1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,519
start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:10,369
welcome to handmade here are the show

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:12,268
recode a complete game live on stream we

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:15,029
we're doing a bunch of font stuff

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,589
yesterday and we pretty much did all the

6
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,350
stuff that I wanted to do yesterday but

7
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:21,149
we just as we just as we finished I was

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,260
like okay now there's this whole bunch

9
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,250
of the stuff I want to talk about but

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,320
let's wait till tomorrow because they

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,219
don't want to start it since it's the

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,289
stuff that we're gonna be doing tomorrow

13
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:29,759
so I want to talk about it so we got

14
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,050
stuff to talk about today that's fonts

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,000
and it has to do with what we did

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,840
yesterday so if you haven't watched

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,109
yesterday's dream you are at a huge huge

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,690
disadvantage just huge unrecoverable

19
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:43,799
it's just I'm sorry you know you're

20
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:47,968
going to watch the stream and it just

21
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:49,229
can be like I just don't get it but then

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,969
you're going to go back and watch

23
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,769
yesterday's dream and to come back to

24
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,079
the stream you can be like oh right

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,399
alright cool bro and that's gonna be

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,270
fine right and if you did say bro then

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,799
you probably also going to ask me like

28
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,280
if I lift and stuff I do not

29
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,929
unfortunately I'm sorry uh you know I I

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,909
don't lift I don't really have any

31
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,770
broker dentals I like going to see

32
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,270
Broadway musicals that I think

33
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:16,170
automatically disqualifies you as well

34
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:19,489
but you know to each his own anyway that

35
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,900
said let's get started today is day 1 69

36
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:23,759
so if you would like to follow along at

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,350
home and you pre-ordered the source or

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,390
you pre-order the game on here to org so

39
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,938
you want to use the source code zip

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,280
that's up there you want day 168 source

41
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:35,758
code so unzip that into a directory and

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,759
you will be right where I am so let's go

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,359
ahead and you know take a look take a

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,950
little look if you will a little peek at

45
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,859
what I was talking about when I said we

46
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,799
did the work yesterday so let me go

47
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:53,129
ahead and do a build here and get our

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,399
compilation directory set so if you take

49
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:59,399
a look at where we were you can see that

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,659
we've got some fonts up here and

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,549
actually you know what I think now might

52
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,290
be a good time to return the music off I

53
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,980
don't think we need any any music for

54
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,390
now

55
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,129
either we can we can probably just stop

56
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:16,049
that from happening and no one will

57
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:19,769
really mind I'm suspecting ok so if you

58
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,170
take a look at where we're at with font

59
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,050
situation you can kind of see that I

60
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:26,399
started adding some debug dump stuff up

61
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,900
here which is kind of the goal what we

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,569
were trying to do with foxes get debug

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,280
stuff happening and what I said was the

64
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,129
whole point of yesterday was to get some

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,430
debug fats some debug readout stuff

66
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:40,829
happening so that we could see what we

67
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,780
needed in terms of font information in

68
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,550
order to make fonts render properly and

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,400
what I hope that you can already sort of

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,500
see from what we've got here is there's

71
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,300
a number of things that we would like to

72
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,310
fix if we were just looking at this and

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,890
going we want to start getting this to

74
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,120
be a good font system what is the sort

75
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,309
of stuff that we would need to do to it

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,230
right and you can see a couple things

77
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:08,849
first of all all of our letters are the

78
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:10,859
same size right if you look in here

79
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,560
we're drawing everything at the same

80
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,300
scale and that's because the way our

81
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,500
renderer system works right now you

82
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
basically just tell it how high you want

83
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,550
something and it automatically scales it

84
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,709
to that size so obviously if we wanted

85
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,510
this to work properly and look like a

86
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,459
real font the first thing that we'd have

87
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:29,250
to go in and do is we'd have to make it

88
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,229
so that the the actual fonts themselves

89
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,930
are scaled proportional to how high they

90
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:35,988
actually were you know in terms of

91
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,159
pixels in the original source art right

92
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,849
now that's something we can probably do

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,039
without any more information because we

94
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,439
know what the pixel sizes of bitmaps and

95
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,449
stuff like that are so we wouldn't

96
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,939
necessarily need to know any additional

97
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,079
information we could probably just get

98
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:56,609
that out of the asset information

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,230
already right and so you know we could

100
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,270
do that we could totally do that so

101
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:02,340
let's take a look at how that might work

102
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,439
right that'd be the first thing that I

103
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,259
think we should start on the road to

104
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:10,289
better looking fonts right so we've got

105
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,629
our debug test line thing here write

106
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,759
text line and here it is drawing some

107
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,469
font stuff we added stuff during the Q&amp;A

108
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,089
as someone was asking about embedding

109
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,570
escape codes that did stuff like change

110
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,189
the color

111
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,399
us or change the size and you can see

112
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:27,990
that in here right so we did that you

113
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:31,019
know I don't know it's not really my jam

114
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,160
but if that's something that you like to

115
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,069
do we'll leave it in there for anyone

116
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,630
who wants to play with it it's all fine

117
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,969
so if we come in here and we take a look

118
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,180
at the output routine you can see the

119
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,550
problem right here is is car scale right

120
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,560
we're passing that and the way that

121
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,810
we've defined our renderer to work is

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,519
that you say how tall you want something

123
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,620
and that's how tall it makes it right

124
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,000
and that's pretty good for what we want

125
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,170
to do in our game because typically we

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,310
want to say oh I want to draw a tree I

127
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,170
want it to be this high and then it just

128
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,170
makes the tree that high and that's what

129
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,670
we want but with something like the

130
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,960
fonts they're kind of a little bit of a

131
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,730
special case where we want them

132
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,620
potentially to be proportional to the

133
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,960
size that they were because it's like

134
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,030
it's it's not really about the game ever

135
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,459
adjusting those sizes individually they

136
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:16,789
all need to be kind of consistent so if

137
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:20,129
we take a look at how push bitmap works

138
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,950
you can see in here that it does the

139
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:25,139
width / height thing so it's doing that

140
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,269
sort of alignment in the line percentage

141
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,729
all that stuff right and you can see

142
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:32,009
that that's you know that's what's

143
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,629
creating this problem for us so what we

144
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,579
would rather do is we'd rather have a

145
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:39,839
way that we can deal with that

146
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:42,000
information in a more you know in a more

147
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:45,659
specific pixely fashion when we need to

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,310
now if we look there's a question of can

149
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,810
we get that information before we load

150
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,610
it because remember one of the things

151
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,829
about push bitmap is it's not

152
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,389
necessarily going to always have the

153
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,430
bitmap that it's actually going to want

154
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,189
right like like right here for example

155
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,870
when we get the bitmap you can see that

156
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,579
sometimes the bitmap doesn't exist right

157
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,230
that's why our font like pages in as the

158
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,599
as the background asset loading occur is

159
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,890
right and stuff like this so the thing

160
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,150
to remember there is it you know the

161
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,699
bitmap might not actually be there so we

162
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:12,689
have a question of is the information we

163
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,849
actually need which is the original

164
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,879
pixel height of this thing is that even

165
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,100
available to us right or do we have to

166
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,569
wait till the actual thing is loaded so

167
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,730
that's one the first question asked and

168
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:27,870
I guess what I would say about that is

169
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:29,920
the asset itself right in our asset file

170
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:35,620
I guess that would be in hand

171
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:37,509
the file formats in the file format we

172
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,040
can actually look at what's stored in

173
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:42,310
the asset information you can see the

174
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,490
HHA pit map here inside that there is a

175
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,259
dim to right and that's part of the

176
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,900
table that's loaded at the beginning of

177
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,849
the game so even though the bitmap isn't

178
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:54,789
loaded we can get the actual dimensions

179
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,800
out of it so what we would like to do is

180
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,200
we would like to be able to get that

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,300
information out so that you know right

182
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,519
here we'd be able to do that information

183
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,460
so what we need is we need the bitmap

184
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,219
info and I believe we actually have a

185
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:10,870
way of doing that somewhere I don't even

186
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,460
remember but I feel like that sort of

187
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,079
thing actually existed I thought there

188
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:16,839
was a good fit mapinfo kind of thing

189
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,310
maybe that went by the wayside I don't

190
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,319
even remember we've written so much code

191
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,620
at this point and at only an hour of a

192
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,439
night sometimes I forget where we are

193
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,899
okay it looks like we did get sound info

194
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,759
but just not get bitmap info right so if

195
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:32,409
we just added to get bitmap info for

196
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,259
that's the exact same thing and we just

197
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,970
did HHA bitmap instead that would allow

198
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,589
people to get that information back at

199
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,510
no cost right it's just a really simple

200
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:42,069
array look up nothing expensive doesn't

201
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,259
actually have to load anything can just

202
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:46,540
go ahead and do its thing don't ask me

203
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,490
why these guys did not have returned

204
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,510
where it normally does it just doesn't I

205
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:55,389
guess have that anyway so if I came in

206
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:58,269
here and said I would like to see the

207
00:07:55,389 --> 00:08:00,909
info for this bitmap please I'm going to

208
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:03,310
pass the assets so it knows how to look

209
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,560
it up obviously and then we've got oops

210
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,009
that's probably a bitmap ID obviously

211
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,759
there we go I'm going to pass the ID of

212
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:14,079
the pit map and so that I now will know

213
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,449
how big that thing will be because the

214
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,490
info has the dimension it so I can then

215
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:21,129
say okay I want you to do the character

216
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,720
scale right but now what I'm going to do

217
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,750
instead is say that the character stale

218
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,610
instead of being this font scale thing

219
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,110
right where we're scaling the flat by a

220
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,460
certain amount there I'm just going to

221
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,259
say it's going to be whatever the native

222
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:33,699
scale the font actually was just for

223
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,559
just for the rich for a moment right

224
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,620
well I guess you know what I could do it

225
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:39,819
this way just set that to one right so

226
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,500
now I'm just going to say however big

227
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,849
the font naturally was that's the scale

228
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,299
we're going to have and so what we'll do

229
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,700
is we'll

230
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,219
multiply that value times whatever the

231
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,070
height of the font naturally should have

232
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:54,009
been right so we go in here and we say

233
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,200
okay we've got that that dim now but

234
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:58,720
we're going to take the the why of that

235
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,070
dim and that will give us a way of

236
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,629
recovering the information potentially

237
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,278
so let's just see what that does course

238
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:04,838
our font and I will probably be huge I

239
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,049
don't remember what we rendered it out

240
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,930
yet gigantic right it's part of the

241
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:13,659
problem but you know what if what out

242
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:15,489
what are gonna do right well one thing

243
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,078
that we can do here right is now since

244
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,120
we have that big memb information i can

245
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,578
actually advance by the size of the

246
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,019
actual character as well so that might

247
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:26,620
help us a little bit it's not going to

248
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:28,299
be enough probably but it'll be

249
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,129
something so we can actually do

250
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:31,449
something where we do like that sort of

251
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,220
thing for now it's not what we're going

252
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,970
to want to do at the end of the day but

253
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,250
it would work right so oh and of course

254
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,769
I guess I have to do a little dim thing

255
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,600
here so it would have to do a Kerrigan

256
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,730
and I don't know what the default care

257
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,930
dim would be that's kind of again

258
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,220
another thing where we need to start

259
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:49,509
this is where we you start getting those

260
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,190
texts metrics but so I'm just going to

261
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,360
hack it in for a second and then we're

262
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,320
going to come through here and start

263
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,079
talking about what all these things

264
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:00,579
actually need to be so there's a the

265
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:03,639
carriage am right and you could record

266
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:07,419
it so then as we move forwards we can

267
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:11,559
actually make sure that that it gets its

268
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:13,539
added properly okay so there we go

269
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:15,189
getting a little bit better there but

270
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:17,769
still not probably what we want but

271
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,290
anyway so there's our font and as you

272
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,299
can see the font is really really huge

273
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:29,559
and so one thing that we probably want

274
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:31,778
to do here i'm just guessing at the

275
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:35,349
outset we would probably like to just

276
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:37,539
say we since this is a debug font we

277
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,490
don't want it to be quite so gigantic

278
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,439
although i guess we could also just for

279
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,360
now we could just live with that and set

280
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,740
like the line height or something up to

281
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
be big again these are just temporary

282
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,028
solutions just to sort of take things

283
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,320
one step at a time and so if we wanted

284
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:53,169
to do that you know when our at y

285
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,089
advances right we're doing this this one

286
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:56,588
point 2f x font scale thing that's not

287
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,000
nearly enough you know we would need

288
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,440
something

289
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,809
where we were closer to whatever the

290
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,280
actual size of the font was going to be

291
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:04,919
which I don't have any idea what that

292
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,539
actually is about point you get the idea

293
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:10,740
right point being we'd have to do

294
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:12,929
something ridiculous like this yeah wow

295
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,850
these are these are gigantic characters

296
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,829
I think I may have been overzealous

297
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,509
there when I did the asset Packer with

298
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,910
just how big these things are right okay

299
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,919
but you can start to see we're getting a

300
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:28,379
little closer right so now if we take a

301
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,689
look at the font you can see that now

302
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:34,169
characters are at least the right size

303
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,840
relative to each other right the capital

304
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,879
letters are taller than the lower case

305
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,870
letters which is what we would like to

306
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:46,019
do right now we also have a separate

307
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:48,419
problem here which is that the alignment

308
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,250
for this character for the characters is

309
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:52,199
in their Center because that's the

310
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,850
default thing that we do with our assets

311
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,950
right if you don't set the alignment and

312
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,710
so you can also see something else going

313
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:03,060
on here which is that all of the line

314
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:05,940
itself right is kind of arranged so that

315
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,129
everything is like centered you know

316
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,750
along a center line which is not at all

317
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,370
how you would line up fonts right so

318
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,570
that's another thing just beware but you

319
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,070
can kind of see it hopefully everyone

320
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,660
can notice what I'm talking about there

321
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,400
you can see how everything lines up up

322
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,289
along the center line based on however

323
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,429
tall the character is bitmap why's it

324
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:25,529
does that alignment along the center so

325
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,620
that's something now one thing that I'm

326
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:30,029
not sure about and I'm just looking at

327
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,139
it because that that makes very sense

328
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,870
that's what I would expect to see that

329
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,779
and that is what we see what I don't

330
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,560
super understand is why some of these

331
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:43,889
characters are as long as they are I

332
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:49,439
guess that's because we're adding in the

333
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:51,689
wrong way if i may just to elaborate on

334
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,060
this a little bit so what happens is we

335
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,160
draw a character and right now we're

336
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,709
centering the character you know the

337
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,959
characters drawn around its own Center

338
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,730
so what that means is we move a certain

339
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,839
distance let me draw this in the way but

340
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,810
I want to make sure people understand

341
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,190
what's going on here because it was an

342
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,049
interesting artifact and it took me a

343
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,560
second to think of what exactly was

344
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,699
happening so

345
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:16,109
want to make sure everyone kind of zon

346
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,570
the same page okay so we draw we have a

347
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,490
position and right now we're drawing

348
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,790
around the center of the font so if you

349
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,889
were to draw a large thing in here right

350
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:27,539
you would get that and then what will

351
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,699
happen is you would advance by the size

352
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,699
of it that's what I programmed it in to

353
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,350
do right so you take this amount and you

354
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,720
would go that far forward so you imagine

355
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,490
taking the width obviously you slide it

356
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,370
to where sort of the center line is

357
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,009
right you'd go that far forward and now

358
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,509
the next character you draw here well

359
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:48,120
the next character might be relatively

360
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:50,549
thin right let's say it's like a simple

361
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,659
little T that's very short right so it

362
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:57,859
looks like this right well now it's got

363
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:00,719
like a much smaller with right now

364
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,180
advances that much and the next guy here

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,300
is going to be much closer to this guy

366
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:08,429
than this dude is so so it's really not

367
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,588
the right amount to advance by at all

368
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,179
right because it's based on the width of

369
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,180
this character but half of that was

370
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:17,129
behind him right and so you're you're

371
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:19,079
looking at the total wrong amount of

372
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,789
advancement right so just I just want to

373
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,589
make sure you know we haven't done

374
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:24,000
anything for advancement yet that should

375
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:25,080
be correct so it's not surprising that

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,240
its rump I just want to make sure every

377
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:37,800
wonder stands how and why it's actually

378
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:39,330
wrong at the moment right okay so now

379
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,389
that we're drawing the font at its

380
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,550
natural size again it'd be pretty easy

381
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:46,230
when we go back there will probably want

382
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:48,120
to go ahead and make the font a lot

383
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,370
smaller for our actual whatever actual

384
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,049
debug font that we pick that we want to

385
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,100
use we want that Davos to be much

386
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:55,939
smaller than this because it's going to

387
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,440
be way too large for our purposes but

388
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:02,310
now that we see it you're looking at

389
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,660
there what I would say is we're at the

390
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,519
point where I think everything is

391
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,319
rendering properly so we want to start

392
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,750
talking about the text metrics like I

393
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,459
saying what will we actually need to get

394
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,379
this to look like a correct line of text

395
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:15,659
instead of all jumbled up like with the

396
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,730
wrong spacing like I said with the weird

397
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:19,559
like being centered about them on the

398
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,000
vertical and it's not to say that you

399
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,679
don't sometimes want to send her text on

400
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,879
the vertical you know sometimes that's

401
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,219
an effect you're actually going for it

402
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,470
but

403
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,700
most of the time right certainly when

404
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,830
you're drawing text on the screen you

405
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,180
want it centered in you want it like

406
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,180
vertically aligned in a different way

407
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:36,639
okay so let's talk about the stuff that

408
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:38,889
we're going to need and then let's go

409
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,189
see if we can put that into the font

410
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,230
file and actually use it right so let's

411
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,000
take a look at this so what are the

412
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,379
first things that we need to do the

413
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,200
first thing that I would say we need to

414
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:52,899
do is to start aligning the text

415
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:56,080
properly right we need to start getting

416
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,250
it vertically aligned properly and like

417
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,379
I was saying at the beginning when I

418
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,649
talked about fonts thoughts have a

419
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:04,779
natural concept called a baseline and

420
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,470
what a baseline is it's that's kind of

421
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:10,299
the line of twere the text is aligned to

422
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,399
it's the thing that sort of is the

423
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:14,319
constant horizontal line that runs

424
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,139
through a piece of text and the way that

425
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,360
it works is different letters have

426
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:23,710
different relationships to the line that

427
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,720
we all understand right and so if you

428
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,269
were to take a look at some example

429
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,759
letters like I've written here you can

430
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:34,149
see that we've got the baseline which is

431
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,340
right here the baseline is a very

432
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:39,100
constant meaningful vertical line to the

433
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,560
text where lowercase letters without

434
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,659
descenders as these are called sit on

435
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:48,039
the line they typically like just touch

436
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:50,019
it right like this sort of thing capital

437
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:51,879
letters almost never go below that

438
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,340
baseline unless it's a fancy font but

439
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,590
they usually rest on it right and then

440
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,590
lower case letters with descenders those

441
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,870
descenders typically come below the line

442
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,660
like I'm Jays and G's and wise and stuff

443
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,400
like that right so what we would like to

444
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,980
start doing is we'd like to start having

445
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,470
the notion of a baseline where we want

446
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,150
our text to appear and we would like to

447
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,880
be able to say that for any given

448
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,610
character we want to be able to place

449
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,980
that character such that it lines up

450
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:23,529
with the baseline so my argument would

451
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,039
be that we want the alignment of the

452
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:29,920
font itself right of the bitmaps to be

453
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,970
placed such that the alignment point in

454
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:37,808
Y is wherever the baseline would pass

455
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:45,159
through that font glyph in a normal

456
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:47,200
alignment situation seemed reasonable so

457
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:52,419
that's what I would like to start out by

458
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:56,230
doing so let's see how we might go about

459
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:58,149
getting that information right now we

460
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,730
know and which is the nice thing about

461
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:02,439
our asset system already we know that

462
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,058
our asset already stores an alignment

463
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,460
point right it has an alignment

464
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:07,928
percentage that's based on the size of

465
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,808
the pit map right so we already have the

466
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:13,450
ability you remember like remember this

467
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:16,538
a line percentage we already have the

468
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,269
ability to specify sort of where in the

469
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:21,339
bitmap we actually want that alignment

470
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:23,710
point to be and so we don't really need

471
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:25,480
to do any more work to support this

472
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,919
through the pipeline our bitmaps will

473
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,308
just render with that pivot point

474
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:32,350
properly no problem we just have to

475
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:34,148
actually set it to something reasonable

476
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:35,378
in our asset processor where's right now

477
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:38,138
we're just setting it to the middle and

478
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:40,829
that doesn't really help anybody so

479
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:44,829
let's take a look at that here we are

480
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:46,778
and when we set the bitmap stuff up here

481
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:52,118
I don't really remember exactly how this

482
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:56,230
goes let's take a look here load LIF pic

483
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:59,109
map there we are so there's our bitmap

484
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:04,058
dim here and I guess the problem right

485
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:07,418
is that we don't actually have in here

486
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:10,388
the align percentage set to anything at

487
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:14,049
all right we we're just letting it be

488
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:19,868
set to the standard the standard point

489
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:22,868
five point five right so what we'd like

490
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:25,028
to do is we'd like to be able to set

491
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:31,359
that a line percentage to something more

492
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:36,669
useful now loaded bitmap itself has what

493
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:38,408
in it exactly loaded bitmap nothing

494
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:40,509
really so the thing that we're getting

495
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:43,419
back from this I feel like what we want

496
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:45,639
to do here is actually pass that desk in

497
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,200
so that the load glyph bitmap thing

498
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:49,388
could actually write into the align

499
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,840
percentage if it 1 &amp; 2 seems like the

500
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:57,038
easiest thing to do to me so what I'd

501
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:59,740
like to do is go to load lifted map and

502
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,859
this right here should take one of these

503
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,429
guys which is a HH a load our bitmap

504
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:14,079
right that right I think that's what

505
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:17,740
that is dest hhhhhh a asset is what that

506
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:21,128
is sorry so yes if I go to test asset

507
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:26,679
builder and go to load cliff bitmap this

508
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:28,269
is going to be an HHH asset asset so and

509
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,129
then when we come in here we should be

510
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,399
able to set those alignment percentages

511
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:37,808
to something meaningful so how would we

512
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:39,819
do that right well I guess the easiest

513
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:41,918
thing probably for us to do is to just

514
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:43,689
recognize that when we were extracting

515
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,669
the fonts from windows like when we're

516
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,899
starting the fonts from Sean we may have

517
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:48,340
to do this slightly differently so we'd

518
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:49,628
have to do we'd have to maintain both

519
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:52,089
paths unfortunately that's just how

520
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:54,759
that's going to go but if we take a look

521
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:57,339
at how this works in here the font

522
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:59,740
itself windows will already I believe

523
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,678
have aligned it properly so that they'll

524
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,500
all be aligned roughly the same and so I

525
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,798
think if we get the text metrics here we

526
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,829
should know what pixel is actually

527
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,408
corresponding to the baseline and then

528
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:16,028
when we go extract things out we just

529
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:18,100
look at where that pixel is relative to

530
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:20,108
the rectangle that we're extracting we

531
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:22,658
should be able to remember that

532
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:25,960
information so if we take the text

533
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:29,049
metric here I'm going to go ahead and go

534
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,028
to look that up on msdn so we can see

535
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:32,329
what's in it I'm hoping that it tells us

536
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:35,599
what the baseline

537
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:37,099
is but I do not remember if it does it

538
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,629
does look like it does you can see that

539
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:40,579
we've got a lot of information here such

540
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,470
as height ascent and descent which

541
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:43,908
should be enough for us to get the

542
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,669
information that we need so you can see

543
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:49,220
here the height is the total size of the

544
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:51,259
characters together the ascent is the

545
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,659
units above the baseline and the descent

546
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,009
is the units below the baseline which

547
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,159
means that we're essentially getting

548
00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:07,849
back information that looks like this

549
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:12,980
oops here is that height here is the

550
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:14,689
essent here is the descent right so all

551
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,849
we need to know to figure out where the

552
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,308
baseline is is we can either start from

553
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:21,798
the top and go down by the ascent and we

554
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:23,599
would be at the baseline or we can start

555
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:26,210
from the bottom and go up the descent

556
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,250
amount oops up the descent amount and

557
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:32,028
we'd get the baseline so it actually is

558
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,648
over specified I believe because as we

559
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:35,119
know height is a cent plus descent so

560
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:36,648
that basically means that if we just

561
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,949
follow either one of them we could get

562
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:41,178
to the baseline right I guess what I'm

563
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,250
saying is you really only need TM height

564
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:44,778
and TM baseline was all you'd really

565
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,429
need and the rest of this you could

566
00:22:44,778 --> 00:22:50,388
figure out but that's not how they chose

567
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:52,880
to do it so whatever so anyway TM ascent

568
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:54,168
or tmd scent is probably what we want to

569
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,269
start looking at but let's figure out

570
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:58,038
how that's actually going to work so

571
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:00,380
we've got our text metric here we

572
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:10,548
probably want to leave that out as a

573
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:12,500
little guy like so you know what I just

574
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:15,408
realized we're going to have to do some

575
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,109
more work here these statics are really

576
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:22,028
not going to work if we start extracting

577
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:22,028
multiple fonts right

578
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:30,588
so what we need to do here is we need to

579
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:34,999
have something where pass you know the

580
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:38,628
font has to be part of the spec when we

581
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:40,489
call load with bitmap so that way we

582
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:42,228
could bundle those up not terribly hard

583
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:44,139
to do but anyway you get the idea so

584
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:46,219
that is definitely something that we can

585
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,508
address a little bit later on when we

586
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:48,859
start to do multiple fonts but it's

587
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,019
worth remembering so that we don't go

588
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:54,348
why isn't it working in well that's why

589
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:57,288
it's not so anyway if we have this text

590
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:58,968
metric we then know that we can access

591
00:23:57,288 --> 00:24:00,888
the ascent of the descent so now when we

592
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:03,709
come down here what we want to figure

593
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:06,618
out is once we have this get text extent

594
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:08,899
point 32w thing that's going to tell us

595
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:10,488
that rectangle of extraction we go

596
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:12,738
through and we look at what part of it

597
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:15,739
is filled right and we end up with

598
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:17,269
essentially a bounding box right we

599
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:18,828
don't need to do apron because we

600
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:21,409
actually are doing the apron now right

601
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:22,818
there's the apron right there and so

602
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:26,659
what we need to know now is in this

603
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:29,959
bitmap right which is this high we just

604
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:35,119
need to know where exactly the that

605
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:38,179
alignment point is now it's actually

606
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:41,538
pretty tricky right because we looked at

607
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:44,028
it here and this this search through the

608
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:45,858
whole bitmap in the space of the min x

609
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:48,318
and the min Y and all that stuff right

610
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:51,168
we know what the baseline would be right

611
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:53,808
we know that the baseline is just going

612
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:59,239
to be you know because since this bitmap

613
00:24:53,808 --> 00:25:04,690
I think we decided was what did we

614
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:08,629
decide what did we decide this bitmap

615
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:12,379
this bitmap is actually bottom up right

616
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:14,178
it's a bottom-up bitmap and so we could

617
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:16,908
have actually written this guy in a

618
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:19,639
forward copy unlike the Seans when

619
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:22,249
sean's were top-down bitmaps right so

620
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:24,408
what that means is in a bottom-up what

621
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:27,769
we know is that a bottom-up bitmap that

622
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:31,039
first row of pixels right the like y

623
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:33,649
equals 0 is actually going to be the

624
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,898
bottom most line and so to get up to the

625
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:37,069
baseline from the bottomless line that

626
00:25:35,898 --> 00:25:39,379
would be the

627
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:41,778
the descent number would tell us how

628
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,929
many how many to go up from that bottom

629
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:47,509
right so when we get down here and it's

630
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:52,309
time to actually fill in I guess this

631
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:56,028
guy at the end here HHA asset when we

632
00:25:52,308 --> 00:26:02,678
get down to the end and it becomes time

633
00:25:56,028 --> 00:26:08,058
to fill in that asset oops like so

634
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:11,809
bitmap align percentage 05 percentage

635
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:14,089
one so I'm going to also just for the

636
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:16,490
for ease of use here i'm going to set

637
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:18,709
our align percentage x 20 so that the

638
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,759
align percentage so the alignment is the

639
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,899
left edge of the character at the moment

640
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,339
although there is something we could do

641
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:26,989
slightly differently there because

642
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:28,819
that's actually the apron that's

643
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,798
actually the line of the apron what I'm

644
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:32,269
actually do is set it one pixel in so

645
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,849
that it starts at the actual first

646
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:36,470
filled pixel which seems a little bit

647
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:39,378
better and of course so to do that I

648
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:43,339
want to go one pixel in and in order to

649
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:45,048
go one pixel in i need to divide by i

650
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:47,000
need to its normal eyes right switch

651
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:50,298
1021 it's our storing this percentage i

652
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,750
want to go one pixel in out of the

653
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:55,190
number of pixels that there are right

654
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,929
however however big the actual thing is

655
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,320
now i have to think about that for a

656
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,320
second

657
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,380
but that's okay I was trying to figure

658
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:11,080
out I just wanted to thank briefly about

659
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:13,690
whether it's actually that right if I

660
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,609
wanted to align with the last guy like

661
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,409
ha what is the actual alignment range

662
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:19,449
run to and I think what we want is to

663
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:21,220
say that one you know one would be the

664
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,200
end of it exactly so I think it's one

665
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,548
over the result with but sometimes those

666
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,250
off by one things there come tricky to

667
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:29,470
think about so anyway I want one pixel

668
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,990
in as the left alignment and now for the

669
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,000
Y alignment what I'd like to do is since

670
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,038
our bitmaps are from the bottom up right

671
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,609
what I want to do is say that however

672
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:45,339
high this guy ends up being I need to

673
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:47,379
you know it would be something what is

674
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:52,168
that called like Tex metrics or whatever

675
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:56,230
text metric whatever that descent is

676
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:58,538
right I could say like oh it's however

677
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,788
big the scent is over the height right

678
00:27:58,538 --> 00:28:04,028
and that would you know tell me how far

679
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:06,339
up it is right but that's not quite

680
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:08,619
correct right that's not really going to

681
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:11,038
be right and the reason for that is

682
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:16,359
because we're doing an extraction here

683
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:21,369
so windows right made a bitmap and you

684
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:27,158
know maybe let's say here is here is TM

685
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:30,538
s descent rather right is is this that

686
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:33,580
value right it's how tall that is right

687
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:36,490
but the but the letter was like

688
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:38,980
lowercase a so what that means is that

689
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,769
the bitmap that we actually save out is

690
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,528
only that big and it starts right at the

691
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:46,778
base line so the value that we actually

692
00:28:44,528 --> 00:28:48,788
would want to have for alignment is like

693
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:50,079
Mutt you know the aprons one pixel but

694
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:54,308
it would just be it would be like one

695
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,449
point 0 over the height right but that's

696
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:57,069
not where we're going to get we're going

697
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,110
to get whatever the ascent is like five

698
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:01,240
pixels or 15 pixels or high don't know

699
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:03,579
how many it is right we're getting at 15

700
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,778
over the height and that's not right at

701
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:06,730
all that's going to put it like up here

702
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:10,599
or something right or way up here and

703
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:14,110
that's no good so what we need to

704
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:16,929
recognize is that actually TM ascent is

705
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:18,759
in the space of the whole bitmap

706
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,190
that we did there the whole extraction

707
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:24,430
region not the part that we actually

708
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,769
found that had content in it so I think

709
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:31,330
the first thing that we want to do right

710
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:34,029
is we want to say okay what was min X

711
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:36,699
right like how far up did we have to go

712
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:41,049
before we actually hit something and we

713
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:44,850
want to subtract that away from that

714
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:47,740
dissent right we want to say like okay

715
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:50,679
we are starting at min x that's like our

716
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:53,589
origin effectively right so I want to go

717
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,769
one pixel in for the apron and then I

718
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:58,990
want to go however many pixels more the

719
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:01,210
descent would be over whatever them in X

720
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,670
is right because here's that min x line

721
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,860
is right where this is and so I only

722
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:09,009
want however much of the descent went

723
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:11,379
above that right I want to like rebase

724
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:14,109
it to here and I think that's a more

725
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:18,580
correct statement about where that

726
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:24,849
baseline should be ok so I'm going to

727
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:27,460
start off by running that so we really

728
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:30,240
rebuild our text assets and then I'm

729
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,740
going to see what we get at this point

730
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,720
okay so we're getting a little bit

731
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,569
better but we're not quite out of the

732
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,910
woods yet right i would say we're still

733
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:42,220
we're still quite a bit janky or there

734
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,050
than i would like and you can see i

735
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,579
don't really know exactly what is

736
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:49,210
happening there but you can kind of see

737
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:52,210
we're off by something for example like

738
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,529
our p is totally wrong and so some

739
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,630
things looking right like roughly

740
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:58,899
correct like the ck looks likely correct

741
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,580
there on the bottom the UI is almost

742
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,590
correct but it's a little bit off like

743
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:04,629
why is the you a little bit lower than

744
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:07,359
it should be and then some letters like

745
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,970
p are just totally wrong right there

746
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,439
just like totally wrong so I'm not quite

747
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,000
at the point yet where I'm interpreting

748
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,009
that data correctly but we're getting

749
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,289
closer like it looks a lot better than

750
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:23,670
it did it's just not there yet okay so

751
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:23,670
let's take a look

752
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:38,250
what can we do to try and improve upon

753
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:41,788
this so oh well for starters that's

754
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:47,278
supposed to be min Y so that's just a

755
00:31:41,788 --> 00:31:51,419
typo uh hum run that again and see if

756
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:57,028
that's just a little bit better ok

757
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:58,649
anyway ok so we're that this is a little

758
00:31:57,028 --> 00:32:01,200
bit more consistent that's a little bit

759
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:03,359
the MINIX middx was not a good idea

760
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,278
let's just be honest the ex was not

761
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,678
involved in that so I was happening so

762
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,480
what you can kind of see happening here

763
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,070
is I think we've got a little bit of a

764
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,370
top-down bottom-up kind of a situation

765
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:17,038
going whereas you can sort of see we're

766
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:19,500
aligning more to the top of things

767
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,048
rather than to the bottom of things

768
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,240
which is not what we would have actually

769
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:26,788
wanted we're getting much closer but

770
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,220
it's not right that's just not right so

771
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:31,440
we're kind of our extraction is a little

772
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,600
bit it's a little bit incorrect there

773
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,960
and we still have weird stuff with the P

774
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,609
as well so I think we're just not really

775
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,500
look understanding these values properly

776
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:41,879
that we're getting back and we probably

777
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,700
have to think a little bit harder about

778
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,940
exactly what is going on there and and

779
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,250
the flip and all that stuff doesn't help

780
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:53,370
another thing we could do here too is we

781
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:55,230
could think about not actually doing the

782
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:58,709
flip any more like like we're flipping

783
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:01,349
both things right which is not necessary

784
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:03,450
at all you know so like one way we could

785
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:05,849
make this I think quite a bit easier on

786
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:08,929
ourselves right is we could just say

787
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:11,788
like oh when we're doing all this stuff

788
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:14,460
why don't we just go the right side

789
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:17,220
round right why don't we just do it this

790
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,340
way right where we're actually stepping

791
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,990
through properly and then we don't need

792
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:23,990
any of this stuff right

793
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:39,879
oops right so this just pre steps by one

794
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:46,150
row and this you know this free steps by

795
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:48,340
max with right I feel like that might be

796
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,410
a little bit of senior a thing to do now

797
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:51,730
now everything isn't upside down all the

798
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,430
time and it might be a little bit easier

799
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:56,349
for us to think about so let's just be

800
00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:01,420
bug that real quick just so we don't

801
00:33:56,349 --> 00:34:09,730
have that kind of craziness oh oh my or

802
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:11,889
not uh let's see there destro is stepped

803
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,679
down one which is correct and then the

804
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,239
source rube it's me and watch as masters

805
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,760
I feel like that should have been a

806
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,519
pretty straightforward change don't you

807
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,200
think what did I mess up there oh I know

808
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,829
what the problem is it's because it's

809
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:30,189
actually max height minus one might have

810
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:32,949
been why mmm okay all right that's not

811
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,539
as straightforward as I thought it would

812
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:38,019
be straightforward to reverse this one

813
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:40,029
and not so straightforward to reverse

814
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:43,179
that one so let me think that through

815
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:45,220
for a second because the death row is

816
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:47,019
really legitimately pretty easy it's

817
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:49,029
just exactly what I said but this one

818
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:57,159
since it has to actually get down to the

819
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:58,780
the max the mac side of the thing right

820
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:02,289
because this is actually stepping

821
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,360
backwards that way as well it's starting

822
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:09,420
at max height and going back from up

823
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,420
from the bottom to find that stuff

824
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,579
alright so I'm going to play with this

825
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:23,150
just for a second bear with me it's just

826
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:25,610
something that I like to do I'm going to

827
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,139
see what happens if i go ahead and scan

828
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,750
from the top down so now we've got the

829
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:31,940
rectangle proper and then i'm going to

830
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,579
stand this guy from the top down as well

831
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:38,059
so hopefully that guy has the rectangle

832
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:44,619
properly and we'll see if that does

833
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:44,619
anything better than than before right

834
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,570
result height minus one minus one again

835
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:53,059
is just flipping the nature of that so

836
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:58,940
we just want that and this guy is just

837
00:35:53,059 --> 00:36:01,460
going to pre step 2 I mean why right all

838
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,740
right all right I just want to see I

839
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:08,360
just want to see if that makes that a

840
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:14,769
little cleaner to look at their man it

841
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:19,670
is just hard to get any luck today oh oh

842
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:22,579
bitmap fiddle eNOS let's c 0 so this is

843
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,380
going through all these guys and we step

844
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:28,219
by the max with every time so that's

845
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:30,410
just looking through their right for for

846
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:37,789
the pixels which is what you would

847
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:41,629
expect this calculates exactly what I

848
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:46,880
would think that it does destro result

849
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:50,090
up memory and we start the source row at

850
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,150
the bits plus the men y which is the

851
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:59,030
earliest thing that we found right so

852
00:36:53,150 --> 00:37:05,300
that should that should be relatively

853
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:10,640
reliable so I'm not sure actually I'm

854
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:13,640
not sure why that was grumpy right

855
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:16,969
because it should be it should be that

856
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:23,210
no matter which way these bits go right

857
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:24,980
it should be that we can just because

858
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,269
we're not scanning the whole bitmap man

859
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,190
you just can't

860
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:29,780
you just can't win with Windows

861
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,539
extraction so do you see what's

862
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,800
happening there yeah we kind of had it

863
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:36,050
we had to deal with this yesterday and I

864
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,870
guess there's no easy way to do that

865
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,970
scan the way that I wanted it to work I

866
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:43,670
wanted it to be able to be simplified

867
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:45,079
slightly and we could flip we could flip

868
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,030
it around but that's really not going to

869
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,340
help as much as I thought it's because

870
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:52,220
when we when we're up here we pre

871
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:54,350
restrict our region and that pre

872
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:59,599
restriction only works if we're going

873
00:37:54,349 --> 00:38:02,509
bottom-up right there's no offset in

874
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,449
here we could build an offset into it

875
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,400
but then we have even more complexity so

876
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:10,039
yeah so now we're still in like Jack

877
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,960
tastic mode which is annoying but what

878
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:16,579
are you gonna do that's just life it's

879
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:21,470
fine we'll live with it not my favorite

880
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:23,420
thing though we'll live with it so all

881
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:25,219
right so our next question is what's

882
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,170
actually going on here why are we seeing

883
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,359
the sort of weird alignment behavior I

884
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,860
also i want to make sure but i'm pretty

885
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,269
sure that our render group doesn't do

886
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,640
anything weird like flip things around

887
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:36,289
it doesn't it treats the alignment the

888
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,699
same in both cases and that's what we

889
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:42,259
would have expected so that's totally

890
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:48,349
fine right so our alignment percentages

891
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:50,660
here for some reason we seem to be

892
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:53,750
getting a very odd sort of situation

893
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:56,000
happening with our descent here and so

894
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,500
I'm just going to see least what I

895
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,449
believe to be happening is what I drew

896
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,190
up here so what I believe to be

897
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:04,129
happening right is we're extracting

898
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:12,230
something out of the bottom of the

899
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:14,809
bitmap like so right and so what I

900
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:22,400
believe to be happening is here is our

901
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:24,259
min Y here is our max why right in what

902
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,059
I believe to be happening is the descent

903
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,060
value i believe is this

904
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,840
that is why what I what I tried to do is

905
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,840
subtract them to find out how far there

906
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,380
was to go there and that would then be

907
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:45,110
the alignment point for that particular

908
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:48,320
font live right but that looks obviously

909
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:50,539
not true and so what I'm wondering is

910
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,880
this is that a incorrect interpretation

911
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:56,170
either of the descent or of the actual

912
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,640
geometry of the extraction is my

913
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,619
conceptualization right of the geometry

914
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,210
of the extraction actually wrong and

915
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:03,409
that's one of the reasons I wanted to

916
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:04,309
take some of the complexity out of it

917
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,589
because then it would make it a little

918
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:10,039
simpler to debug but you know if you

919
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:12,289
can't then you can't so anyway if we

920
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,210
assume that that's the case I would like

921
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:16,400
some more information about that TM

922
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,670
descent what I might do is step in there

923
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,599
of course I also take a look in here and

924
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,570
just take a look at those or anything

925
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,339
that I'm missing about that it doesn't

926
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:31,820
seem like I should be missing that much

927
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:33,920
about it yeah the amount of leading

928
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,400
space inside the bound set by the TM

929
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,610
height member ascent Dora let's see the

930
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,050
amount of space though as between rows

931
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:48,590
outside the font it contains no marks

932
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:52,610
yeah that all seems reasonable overhang

933
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:54,350
me out of some synthesized fonts for

934
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,570
security felt care blah blah blah blah

935
00:40:54,349 --> 00:41:01,279
blah don't care about any of this stuff

936
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:03,850
really I don't think so I feel like that

937
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:08,240
descent should have been that value

938
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:10,849
since it's not i'm a little unsure of

939
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:14,599
what actually means it could be that

940
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:16,880
it's negative i'm gonna step in here

941
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,339
because I want to just look I just want

942
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,039
to look at the value I want to see what

943
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,530
the value actually is so that I have

944
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:28,309
some kind of an understanding you know

945
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:30,110
of that so let's see here oh and you

946
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:32,809
know there's another thing that I'm not

947
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:38,570
sure about as well which is I don't

948
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:41,480
actually know like when we do get text

949
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:42,860
extent point 32 and in fact you know

950
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,530
what maybe let's just take a look at

951
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,620
that document

952
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,780
I don't actually know how that lines up

953
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:51,960
the font which is something that is kind

954
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:55,769
of important for us now right because we

955
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,260
need to know where things are ok so

956
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:59,909
let's see the Congress traitor takes his

957
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,070
account when dealing with ticks on Santa

958
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:05,929
calculated string width of what is about

959
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,930
the height tell me about the height

960
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:16,050
that's all you got that's it so it

961
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,730
doesn't tell it at all doesn't consider

962
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:21,019
new line or care to turn characters when

963
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,019
it computes the height of a text string

964
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:31,259
ok well I don't know say about that

965
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,190
let's see carissa different computer

966
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,120
dimension of the strings within

967
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:36,539
heightened logic and computer without

968
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,289
you considering a clipping blah blah

969
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:42,329
blah click the extreme it takes an

970
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:43,800
account today I txt file screaming

971
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:47,219
chicken or taste account all that's all

972
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:51,000
with this is all with this horizontal

973
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:52,559
the statement blah blah blah so yeah

974
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,329
like I guess what I'm saying what I'm

975
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,860
trying to verify is when this thing

976
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:59,250
prints things out I don't know if it

977
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,200
respects the baseline or not so I don't

978
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,699
know if there's maybe we could also see

979
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,839
if there's a way to get some metrics

980
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:09,000
about our individual character which

981
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,829
maybe is something we could do instead

982
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,190
of trying to do the lineup in case it

983
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:15,329
doesn't line those up properly so I

984
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,960
don't know so we could take a look at

985
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:20,190
that obviously get character placement

986
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,990
these things maybe one of these things

987
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,090
would tell us something that we care

988
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:25,589
about Carrick string such as a character

989
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:30,440
with scary positioning ordering the

990
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:34,800
string glyph rendering let's see here

991
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:37,349
max extent I don't know that we care

992
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,039
about this this doesn't seem it just

993
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:42,869
doesn't seem that useful extech out

994
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:44,279
again also not that useful I feel like

995
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:47,639
get text metrics should have been what

996
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:50,010
we wanted all right so I'm going to step

997
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:52,019
into it I'm just want to see a little

998
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:55,650
bit more carefully what's going on there

999
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:56,800
just so I can just so I can make sure

1000
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,930
there's nothing redic

1001
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,990
what's going on with it so here we go

1002
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:04,179
into the asset builder and I'm going to

1003
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:07,179
step into the lift app stuff and I just

1004
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:14,489
want to get out what those what those

1005
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:17,829
texts metrics values actually are okay

1006
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:22,029
so there's the asset and the descent

1007
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:23,710
there is the height itself right and so

1008
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,320
these two these things are supposed to

1009
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:33,039
add up and hey they do so that's at

1010
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:36,130
least something I suppose so let's take

1011
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:38,289
a look at an individual character we

1012
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:39,990
don't really need that memory so much

1013
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:42,940
anymore so I'm gonna expand this out

1014
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:46,359
what I'd like to do is see I guess I

1015
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:48,849
don't know exactly where we are in here

1016
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:52,570
when we do kind of the code point so if

1017
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:54,880
I do care code point right what i could

1018
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:57,220
do is step into that the next time it's

1019
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,920
going to extract one instead of letting

1020
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:01,899
it do the extraction I could change the

1021
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,980
code point I could just edit what that

1022
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:09,460
was and so instead of 34 I could set it

1023
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:11,740
equal to the lower case P which is the

1024
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:15,519
value that was a little oops the lower

1025
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:18,669
case P can you are you looking at that

1026
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:21,250
I'm typing one and because visual studio

1027
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:24,820
is so awful all the time it inserts to

1028
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:30,730
and then it makes it an error God you

1029
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:32,380
just want learn code all right anyway so

1030
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,240
I'm going to set the code point to be

1031
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,829
the P so like because I know that

1032
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,349
character was doing some unusual things

1033
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:42,460
so I just want to see what it's going to

1034
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:44,049
do right so if I come in here I know

1035
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,429
that this is the height the descent

1036
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:49,060
stuff so I've got that information I

1037
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:52,329
want to know what the min Y max why and

1038
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:55,570
end result height are right i just want

1039
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:59,230
to see what those turn out to be so it

1040
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:03,610
says that the min Y is 41 it says that

1041
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:07,539
the max y is 1 15 now what strikes me as

1042
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:10,099
odd about that already is that that

1043
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:14,449
doesn't really jive with this at all

1044
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:18,440
in my mind because if the descent is 33

1045
00:46:14,449 --> 00:46:20,778
pixels then I would expect the P to go

1046
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,849
basically to the bottom of this font and

1047
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,978
it doesn't really which makes me think

1048
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:27,229
that we're still other or that I'm still

1049
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:30,348
thinking of this thing upside down or in

1050
00:46:27,228 --> 00:46:31,699
the wrong orientation or whatever you

1051
00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:33,950
know what I'm saying like I'm not

1052
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:37,489
getting something about it I'm not I'm

1053
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:39,679
it's like it's not sinking in right and

1054
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:42,289
so the problem is the min Y and Max why

1055
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,788
are basically are probably I'm think

1056
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:46,369
those are those are probably flipped

1057
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:48,769
right in our heads from where they

1058
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:50,809
actually would be so the descent is the

1059
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:52,459
correct thing that that says how to go

1060
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:54,950
up from the bottom and that is the value

1061
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,900
that we want but really it's not min why

1062
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:59,108
that is that baseline right min why

1063
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,999
doesn't actually correspond to this

1064
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:04,998
position it corresponds to this position

1065
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:08,538
flipped and max why is the other way is

1066
00:47:04,998 --> 00:47:10,788
the other way round right so what we

1067
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:15,469
would actually want to know is where

1068
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:18,229
would max why how would max why and and

1069
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:20,440
the descent interrelate but the problem

1070
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:23,118
is right max why is the flipped version

1071
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,849
so what we need to know is like the

1072
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,160
flipped version max why we need to know

1073
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:29,539
what the what the expected height of

1074
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,608
this thing was so what do we actually

1075
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:34,670
have that value where is that value

1076
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:38,058
that's in here right but unfortunately

1077
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,710
those things get overwritten because

1078
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:43,819
that's the actual value that I wanted to

1079
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:47,929
know I want to know what these guys are

1080
00:47:43,818 --> 00:47:50,150
I suspect that basically those guys are

1081
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:53,328
the 10 because there they are there in

1082
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:58,460
size yeah that's fine so you can kind of

1083
00:47:53,329 --> 00:48:00,798
see 127 right that see why that looks a

1084
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,028
lot more right to me if that ran right

1085
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:04,608
up against that that's what I would

1086
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:06,380
expect from the P so I think what we

1087
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:12,068
actually want to do here is we want to

1088
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:12,068
say okay whatever that original size was

1089
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:21,650
max why runs up to that and TM descent

1090
00:48:16,789 --> 00:48:26,869
is it's like max why it's like this

1091
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:31,260
right it's like sighs see why is that

1092
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:34,920
length right max why is this length

1093
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:38,040
right and then TM descent is somewhere

1094
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:42,680
in here and so the actual value I

1095
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:47,550
actually want right is something like

1096
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:53,549
sighs see why right which is this amount

1097
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:56,400
minus the TM descent right that puts me

1098
00:48:53,550 --> 00:49:02,220
at this actual location it's that value

1099
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:04,619
relative to the max why right and I feel

1100
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:09,989
like that will actually give me what I

1101
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:12,900
what I wanted right so yeah so if i go

1102
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:28,159
ahead and do that I need to preserve

1103
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:28,160
these somehow like this and off we go

1104
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,088
are so what I want to do is I want to

1105
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,849
say all right let's let's try that let's

1106
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:41,619
see if my thinking there is correct so

1107
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:45,068
that's the bound wit I'm bound height

1108
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:47,829
rather minus the descent and that's

1109
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:49,210
going to be relative to that that that

1110
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:52,239
is what's going to be relative to them

1111
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:55,119
in Y so that I think is a little bit

1112
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,420
better that that seems thought through a

1113
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,528
little bit more carefully than before

1114
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,239
don't know if it's correct or not but

1115
00:49:59,528 --> 00:50:03,880
that's at least a little bit better than

1116
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,940
I I don't want to rerun the asset

1117
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:15,519
processor but I did so now let's switch

1118
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:17,759
back to handmade hero right and let's

1119
00:50:15,518 --> 00:50:20,169
see where we're at so that's

1120
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:21,849
surprisingly that's a little bit odd I

1121
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:26,559
feel like that should have changed

1122
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:29,440
something we're pretty evenly aligned in

1123
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,140
a lot of places with the top edge except

1124
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,548
for that p again is still yeah that's

1125
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:35,368
really weird I don't feel like that

1126
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:37,389
changed very much for such a

1127
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:43,568
significantly different thing to have

1128
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:45,548
done oh I've got that going the wrong

1129
00:50:43,568 --> 00:50:49,139
way still there right so bound height

1130
00:50:45,548 --> 00:50:56,498
minus DM descent that's going to be the

1131
00:50:49,139 --> 00:51:01,348
location of it and min Y min wise not

1132
00:50:56,498 --> 00:51:01,348
the variable I said right

1133
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:09,649
yeah so this is actually what I said

1134
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,909
first of all but like I said it's going

1135
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,800
and I think it's going in the wrong

1136
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:15,529
sense as well so I even still have one

1137
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,980
more further thought bug right which is

1138
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,750
that what we want is we want a positive

1139
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,460
value for our alignment right the

1140
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:25,880
positive value is supposed to go upwards

1141
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:27,889
right so when we subtract max why well

1142
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,320
max y is going to be lower than these

1143
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:31,940
things are so we really want this going

1144
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:37,010
the other direction it's really the max

1145
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:40,900
y minus these guys right is that is the

1146
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:45,650
more correct version right so it's this

1147
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:49,250
not the other way around said I was

1148
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:50,990
tired today I wasn't kidding definitely

1149
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:55,088
was a heavy it was a heavy brain day at

1150
00:51:50,989 --> 00:51:58,729
the office whatever that means all right

1151
00:51:55,088 --> 00:52:01,039
so let's see let's see if that makes a

1152
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:03,980
little more sense there we go so that's

1153
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:05,300
more what i expected to see and now you

1154
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,760
can actually see that we're actually

1155
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,140
lined up properly you can see us kind of

1156
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,609
lining along the baselines we're

1157
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:13,250
definitely getting a lot closer that

1158
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:15,259
looks a lot more correct to me in terms

1159
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:20,050
of what the font would actually have one

1160
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:22,520
have wanted to appear as as doing right

1161
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,960
now we still have i've got like about

1162
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:29,929
seven minutes left i think we started it

1163
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:31,940
at 5 10 so we'll save kerning for next

1164
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:35,629
week but at the moment we can still

1165
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:38,240
improve a little bit on this stuff here

1166
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,250
so let's take just a quick second to

1167
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,828
take a look at how we're advancing our

1168
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:48,079
characters I'm just sort of set us up

1169
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:50,030
for doing the kerning tomorrow right so

1170
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,369
let's take a look at that inside

1171
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,869
handmade hero where we're doing our

1172
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,670
character advancing you can see we're

1173
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:59,300
advancing by carriage am which is

1174
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:01,400
whatever the the the height of the thing

1175
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,750
was and that well that was just kind of

1176
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,420
dumb actually now that I think about it

1177
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:07,159
that's never what you want so what we

1178
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,510
actually wanted to do was was just make

1179
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:09,828
it that's the height of the character we

1180
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,849
want to be based on the width of the

1181
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:15,500
character and that should fix hopefully

1182
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:16,640
that's just a stupid typo that should

1183
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,949
fix our alignment and so there

1184
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,210
can see actually now we're spacing out

1185
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:23,118
the characters and more consistently

1186
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:24,260
right as well but we're not kerning them

1187
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,088
or anything so they're not going to be

1188
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,039
looking good that way we could make it a

1189
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:31,009
little bit better by just adding a

1190
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:33,859
little bit of slop in there right like

1191
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:35,289
you know separate characters by you know

1192
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:39,469
two pixels or something like that

1193
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:41,660
something like this right just to make

1194
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:43,818
it a little easier on the eyes but you

1195
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:45,558
know oops I don't mean to start the

1196
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:46,818
fountain again but again what we really

1197
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:48,319
want to do is kerning so we'll save that

1198
00:53:46,818 --> 00:53:51,018
for next week so now we've got text

1199
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:53,268
aligning on the baseline that's good we

1200
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:54,679
have got things kind of aligning more

1201
00:53:53,268 --> 00:53:56,598
properly left to right but we have to

1202
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:59,659
fix that to make it a little bit better

1203
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:00,619
and we'll do that next week and the

1204
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:02,210
other thing that you have to do that you

1205
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:03,920
can see immediately is we also still

1206
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:06,409
have no idea about the spacing between

1207
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,930
the lines that's why we're losing our

1208
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:10,608
top line right it's gone because we

1209
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:11,778
don't even know how far down and move to

1210
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:14,239
like a line it with the top of the

1211
00:54:11,778 --> 00:54:15,768
screen we have no idea we don't know

1212
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,479
anything about how to advance between

1213
00:54:15,768 --> 00:54:19,159
lines I just you know made up a value

1214
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,690
there so those are the metrics that we

1215
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:22,368
want to keep getting so next week as we

1216
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,838
sort of push through and finish up the

1217
00:54:22,369 --> 00:54:26,329
font stuff that's what we'll be doing we

1218
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:28,480
want to get those values out and use

1219
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:32,420
them in some way that makes some sense

1220
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,059
right I also feel like and I could be

1221
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,159
wrong about this but I feel like we have

1222
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:38,839
another problem here I'm just going to

1223
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:41,118
point it out which is that the

1224
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:43,608
extraction is not I don't think using

1225
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,769
premultiplied alpha or something can you

1226
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:47,358
see how the G has some little things on

1227
00:54:45,768 --> 00:54:51,139
there that are not they don't look right

1228
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:52,518
to me and I suspect that that is because

1229
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:55,788
we are not prepping this with

1230
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:57,768
premultiplied alpha so what I wanted or

1231
00:54:55,789 --> 00:54:59,569
something I don't know or maybe we are

1232
00:54:57,768 --> 00:55:03,618
and we shouldn't be I don't know what's

1233
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:09,759
going on exactly something weird is

1234
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:12,740
happening there I think let's see here

1235
00:55:09,759 --> 00:55:14,358
oh yeah you know what it probably is

1236
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:18,018
it's we're probably not and we're not

1237
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:20,389
doing gamma either right we're not we're

1238
00:55:18,018 --> 00:55:22,399
not gaming this at all so we have this

1239
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:24,528
stuff we're set we're not gaming the

1240
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,759
Alpha so if you remember if you remember

1241
00:55:24,528 --> 00:55:28,460
we went through that whole gamma thing

1242
00:55:25,759 --> 00:55:29,889
because launched on made us do it you

1243
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:32,028
can blame one for this

1244
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:33,768
because I wasn't going to do it but he

1245
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:37,099
was like you got to do gamma and I was

1246
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:41,208
like fine so you remember we did this

1247
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:43,609
stuff right we convert to linear and

1248
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:46,578
then multiply by a and then convert back

1249
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:49,009
right we did this whole thing that is

1250
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:50,239
what we actually would want to do in

1251
00:55:49,009 --> 00:55:52,400
order to make sure that our alpha

1252
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:54,889
blending is correct I believe because

1253
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,608
otherwise what the it's going to be

1254
00:55:54,889 --> 00:56:03,139
unpacked and properly right so what we

1255
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:07,608
want to do there is we want to probably

1256
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:11,170
just follow this exact pattern right we

1257
00:56:07,608 --> 00:56:11,170
probably just want to do this right

1258
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:20,899
exactly something like this we could

1259
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:25,039
even sort of make this a little utility

1260
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:28,400
function right if we wanted to and so we

1261
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:32,599
could do texel here right and texel

1262
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:36,048
would just be whatever that like this

1263
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:38,209
gray value here when we convert it we

1264
00:56:36,048 --> 00:56:46,369
could just go ahead and divide that gray

1265
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:48,948
value x 225 right that sort of thing and

1266
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:52,219
then we could get rid of all of that

1267
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:56,869
right and say that okay the texel is

1268
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:58,579
just all gray like so although actually

1269
00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:02,059
that's not true I guess what we really

1270
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:04,910
do is we'd set these two white set that

1271
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:08,689
alpha value to gray we would do the srgb

1272
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:13,578
the linear multiply the RGB and then we

1273
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:16,509
retire it right that seems like I think

1274
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:16,509
the correct thing to do

1275
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:24,030
set that knots to be an r32 so let me

1276
00:57:22,588 --> 00:57:25,380
just see because I'm just when I noticed

1277
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:27,150
little things like that I just like to

1278
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,329
take a look at them and and see if we

1279
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:33,780
haven't introduced a annoying thing oh

1280
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:34,980
dear certainly made some kind of a typo

1281
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,519
there because we got nothing back from

1282
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:43,530
that what was the problem there I read

1283
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:45,210
out the texel right oh it's srgb to d5

1284
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:47,730
to linear one so these actually are

1285
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:50,010
still 255 based values I guess is the

1286
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:51,889
problem so we really just need that is

1287
00:57:50,010 --> 00:58:00,030
that correct these are supposed to be

1288
00:57:51,889 --> 00:58:01,259
255 255 something like that I don't

1289
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:08,820
really remember how we did that but I

1290
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:11,280
think it was something like that what am

1291
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:13,200
I missing there do you guys know what

1292
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,000
I'm missing you probably already see it

1293
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:16,379
on the on the stream like I said such a

1294
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,338
sleepy day today so I'm assuming that

1295
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:24,450
people are faster than I am right now so

1296
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:27,239
yeah that looks like it doesn't it

1297
00:58:24,449 --> 00:58:30,379
doesn't divide it out so it's just

1298
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:32,519
taking the the 255 values right and

1299
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:38,700
that's exactly what we would be doing

1300
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:40,769
here right it would do srgb to linear to

1301
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:43,169
do the conversion that would write it

1302
00:58:40,769 --> 00:58:47,670
out to test

1303
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:51,298
which seems totally sane right right

1304
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:56,130
that's a desk so what's what's the

1305
00:58:51,298 --> 00:59:00,139
problem there what what happened why did

1306
00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:06,568
you not oh I didn't rerun it that's all

1307
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:08,250
so hey guess what it's fixed now right

1308
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:12,150
you can see that we're not getting that

1309
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:13,260
black fringe on there and so yeah you

1310
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,548
know what are the one of the things

1311
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,660
about getting graphics right if you

1312
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:17,789
really want to get it right as you got

1313
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:20,909
to kind of be ever vigilant about those

1314
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:22,679
sorts of things because you know any

1315
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:25,980
little thing causes an artifact for you

1316
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:27,449
right so that's that's correct now and I

1317
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,949
did a nice clean edge on that and

1318
00:59:27,449 --> 00:59:33,000
everybody's happy and everything looks

1319
00:59:28,949 --> 00:59:34,348
nice and fun so that's all good i'm

1320
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,230
going to turn off our particle fountain

1321
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:38,700
at this point someone was mentioning we

1322
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,170
probably shouldn't be spewing nothings

1323
00:59:38,699 --> 00:59:42,779
everywhere because we're currently using

1324
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:45,630
the window 32 extraction path not the

1325
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:49,319
STD library extraction path so i feel

1326
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:52,140
like that is a good point it's a good

1327
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:56,460
point so maybe we'll go ahead and and

1328
00:59:52,139 --> 01:00:00,088
calm these particles down a little bit

1329
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:03,119
just say save that for some other time

1330
01:00:00,088 --> 01:00:06,179
when particles are more on the menu and

1331
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:11,298
with that i think it is a good time to

1332
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:14,279
go to the Q and a so if you could please

1333
01:00:11,298 --> 01:00:16,650
send me your questions now put a cue

1334
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:21,410
colon in front of them so that I can see

1335
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:21,410
them and we will go from there

1336
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:37,599
ronald dragon does sdb treat i provide

1337
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:39,819
text metrics for this sort of thing will

1338
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:43,569
you show how to get them from the stb

1339
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:46,990
lib on stream yes actually that is is

1340
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:51,880
not particularly difficult if you want

1341
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:55,109
to use the library for that an SUV

1342
01:00:51,880 --> 01:01:00,760
truetype you can actually see there's a

1343
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:02,800
get font v metrics thing that you can

1344
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,560
use to get this information and it is

1345
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:09,160
exactly the same information actually as

1346
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:10,840
the information we were just using so

1347
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:14,139
you can see that you get the SN number

1348
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:17,289
the descent number and the line def

1349
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:20,259
number the only difference is if I

1350
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:23,619
remember correctly Sean does the descent

1351
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:28,420
backwards like negative whereas windows

1352
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:29,859
does it forward so it's positive so that

1353
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:34,980
you can't just literally copy the value

1354
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:34,980
but otherwise it's the same same thing

1355
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:42,820
really be covering right-to-left text so

1356
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,469
there really isn't a difference between

1357
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:47,680
right-to-left text and left right X it's

1358
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:55,359
just whether you subtract or add to the

1359
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:57,279
advancer but you know I don't know that

1360
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,720
I super care about handling

1361
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,060
right-to-left text again the game is not

1362
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:06,099
really about text so we're not doing

1363
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:11,019
much in the way of text handling do you

1364
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:13,210
have any proprietary dependencies I have

1365
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:16,480
no idea what that means tactile dactyl

1366
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:19,150
if you can clarify I could answer the

1367
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,460
question what were the things you just

1368
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:25,750
took off I'm assuming something for your

1369
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:27,280
wrists oh yeah we're wrist braces can

1370
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:34,420
you go over how you computed a line

1371
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:39,790
percentage one again yes I can so here

1372
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:41,769
is a line percentage one right and let's

1373
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:42,599
go ahead and you know draw it out on

1374
01:02:41,769 --> 01:02:46,088
here

1375
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:53,609
so you can see that what we have on the

1376
01:02:46,088 --> 01:02:53,608
whiteboard we have 1 plus quantity max y

1377
01:02:54,539 --> 01:03:09,999
minus the quantity the height minus the

1378
01:03:01,688 --> 01:03:11,288
descent / the bitmap height right so I

1379
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:18,009
guess the way I should probably do this

1380
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:21,219
is maybe 1 plus y max right minus the

1381
01:03:18,009 --> 01:03:31,239
height of the extraction region minus

1382
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:33,159
the descent right / that height of the

1383
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:35,228
whole of the of the bitmap of that was

1384
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:36,578
the pout that we're saving I guess we

1385
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:41,018
could say right the height of the bitmap

1386
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:43,469
right so this is what we're writing out

1387
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:48,578
and so let's take it piece by piece

1388
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:51,039
right so HB is actually the thing that

1389
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:54,640
we're storing right that's the height of

1390
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,109
the thing that we're storing right so

1391
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,509
that is you know if we take that

1392
01:03:56,108 --> 01:04:02,978
lowercase a basically the lower case a

1393
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:05,769
is like they're right it fills the

1394
01:04:02,978 --> 01:04:08,288
entire thing except for a 1 pixel apron

1395
01:04:05,768 --> 01:04:12,669
right so it's like that and there's like

1396
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:16,449
a 1 pixel like apron around the side so

1397
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:19,449
it makes sense ok and HP is the height

1398
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:21,818
the total height of the whole thing with

1399
01:04:19,449 --> 01:04:25,389
the one pixel apron so the actual height

1400
01:04:21,818 --> 01:04:27,219
of the character is like hb- too that's

1401
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:31,748
actually the height of the a and in

1402
01:04:27,219 --> 01:04:34,509
pixels right so up here on the top what

1403
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:36,578
do we have well we have the quantity the

1404
01:04:34,509 --> 01:04:39,309
height of the extraction region which is

1405
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:41,140
some larger region right we have the

1406
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:44,048
height of the extraction region minus

1407
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:46,509
the descender right whatever the scent

1408
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:49,329
metrics was and that what I was saying

1409
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:53,159
is that's taking this and moving us up

1410
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:53,160
to some line right

1411
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,760
that makes sense that's what we're sort

1412
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:58,629
of trying to do conceptually i'm not

1413
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,090
going to draw that in quite yet because

1414
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:05,070
we have more we're taking that amount

1415
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:09,460
and we're subtracting it from the wimax

1416
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:11,950
right so again this thing is the

1417
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:14,590
difference right it's the difference

1418
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:18,299
between where the descender was and

1419
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:29,559
where the height of the whole thing was

1420
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:30,850
right so H E and this is d now it's

1421
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:32,469
worth noting that since these are in a

1422
01:05:30,849 --> 01:05:34,299
subtraction we could have phrased this

1423
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:37,449
in a different way we could have phrased

1424
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,250
this as plus D minus H right i mean we

1425
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:40,179
could we could distribute this plus if

1426
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:44,019
we wanted to i mean this this

1427
01:05:40,179 --> 01:05:47,049
subtraction right if we wanted to but

1428
01:05:44,019 --> 01:05:49,329
anyway so anyway right this quantity

1429
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:52,119
here right is is the is the height of

1430
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:54,779
the extraction area which is a wider

1431
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:58,150
again a wider region so it's this thing

1432
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:00,700
it's that height minus whatever the

1433
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:03,369
descender height is which is some other

1434
01:06:00,699 --> 01:06:05,589
you know it's some some quantity that

1435
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:08,519
just says this right so we're basically

1436
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:12,789
talking about this amount right here

1437
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:16,329
right the part from here down that's

1438
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:20,159
what we're talking about right if that

1439
01:06:16,329 --> 01:06:22,900
makes sense we're then subtracting wimax

1440
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:26,858
wimax is the height of the whole thing

1441
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:29,650
right and the reason that I had to do it

1442
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:33,989
in this extremely torture the wimax is

1443
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:37,630
is the height of the you know I think I

1444
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:42,358
probably drew this wrong now I think

1445
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:46,980
about it that's why isn't actually the

1446
01:06:42,358 --> 01:06:53,380
light of the whole thing it's this thing

1447
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:56,360
right it's this line over here

1448
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:57,800
so I said that wrong it's not bite of

1449
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,880
the whole thing it's the height of this

1450
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,710
thing right here right so again so what

1451
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:07,760
I'm trying to do there is say okay I

1452
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:10,269
need to know if I was to start where I'm

1453
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,970
actually going to extract my pixels from

1454
01:07:10,269 --> 01:07:17,000
where with that that where would that

1455
01:07:13,969 --> 01:07:20,299
descender line be in reference to this

1456
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,340
guy how many pixels up from the start of

1457
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:25,850
the extraction area would I have to go

1458
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:27,320
to get there right so I had to do this

1459
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:29,929
super tortured version because the thing

1460
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:34,580
was bottom up so I couldn't just take a

1461
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:35,809
sort of the I only have the descender

1462
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:37,699
because the way that it gives me a text

1463
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:41,420
metrics I only have that descent value

1464
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:42,889
relative to the extraction region the

1465
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:44,030
extraction region is what Windows is

1466
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:45,259
telling me is where it plays the

1467
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,820
character and it's telling me that it's

1468
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:49,610
the sender was relative to that so I

1469
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:51,200
have to compute it that way and then

1470
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,670
once i compute it that way once i

1471
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,589
figured out where that is then i could

1472
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:58,730
subtract where i'm actually extracting

1473
01:07:54,590 --> 01:08:00,860
from and do you know where i'm actually

1474
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:03,440
starting the actual values from and then

1475
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:05,870
i can do it right because like i said

1476
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,970
the extraction region being here the

1477
01:08:05,869 --> 01:08:09,440
port we're actually starting to copy the

1478
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:12,019
pixels or where we're saving the bitmap

1479
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,840
from comes in here once i have that

1480
01:08:12,019 --> 01:08:16,970
value right once i know how big that is

1481
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,159
that's actually going to be the

1482
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:21,050
alignment point right that's where I

1483
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:22,939
want it to be but the alignment is

1484
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,320
phrased as a percentage it phrases a

1485
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:26,750
percentage of the total height of the

1486
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,549
bitmap so what I need to do is I need to

1487
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,859
say okay if I've got how many pixels I

1488
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:33,800
go up right if I've got a pixel count

1489
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:35,960
for going up what I want to do is take

1490
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:39,110
that pixel count and divide it by the

1491
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,659
total pixel count right to get the

1492
01:08:39,109 --> 01:08:43,849
percentage but the problem is we

1493
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:45,920
introduce an additional one pixel wide

1494
01:08:43,850 --> 01:08:47,690
apron because that's how the fonts were

1495
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,279
actually you know how we're specking a

1496
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:54,079
bit messed to be stored so technically

1497
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,269
the descender is actually one further

1498
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:59,239
than it was before that's what this is

1499
01:08:56,270 --> 01:09:02,540
and the height is actually to greater

1500
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:05,479
than it was before and that's what HP is

1501
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:06,199
right so instead of p / h we actually

1502
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:07,969
have one

1503
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:10,069
us that that value whatever we want to

1504
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:11,420
call that I'm point P here but whatever

1505
01:09:10,069 --> 01:09:14,719
you want to call the quantity they're

1506
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:16,850
right this quantity we actually have one

1507
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,680
plus that divided by the big height the

1508
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:22,430
height of the whole bit map that has the

1509
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,900
apron in it right so hopefully that's a

1510
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:28,690
little bit more I know it's crazy but

1511
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:28,689
that's just what we had to do

1512
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:42,250
are you developing this engine with the

1513
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:44,230
intent to use it beyond this game no it

1514
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:52,270
is only designed to be used for this

1515
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:54,309
game colon friend aren't we currently

1516
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,960
using a fixed width font so advancing by

1517
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:57,280
some fixed distance ascendant method

1518
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,960
should improve letter spacing even

1519
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:03,250
before discussing kerning in full Jenner

1520
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:05,140
in full generality um not necessarily it

1521
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,489
probably looks better if you do it this

1522
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:09,220
way even on a fixed width font because

1523
01:10:06,489 --> 01:10:12,819
fix with fonts look like they have too

1524
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:14,770
much space in them typically but yeah I

1525
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:15,819
mean who knows what you want to do is

1526
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:20,410
the kerning thing that we're going to do

1527
01:10:15,819 --> 01:10:22,029
next week so now that you have text

1528
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:32,649
handled will there be a net hack mode

1529
01:10:22,029 --> 01:10:34,300
for handmade hero uh no tactile dactyl

1530
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:35,859
proprietary dependencies anything that

1531
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:38,020
you need to pay a license fee for to

1532
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:40,089
develop our sell copies of the game ok

1533
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:43,960
so you I guess you must be a new viewer

1534
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:45,989
potentially then know like hameed heroes

1535
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:49,119
written from scratch we wrote everything

1536
01:10:45,989 --> 01:10:51,099
literally everything the only thing that

1537
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:52,420
we did not write is an optional

1538
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,980
component that I showed how to use

1539
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:57,010
because people wanted to see how to use

1540
01:10:53,979 --> 01:10:59,349
a library so sdb truetype is optional

1541
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:02,260
but even it is completely free it's in

1542
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:04,090
the public domain and you don't have to

1543
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:06,489
use it in handmade hero you can actually

1544
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:09,130
just not use it by setting this use

1545
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:11,319
fonts from windows 21 so so yes we we

1546
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:13,319
wrote everything from scratch there's no

1547
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:17,639
components in it that we didn't write

1548
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:17,639
let alone that we would have to pay for

1549
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:37,470
I think that is it for questions that I

1550
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:37,469
see that are related to the coding

1551
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:04,198
off topic saved this for the end because

1552
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,869
i forgot to mention in the beginning I

1553
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:08,369
had a dream with you and Jeff in it you

1554
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:11,189
guys were in my neighborhood on

1555
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:13,800
Halloween trick-or-treating and going

1556
01:12:11,189 --> 01:12:15,238
door to door asking for candy at some

1557
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,279
point I was trying to put on my costume

1558
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:22,799
and it got stuck and Jeff was laughing

1559
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:25,529
at me all right I don't know that that's

1560
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,869
a question so there's nothing really for

1561
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:29,130
me to answer although i would say that I

1562
01:12:27,869 --> 01:12:31,590
don't know that Jeff would laugh at you

1563
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:32,909
he tends to be in person very helpful so

1564
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:37,340
you would probably try to help you get

1565
01:12:32,908 --> 01:12:37,339
the costume on would be my guess

1566
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:18,520
any other questions any other questions

1567
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:26,109
we've got five minutes left but i can

1568
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:27,670
always end early no Jo Jo I did forget a

1569
01:13:26,109 --> 01:13:32,079
question how did you guys get into my

1570
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:35,039
dream I do not know I guess we just had

1571
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:38,769
some kind of magic astral projection

1572
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:42,760
spirit walking dream manifestation

1573
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:45,990
happening and that's where he popped in

1574
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:45,989
you know we popped in

1575
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:57,829
CSX 3214 you could try answering the one

1576
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:59,859
I just asked that's not a coding

1577
01:13:57,829 --> 01:13:59,859
question

1578
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:16,109
itz cash why not use block-based bright

1579
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:20,429
fonts for debugging and avoid the

1580
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:23,099
windows font headache so you know I

1581
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:25,800
wouldn't be opposed to that so I don't

1582
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,730
want to say don't do that but I felt

1583
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,739
like that wasn't a particularly

1584
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:31,500
productive thing to do because I feel

1585
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:35,550
like we'll probably want fonts in the

1586
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:36,899
actual game and so why not just write in

1587
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:38,550
actual font system and then we can have

1588
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:40,949
all the fonts we want instead of just

1589
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:44,489
writing one like kind of ugly

1590
01:14:40,949 --> 01:14:46,649
block-based thing I mean block-based fox

1591
01:14:44,489 --> 01:14:48,059
just don't look professional the only

1592
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:49,619
time you really should be using those as

1593
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,880
if your whole game is like a bitmap

1594
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:54,420
pathetic and you're sure you're going

1595
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,920
for that old-school thing but our game

1596
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,050
does not have that aesthetic like it's

1597
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,930
act it's like fairly painterly art and

1598
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:03,630
so we're going to need regular font

1599
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,980
support for the game so it just seemed

1600
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:06,420
like you might as well do it once and

1601
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:08,729
have it and then you use that for both

1602
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:15,690
the debugging and for the regular you

1603
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:18,869
know what do you use for version control

1604
01:15:15,689 --> 01:15:22,409
at work I use a program called see

1605
01:15:18,869 --> 01:15:25,019
mirror that I wrote although we were in

1606
01:15:22,409 --> 01:15:26,970
the process of transitioning away from

1607
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,560
it I just haven't had a chance to

1608
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:30,720
actually finish all the code for the new

1609
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:34,260
one so we're still kind of a little

1610
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:37,130
hybrid but that's the one that's still

1611
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,130
in use at the moment

01:15:55,630 --> 01:16:14,180

messed up woman from the 1930s all right

1615
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:35,390
