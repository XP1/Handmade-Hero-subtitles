00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,169
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,439
hero the show where we could a complete

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:13,169
game live on stream we are probably

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:18,108
going to since we sort of started it

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:20,189
yesterday we are going to take a look at

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:22,320
allowing multiple sim region

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,768
computations per frame just to sort of

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,778
get an idea of what it what it would

9
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,389
entail and we're just not going to worry

10
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,278
too much about the overlapping

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,469
boundaries problem what we'll do is

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,590
we'll just try to make it so that if

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,719
multiple sim regions would overlap we

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,059
just go ahead and overlap that merge

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,189
them together and simulate a bigger sim

16
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:47,308
region that's probably not going to be

17
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:49,229
you know the final way to do it we may

18
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:50,878
have to get more creative and try to

19
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,968
hack things together in order to make it

20
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,839
work I don't know just because I'm

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,320
worried about the performance

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,640
implications of merging regions together

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,649
you know like i said i don't really have

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,840
a good feel for what's going to be

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,040
required there but we're going to give

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,890
it a shot and we'll just see what

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,740
happens at the very least we know that

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,049
we can do a reasonable job anytime some

29
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,478
regions aren't overlapping so you know

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,650
when in doubt at least implement the

31
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:19,200
thing that you know you can implement

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,920
and then you know will at least be in a

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,350
better position to have some kind of you

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,118
know guess about whether or not we'll be

35
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:34,139
able to do something smarter than just

36
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,239
merging the regions so today is day 3 49

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,460
so if you would like to follow along at

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,548
home please start with de 348 source

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:44,129
code that's what I'm starting with today

40
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:47,640
oops and I'm going to just go ahead and

41
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:55,199
do a quick build and run here so let's

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:58,500
load up the there we go let's go ahead

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,250
and run this so we are basically back to

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,478
normal behavior here for the most part

45
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,340
everybody is kind of just hopping around

46
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:09,598
doing their random thing that they do

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:13,020
and so I really just wanted to make it

48
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,769
some way of sort of having a bigger

49
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,409
world

50
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,850
that's getting simulated by different

51
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:21,210
people and different at different times

52
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,680
and stuff like that and and so as you

53
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,000
can see I've had the world generator

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,340
generate us a fairly sizable at least by

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,020
our current standards sighs you can keep

56
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,729
walking around this world for a long

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,300
time and there's just lots of random

58
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:38,009
junk happening you know we don't have a

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,840
very interesting world generator at the

60
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,669
moment so there's nothing interesting to

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
see in this world but it's definitely

62
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:46,049
got plenty of rooms and so what I want

63
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,119
to do is just get it to the point where

64
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,790
maybe we've got to simulation regions

65
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,800
happening if you remember we've sort of

66
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,979
have this ability to zoom out on the

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,050
debug camera and if I do zoom out on the

68
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,719
debug camera you can kind of see what's

69
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,540
getting simulated at the moment and it

70
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,849
kind of reaches back just to write about

71
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:09,109
their right you can sort of see that

72
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:14,849
anything in this boundary here is sim

73
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:17,490
and anything in this safe region here is

74
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:21,239
is pulled in as well although not

75
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,700
simulated at the moment and I can sort

76
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,439
of come back here this way and activate

77
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,509
those things you can see how they become

78
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,490
active when I come in there but if I

79
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:31,139
leave that region well I'm not doing a

80
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,750
very good job leaving it if I leave that

81
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:36,179
region then things that are outside that

82
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,159
boundary generally I think go back to

83
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,629
sleep right I don't actually know if

84
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,949
that's true to be honest with you I

85
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:42,650
guess I don't really know what we ended

86
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:46,049
up deciding to do there in terms of

87
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,159
checking people's active flags because

88
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,469
we have some weird stuff that's

89
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,840
happening whoa so this is pretty

90
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:53,669
interesting here I guess what that means

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,259
is because like this guy was still

92
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,759
obeying collision and everything so I

93
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,799
guess that means is we're not rendering

94
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,329
anything out there but we are actually

95
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,520
simulating it properly which is

96
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,950
interesting so the simulation battery

97
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,480
must go out to their remember we have a

98
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:08,579
weird thing that we did which is that

99
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,399
any time any part of a creature is

100
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,200
inside if that is a multi-part creature

101
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,700
it will bring in the rest of the

102
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,899
creature so we also have kind of an

103
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:19,949
interesting thing going on there we have

104
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,689
to look for but anyway if we take a look

105
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,509
at what's going on here we definitely

106
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:26,759
have a big enough world to make multiple

107
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:28,079
sim regions because for example you

108
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,408
could imagine

109
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:34,568
having say for sake of argument down

110
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:36,098
here there's definitely rooms we could

111
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:38,949
have a second sim region down here

112
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:41,288
simulating those rooms right so it would

113
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:44,259
be nice to do a test here where we could

114
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:46,658
have that extra sim going on so we could

115
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,120
verify that we can sim and that we can

116
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:56,978
also send this other area over here

117
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:58,209
right so that's really it uh by the way

118
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:00,848
those of you who are wondering where the

119
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:02,829
black dot is the black dot is we've

120
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:05,378
figured out what it is the black dot is

121
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:06,878
the cursor for some reason we're drawing

122
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,439
the cursor we're not drawing it in the

123
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,599
right place I don't even know why we

124
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,300
were drawing it or when but you can kind

125
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:15,538
of see it moving around there randomly

126
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,218
you know I'm saying that's pretty weird

127
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:21,278
so yeah I have no idea why that's there

128
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:25,959
but that's what that is somebody must be

129
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:27,129
drawing the cursor I've no idea why I do

130
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,239
not care about that at the moment I

131
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,930
should probably add to the Duelist

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,098
though like say why is somebody's still

133
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:40,740
drawing mouse cursor and drawing it

134
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:42,819
wrong like no idea when that got put in

135
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,288
one hour night it's kind of hard to

136
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,360
remember what it is that you have and

137
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:48,490
haven't done and why all right so anyway

138
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm going to recompile here at that I'm

139
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,439
going to go ahead and switch out to a

140
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,028
handmade world mode and in handmade

141
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,229
world would be already sort of started

142
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,848
to play around with this you can see I

143
00:05:56,228 --> 00:06:00,310
have an update and render sim region

144
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:02,680
call and what I did was I made it so

145
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,718
that right here we just you know do that

146
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,759
call which updates and renders the same

147
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:08,680
region and so in theory we could call

148
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,620
this twice with different sim bounds and

149
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,149
do a second simulation but things are a

150
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,278
little bit dicey ER than I would like

151
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:17,348
them to be because if you go and look at

152
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:19,658
what happens in the update and render

153
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:22,209
sim region call because it's update and

154
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:23,860
render are baked together we definitely

155
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:25,088
have some situations where if we wanted

156
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,830
to do an update without doing any

157
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:31,449
rendering it would be a little bit

158
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:34,120
unusual right and similarly there are

159
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:36,879
some things in here like this which are

160
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,668
sort of what happens with the player

161
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,350
input right but we don't really want the

162
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:44,799
player input to be involved

163
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:47,040
here you know we don't necessarily want

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,660
player input to be getting considered

165
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,540
every time we update a sim region

166
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:56,020
because we only want to do that for the

167
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,240
for the sim region that the monitor is

168
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,709
actually viewing because if you you know

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,329
you're not supposed to be interacting

170
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,279
with any of the other sim regions that

171
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:05,500
are getting simulated off-screen which

172
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,079
are just to like allow MPC's to do

173
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,269
things or to allow game events to happen

174
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,599
that are you know sort of happening

175
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:15,729
without your participation so they

176
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,650
certainly shouldn't be checking for any

177
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,650
kind of player input at that point ooh

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:33,819
hmm yani okay so let's take a look here

179
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:37,689
and and just see what we might want to

180
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:40,839
do about that so again we've got a we've

181
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:44,639
got some sort of issues here that we we

182
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:49,089
kind of want to think about specifically

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,490
when we do updating of the world we

184
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:53,709
don't necessarily want to split update

185
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,900
and render into two separate parts right

186
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:57,519
because if you think about what happens

187
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:59,379
here the natural thing for us to do

188
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,870
would be to say well we want to be able

189
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,209
to update the sim regions and we want to

190
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,129
be able to render the world but we don't

191
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,389
want to have to render every time we

192
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,889
update because we may want to update

193
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,680
things that we don't render their

194
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,050
off-screen so it may be tempting to

195
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,050
break update and render into two steps

196
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,480
one that does updating and one that does

197
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,600
rendering the problem with this is it is

198
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,430
inherently slower to do that usually the

199
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,920
reason is because when I have to update

200
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,230
something I have to pull of its data

201
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,379
into the cache and I have to work on it

202
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,180
right so it's live it's there it's in

203
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:38,110
the cash ready for me to operate on it

204
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:39,579
it already got dragged in to you know

205
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,149
from main memory into the processors

206
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,310
cash so it's usually pretty free at that

207
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,659
point for me to then just use that data

208
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:48,819
that I've already pulled into the cash

209
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:51,429
to produce a render command for this

210
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,990
thing that will properly reflect where

211
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:54,009
it is in the world and what if it Maps

212
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,120
should be and all those other thoughts

213
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,549
of things that I need to

214
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,990
look at the entity's data to be able to

215
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:04,149
determine how to do that right so if I

216
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,430
fundamentally split up update and render

217
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:08,740
into two pieces then I have this problem

218
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:11,109
where I'm pulling everything back into

219
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,120
the cache twice right the first time I

220
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,649
pull it in to do the update the second

221
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,019
time I pull it in to do the render and

222
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:20,169
that's not probably going to be a very

223
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:22,419
efficient way to do things so it depends

224
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:24,069
largely on whether or not the update

225
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:26,528
needs to fully complete before the

226
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,750
render can happen is really the only

227
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:31,179
reason why I would probably split them

228
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,278
up and what I mean by that is if for

229
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,528
example update needs to operate in

230
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,088
several passes like for example all

231
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:39,669
objects need to be I'm sorry all

232
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,260
entities need to be moved in the world

233
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:42,939
and then they need to have some like

234
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,338
collisions reconciled after their

235
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,170
movement or something and then and only

236
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:48,790
then after all that's done can I

237
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,789
actually issue render commands for them

238
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:53,649
if that's the case then splitting it

239
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:56,349
into update and render makes reasonable

240
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,329
sense because I already know that I'm

241
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,430
not going to get that cash win I have to

242
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,990
wait until things are done and pull an

243
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:08,019
entity back into the cash to render it

244
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:09,899
anyway so at that point I'm not worried

245
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,958
about making an architectural faux pas

246
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:16,600
by splitting up these two operations

247
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,739
however if I don't think that I'm going

248
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,330
to do that if I think that in general

249
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,430
i'll be able to just step through each

250
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,259
entity allow it to run a simulation step

251
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:29,370
and then retire it and say this is its

252
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:32,799
permanent location for the final frame

253
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,360
for the next frame rather at that point

254
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,129
it really doesn't make very much sense

255
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,830
for me to split them up what I would

256
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:40,958
rather do is just make it so that I do

257
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,810
them both together and there's just have

258
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:50,588
a branch that's like if I'm rendering do

259
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:52,509
the render work otherwise don't write so

260
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,640
I think at this point in time it's too

261
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:56,289
early to make a definitive statement

262
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,539
that i know that splitting update and

263
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:00,458
render is a good idea i think that it's

264
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:02,409
possible that keeping update and render

265
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:04,899
together is going to be smarter and more

266
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:07,240
efficient in the end it certainly has

267
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:09,088
the possibility to be so and so what I

268
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,019
would like to do is keep it

269
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:18,420
that those things are still welded but

270
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:20,220
they will essentially work they will

271
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:22,229
essentially work in a way that allows

272
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,629
you to turn off the rendering when you

273
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,778
don't want the rendering to occur now

274
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:30,240
I've got some situations here where like

275
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:32,129
I don't super understand a couple things

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,740
like for example I don't know why the

277
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,720
render group okay as that's why it is

278
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,399
because it needs to reserve sort keys I

279
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,709
was like I don't know why the render

280
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,769
group needs to get passed down to

281
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:50,549
something like the brain who's really

282
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:53,039
tired easy to adapt it's nap time and so

283
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:54,748
yeah in in this case where we've got the

284
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,278
sort of always behind always a sort of

285
00:11:54,749 --> 00:12:01,439
it's having to pass the renter rip down

286
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:03,769
to this thing so yeah in this case with

287
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:06,448
the render group reserved sort key bit

288
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:09,209
this would just be something where the

289
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:12,808
render group is only getting passed into

290
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:14,938
this thing for that one purpose and it

291
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:17,458
makes sense why it has to happen but I

292
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:19,259
do wonder when we move to a z-buffer if

293
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:22,378
maybe we can get rid of that I hope that

294
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:24,778
we can I'm not sure because it'll depend

295
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,670
on how we choose to make things work but

296
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:29,338
it's entirely plausible that we could

297
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:32,128
just sort of structure things so that

298
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,600
maybe that works I don't know well I

299
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:35,759
guess we'd have to because we won't have

300
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,610
the ability to do a sort key of that

301
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,778
nature inside the z-buffer really i mean

302
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,480
we could implement something like that

303
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:44,100
in a crazy sort of depth control

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,100
situation but i don't know if we really

305
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,350
want to go that far so anyway yeah this

306
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,839
render group situation is is not my

307
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,659
favorite and I do wonder so if we do

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,029
that reserve sort key thing here if I

309
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:59,360
wasn't going to do that always behind

310
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:01,919
always in front of I assume we just get

311
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,240
the head passing in front of and behind

312
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,860
the body at the moment right because

313
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,249
that's all that was for also I believe

314
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,688
we're still in debug I mean I optimize

315
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:15,058
build which I don't really need to be in

316
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:16,980
at the moment we're not doing any kind

317
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:20,009
of performance testing so I'm not going

318
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,430
to bother with the logger build times

319
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,720
that come from that

320
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:26,359
so yeah you can kind of see how the head

321
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,639
like flashes because it doesn't have do

322
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,289
you see how it kind of goes behind the

323
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,389
body occasionally there to see that

324
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:34,819
happening so that's what I'm talking

325
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,799
about that's what that code was in there

326
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,790
for so I'm going to go ahead and say

327
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,529
that while we're doing this for

328
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:41,120
architecting since I already said that

329
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:44,059
we're going to go ahead and put in the

330
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,919
3d stuff and I don't think that sort key

331
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:48,409
situation is really going to be able to

332
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,000
work i'll probably just pull that and

333
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:51,409
then we won't rely on the render Bruce

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,570
that's the only reason it was in there

335
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:55,459
now it's worth noting that I'm not one

336
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,500
hundred percent certain how we are going

337
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,210
to address that problem but I think it

338
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,549
wouldn't really matter that much because

339
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,070
as long as the body and the head when

340
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:06,500
they when they tilt are tilted the same

341
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:08,150
way I think we'll probably be able to Z

342
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,549
buffer will be able to take care of that

343
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:13,850
for us we'll just have to layer things

344
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:16,219
properly so I think that'll be ok I

345
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,840
think that that won't be something it

346
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,879
will still require a little bit of

347
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,160
finesse but I don't think it'll be too

348
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:25,549
much of a problem so I'm going to go

349
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:29,990
ahead and remove that for now and then

350
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:32,120
we can get rid of the render group from

351
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,090
here because that's the only thing that

352
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,350
it was actually necessary for so what

353
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,210
I'm going to do now is I'm just going to

354
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,680
take a pass through this code and I'm

355
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,210
going to try and isolate the stuff

356
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,609
that's actually working on the render

357
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,370
group and what you can kind of see here

358
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,620
is that there's really not that much

359
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,480
stuff that's happening it's mostly in

360
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,750
pass-through calls and a little bit of

361
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,820
debug stuff here so this debug stuff it

362
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,039
doesn't really matter when i call this

363
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,470
debug stuff per se because since it is

364
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:03,829
sort of put in the world in a sort any

365
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,960
way or in a z-buffer later on i should

366
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,090
be able to do something where I kind of

367
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,139
move this stuff down into a more

368
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:16,759
aggregated place so for example if I

369
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:18,789
wanted to I should be able to come down

370
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,789
here

371
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:27,659
and yeah let me just see if that still

372
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:34,429
works reasonably well get the debug

373
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:34,429
camera there yeah

374
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,080
so that's still totally fine and so what

375
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,689
I want to do is I just want to kind of

376
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,259
calves off this part here because all of

377
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,660
this stuff and I guess is this raft

378
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:52,909
outline mouse p nonsense this looks like

379
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:54,528
the stuff this is the person who's

380
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:58,009
drawing the mouse isn't it goodbye to

381
00:15:54,528 --> 00:16:01,370
you sir I don't actually know is this

382
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:08,088
necessary that orthographic change there

383
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:10,009
I don't think it is yeah so if I take a

384
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,260
look now at what's actually happening I

385
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:16,009
can pretty much calves off this entire

386
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:17,720
section as being stuff that's only there

387
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,399
if we're rendering right so for

388
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,120
rendering we need to do this and then

389
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,950
really there's only just one thing that

390
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,919
I need to be aware of which is that it

391
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:31,399
update and render entities right that

392
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,708
actually does need to obey the same sort

393
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,360
of protocol where you have to be able to

394
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:37,099
test whether you're going to render or

395
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,320
not so that you can optionally not

396
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,240
render but now we're definitely in a

397
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,310
case where we don't have to render if we

398
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,990
don't want to and similarly I can come

399
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,859
in here and I can sort of start to act

400
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:53,120
get these things sort of place in a more

401
00:16:48,860 --> 00:17:02,089
reasonable fashion we could sort of say

402
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:03,259
all right maybe like this let's say we

403
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:08,058
could sort of look at these and go you

404
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:14,150
know we know that at least these things

405
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:16,849
here are optional right we don't need to

406
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,949
pass any of this stuff if you wanted to

407
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:23,359
do a sin step you could and all of those

408
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:25,910
things could be left 0 right now what I

409
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,078
don't know is for background color I'm

410
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,929
assuming that's just a pass through to

411
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:32,990
the render edit e and I'm correct as far

412
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:36,830
as game state is concerned that's only

413
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:39,558
for input I think or yeah because

414
00:17:36,829 --> 00:17:42,769
basically controlled heroes is the only

415
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:45,710
place that that really is ever used so

416
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:48,859
that's really in some sense probably up

417
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,659
optional as well so it would kind of be

418
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,358
nice it'd probably be

419
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:55,999
nice if we had some way of making that a

420
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:59,569
little bit less sort of weirdly

421
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:12,169
intertwined so for example if I went out

422
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:16,009
to let's say uh maybe rain and just

423
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:18,649
looked at it yet you can kind of see the

424
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:21,950
only reason that we need this is again

425
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:26,028
to get at that controlled heroes array

426
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:28,340
so you know that's another one that's

427
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:31,128
really only necessary if we have input

428
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:32,569
so technically even that is is kind of

429
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,949
optional so you can just kind of see

430
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,808
what i'm doing here is kind of looking

431
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,028
at really what what's actually necessary

432
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:41,028
for this code let's take a look at

433
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:42,919
screen bounds so screen bounce is

434
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:45,829
interesting in that screen bounds is

435
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:49,099
really something you know this this

436
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:51,648
render code this code for the pushing

437
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:56,269
the outline here this stuff could really

438
00:18:51,648 --> 00:19:01,038
be moved one level out if it wasn't for

439
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:05,028
this this sim region bounds part here

440
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:08,450
and uh so I mean really that's the only

441
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:10,429
thing and so if we wanted to we could

442
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,499
probably get away with doing this a

443
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:18,019
little bit cleaner I'm trying to think

444
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:19,548
of how exactly that would work because

445
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:21,288
you can kind of see the problem is that

446
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:23,749
we don't get information about the

447
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:25,729
camera until later and so then when we

448
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:27,499
come through here we would mean that we

449
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:29,960
need to know some of the stuff like the

450
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,909
screen bounds and that sort of thing in

451
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,409
order to just do that debug rendering

452
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:38,299
but yeah again that's like all see your

453
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,669
sim bounds should be used yes for this

454
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:43,278
so it's really you know even screen

455
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:45,919
bounds here is a totally optional thing

456
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:51,098
right it's not necessary so you're

457
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:53,778
really looking at very very few actual

458
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:56,028
actual pieces of information there I'm

459
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:58,239
interested to know in update and render

460
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,588
entities because I'm not actually sure

461
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:03,169
I'm interested to know what the

462
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:04,558
transient state is used for in there so

463
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,019
inside update and render

464
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,999
which is right here I kind of want to

465
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,649
know what trans States used for I'm

466
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:19,350
going to switch screens because I can't

467
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:22,138
see behind my head there so tranh state

468
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:24,148
is also just used it's just used for the

469
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:26,459
asset system so really the trans state

470
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:28,888
itself is not necessary at all that

471
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,120
could just be the asset system that's

472
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:32,189
getting past there would be the only

473
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,479
thing that action news happen and that

474
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,700
only needs to happen because of the

475
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,759
rendering so that again is totally

476
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,929
optional so you know we sort of have a

477
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:44,819
thing that's like game assets here and

478
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:47,369
the trans state is really not necessary

479
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:50,368
it's really just that one piece of it

480
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:52,769
right and so when I call this you know

481
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:55,199
I'm really only passing that is the only

482
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:59,788
useful part of the thing that I'm

483
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,819
actually passing so yeah again kind of

484
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:06,658
getting it a little bit more little bit

485
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:08,428
more figured out here so yeah so trans

486
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:10,139
state is getting past with that reason

487
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:11,879
but now we sort of got an idea that

488
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:13,368
really if you were going to simulate you

489
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:16,558
would only need these three things

490
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:19,259
that's all you actually need and then if

491
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,720
you want to simulate an render at the

492
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,499
same time then you need to deal with

493
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,499
this stuff right here

494
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:37,539
so I think that's mostly it I just want

495
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:40,180
to know if I can maybe I I would be

496
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:42,879
interested to continue fussing with that

497
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:47,110
a little bit more to kind of get it more

498
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,750
condensed down into a cleaner state I

499
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:53,019
don't need to do it right now but it's

500
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:56,170
on my mind because you know maybe sort

501
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:58,299
of reorganizing how some of these

502
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,910
structures work may be thinking of

503
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:03,129
things in terms of a context that we

504
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,680
could construct there are ways we can

505
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,380
sort of architect around that a little

506
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,660
bit and so I do wonder if maybe that

507
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,640
isn't something we will want to do in

508
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,910
the future I'm going to go ahead through

509
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,280
here and do the exact same

510
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:20,529
reorganization mouse p i think was used

511
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:23,049
only for debug picking if i'm not

512
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:24,609
mistaken but we probably still want that

513
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:27,609
to be happening so we're going to leave

514
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:30,959
all that in there we've got some stuff

515
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:35,579
here like dt is going to be necessary

516
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:39,130
and camera p is really only necessary

517
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,839
for rendering obviously so a lot of this

518
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:50,650
stuff i think pretty much everything

519
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:52,209
after here is probably also optional and

520
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,610
so now we just kind of have to take a

521
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,500
look at what this stuff is doing or when

522
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:58,659
it's doing it so you can kind of come

523
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,900
through here and see we're computing all

524
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,430
this stuff like the camera p on all this

525
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,200
like fog amounts and that sort of stuff

526
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,210
we don't care what those come out to be

527
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,830
if all we're doing is simulating so it

528
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,529
doesn't matter you could pass like zero

529
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:13,809
for the camera P and that would be fine

530
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:15,700
I also don't know if this stuff needs to

531
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,250
be done at the top I think it might be

532
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,720
able to do it sort of well no it needs

533
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,869
to be done prepped so that each entity

534
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,799
can hand of have it happen but this is

535
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,449
obviously something that doesn't

536
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,549
actually need to be inside here this

537
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,190
could be done above this could be done

538
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:33,190
in the outer layer code and passed down

539
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,529
as sort of the fog cam rail arrays or

540
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,720
something like this right and these clip

541
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:38,920
Rex could be set up that way so this is

542
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,799
actually something that we could pull

543
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,240
out and probably should pull out into a

544
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:44,409
separate piece of code so that's just

545
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,730
worth

546
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,460
thinking about there because for example

547
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,099
these like push clip threat calls those

548
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,769
are something that we only would be able

549
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:56,199
to get if we actually had a render group

550
00:23:53,769 --> 00:24:04,869
itself so you know we're really looking

551
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:06,309
at something more like this where if

552
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:07,779
somebody told us we were going to have a

553
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,929
render group then we could do something

554
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:14,769
with it but otherwise we can't so

555
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:16,960
looking at this rendered group there's

556
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:18,609
some usage of it the next time we get to

557
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,019
it we come back down in here where we're

558
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:22,449
sort of doing this entity transform

559
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:25,839
stuff and my assumption is that all of

560
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:28,120
this can be sort of removed because

561
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,299
remember this is all just like for

562
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:34,029
sorting and for you know aggregates and

563
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:36,399
all that sort of stuff all of this stuff

564
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:39,460
is just for drawing there's nothing else

565
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,519
that happens in here at all as far as i

566
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,309
know so really all of that stuff can

567
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,529
just be kind of moved inside of a giant

568
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:50,200
if statement that says don't do any of

569
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:52,960
the render work if somebody isn't asking

570
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,910
us to render at this time and the same

571
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,710
thing would be true down here right so I

572
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,060
think that's pretty much all we would

573
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:05,170
need to do let me go ahead and

574
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:08,649
reorganize this particular call to have

575
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:11,830
the update and render entities to have

576
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:13,240
the order of parameters reflect the new

577
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:16,179
order of parameters where I just kind of

578
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,200
was arranging things there so we've got

579
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:22,600
the dt comes here then we've got render

580
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,049
group camera p draw buffer background

581
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:31,689
color assets mass p and the same now is

582
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:34,659
true for see here update and render

583
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,970
world is calling update and render sim

584
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,420
region which is right here that's going

585
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,009
to translate this world mode and the sim

586
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,620
bounds those are the things that are

587
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:51,220
actually passed then we have the render

588
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:57,479
group screen bounds the game state the

589
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,480
background color is actually before that

590
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:07,918
so background color screen bounds game

591
00:26:03,098 --> 00:26:12,578
state input render group and drama fur

592
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,839
so there you go and now if i run this I

593
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:16,808
should get exactly same thing I was

594
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:20,138
getting before and I believe if we want

595
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:26,319
to we could turn off rendering so let's

596
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:29,828
just try that and see if we can do it so

597
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,838
we'll just call update we know we only

598
00:26:29,828 --> 00:26:33,969
need these things so I'm just going to

599
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:38,048
call like with nothing for the

600
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:40,450
background color with rectangle I don't

601
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:43,509
know well I mean I guess it doesn't

602
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:48,459
matter what I pass here but you know 0

603
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:50,409
for the game state 0 for the input 0

604
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:52,359
under group and 0 for the draw buffer

605
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:58,239
now there is one place we're going to

606
00:26:52,358 --> 00:27:03,098
have to fix and that is that I inside we

607
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:06,278
have to if on the input inside the brain

608
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:08,528
because we didn't in here there is one

609
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:10,538
person who does that you can kind of see

610
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:13,929
that we have this place for the game

611
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:19,328
state and the input get hughes and so

612
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:21,639
that part is not going to work anything

613
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:23,469
that references the input is not going

614
00:27:21,638 --> 00:27:25,358
to work so if i take a look at ups

615
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:27,190
that's not what I wanted if I take a

616
00:27:25,358 --> 00:27:31,749
look at where controller is being used

617
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:35,950
at the moment I think it's really only

618
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:39,069
in just this one preamble where we set

619
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,649
everything right and I think we can

620
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:48,009
probably just do an if around that and

621
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:51,488
have that go away now granted I don't

622
00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:53,348
know that we really need it too because

623
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:56,499
you know this is only going to happen in

624
00:27:53,348 --> 00:27:58,569
a circumstance where you're simulating

625
00:27:56,499 --> 00:28:02,469
something that should be allowed to be

626
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:05,168
controlled so you know we could just

627
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:07,619
always pass the game state and the input

628
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:07,619
I

629
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,140
that's a tough that's a tough call but

630
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,939
i'm going to go ahead and do it anyway

631
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,390
because i think we probably want to

632
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,580
eventually get it kind of separated out

633
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:30,250
so i'm just going to go ahead and try

634
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:32,829
that all right so we want to d sword why

635
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,109
do we clear d sword if it's already

636
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:38,079
cleared like it's cleared here it

637
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:40,750
doesn't get set to anything so I have no

638
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:44,740
idea what that's for I don't pretend to

639
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:47,859
know old code so I'm going to do if

640
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,019
input around this and then I'm just

641
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:53,289
going to kind of go through here and see

642
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:55,839
if I can move all of this stuff in word

643
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:59,789
so that now it's not actually able to

644
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:03,909
access it and it looks like we've got a

645
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:16,089
couple things from the con hero that our

646
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:23,290
control information and so yeah so I

647
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:29,049
think for those I think we just want to

648
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:30,730
sort of nullify them out right I mean I

649
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:37,379
think what we want to do here is we've

650
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:37,380
got a handmade h oops

651
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:49,619
for this sort of thing I think we just

652
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:54,029
want to go like hey all right there's a

653
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,029
cleared one of these that you can use

654
00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,279
that just has everything set to nothing

655
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:02,970
and then when you come in here will

656
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:06,009
actually set it if there actually is one

657
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:08,230
you know what I'm saying and then

658
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:13,539
everything else can proceed as as

659
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:15,819
planned I think that should work all

660
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:17,409
right so now in what we're going to do

661
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:18,849
now is just kind of go through and clean

662
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,800
up anything where we were referenced or

663
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:23,969
something we didn't have so in this case

664
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:35,289
like we've got the mouse p situation

665
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:37,180
happening so that's in here and what I

666
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,339
want to do is just say well okay you

667
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,350
know don't set it to anything if you

668
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:43,349
can't write if you don't have an input

669
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:56,699
then you don't see if we got anything

670
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,700
else

671
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:06,940
um what there I was like that's a weird

672
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,310
place to give me that error because

673
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:14,860
that's actually where the error is but

674
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:16,960
okay so here's an input dt4 frame is

675
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:19,539
getting called here and of course in

676
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,819
updating render sim region that input

677
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:23,529
dt4 frame is not something that we

678
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:27,970
actually have because so what we really

679
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:33,549
want here is we want that DT for the sim

680
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:36,720
to be passed directly to us oops because

681
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:39,460
we don't know if we have an input right

682
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,690
and that way we can kind of get rid of

683
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:49,059
this and then down in here when we

684
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:51,150
actually call it will just pass that

685
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,149
along

686
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,549
so now I think we're in good shape

687
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,350
because right we shouldn't be seeing

688
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:09,450
anything right because we've passed 02

689
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:13,069
the sim but it still should be

690
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:18,569
simulating everything in theory

691
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:21,539
unfortunately I guess does that mean we

692
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:28,980
exit because we didn't set heroes exist

693
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:31,289
to anything yes I suppose it does so we

694
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,599
will automatically exit because it never

695
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:37,859
triggered the like add a hero piece of

696
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,449
code uh well so that's okay I mean this

697
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:42,000
is just for testing purposes so in

698
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,580
theory that's all fine so now all we

699
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,500
have to do is simulate some other region

700
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:48,960
that is not the same region that we were

701
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,910
going to simulate before so you know now

702
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,890
we've got two sims that are happening in

703
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:55,350
fact if we did this the game should run

704
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,850
at double speed right if I simulate it

705
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:59,730
once and then stimulate it again I

706
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:01,349
should get a double update so everything

707
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,390
should move twice as fast in theory

708
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:15,719
right or something weird like this

709
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:19,340
should happen weirdly enough I i I'm not

710
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,339
even really sure what that is doing

711
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,240
can't say I know whether that's what I

712
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:34,229
would have expected or not because I'm

713
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,990
kind of just doing something random here

714
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:40,150
but I would have expected it to simulate

715
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,740
them again and they didn't look like

716
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,960
they were going twice as fast which is

717
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:47,048
weird so I'm not sure what happened

718
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:49,210
there that seems a little odd doesn't it

719
00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:50,769
I mean it seems like that should have

720
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,079
the little hopper guys should have

721
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:54,579
hopped twice as fast I'm not surprised

722
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,019
that I can't move because I would be

723
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:57,668
getting cleared so I'd only be able to

724
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:59,679
do a little bit of motion before I would

725
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:04,330
get cleared by the next pass through who

726
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,769
didn't have an input call but yeah it

727
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:08,409
seems like those guys should have been

728
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:18,398
hopping faster I guess let's double

729
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:23,440
check something does this play twice as

730
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:26,230
fast yes it does so we do know that our

731
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,820
dt per frame can be doubled and we'll go

732
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,659
twice as fast so I would have expected

733
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,519
if I did this that I would end up doing

734
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:36,039
two sim steps which should have made

735
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:39,128
everything run twice as fast but it did

736
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:45,070
not do that at least not that I could

737
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:50,409
perceive Oh although since we're running

738
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:59,559
too slowly with two of the sim steps let

739
00:34:50,409 --> 00:35:01,900
me see if this makes a difference there

740
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:06,699
we go alright so it did do it did do

741
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:09,160
that disaster narrowly averted so I

742
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:11,349
wonder what is actually why it was

743
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,839
running so much more slowly when we ran

744
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,279
it twice let's take a look in D because

745
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,840
it doesn't run that it doesn't really

746
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,630
run much slower when we're not when

747
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:23,019
we're in a release mode I'm curious who

748
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:25,180
is taking up that time Oh get closest

749
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:28,780
reversible of course the UNAC celebrated

750
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:29,710
N squared disaster of it all some point

751
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,300
we're going to have to do something

752
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,019
about that it's an easy thing to do

753
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,019
something about but

754
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:42,329
alright so I think that's really all we

755
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:44,970
needed to do to do to sim things for

756
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:47,369
frame we could also choose if we want to

757
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:52,798
to do sin without input so I could avoid

758
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:56,430
passing in the input but still do a sim

759
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:58,650
and a render I think and if I do that

760
00:35:56,429 --> 00:36:01,588
what I could say is like okay when we do

761
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,509
an update and render sim region let's

762
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:06,389
give it a sim bounds that's not the sim

763
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:11,608
bound we're currently at so let's call

764
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:25,308
this sim bounds to write and i'm going

765
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:29,179
to go ahead and say that sim bounds

766
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:29,180
drive an offset call

767
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:45,538
mmm yeah I do I'm going to offset the

768
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:48,149
sim bounds by something so let's say

769
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:53,429
that I'm going to offset the sim bounds

770
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:56,219
by like you know 100 meters in that

771
00:36:53,429 --> 00:37:03,059
direction for some reason don't ask me

772
00:36:56,219 --> 00:37:06,418
why and then I'm going to go up here and

773
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:10,319
I'm going to say all right a mr. camera

774
00:37:06,418 --> 00:37:17,239
person let's use the debug camera let's

775
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:19,739
zoom out a ways and I really need this

776
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:22,679
debug you I do not be quite so bad as it

777
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:25,499
is but now we should be getting in there

778
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:28,499
we have it is to separate simulating

779
00:37:25,498 --> 00:37:30,208
regions that we can see both of right so

780
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:32,639
there's one region that's being

781
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:35,418
simulated and here's another region

782
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:38,338
that's being simulated by the sim call

783
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:40,108
which is exactly what I wanted and so

784
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:44,219
you can see that this is relatively easy

785
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:49,078
thing for us to have work it's it's

786
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:50,400
pretty straightforward but I like I said

787
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:53,189
it gets problematic when these things

788
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,909
overlap and maybe there's things we can

789
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:58,168
do to kind of fix that I don't know we

790
00:37:56,909 --> 00:38:00,989
got to kind of think about it a little

791
00:37:58,168 --> 00:38:05,908
bit harder but at least for part of the

792
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:07,918
way there now so yeah I think that's

793
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,119
about it all I want to do today we're

794
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:17,038
going to start in on some more heavy

795
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:19,880
lifting on that front next week so let's

796
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,880
go ahead and go to the QA

797
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,210
f1 aw did you make that debug you by

798
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,230
yourself yeah that's why it's kind of

799
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:39,519
clunky like we didn't when we made it we

800
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,068
were kind of playing around with data

801
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,139
structure stuff a bunch and doing some

802
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:45,789
things you know that are cool and all

803
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:49,239
but we didn't spend any time on the

804
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:52,630
actual widget miss of it all so it's

805
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:54,159
kind of super lousy and it wouldn't take

806
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,260
very long to go in and fix it and I

807
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,480
probably should budget a couple days

808
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:04,319
just go in and make some nice widgets

809
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,318
you know for it but

810
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:15,559
Nicola have you thought about

811
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,150
refactoring your brain code to make use

812
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:18,739
of virtual method switch statements on

813
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:22,910
type is basically replicating the type

814
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:24,889
system a bit of the code smell so I mean

815
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:27,619
as you may have predict I strongly

816
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:29,509
disagree with that opinion my opinion is

817
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:34,309
that virtual methods are the one that

818
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:36,140
smell and that switches are correct the

819
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:39,529
reason that I believe that is twofold

820
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:41,960
one is because I believe that if

821
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:44,690
fundamentally speaking C++ as virtual

822
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,360
system and inheritance are designed and

823
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:51,110
properly so even if you were going to go

824
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,490
that route you would not want to do it

825
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:55,460
the way that they do it and the reason

826
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:57,559
for that is because the identification

827
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,900
of a type as being the type that it is

828
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:02,840
is a first class citizen in programming

829
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:06,440
and also in actual math in like group

830
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,809
theory and stuff c++ fundamentally

831
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,000
doesn't allow that they have a very like

832
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:13,400
shoddy rtti system that doesn't even

833
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,400
have your you are not even able to

834
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:19,400
define what the values are four types so

835
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,490
you can't say this particular derived

836
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,320
class is considered type you know 37 or

837
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:25,669
something this but that's critically

838
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,110
important it's critically important

839
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,990
because you need it in order to be able

840
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,690
to do save and restore and communicating

841
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:34,459
between your program compiled on one

842
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,650
compiler and another version compiled on

843
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,929
another compiler like let's say ps4 is

844
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,880
llvm and your pc version is you know

845
00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:47,719
msvc there are TT I wouldn't necessarily

846
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,039
even have to agree with itself although

847
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:50,809
i don't know maybe these days they

848
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,699
expect it to do so in the old days it

849
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:56,210
didn't but even simple things like that

850
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:58,369
just don't work right so first of all I

851
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,720
I think yeah virtual methods are the

852
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:01,420
ones that I think are really

853
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,679
questionable I don't like them at all

854
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,740
secondly switch statements are actually

855
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,960
way more readable in my opinion because

856
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:11,019
they put the code that does the same

857
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,150
thing for each entity in the same place

858
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:17,300
which is what I find more valuable than

859
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:18,950
having the code for an entity included

860
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,510
all the different types of code for

861
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:22,659
entity including one place the reason

862
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,580
for that is I don't tend to change

863
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:27,559
entities in ways or I don't

864
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:30,829
to change subclasses in ways that are

865
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,900
super unique to their layout very often

866
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:36,710
what I tend to do is change the way

867
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:39,019
methods work very often so for example I

868
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,909
may change the way that rendering is

869
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:42,530
happening that means that typically what

870
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:44,960
I'm doing is I'm changing the render

871
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,990
call of all of the entity types or

872
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,809
whatever it is at once so I want all

873
00:42:47,989 --> 00:42:52,609
that code in one place so I can pull out

874
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,960
shared pieces really easily just by

875
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,849
cutting and pasting it up to the top

876
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,710
rather than having to factor that out

877
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:59,329
into a virtual base function which could

878
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,920
call the derive functions and have to

879
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:04,549
make sure that that always happens blah

880
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,200
blah blah blah blah so I would like

881
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,820
strongly challenge anyone who suggests

882
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:10,819
that switch statements have a code smell

883
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,789
to them that to me is very dogmatic I

884
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,100
don't see any factual basis for making

885
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:17,840
that claim it's just it sounds like one

886
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:20,150
of those things that C++ programmers say

887
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,610
but they have no data to back that up

888
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,460
right there like I don't know of any

889
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:28,160
actual evidence that suggests that

890
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,900
somehow a virtual function is cleaner

891
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,670
than a switch statement because all the

892
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,800
evidence that I've ever seen either

893
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:37,490
suggests that their equivalent and just

894
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,289
have different sort of code layout so

895
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,579
depending on what you might be doing one

896
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:42,529
may be better than the other right or

897
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:44,630
did a switch statement is strictly

898
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:47,030
superior because you have a well-defined

899
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:53,260
type you can use that type in other

900
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:53,260
places right so yeah

901
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:22,630
do you use keyword only at your day job

902
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,639
are you faster without the mouse um yeah

903
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:29,260
I don't really like using a mouse very

904
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:31,989
much but I sometimes have to and

905
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,700
sometimes you know a mouse is useful for

906
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:36,969
like picking entities and stuff like

907
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:39,039
that and a lot of times I don't

908
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:41,019
necessarily have good keyboard UI and

909
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,449
things like unfortunately it tends to be

910
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:48,159
a cheaper sometimes to do stuff like

911
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:49,689
coming through and making a quick mouse

912
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:51,339
you buy for something is actually easier

913
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:58,809
than making a good keyboard you I so

914
00:44:51,340 --> 00:45:00,789
that's unfortunate but Nick see i missed

915
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:02,619
the reason the two areas on the screen

916
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:05,469
are discontinuous are these two sim

917
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:07,239
regions of a larger world yes so

918
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:10,119
essentially what we're doing is we're

919
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:12,489
stimulating both of these regions I just

920
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,289
said simulate a region where the where I

921
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:17,109
am right now and then stimulate a region

922
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:20,259
off to the side so if I was let's say

923
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:28,059
let me build in a release here so we're

924
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:33,600
not paying the the the cost there and

925
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:33,599
let me go ahead and pull this guy out

926
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:43,829
for the love of God man I need to fix

927
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:43,829
this somebody really github bug

928
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,550
alright so I'm going to start hopping

929
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:58,410
along right and hopefully you can kind

930
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,850
of see that that simulation region down

931
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:01,529
at the bottom there is just going to

932
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:03,980
keep simulating some part of the world

933
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:10,200
that's kind of like just off to the side

934
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:11,789
right that's all it's doing and at this

935
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:13,859
point now there's nothing in that same

936
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:15,239
region because it's you know there's no

937
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,840
part of the world that happens to

938
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:21,059
overlap that for whatever reason and now

939
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,980
I've gotten down at this point to the

940
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:25,110
area that we were seeing in the same

941
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:30,719
region before i'm now in it right and

942
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:35,670
i'm hopping along you can see me doing

943
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:39,629
it right so hopefully that'll make sense

944
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:41,130
and yet if it will only actually see

945
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,420
anything in the sim region when there is

946
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,800
part of the world that happens to

947
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,750
overlap it which is not necessarily

948
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:52,370
always I can't really see where my guy

949
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,369
is at the moment

950
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:06,539
oh no that's not good look at what

951
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,210
happened to my poor hero he's been sort

952
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:11,039
of stuck he's been stuck in a tree in a

953
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:13,170
horrible accident I assume this is

954
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,610
probably because I hit one of those jump

955
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:19,530
pads which we have not really

956
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:21,120
implemented yet I think I slammed him

957
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,730
into a tree but anyway point being that

958
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,089
is all the separates in region is meant

959
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,090
to be doing

960
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,440
what do you think about changing float

961
00:47:45,088 --> 00:47:48,808
values in the debug system by the

962
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,759
distance you drag example longer drag

963
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:52,109
distance equals bigger increments

964
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:54,298
decrements of the value shorter drive

965
00:47:52,108 --> 00:47:54,989
distance equals smaller increment so

966
00:47:54,298 --> 00:47:58,018
you're talking about basically

967
00:47:54,989 --> 00:48:00,358
acceleration on it meaning like if I

968
00:47:58,018 --> 00:48:02,548
move it a lot I don't just move it by

969
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:03,929
that much more than the little amount I

970
00:48:02,548 --> 00:48:08,068
actually moved by like an exponential

971
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:15,748
amount more if I'm understanding

972
00:48:08,068 --> 00:48:22,038
correctly I I don't know I I guess I'd

973
00:48:15,748 --> 00:48:22,038
have to play with it probably

974
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:10,099
and yeah I definitely don't like see

975
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:13,429
make see make is is real problematic

976
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:15,949
especially on windows it's a little bit

977
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:18,109
better on unix I think probably because

978
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:19,549
it came from unix I would assume I don't

979
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:21,530
really know where it came from but I I

980
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,789
believe that the sort of Windows version

981
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,650
is a bit of an afterthought it doesn't

982
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:26,779
work very well it's got a lot of

983
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:29,269
problems like I had to edit the source

984
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,070
code to see make in order to get llvm to

985
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:33,110
build properly because see make itself

986
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:34,970
didn't have any way of specifying that

987
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:37,490
you didn't want to use dynamic libraries

988
00:49:34,969 --> 00:49:40,669
it was hilarious it's like hard coded

989
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:45,109
into the source it's like ok so there's

990
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:46,670
a bunch of stuff like that likessee make

991
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:50,690
is way worse than just using a batch

992
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:52,610
file in my experience I'm still open to

993
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:55,700
the possibility that like there is a

994
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,769
make system that's good or something but

995
00:49:55,699 --> 00:50:00,230
I've just never seen it is the problem

996
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:02,150
they all seemed like way worse than just

997
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,360
writing in the batch file that does the

998
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,360
build

999
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,769
what books you recommend for c

1000
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:43,019
programming you know i mean the only one

1001
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:44,159
that I really remember is the actual one

1002
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:47,009
that's like the C programming language

1003
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:51,118
the original one the white book by cover

1004
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:53,130
I mean there might be good ones these

1005
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:59,039
days but I don't know what they are it's

1006
00:50:53,130 --> 00:51:01,760
been 25 years since I learned see so I

1007
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,760
have no idea

1008
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:45,989
how about for learning open jail so

1009
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:49,829
those arcs synthesis tutorials are

1010
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:51,509
pretty good I mean you know there's not

1011
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:57,360
a lot of great resources on learning

1012
00:51:51,510 --> 00:52:00,300
modern graphics API is unfortunately but

1013
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:03,480
like it's definitely the case and I'm

1014
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:06,560
going to go ahead and here and rid of

1015
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,559
that for now

1016
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:27,320
handmade network oxus somebody posted

1017
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:36,019
here you go so this this thing here is

1018
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:37,550
pretty good I the the the Ark synthesis

1019
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:39,889
tutorials were like a website that was

1020
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:41,539
like a dopo gel three-point Oh tutorial

1021
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:43,789
site that was that was pretty good like

1022
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:45,440
it covered a lot of stuff and like

1023
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:48,650
showed how to do it in fairly modern

1024
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,530
open jello with like shaders and you

1025
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,030
know was as good at anything that would

1026
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:56,180
be like here's how to write something

1027
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:58,190
that isn't super antiquated I don't know

1028
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:59,779
what else there is available and for

1029
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,269
some reason the arc synthesis tutorials

1030
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,420
got taken down but thankfully somebody

1031
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:07,159
had saved them I guess and now they

1032
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,599
exist here I don't know if this is the

1033
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:14,989
person who actually did it or not but

1034
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:17,690
whoever did it I'm glad they did because

1035
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:20,659
it's something that I thought was pretty

1036
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:23,450
reasonable when I looked at it and it

1037
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:25,659
was a bummer that they kind of went away

1038
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:25,659
but

1039
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:50,860
soy sauce the kid by the way I would

1040
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:56,329
throw in a pitch for n site if you

1041
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:58,700
haven't already taken a look at it this

1042
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:01,250
thing if you're having OpenGL problems

1043
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:09,769
and you have access to an nvidia card of

1044
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:13,340
some kind this tool is really good it's

1045
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:15,769
a little crashy and for understandable

1046
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,450
reasons because they're doing some

1047
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:23,079
pretty unholy stuff with the graphics

1048
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:26,750
card to say the least but this thing

1049
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:30,079
really will help you with OpenGL

1050
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:33,710
debugging like I would highly recommend

1051
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:36,259
using it because it allows you to do a

1052
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:39,920
number of things that you can't normally

1053
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:43,160
do in any real easy way in your own code

1054
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,409
so for example you can step into shaders

1055
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:48,109
and actually inspect variables right and

1056
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:50,719
it kind of works you can look at

1057
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:53,480
textures like for it given shader

1058
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:55,219
invocation you can actually look at what

1059
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,320
textures were bound and what their

1060
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:59,750
images were so you can even see if you

1061
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,860
like your textures are messed up and so

1062
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:03,230
like there's a ton of stuff that

1063
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:05,269
typically you had to do yourself to

1064
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,769
validate these sorts of things when you

1065
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:09,800
were doing graphics card debugging in

1066
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:13,159
the old days and this stuff is really

1067
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:17,630
helpful so if you do have access to an

1068
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:20,239
nvidia card it's pretty great if you can

1069
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:22,220
run something like this because then you

1070
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:27,109
can at least validate your OpenGL code

1071
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:30,500
is working properly on a known platform

1072
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:32,000
and then at least you can know that when

1073
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,500
you're going to run it on whatever L

1074
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,909
because you know maybe the bugs on AMD

1075
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:40,820
or something right at least then you've

1076
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:42,619
taken out part of you know we least you

1077
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,269
know it works on something because

1078
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:45,980
you've debugged on something and then

1079
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:47,509
you're only talking about bugs in that

1080
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,590
specific Hardware whatever you've moved

1081
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,590
to right

1082
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:07,690
I've never tried render doc uh is it

1083
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,689
good

1084
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:17,339
it looks like sort of the same thing

1085
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,340
which is cool

1086
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:31,149
it's cool that it supports all three of

1087
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:37,540
these ap is what version of OpenGL does

1088
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:39,059
it support hmm so this would not really

1089
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:42,579
be something that I could use because

1090
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:51,730
that's a kind of an old version of

1091
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:53,230
OpenGL to a certain extent but but it

1092
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,559
would certainly work for what you were

1093
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:59,349
talking about which is OpenGL ES oh wait

1094
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:07,539
no no immediate plans so no it wouldn't

1095
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:09,940
nevermind all right I'm going to wind it

1096
00:57:07,539 --> 00:57:12,130
down here but yeah I haven't tried that

1097
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,690
one but that's cool if that works too

1098
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:18,700
you could try either one of them right

1099
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:22,079
like whatever one works because they

1100
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:22,079
probably both show similar information

1101
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:41,389
alright thank you everybody for joining

1102
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,650
me from the episode of handmade hero

1103
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:44,389
it's been a pleasure coding with you as

1104
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:46,220
always if you would like to follow along

1105
00:57:44,389 --> 00:57:48,409
series at home you can always prayer to

1106
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:49,819
the game on handmade here org it comes

1107
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:52,219
with the source code so you can play

1108
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,990
around with it we also a forum site you

1109
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:55,849
can go to if you want to ask questions

1110
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:57,349
we have a patreon page and go to France

1111
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:58,940
fourth the video series we have a

1112
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:00,500
schedule bot who treats the schedule at

1113
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,570
you and we have an episode guide you

1114
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:07,730
could use for catching up on old

1115
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:10,970
episodes i will mention i have been

1116
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:16,579
thinking about switching up the format

1117
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:18,769
of handmade hero uh to be in longer

1118
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:21,769
chunks I've been thinking about possibly

1119
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:26,179
instead of doing monday through friday

1120
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:28,039
one hour stream a night with usually

1121
00:58:26,179 --> 00:58:29,719
like maybe one day off on the week you

1122
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:31,550
know I typically do some days I do five

1123
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:35,589
but oftentimes I only do four so it's

1124
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:38,019
about 44 hours a week on average right I

1125
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:43,789
was thinking of actually doing on

1126
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:45,440
saturday and sunday to to our blocks so

1127
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:48,529
that there were longer continuous

1128
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,519
programming blocks especially when we go

1129
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:53,840
through and do the 3d stuff because

1130
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,699
that's definitely going to be something

1131
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,820
where you know maybe we want a little

1132
00:58:55,699 --> 00:59:02,118
more concentrated time to kind of talk

1133
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:05,080
about the math and then implement it in

1134
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:07,880
one episode which would kind of be nice

1135
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:11,389
so I don't know I have been thinking

1136
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:13,608
about that that may happen if that does

1137
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:16,909
happen then probably what we would be

1138
00:59:13,608 --> 00:59:19,039
doing is next week we wouldn't do any

1139
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:20,868
broadcast during the week and then the

1140
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:25,789
Saturday into Sunday we would do two

1141
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:29,030
hours each what on each day to our

1142
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:31,179
Saturday to our sunday if that makes

1143
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,180
sense

1144
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:43,869
but don't quote me on that I haven't

1145
00:59:39,219 --> 00:59:47,139
100% decided yet but it seems like what

1146
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:53,039
I may want to do to do sort of a thicker

1147
00:59:47,139 --> 00:59:53,038
block if that makes sense

1148
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:08,259
all right uh so that's about it I will

1149
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:12,199
sign off for now and like I said maybe

1150
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:13,190
check the tweet bot for more information

1151
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:14,569
about whether we're going to switch to

1152
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,950
it switch up the schedule for a little

1153
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:18,800
while and try it that way and see how it

1154
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:21,379
goes or whether we won't that's about it

1155
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:23,090
for today until I see you all next time

1156
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:25,990
have fun programming and i'll see you on

1157
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:25,990
the Internet take
