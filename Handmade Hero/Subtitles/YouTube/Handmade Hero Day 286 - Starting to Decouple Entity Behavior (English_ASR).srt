00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,239
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,789
Hero the show we code a complete game

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,378
live on stream it is well it's time for

4
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:17,969
us to do probably a little work with our

5
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:21,149
with the way we're working on entities

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:22,410
right now we sort of got movement into a

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,899
place where it was kind of getting

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,698
pretty interesting and we want to kind

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,528
of continue down that road but in more

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,150
of the entity system side of it so today

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,668
I think we're gonna probably look a

12
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:36,929
little more closely at how we're doing

13
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,069
our entity type systems and start to

14
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,988
think a little bit more about what

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,988
that's gonna mean as we go forward so

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:52,739
today is day 286 if you would like to

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,820
follow along at home you want to do two

18
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,589
day 285s

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,320
source code that's what I'm starting

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,730
with today so let's go ahead and boot up

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:13,909
for coder here and and let's open our

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:13,908
project alright so so here we go

23
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:20,489
so essentially what we've got now right

24
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,109
and we and I kind of played around with

25
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,719
this in the Q&amp;A because someone asked

26
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:27,359
about it we have the ability to sort of

27
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,849
generate arbitrary additional little

28
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,799
dudes here right and those are all full

29
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,328
entities with the same motion controller

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,700
and everything else is the hero and all

31
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,828
that sort of stuff and you can start to

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,680
see like one of the things that I guess

33
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:42,599
I should emphasize here is the way that

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,340
engine development and game development

35
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,978
does tend to work is it's it's very

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,659
nonlinear in that way like you saw us

37
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,629
spend a lot of time on like little

38
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,659
detail things you know several days and

39
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:57,420
you know it's ours really so you know I

40
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,140
don't know think to three days of coding

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,149
of full time coding let's say we may

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,799
have spent on just figuring out like how

43
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,840
you know we were gonna place points in

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,179
the world and occupy them you know we

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,409
probably spent five six full days of

46
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,550
coding you know if you took all those

47
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:12,989
hours and put them in there thinking

48
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,100
about how we were going to do like

49
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,840
entity storage and world

50
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,669
storage right and in this course of

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,439
handmade euro which so far is only

52
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,329
probably up to six seven weeks of total

53
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,300
coding if you pack the hours into

54
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,590
regular work weeks that's a huge amount

55
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,460
of the project being spent on those

56
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,870
things right and so but when you start

57
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,790
to look at those at some point they

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,230
start to come together and you can just

59
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,359
do stuff like this where now you've just

60
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:38,009
got you know stuff that sort of becomes

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,420
an autonomous system where it's like oh

62
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,129
I just want more of these and I threw

63
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:43,079
them in there and and that sort of stuff

64
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:45,840
and that's sort of the curve that we're

65
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,260
kind of going to see unfold probably

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,759
over the next you know a hundred coding

67
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,469
days of handmade heroes the next hundred

68
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,899
hours or whatever it's things will start

69
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:57,270
to ramp up quite a bit and so you'll

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,500
start to see things slowly get into that

71
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,540
because we're kind of like right at the

72
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,490
cusp of that curve where all of a sudden

73
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:05,489
it starts to shoot up and adding things

74
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,930
now no longer is just oh I did X amount

75
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,129
of work for X amount of pay back it's

76
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,180
like I did X amount of work for x

77
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,079
squared I'm going to pay back and it

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,520
starts to be kind of good right uh so

79
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,140
that's that's really where we're

80
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,120
starting to go and I and I feel like you

81
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:19,649
know being able to spawn people it's

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,300
kind of just a simple example of that

83
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,530
right but we've still got a bunch of

84
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,700
things like for example these guys are

85
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,050
caught inside each other right now

86
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,069
because we still have the old collision

87
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,450
stuff which doesn't really know what

88
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,919
it's doing and isn't particularly

89
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:31,649
logical for the stuff that we're working

90
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,229
on right now and we also have like a

91
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,480
bunch of other stuff like we need to

92
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,340
figure out our Z stuff correctly so it's

93
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,019
a few things that we really have to go

94
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,030
through before we're it free and clear

95
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,430
but we're definitely starting to get

96
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,770
there so one of the things that I want

97
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,219
to take a look at now is I want to start

98
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,960
to get a little bit more of a sense of

99
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:54,270
how the entity system comes together and

100
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,930
so what I'd like to do is if start to

101
00:03:54,270 --> 00:04:01,469
try and break down some of these type

102
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,840
based operations that we're doing in the

103
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:06,419
entity system so in other words right

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,129
now what you see us doing in the NA

105
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,199
system is is we basically special-case

106
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,060
everything by the type of entity so even

107
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,089
for example the way that we know how to

108
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,579
draw the little hero dude here right is

109
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,649
because we created an entity that had a

110
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,258
type of hero head and an entity that had

111
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:27,168
a type of hero body and those two things

112
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:29,900
are used in multiple places to determine

113
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:31,668
how it's controlled and how it moves and

114
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,168
that's not a bad thing

115
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:34,909
there are plenty games whose energy

116
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:36,709
systems work exactly that way and that's

117
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,720
not a problem so you know if you're

118
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,310
doing it that way that's great and

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,979
certain games where the entities are

120
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,500
very specific and each entity is

121
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:47,060
supposed to be very unique and very

122
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,970
different from all the other entities

123
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,740
that's totally the you know the

124
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,120
reasonable solution is just to write the

125
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,189
code for each of the entities that you

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,509
want and off you go and you can still

127
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,829
share like through functional

128
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:00,560
decomposition you can still share the

129
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:03,769
things that they use but in this game we

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,780
want a more of a continuous feel meaning

131
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,728
yes we want lots of very different and

132
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,529
interesting entities in the game but we

133
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:12,258
don't want those to be isolated points

134
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:14,149
in space we rather want the full concept

135
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,000
of entities to encompass everything

136
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:20,418
between those so everything from you

137
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,370
know this hero through to a boss monster

138
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:23,689
rather than just having hero and boss

139
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,490
monster we want to be able to say like

140
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:27,800
what's the thing that's halfway between

141
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,728
the hero on the boss master or a quarter

142
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,319
of the way between here on the boss

143
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:33,110
monster and that's what right we want to

144
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,658
be able to sort of think about this sort

145
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,069
of very very varied space of like lots

146
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:38,418
of different permutations that are

147
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:41,209
scattered throughout the possibility

148
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:43,430
space so that the game has a lot of rich

149
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:46,038
sort of texture to it in that gameplay

150
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,800
sense and again this kind of comes more

151
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:52,189
from you know sort of the roguelike

152
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,020
tradition of games not the zelda side

153
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:55,788
because you know like I often say it

154
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,370
sort of we want to kind of combine those

155
00:05:55,788 --> 00:06:01,158
sorts of things and that rogue alike

156
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,158
side is very much about not having all

157
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:07,339
these hard-coded specific entities but

158
00:06:04,158 --> 00:06:09,829
rather having hard coded little chunks

159
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:11,089
that assemble to create entities so that

160
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,109
they could be assembled in a different

161
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,359
way to create a different entity or

162
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,949
remove from one entity to make it to

163
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,680
turn it in to another end of your added

164
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,629
to an ad to give it that ability right

165
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,180
and so that's what I wanted to start

166
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,459
looking at today just because I feel

167
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,139
like now might be a good time to sort of

168
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,779
play with that a little bit I just get

169
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,879
that sense so what I want to do is take

170
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:34,399
a look at this entity type field and

171
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,779
start to think about if we want to start

172
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:45,589
to eliminate the actual use of this type

173
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:53,429
field what would we do right

174
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:56,549
so for example let's say we would now

175
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,730
like to have some other enemies in the

176
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,850
game which we we want to completely

177
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:06,210
reuse for all intents and purposes the

178
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:09,180
code for our hero and make them and

179
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:13,979
those two entities or couple and is

180
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,900
going to be an enemy whose movement

181
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,600
whose whose looks just like the hero

182
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:21,799
he's like the evil version of the hero

183
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:25,650
looks and moves just like the gyro but

184
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,199
he or she whatever it is the specter it

185
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:30,689
perhaps the evil whatever manifestation

186
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,329
of the hero but it has some kind of an

187
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:35,430
AI thing on it which causes it to jump

188
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,769
around attack the hero so instead of

189
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,449
using controller as an input it uses

190
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,799
some kind of artificial intelligence or

191
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:45,120
or it just walks around it doesn't even

192
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,668
matter something that is not what that

193
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,490
does not wait for keyboard input right

194
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:52,769
to move around another one would be a

195
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,900
floating head and it uses the exact same

196
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:57,509
code for the hero head only there's no

197
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,788
body another one would be just the body

198
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:03,060
right it hops around but doesn't need a

199
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:04,918
head to tell it where to do so right so

200
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,689
even just with a code we have for the

201
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,909
hero which is very little code right

202
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:10,500
it's like you know 50 lines of code we

203
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,550
wrote for that of something 100 lines of

204
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,740
code I don't know how many but very

205
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,240
little you can already see how in theory

206
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,860
we could have created a number of

207
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,720
entities right if you start to think

208
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,759
about different a ie controls of them

209
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,960
you could have dozens of entities like

210
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,879
different head monsters different

211
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,889
whatever that are all basically doing

212
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,139
you know that underlying code but right

213
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,879
now in our system that's would not be

214
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,168
obvious how we would do that right we'd

215
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,460
have to actually go in and change this

216
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:37,740
video what I want to look at in terms of

217
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,479
pushing the system towards that more

218
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,349
decoupled state where things are very

219
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,209
piece pieced together is what would I do

220
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,980
to start getting me to a place where

221
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:49,549
that would have just been trivial and

222
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,019
you can see that pay since entities

223
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:52,278
just have all this information in them

224
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,769
we've already done the thing where we're

225
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:55,939
just kind of doing the flat entity and

226
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,980
then we'll look at compressing it down

227
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,500
later we don't have a problem with the

228
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,230
data so creating the data for those

229
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,299
other entity types that we want would be

230
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,528
trivial right it just created entity and

231
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:08,539
it's already got we know it as the data

232
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:10,820
so we don't run until you the C++

233
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,349
nastiness of like having to like

234
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,459
decouple class hierarchies or

235
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,409
we did this wrong thing that's like

236
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:17,299
we're not gonna have any of that problem

237
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,740
because if the data is already flat and

238
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,240
so that'll just work no matter what

239
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,320
combination of things we want it to do

240
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,139
right but this type field is still

241
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,019
serving oh it's it's this type field is

242
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:31,730
still very much C++ object-oriented

243
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,190
nastiness in a lot of ways right

244
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,170
that type field is like saying this is a

245
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,110
particular instance of this particular

246
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:41,269
class of entity which really prevents us

247
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,850
from being able to do those mixing

248
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,190
things in exactly the same way that it

249
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,509
is difficult in C++ to do them right or

250
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,769
I shouldn't obviously reporting

251
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:52,059
receivable so I I guess I mean where the

252
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:54,889
C++ class interface inheritance model

253
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:56,299
which I already said I don't like so I

254
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:04,750
don't want that how do we get rid of

255
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:07,250
that well first things first

256
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:10,458
what I'd like to start by doing is

257
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,549
saying well we know that this movement

258
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:15,409
mode already exists in a sort of finite

259
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:17,419
state machine quote unquote kind of a

260
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,889
context where we have two types of

261
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,990
movement that an NV could be doing

262
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,699
planted we're standing one place or

263
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,230
hopping where it's going from one place

264
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:30,350
to another via a hop so the way in which

265
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,199
you might be moving is already has a

266
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:36,800
state variable so the fact that I have

267
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:39,919
coupled that ability to use that state

268
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,708
variable to the entity type is clearly a

269
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:46,370
mistake right I could just not do that

270
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:48,379
and then all entities could have had a

271
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,839
planted and hopping motion and any

272
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:53,480
entities that want more motions can go

273
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,079
in there right so that's the first way

274
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,329
we can start to attack that entity type

275
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,479
problem is by saying instead of having a

276
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,679
type that says what type is the entity

277
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,570
let's

278
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:07,569
focus on the parts we actually care

279
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:10,330
about and make those have identifier x'

280
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,950
right so saying what is the actual code

281
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,620
differences that I actually care about

282
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:17,290
at a lower level let's make those have

283
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,330
them and lo and behold we already did

284
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:21,159
that as part of the implementation so

285
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,649
really this first part is just going to

286
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:26,588
be an exercise in getting things off of

287
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:30,278
the type variable when they didn't need

288
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:34,300
to be there in the first place right so

289
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:39,700
let's start by trying that and we'll see

290
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:41,620
what unfolds so if I go into world mode

291
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,810
here and I take a look at the movement

292
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,769
mode and where that's being used and you

293
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,708
know what I'm gonna go over here I

294
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,659
always start for coder starts you in

295
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,799
this window or rather my for coder

296
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,088
config starts you in this window I

297
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,708
probably should make a start in the

298
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,589
other window for no reason other than

299
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:59,289
since this is a stream and the head my

300
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:01,270
head is down in the lower right hand

301
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:03,039
corner it probably would make more sense

302
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:07,028
to start so that I'm on the side that's

303
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:09,730
not obscured but anyway so looking at

304
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:11,528
the movement mode we can kind of see

305
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,209
here that there's a bunch of information

306
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:15,338
that's going on a bunch of things that

307
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:17,500
are happening but the movement mode what

308
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:22,480
if we were to just pull those out so

309
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:24,250
that they weren't actually in the inside

310
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,778
the switch statement right like doing

311
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,159
the very most simple possible thing

312
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:33,338
could I just move this out so that it

313
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:36,449
wasn't in the switch at all right could

314
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:40,360
I do that so let's start by trying that

315
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,400
and and let's see here

316
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,259
we've got what have we got here teeth

317
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,730
rest this whole thing so let's take a

318
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:49,299
look at this whole thing here the hero

319
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,220
body code right you can see here that if

320
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:54,429
the if the movement moves planted we pin

321
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,290
it to its occupying square right we we

322
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:57,879
take a look at this head Delta and that

323
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:59,528
head Delta thing that's obviously a

324
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:03,669
little bit specific two paired entities

325
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:06,850
right but the rest of this isn't so much

326
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:09,069
right like all of this it's really just

327
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,870
that Bob amount that has to do with the

328
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,640
head distance here it looks like the t

329
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,320
head distance it's really just that bob

330
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,750
amount that's happening inside planted

331
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,820
that's really it

332
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,669
and you can see that that hopping in

333
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,220
general doesn't really require the head

334
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:25,379
at all so I think what I'm going to

335
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,960
start by doing right is I'm gonna try to

336
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:32,250
take this out and see if I can make this

337
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,960
be its own sort of idea here and and if

338
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,029
you're thinking in the back of your head

339
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,370
well you know this does look like the

340
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,990
sort of thing Kaycee that you might want

341
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,779
to pull out to a separate function I

342
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,220
agree with you but not quite yet it's a

343
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,439
little bit premature to do so so we're

344
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,790
gonna leave it in line for now but you

345
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,560
can see that that is kind of a thing

346
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:51,899
that might be primed for pulling out

347
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,549
into something so it's easy to see what

348
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,100
it you know it doesn't have to it makes

349
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,569
make it easier to read so I'm just going

350
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,290
to make a note instead of making it a

351
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:04,910
function for now and I'm going to say

352
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:08,730
handle the end of these movement mode

353
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:09,809
and here we go with that and then we're

354
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,149
just going to go ahead and compile it

355
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:14,969
and see what our effectively our

356
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,519
problems are if you will so down here

357
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,460
you can see that we've kind of got this

358
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:22,740
computation for T Bob and B T Bob and

359
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,080
that sort of stuff and so what I kind of

360
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,830
want to do there is take that out and

361
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,810
and put it down in here right and what

362
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,670
you can see with these equations you're

363
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,349
like well you know everyone now is gonna

364
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:35,370
be using this DT Bob well maybe we're

365
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,200
gonna call that a slightly different

366
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,139
thing that has to only do with movement

367
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,960
but even so what we could do here is

368
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:45,689
notice that our we can have a DT Bob

369
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,450
which is like you know movement mode you

370
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,610
know inert or immobile or something like

371
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,440
this and that could just not set

372
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,529
anything right that could that could do

373
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,120
nothing at all if that makes sense and

374
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:01,949
so I could go into our entity structure

375
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,350
let's go here where we're sort of

376
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,759
defining these movement modes and I

377
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,500
could make the default movement mode

378
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,350
that you're just not doing anything at

379
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,519
all right you're not bobbing you're not

380
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,040
stretching you're not doing anything

381
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,600
you're just completely immobile and so

382
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,189
for something like a tree which which

383
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,050
never does any movement it doesn't even

384
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:22,110
think about movement you know it could

385
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:24,539
have something like that and and and

386
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,080
wouldn't ever set DDT Beauty Bob

387
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,719
although now that I think about it

388
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,889
you know maybe I'll just won't even do

389
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,180
that and just say that that's planted

390
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,039
for now because if you look at planted

391
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,689
it only only was doing something when

392
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,519
there was a head involved and a tree

393
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,080
would not have a corresponding entity

394
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,269
that's like a linked part to it in any

395
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,810
particular way so it seems to me like

396
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,069
that's probably okay right so let's just

397
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:48,259
leave that out of the out of the

398
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,300
situation for now so let's go ahead and

399
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:52,399
rebuild and you can see that our primary

400
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:54,829
problem here again is that this part

401
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,299
isn't really set up for working if

402
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,129
there's no heads so let's not try to

403
00:15:56,299 --> 00:16:00,709
solve that just yet let's just go ahead

404
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,759
and comment it out and make sure that

405
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,360
we're okay

406
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,980
when we run okay so now you can see what

407
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,169
we've done essentially we have exactly

408
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,909
the same code running and we just don't

409
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:13,009
have the extra bobbing motion that was

410
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:15,559
happening before but we have most of it

411
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:17,809
right but when it's planted and you

412
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,419
stretch it doesn't go down I think was

413
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:24,619
the main thing based on it doesn't sort

414
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:26,870
of hunch down so really we have lost

415
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,360
nothing and one of the nice things about

416
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:33,259
this is it applies to you know all of

417
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,539
the entities in the system with no

418
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,399
deleterious effects except for one right

419
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:40,189
and of course you may have missed it but

420
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,990
I'll show you again well this guy right

421
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,360
here you notice goes off into the middle

422
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,180
of nowhere well why is that that's

423
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,730
because the DT Bob like this this whole

424
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:54,769
equation right is entirely predicated on

425
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,860
that DT Bob meaning sort of the

426
00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:00,559
springiness of the characters motion and

427
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:03,409
we were using that bobbing motion to

428
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,049
actually control the floaty thing right

429
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:09,079
it's got this entity you know T Bob here

430
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:12,319
right so it's kind of getting added to

431
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,539
the position using that increasing

432
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,829
timing value and so those two things

433
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:21,529
kind of conflict right now I don't

434
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,838
really know exactly how we want to

435
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:25,759
proceed here and the main reason for

436
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,440
that is the floaty thing is kind of a

437
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,579
one-off and I don't really even know

438
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:35,450
what it means or should be so I don't

439
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:38,480
have much of an opinion about what that

440
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,029
really value like what I want to do here

441
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,890
right so you know

442
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:47,379
for now we could even just say let's not

443
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,850
bother supporting this guy at you know

444
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,980
at the moment and it's just another

445
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:53,359
point temporarily and we can sort of

446
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,860
look at that in a second when we think

447
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,069
about how we might want that to work in

448
00:17:54,859 --> 00:18:00,469
reality right but either way you get the

449
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:02,389
point which is that we need to now make

450
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,579
solid definitions for things we don't

451
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,990
want something called t-bob because we

452
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:08,419
don't really know what that actually

453
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,099
ever means right we need to have solid

454
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,470
definitions of our variables so that

455
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:13,969
everyone can share them and again this

456
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,370
is not a deficiency of the system it's

457
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,890
actually a strength meaning the goal of

458
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:21,379
the system is to make single variable

459
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,120
points inside the entity for single

460
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,010
specific things of meaning so that

461
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,959
everyone can share them and build richer

462
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:30,589
interactions that build on top of them

463
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,200
right and the example here is like if we

464
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:35,750
have a value that's about how the bounce

465
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,759
is happening then other things can start

466
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,069
to tie in to that bounce value for other

467
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,379
reasons and that's what starts to make

468
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:44,119
the entity system rich and create a

469
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,430
variety of interactions that are

470
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,429
interesting which is what we want

471
00:18:52,390 --> 00:19:00,288
okay so I'm gonna put it to do in here

472
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,819
because I do want to think about this

473
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:03,740
later I just don't know what it means

474
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:07,119
right now but platforms you know we'll

475
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:13,190
want to sort of support so think about

476
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:20,569
what this stuff actually should mean or

477
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:22,308
does mean or will mean right okay so now

478
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:24,139
let's take a look at the more pressing

479
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:27,500
problem which is that these entities are

480
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,530
paired and there's this concept of the

481
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,058
sort of you know related entity you know

482
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:34,158
like an entity to which you are attached

483
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:37,490
if that makes sense or that you're I

484
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,690
don't I don't want to I don't know what

485
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,538
we'll call that there's just this

486
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,490
concept that entity can be paired such

487
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:45,980
as the head in the body but you could

488
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,960
imagine other things being like that so

489
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,960
you know it's sort of a generic concept

490
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,630
of I have an entity to whom I am paired

491
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,269
and I have a certain behavior towards

492
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,280
that other entity to whom I impaired and

493
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:01,369
I want to you know make sure that I

494
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:03,139
support that right so what I think we

495
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:06,408
want to do there is I think we want to

496
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,870
sort of have a solid notion of what that

497
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:10,730
means so instead of calling this entity

498
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:14,058
reference head we'll call it something

499
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,370
else now what I want to do here before

500
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:20,950
we do anything else is sort of start to

501
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:24,548
create a section or rather a partition

502
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,548
between these two

503
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:34,730
a partition where we start to move

504
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:37,638
things up into the entity structure

505
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:40,970
proper by saying this is something we

506
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:42,528
actually thought about right versus this

507
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,879
is some stuff that we just did while we

508
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:46,339
were prototyping and getting things

509
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:48,168
ready right and so up to this point

510
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:49,999
right we've been basically trying things

511
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,259
out and it's you know being stored

512
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,788
getting the engine running you know

513
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:54,739
doing whatever software rendering all

514
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:55,700
these other things right well now we're

515
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,619
starting to think about this entity

516
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,960
system for real and so now it's time to

517
00:20:57,618 --> 00:21:01,548
start saying when are we gonna actually

518
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,619
lock down variables and say this

519
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:05,450
variable means something and we thought

520
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:06,798
about it and it mean doesn't mean we

521
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,230
can't change it but it's there's a

522
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,759
difference right between one of these

523
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,989
and one of these other ones that we just

524
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,839
got through in there when you know we're

525
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:16,730
just like playing around so I'm gonna

526
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,608
start with by saying the first one that

527
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,690
we really mean perhaps is this one and

528
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:27,638
any reference and the way the way that I

529
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:33,710
think we might do this is to say let's

530
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:37,248
introduce a notion of like almost like a

531
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:40,429
geometry of of these creatures where you

532
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:44,089
can perhaps have some child creatures

533
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:45,649
and a parent creature maybe I mean they

534
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:47,868
don't know exactly how we want to do

535
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:53,238
this but let's just say that we're going

536
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:57,019
to have some notion of of this parent

537
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:58,819
right in any way pairing and I'm not

538
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:00,679
sure how far we want to take that but

539
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,178
I'm just thinking of things like you

540
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,460
know let's say I have some kind of boss

541
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:06,048
monster spider thing and each of its

542
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,239
legs is a separate piece that could

543
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:10,429
detach and sort of like move around or

544
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:14,058
whatever right it's it's there's sort of

545
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:16,639
this may be multiple entities kind of a

546
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:18,918
thing going on there so we're gonna want

547
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:22,459
something like that and the head body

548
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,649
case is a similar situation right the

549
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,509
head is probably the primary concept of

550
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:28,158
the entity meaning that if you still

551
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:30,288
have your head you are still technically

552
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,970
alive I don't know maybe that's not true

553
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:35,450
maybe either/or is alive you're still

554
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,558
technically alive I'm not sure the point

555
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,058
being you've got these these entities

556
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:38,539
and there's sort of this relationship

557
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,639
between them

558
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:43,190
and I think we're gonna see that a lot

559
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,050
and so we want some way of representing

560
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,110
that relatively generically right we

561
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:50,180
don't want to just say this is the head

562
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:51,649
of the creature this is the body we want

563
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,769
to say this is the parent entity and the

564
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,800
only question that I have right now is

565
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:59,359
do we want the notion of multiple parrot

566
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,859
in amis because it seems to me that

567
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,659
we're probably gonna want the notion

568
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:06,949
that I could be paired to multiple

569
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:09,980
entities not just a single entity if

570
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:13,370
that makes sense so I think we would

571
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:17,000
want to and I think what we would want

572
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:21,259
here is the concept that an entity can

573
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:29,559
have some number of paired entities so

574
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:31,849
we would want something like this right

575
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:34,879
where we sort of had the notion that

576
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:36,949
there was some set of parent entities we

577
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,060
know how many there are right and we can

578
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:43,640
sort of loop over them now the thing

579
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:50,839
that I'm not quite sure about obviously

580
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:53,300
is I don't really know whether these

581
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:56,299
paired entities have some kind of a

582
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:58,819
structural thing going on meaning you

583
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:03,049
know when I parent entity with another

584
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:05,119
entity is there some kind of a you know

585
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:06,200
does it is there a meaning to that

586
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,859
pairing

587
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,660
because you know maybe they're sort of

588
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:13,579
maybe and the more I'm saying it seems

589
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,830
like the answer is obviously yes right

590
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:17,359
and so when I attach them to another one

591
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,309
maybe I just have this notion that

592
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,369
they're paired they're linked would be

593
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:23,990
one way of just describing it and maybe

594
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:25,549
like a parent to child link versus a

595
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,309
child the parent link might be a thing

596
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:30,769
you know I don't know but it seems to me

597
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:33,529
like there's a little bit something

598
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,269
going on there and so you know the

599
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:37,490
notion of an entity reference could

600
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:39,829
easily be expanded to have some kind of

601
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,019
an enumerator with it that said what

602
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:43,460
kind of reference actually is this like

603
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,750
what are you trying to say my

604
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,740
relationship to this other object

605
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:52,058
actually is and I don't know like I said

606
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:54,470
this is a little bit premature

607
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:57,410
but that's essentially what we want here

608
00:24:54,470 --> 00:25:00,350
and we're gonna want probably the

609
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,630
ability to make these be as varied as

610
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:05,209
possible meaning we'd like to know that

611
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,800
the the number of entities paired with

612
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,590
the particular entity could be whatever

613
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:14,419
it needs to be and I would suspect that

614
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:17,949
we probably want to have it so that it

615
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,950
could grow dynamically I'm guessing

616
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:28,269
that's my assumption so we would want

617
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:32,269
the ability for this entity reference

618
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:35,058
set here to be as large as we want it to

619
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:36,859
be right and if you want 12 paired in

620
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:39,289
bees or 23 paired entities or something

621
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:41,149
like that that's fine so I don't want to

622
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,379
implement anything with that yet because

623
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:46,220
like I said I haven't thought through it

624
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,230
enough but I want to sort of have I want

625
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,420
to take that and now look and see what

626
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:52,819
happens if I do you know again right the

627
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,539
usage code first kind of thing what

628
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:59,119
would happen if I was to say I can have

629
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:02,599
multiple paired entities so if I come

630
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,339
here to say movement planted and I know

631
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,069
that I've got two this was the code

632
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:10,519
effectively that I wanted to write how

633
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:12,079
would I deal with this fact here you

634
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,150
know what would I do

635
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,419
and you can see that this code is

636
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:20,420
essentially saying however far away the

637
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,820
head was from the body I want that to be

638
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:27,050
how far I crouch down because I'm about

639
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:29,089
to jump or something right and so if we

640
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,879
wanted to maintain that behavior let's

641
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:34,609
say that we had multiple heads or

642
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,200
something right what we would need to

643
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:38,029
know there is what's the behavior

644
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,920
supposed to be when we don't just have

645
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,539
one and there's a couple of different

646
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,150
ones we could do we could look at the

647
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:45,950
average distance away they are right we

648
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,500
could look at the maximum distance away

649
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,789
so whichever one's the farthest we could

650
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,769
look at the minimum distance that's ones

651
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:56,659
away right basically we could use the

652
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:58,369
set of norms norms are I don't even know

653
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,350
why I'm bringing this up

654
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:12,219
you know handmade here it's educational

655
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:19,219
supposed to be education so a norm is

656
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:22,670
essentially like a measure it's sort of

657
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,100
a way of taking something and asking for

658
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:32,000
a way of measuring it and they often

659
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:39,559
have names like the one norm 2 norm 3

660
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,200
norm infinity norm etc and you know

661
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:44,059
there's you know these are often the

662
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,289
Euclidean ones we're talking about right

663
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:46,339
so it's a bunch of terminologies here

664
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,500
like you could someone says the you

665
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:54,829
clinically an infinity norm or something

666
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:56,119
like this right well if we take a look

667
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:57,439
at what these things are you'll see

668
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,089
these in the literature they're really

669
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,920
very simple to understand actually and

670
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:03,919
what they are is they're ways of looking

671
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,410
at values that are when you have more

672
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,640
than one value and you want to take the

673
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:13,310
measure of them you get into like this

674
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,950
situation for example with vectors so

675
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:18,049
you know how we typically have vectors

676
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:20,360
for example in 3d we have an X Y Z

677
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:24,139
vector and oftentimes we've said well

678
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:26,359
let's take the length of the vector and

679
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,220
what did we do when we took the length

680
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:30,049
of the vector right what did we actually

681
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,970
compute well if you remember correctly

682
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,710
we essentially use the Pythagorean

683
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,559
theorem to compute the length right if

684
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,720
you imagine the triangle where we have

685
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,299
you know sort of the X and the y here

686
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,250
and we want this right this is our

687
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:48,889
length we said well the length squared

688
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:50,420
equals x squared plus y squared right so

689
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,710
when we said we wanted to figure out the

690
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,390
length was we said well let's just

691
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,710
square root both sides and we have x

692
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,900
squared plus y squared Square rooted

693
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,730
right and that's how we were computing

694
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,840
the length of say our two-dimensional

695
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,190
vectors and three dimension vectors are

696
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,639
the same it was just plus a Z squared

697
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,960
over here or whatever right so right you

698
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,400
can trivially keep extending this

699
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,230
outwards no matter what your dimensions

700
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:18,870
are it just gets longer

701
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:21,269
so that is actually the two norm right

702
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:23,189
that's actually what that is the length

703
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:25,500
what we were taking here when we say

704
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,450
length is actually the two norm what do

705
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,049
we mean by two norm well the two

706
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:33,569
actually refers to the power because the

707
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:39,000
definition for a norm generally speaking

708
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:43,169
is that the norm whatever it is when we

709
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,210
say say the N norm what we mean is that

710
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:52,340
it equals the enth root whatever that is

711
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:56,880
of the components raised to that power

712
00:29:52,339 --> 00:30:00,829
right so the two norm is the square root

713
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,150
of x squared plus y squared the one norm

714
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:05,909
would just be the values added together

715
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,470
right because it would be the first you

716
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,920
know it would be a non square root

717
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:12,420
basically it'd just be nothing there X

718
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,400
to the first plus y to the first would

719
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,620
just be X plus y that'd be the one norm

720
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,700
right the three norm would be the cube

721
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:23,369
root of x cubed plus y cubed and then

722
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,440
the most mysterious one of them all this

723
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:28,859
one right here which is the infinity

724
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,110
norm is the infinite infinitive whatever

725
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:33,990
you want to call that the infinite root

726
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:38,279
of x to the infinity plus y to the

727
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:40,529
infinity got that done and so let's talk

728
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,910
about these real quick so you're very

729
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:43,829
familiar with the two norm already

730
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,019
that's just what we think of as

731
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:47,759
Euclidean distance that's the typical

732
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,500
notion of distance in Euclidean space

733
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,890
that we're all familiar with that's the

734
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:55,589
two norm the one norm is just the sum

735
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:58,860
that's the sum total of all of the

736
00:30:55,589 --> 00:31:01,349
values right and you use the one norm

737
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:03,240
often in computer graphics as well

738
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:05,099
because for example when you want to

739
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,589
renormalize things like blend weights

740
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:09,119
right you want to normalize the blending

741
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:11,039
equation well you need all the weights

742
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,989
to sum to one so what do you do you

743
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,879
divide by the one norm add all the

744
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:18,599
values divide by that now you know that

745
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,820
everything sums to 1 right so one norm

746
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:23,189
two norms very common three norm not so

747
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:23,759
much infinity norm more common than you

748
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,990
might think

749
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,539
because

750
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:30,269
what happens when you take the infinite

751
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:32,909
route of a sum of infinite powers well

752
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:35,910
the answer is that actually everything

753
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:38,940
but the largest power draw I'm sorry the

754
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:46,650
largest variable drops out so what this

755
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:48,990
actually becomes is max X Y Z so the

756
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:52,290
maximum component of all of your

757
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:56,130
components is the infinity norm so if I

758
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:57,389
had a vector and it was 9 10 3 and I

759
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:00,059
said what's the infinity norm will be

760
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,380
infinity norm is 10 because it's 9 to

761
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,789
the infinite power plus 10 to the

762
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:08,220
infinite power plus 3 to the infinite

763
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:10,079
power to the infinite root now you would

764
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,569
need somebody such as perhaps pseudonym

765
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,269
73 to explain to you the number

766
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:17,730
theoretic basis by which that actually

767
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:19,349
comes out to be the case I don't pretend

768
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,610
to be a math proofs kind of a fellow so

769
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:22,139
I am NOT even going to attempt to tell

770
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,849
you about that it is way out of my area

771
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,100
of expertise I can simply tell you that

772
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:31,500
that is the definition of the infinity

773
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:33,439
norm and leave it at that ok so point

774
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,640
being what I was sort of speaking of

775
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,679
when I sort of threw that as a side and

776
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,240
I thought it might be good in chance to

777
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,820
sort of slip that in as a minor

778
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,870
educational topic so now that you know

779
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:46,049
what people are talking about when they

780
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:49,589
talk about norms in here when we're

781
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:52,950
talking about taking something that

782
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:55,500
expects to operate on one thing and then

783
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,960
we want it to operate on a number of

784
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:00,450
things at the same time but still only

785
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,700
produce one outfit output right if we

786
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,230
wanted to have n copies of this

787
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,269
operation well then we just have a for I

788
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,099
loop right but in this case we still

789
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:09,210
only want we we only have one value that

790
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,480
we're outputting we're still just

791
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:15,480
outputting one value for D DT Bob so we

792
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,058
need some way of actually rephrasing the

793
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,039
equation in terms of multiple inputs but

794
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:21,869
only still produce one output and one

795
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,730
way of doing that again is using a norm

796
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:26,579
on the input so that we're actually just

797
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,500
pre sum you know summarizing the input

798
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,089
down into something that's what we were

799
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,339
originally working with such as length

800
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:36,529
instead of taking just the length of one

801
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:38,720
thing can we now say what is some other

802
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:41,899
measure that would sort of make that

803
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,370
work right and so in this case I'm not

804
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,490
sure but let's say that that's what we

805
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:48,529
were going to do so imagine here we're

806
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,890
going to say paired you know entity

807
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:53,359
index or something like this and we

808
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,750
would say paired entity index is less

809
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:59,509
than paired and the count for the entity

810
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:02,058
that were on and then we would increment

811
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:08,329
that then we would look at which entity

812
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:13,128
that was in the pair identities and we

813
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:15,590
would grab out our pair from that as a

814
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:17,989
pointer if there is something in that

815
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:21,019
slot this you know meaning the slot is

816
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:25,059
valid then we could sort of do the same

817
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:29,690
equations that we were doing here right

818
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:32,898
like so and really the T had distance I

819
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,608
suppose could be clamped at the end so

820
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:36,980
it's only really the head distance part

821
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:41,299
that we're doing here and so we could

822
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:45,139
make this head distance initialize to

823
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:49,750
something go through here and sort of

824
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:53,139
take the that that length notion and

825
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:55,668
then at the end produce some final value

826
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,260
I'm gonna go ahead and maybe just say

827
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,929
let's take the two norm let's take that

828
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,280
that average we already know that we're

829
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:02,419
doing a length operation so instead of

830
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,660
square routing I'll just leave it

831
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,170
squared and then at the very end I will

832
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:08,170
square root it

833
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:18,719
so you can see what I'm doing there I'm

834
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,510
just some you know I'm just summing all

835
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,549
of those up so that as we get them I'm

836
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,020
summing the squares you know just like

837
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,400
the x squared y squared Z squared I'm

838
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:29,940
doing basically the sum of the squares

839
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,119
of the lengths and then I square root

840
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,039
those to get a final head distance then

841
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,740
we go ahead and operate on it like so

842
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,869
and in this case our head distance will

843
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,269
be 0 if there were none so we no longer

844
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:44,220
really have to check separately to see

845
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:48,570
if we had a head because where this loop

846
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:51,480
is effectively that check right so

847
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,430
here's the movement planted code now if

848
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,940
we did not know anything about what we

849
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:59,358
might be paired with and our rule for

850
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,820
how we wanted our bounciness to to work

851
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:06,779
would would have you know would go with

852
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,769
that essentially so there you go so

853
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,830
that's the kind of thing that seems

854
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:12,599
relatively reasonable I don't know again

855
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:14,159
like I think it's maybe a little too

856
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,269
soon to say for sure whether we need

857
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,469
additional things there but you can see

858
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:21,030
that it would be relatively easy to

859
00:36:16,469 --> 00:36:24,000
write things in this fashion because you

860
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,500
know we we can respond to an arbitrary

861
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,940
number of attach entities at this point

862
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,079
and that's the kind of thing that we're

863
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,670
going to be looking to do as much as

864
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,329
possible meaning can we generalize these

865
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:35,159
things up into things that don't require

866
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:36,929
specifics that can work some sort of

867
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,940
more in generalities so that as we get

868
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,889
more permutations of stuff they can

869
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,920
interact with each other in a richer

870
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:45,838
fashion so if I go ahead and compile

871
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,200
that you'll notice that most of my

872
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,570
troubles here now come for the fact that

873
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,059
we no longer have that head entity to

874
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,519
pack and what you'll notice is when

875
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:59,070
we're doing this packing we don't really

876
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:01,739
have that packing operation doesn't

877
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:04,980
really do anything it just does a block

878
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:07,289
copy of the entity over into the sort of

879
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,920
the raw space and so one question that

880
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:14,519
we obviously have now is well what do we

881
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,400
want to do here during this packing in

882
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:19,170
terms of packing down things like this

883
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,059
array right

884
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,650
we the pair identity count part would

885
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:24,630
still pass through just fine but the

886
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,860
this part right here with the pair

887
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:29,019
didn't be pointer that

888
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,360
what we actually want to do is pack that

889
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:36,219
array however many entries there are

890
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,510
into the the chunk right and so now

891
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,849
might be a good time to start to think

892
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:43,150
about that part of the process there are

893
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:45,549
two things that we care about here one

894
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,340
is that we pack and unpack this array

895
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,170
properly using only the amount of space

896
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,309
that's necessary to hold the array right

897
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,670
because remember we could get around

898
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:56,619
this by just going like that but the

899
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,150
idea is that we'll eventually get too

900
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,889
unwieldy it's probably not on - and

901
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,389
really right now but as we up the number

902
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:04,119
of entities and up the number of things

903
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:05,529
in the entities that amount of data

904
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,449
throughput just gets more and more and

905
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,280
more and eventually might lead to

906
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:11,829
constraints on what kind of gameplay we

907
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,269
can have if we're not more judicious so

908
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:14,769
we want to do is say let's only pay for

909
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:17,920
the entities that were - with which we

910
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:24,130
are actually paired and so what we want

911
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,690
to do here is say you know just pack the

912
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,000
number that's actually there and that's

913
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,650
a pretty easy thing to implement with

914
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,690
what we've got right now that wouldn't

915
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,400
take much time - right now what's a

916
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,950
little bit trickier and something that

917
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,639
we haven't really seen yet is what we

918
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:44,079
want to do for essentially growing these

919
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:46,119
arrays over time right because what's

920
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,009
gonna happen is when you first create an

921
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,539
enemy there might be no pair identities

922
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,880
with it and so this pointer could just

923
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:53,380
be 0 later on you're gonna add a pair 10

924
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,119
B and maybe that's a time when you

925
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,690
allocate a little thing temporarily in

926
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,219
this image of store it or whatever but

927
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,050
what's our policy there how do we do

928
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:03,969
with that we essentially now have this

929
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:07,030
notion of a dynamically growing array

930
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:09,250
and we don't really have any way of

931
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,930
dealing with that yet in the system so

932
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,090
how do we how do we want to deal with

933
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:14,859
that right what do we want to do and

934
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,250
what's our policy there there's some I

935
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:22,240
you know people do like you grow by 2x

936
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:23,769
every time or other things like this for

937
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,209
something like the paired MD list I

938
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:27,219
think it's unlikely that you're gonna

939
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,500
have a ton of pair identities all that

940
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:31,269
often so I feel like probably what we

941
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,099
want to do is just allocate in like

942
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,840
blocks of four or something right

943
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:36,639
because the chances of somebody having

944
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,950
you know a hundred pair identities is

945
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,779
fairly low the chances of them having

946
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:44,250
zero one or two pair identities is

947
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:47,079
pretty high so we probably want to

948
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:52,659
optimize for the more simple case

949
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:55,030
they're right all right so let's write

950
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:58,179
this code because like I said I think

951
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,040
it's a good place to do that so the

952
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:01,719
first thing I want to do is I want to

953
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:03,759
take PAC entity into chunk oh and by the

954
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:06,578
way this might be a good time as well I

955
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,740
think we've got about 20 minutes left on

956
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:11,920
the stream here this might be a good

957
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:14,949
time as well to take a look and see if

958
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,780
it's now a good time to move the unpack

959
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:19,239
code over here into handmade world

960
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,800
because my goal is to have all of the

961
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:23,108
packet unpacked stuff happening in

962
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,450
handmade world and then all the sim

963
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:28,179
stuff can happen over in sim region and

964
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:29,919
entity but I'd like the packing to kind

965
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:31,960
of live in a place where we can see it

966
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,849
very clearly what's involved in the

967
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,440
packing and what's not because that's

968
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:40,829
the process we want to sort of

969
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:44,710
systematize and not screw up choosing

970
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:46,269
alright so here's our problem child pack

971
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,829
entity reference head is now an

972
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:50,199
arbitrary number of things that we need

973
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:52,240
to pack again not particularly difficult

974
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:54,159
we know we have to pack some number of

975
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,649
entity references now what's an entity

976
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,649
reference well an entity reference is

977
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:01,869
actually a pointer in an index but guess

978
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,670
what if we're gonna start packing these

979
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:06,280
things we actually don't need to pack

980
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:08,440
the index anymore right

981
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,869
and so what we can start doing here is

982
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,980
saying well we really don't need entity

983
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:17,559
reference anymore right that's not

984
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:22,619
really a thing we can just store entity

985
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:25,088
IDs by themselves and so you know we

986
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,740
when we pack we could leave the IDS in

987
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:28,239
here if we want to carry the IDS through

988
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:30,009
and there might be some valid reasons

989
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,959
why we might want to do that I'm not

990
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,270
100% sure that we will ever need to do

991
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,550
that but basically the the reason that

992
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:39,699
we would that we might need to have that

993
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:45,160
notion is we might need to have entity

994
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:48,578
IDs be things that you can look up and

995
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:51,039
keep even if you're no longer if they're

996
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:52,329
not nearby right because remember the

997
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,269
only things that could translate into

998
00:41:52,329 --> 00:42:01,910
pointers are entities that

999
00:41:53,269 --> 00:42:05,119
actually nearby so we may want to start

1000
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:09,049
to to sort of break that notion right

1001
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:14,150
and so if you have entity reference you

1002
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:15,380
know we may want to make it so that I'm

1003
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:30,170
trying to think of how we want to do

1004
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:41,840
this exactly I guess here's the here's

1005
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:44,619
the general problem if people ever want

1006
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:47,480
to keep track of an entity long term

1007
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:49,309
meaning let's say you know this would

1008
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,219
not be anything that's frame to frame

1009
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:57,079
simulation but let's say we wanted

1010
00:42:52,219 --> 00:43:01,819
something to remember a thing like I am

1011
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:05,119
looking for some special gemstone that's

1012
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:08,260
created in the world and so my entity

1013
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:14,539
has the entity ID of that that gemstone

1014
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:17,180
in it right perfectly standard thing so

1015
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:20,269
that I would know if the gemstone were

1016
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:22,129
nearby to me or I saw it I go that's the

1017
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:23,690
gemstone I'm looking for I could match

1018
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,240
the IDS or something I don't know I'm

1019
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:29,480
just making this up another one would be

1020
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,589
like oh I have a familiar and if I'm on

1021
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,940
the same screen as the familiar the

1022
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,460
familiar comes over to me and hangs out

1023
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,190
if I'm off if I'm off somewhere else

1024
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,960
I don't want the familiar to forget that

1025
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,030
they're my familiar I when I come back

1026
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,179
on I want them to recognize me again and

1027
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:46,100
come over right so that's really what

1028
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:47,239
I'm talking about here so the way that

1029
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,529
we had the system set up right now you

1030
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:50,659
couldn't really do that

1031
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:53,800
because as soon as the person goes out

1032
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:56,719
of simulation range it would forget that

1033
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,670
you were ever it that ID would go to

1034
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:01,339
zero that's just the way that it works

1035
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,230
right now and so I suspect that what we

1036
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,000
would rather have is we'd rather have

1037
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,039
the ability to store any ideas IDs

1038
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,750
permanently over time

1039
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:16,599
the problem with that is how do we make

1040
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:18,880
it clear in the pair identities that

1041
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:21,699
that's what's going on right and we have

1042
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,440
a couple different options so one is we

1043
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:24,909
always keep the entity reference around

1044
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,240
where we have the entity pointer and the

1045
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:30,339
entity ID that's the index right and

1046
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,569
then whenever you set it if you set the

1047
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,350
entity pointer you have to set the end

1048
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:37,750
of the index as well right because if

1049
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:40,630
you didn't do that then we would never

1050
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:43,119
know when we go to packet what we would

1051
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,890
see is the pointer was set to something

1052
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,949
and the index was set to something else

1053
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:51,219
right in the case where the pointer was

1054
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:55,750
set to something valid we would know to

1055
00:44:51,219 --> 00:45:00,369
overwrite the index with that entity

1056
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:04,150
that pointers and the ID no problem in

1057
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:06,219
the case where the index wasn't I start

1058
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,710
where the pointer wasn't valid right and

1059
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:16,839
and just to be clear I'm saying let's

1060
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:19,869
say we did this right in the case where

1061
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,730
it wasn't we sew the pointer 0 we

1062
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:23,559
wouldn't know what did that meant clear

1063
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,719
out the index because this person's no

1064
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:28,360
longer looking at something or if that

1065
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:30,939
just meant oh when we loaded this guy in

1066
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,430
the index the entity index that he was

1067
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:37,960
looking for doesn't exist in this sim

1068
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:40,750
region so we couldn't find it right and

1069
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:44,199
I don't know right because I could see

1070
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,429
it doing either way but you know I mean

1071
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,980
I guess what I'm saying is a bare

1072
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:50,919
minimum we've got to do at least this or

1073
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,869
that right where we only just can't ever

1074
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,460
keep track of the index but if we kept

1075
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:56,049
track of both of them so you can quickly

1076
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,059
use the pointer and you don't have to go

1077
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:02,890
through any kind of a hash table to use

1078
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:03,429
the index so if you went this this route

1079
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:06,099
with it

1080
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:10,719
then I guess what we could do is at pack

1081
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:13,929
time we could say oh is the index sum is

1082
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:17,949
the is the this entity's index that we

1083
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:19,568
have here is that in the hash table and

1084
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:23,828
if it is

1085
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:26,558
in the hash table then it's okay right

1086
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:33,339
if it's not in the hash table then it's

1087
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:35,829
not and I don't know there's a lot of

1088
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:37,958
cons with that to the entity pointer

1089
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:39,609
will appear to be zero so everyone who's

1090
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:43,509
using an entity pointer will not get one

1091
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:45,278
right but the ID will still still

1092
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:48,670
secretly be valid so if someone wants to

1093
00:46:45,278 --> 00:46:50,349
say am i chasing anyone the thing where

1094
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:53,949
you do like if edit ereference dot

1095
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:55,809
pointer is not right because it's really

1096
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:57,969
entity dot index that tells you that

1097
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:59,739
because the pointer might be 0 if the

1098
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:01,239
person just doesn't happen to be in any

1099
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:04,809
sort of simulation range that you can

1100
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:09,999
see so you can see why this is

1101
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:12,430
relatively complicated but I do think

1102
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:16,409
there's at least some merit to

1103
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:16,409
essentially saying something like this

1104
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:41,090
let's say that we made this structure 16

1105
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:43,699
bytes long so we essentially said we've

1106
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:45,829
got a relationship we have an index we

1107
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:47,989
have a pointer that's what an entity

1108
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:49,400
reference is you always use the pointer

1109
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:51,979
anytime you're trying to do something

1110
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,240
but you always check the index if you're

1111
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,760
trying to throw something is correct or

1112
00:47:53,239 --> 00:48:00,019
not and we could say well let's go ahead

1113
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,430
and make these extra hard to access so

1114
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:04,579
that people know that they really should

1115
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:05,869
not be accessing them and then we can

1116
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:07,250
make it so that you're supposed to go

1117
00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:10,659
through some helper functions that do

1118
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,659
the right thing right

1119
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:30,170
I don't know you can see why this is

1120
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:31,849
complex right it's a tricky pit bit it's

1121
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,039
easy to implement no matter what we pick

1122
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:35,960
to do the problem is just I want to make

1123
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:38,119
something that's not going to cause too

1124
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,530
many problems for the usage code and I

1125
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:40,759
think most of the time the porter stuff

1126
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,320
would just work but I'm just worried

1127
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,600
about that one case where the pointers

1128
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,090
Nell but the index is still valid which

1129
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:50,150
is the case for long distance references

1130
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:52,700
essentially and I just don't know if

1131
00:48:50,150 --> 00:49:01,460
there's any way other way I can really

1132
00:48:52,699 --> 00:49:03,710
make that be any more good right so I'm

1133
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:05,960
gonna start sure another option would be

1134
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,900
to make the entity always point to some

1135
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,750
kind of a special dummy entity and you

1136
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,740
can test for that I don't really love

1137
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,000
that either

1138
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:16,729
in short I just don't think there's a

1139
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,380
lot of good stuff to do here other than

1140
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:20,920
maybe try to have some helper functions

1141
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,619
that make it easy to do the right thing

1142
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:28,159
but it's it's basically a tri-state

1143
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:31,339
condition right you know it's something

1144
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:35,750
that looks like this it's like zero no

1145
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:38,000
reference one is you no reference to

1146
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:41,630
something in Sim range and two is

1147
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,840
reference something out of Sim range so

1148
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:47,329
basically everyone in the game who is

1149
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,780
using entity references for things is

1150
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:52,400
going to have to know whenever they do

1151
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,250
processing on that reference they need

1152
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,769
to expect one of those three states not

1153
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:01,130
just two states because normally it

1154
00:49:57,769 --> 00:50:02,869
would just be like that right that's

1155
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,480
what we would have in the simple case

1156
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:09,049
where we didn't support essentially out

1157
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:12,820
of course sized worlds which is sort of

1158
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,820
what we do support now

1159
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:31,559
I don't know I just don't know I just

1160
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:31,559
don't know don't know uh so yeah

1161
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:48,409
I guess what I'll say about that is I

1162
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:52,369
guess we'll sort of have to see what the

1163
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:55,219
code breaks down to look like if I was

1164
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:57,980
to look at the one piece of code that we

1165
00:50:55,219 --> 00:51:00,858
started with just now and say what does

1166
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,829
that look like right then you can see

1167
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:07,159
this code right here this code probably

1168
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:09,230
just is fine meaning it's not making any

1169
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:11,329
decisions about this it's just saying

1170
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:14,590
hey any entities that actually are

1171
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:17,179
available to me you know right now I

1172
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:26,780
will go ahead and take their lengths and

1173
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:29,149
that'll be that right and so it would

1174
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:33,140
work fine and and I and I guess maybe

1175
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:35,000
the answer is just you know maybe really

1176
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:37,098
what we want is it's just you almost

1177
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,599
always use the pointer and you only have

1178
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:40,300
to worry about the index if you're

1179
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:43,460
talking about something that's that

1180
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,740
you're about to like take you're about

1181
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,380
to make a decision about it based on

1182
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:52,269
whether there is anything there and

1183
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:55,400
maybe there's a thing that's like b32

1184
00:51:52,269 --> 00:51:58,489
you know

1185
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:02,829
reference exists or something I don't

1186
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:05,750
know or reference references valid

1187
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:08,239
reference I don't know something like

1188
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:18,710
that and it passes the entity reference

1189
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:23,959
so that you can always ask you know hey

1190
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:26,389
tell me is this thing valid and that'll

1191
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:31,519
always look at just the index it's never

1192
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:34,639
gonna look at the pointer because the

1193
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:38,420
pointer is irrelevant if the pointer is

1194
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:40,699
zero it still could mean that the index

1195
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,130
was valid in which case this reference

1196
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:47,118
is still valid

1197
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:49,460
so something like that right so let's

1198
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:55,730
say that that was the case I'm gonna go

1199
00:52:49,460 --> 00:53:01,449
ahead and compile this what did I do

1200
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:06,440
wrong oh right it's index top value

1201
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:08,989
there we go so let's get back to what I

1202
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,789
was talking about before so when I want

1203
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:13,159
to store these things and I may go ahead

1204
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:16,730
and also do now that I think about it I

1205
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:22,549
may do a slight switcheroo here as well

1206
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:30,039
and say let's have like an entity stored

1207
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:30,039
reference so you know this is like that

1208
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:42,829
something like this and that way when we

1209
00:53:39,769 --> 00:53:44,588
say hey are two references equal we

1210
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:49,750
could also have a thing that's like hey

1211
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:49,750
inline be 32

1212
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:07,910
something like references are equal and

1213
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:11,219
we say any reference a any reference B

1214
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:12,989
which is a little confusing because we

1215
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:18,149
it's hard to say whether that should

1216
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:19,439
include the relationship or not but that

1217
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,670
I guess will be something we'll have to

1218
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,740
think about a little bit more down the

1219
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:29,960
line right but okay so in here we would

1220
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:29,959
say if references are equal we'd say

1221
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:52,500
yeah we just say entity stored index

1222
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:59,250
equals be stored index so I I don't know

1223
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:04,889
why that was a bracket so you know we've

1224
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:13,519
got a check on that we could also demand

1225
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:19,289
that a stored relationship was be stored

1226
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:29,659
relationship and yeah then here we just

1227
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:29,659
say references are equal

1228
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:40,740
I guess you know I might keep the

1229
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:44,159
pointer around in this case maybe even

1230
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:48,389
in the other case because you know we

1231
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:55,259
really don't know the person may have

1232
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:56,489
set and not set the index yet so I'm

1233
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,280
just trying to think of how I would like

1234
00:55:56,489 --> 00:56:00,869
that case to proceed let's say I set the

1235
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:06,080
entity reference and didn't set the

1236
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:06,079
index yet you know to set the pointer

1237
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:24,750
yeah so I think that's actually what we

1238
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:28,940
want I think we want to say references

1239
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,940
are equal a Titan B speed identity

1240
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:46,589
something more like that okay so now

1241
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:48,990
when we do our packing we've got sort of

1242
00:56:46,588 --> 00:56:50,460
our pack entity into chunk what we're

1243
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:53,009
gonna do here is we're gonna make sure

1244
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,300
that our indices are packed properly and

1245
00:56:53,010 --> 00:57:01,650
I guess I'm kind of running out of time

1246
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:03,269
unfortunately that's unfortunate so now

1247
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:06,180
what I want to do is say okay let's do a

1248
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:08,179
pack entity reference what I want to do

1249
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:12,989
is say how much room am I going to need

1250
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:17,969
for the array of this particular fellow

1251
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:20,489
right of this particular entity and so

1252
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:24,269
we know that we will need to store a

1253
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:29,419
paired entity count of them right so our

1254
00:57:24,269 --> 00:57:33,809
pack size is the size of the source plus

1255
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:37,079
some data right however many pair

1256
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:47,429
entities there are times the size of the

1257
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:49,710
stored entity reference right so that's

1258
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:52,889
how we actually would compute how much

1259
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:56,480
room we need now which is more than just

1260
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:59,429
the room for the for the entity itself

1261
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,769
so now when we get down here and we say

1262
00:57:59,429 --> 00:58:05,088
oh we've you know we've packed this the

1263
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:07,710
source in here we now also have to pack

1264
00:58:05,088 --> 00:58:09,509
where we packed the two traversal

1265
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:13,289
references isolate we now need to pack

1266
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:14,910
this entity reference array right and so

1267
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,800
what we want to do is we want to do pack

1268
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:19,078
entity reference the the array of entity

1269
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,730
references pack entity reference really

1270
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,170
doesn't probably need to be a thing in

1271
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,490
quite that way anymore we could probably

1272
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:26,550
just bring it down here and say all

1273
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:29,750
right let's pack all these things

1274
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:32,150
together right

1275
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:38,659
I'm a little nervous about not having

1276
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:41,539
named slots for these you know maybe

1277
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:44,899
it's dumb to have them in an array and

1278
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:46,670
not to have them named but I just don't

1279
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,639
know how else we would support things

1280
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:53,750
that kind of have arbitrary numbers of

1281
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:55,369
things that connect to them and we can

1282
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:58,639
always have more than one array if we

1283
00:58:55,369 --> 00:59:00,589
want right in fact you know what I could

1284
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,000
do here is I could actually call this I

1285
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:05,059
could leave it outside and say packing

1286
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,090
may be referenced array right and then

1287
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:09,590
you know just say the reference count or

1288
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:13,309
even just just count we know what it is

1289
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:20,780
there's the source right and then stored

1290
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:26,079
entity reference why is that gonna be

1291
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:26,080
stored reference stored entity reference

1292
00:59:28,989 --> 00:59:34,009
and then we'd say stored entity

1293
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:45,019
reference destination then after we loop

1294
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:46,700
over these we'd say all right the desk

1295
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:50,929
we're gonna do exactly the same thing we

1296
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:53,659
were doing here right we'd say the

1297
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:58,819
destination index is going to equal the

1298
00:59:53,659 --> 01:00:02,179
source this is pointers ID but only if

1299
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:05,780
the sources pointers ID is not equal to

1300
01:00:02,179 --> 01:00:07,250
0 so only in the case where oh sorry

1301
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:08,330
where the source pointer is entered so

1302
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:11,599
only in case where we had a valid

1303
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:12,799
pointer do we want it to be equal but

1304
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,889
we're gonna expand this case a little

1305
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:20,780
bit and say well if it was equal then

1306
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:23,179
you know maybe we're gonna do this the

1307
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,550
other way where we'd say like we'd still

1308
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:27,710
preserve that ID maybe we do that and

1309
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:30,769
we'll do that if it's in the hash table

1310
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:32,389
right so this is going to have to take

1311
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:34,340
this is essentially going to need to

1312
01:00:32,389 --> 01:00:36,980
know the sim region nutrition and this I

1313
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:39,350
guess this sort of begs the question -

1314
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,090
now of you know just the packing live in

1315
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,679
the sim region actually instead of over

1316
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,480
here in the world

1317
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:47,039
maybe this world thing you know will

1318
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,940
literally just be for you know will not

1319
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,579
you you get the idea

1320
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:54,099
you know what I'm saying because we we

1321
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:59,309
need that hash table to know whether or

1322
01:00:54,099 --> 01:01:02,470
not we would repack this right and so

1323
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:07,269
yeah I mean the other thing we can do is

1324
01:01:02,469 --> 01:01:10,419
do that at is is do that at the you know

1325
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:12,039
at set when the sim end closes down but

1326
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:14,680
I don't know to what extent we really

1327
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:16,000
want that to happen it just seems like a

1328
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:19,419
little bit of overlapping work there

1329
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:23,130
so anyway point being we're gonna have

1330
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:23,130
to do this case I'll leave it for now

1331
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:44,200
but instead I guess well do or say ok

1332
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:46,719
we'll clear it in that case in either

1333
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:49,659
case we'll say that their relationship

1334
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:51,039
well I guess that's fine not true we'll

1335
01:01:49,659 --> 01:01:59,588
say that the relationship equals the

1336
01:01:51,039 --> 01:02:01,949
source relationship in this case I guess

1337
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:01,949
we'll say

1338
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:16,220
none right and we'll increment the two

1339
01:02:13,818 --> 01:02:19,788
so we walked the array and we just

1340
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:22,548
basically remap those source it's the

1341
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:30,289
source over to the desk and then and

1342
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:31,548
then we're done we could also do this so

1343
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,990
at least we know it's always initialized

1344
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:34,460
and then in here it's like we could just

1345
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:38,538
look at see if the hash table if it's

1346
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:39,740
found all right and so then what we

1347
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:42,319
would need to do here is we wanted to

1348
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:44,209
pack these entity references skin all we

1349
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:48,139
have to do now is say well okay we know

1350
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:53,480
how many there are right we do the death

1351
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:57,230
entity sorry we know in the source

1352
01:02:53,480 --> 01:03:03,500
entity we know we've got that that

1353
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:05,298
entity paired entity count right and

1354
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,858
then we know that the sources paired

1355
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:09,858
entities is the array that we're coming

1356
01:03:06,858 --> 01:03:15,768
from and then finally we know that the

1357
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:18,199
dest is the amount that we added right

1358
01:03:15,768 --> 01:03:20,328
in our pack size that's after the source

1359
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:21,469
we know where that is as well and we're

1360
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:24,079
gonna want to make this a little more

1361
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:27,288
systemic but we know exactly where the

1362
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:30,440
the entity store references live as well

1363
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:33,950
they live here so that's the packing

1364
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:36,409
code and we're over time so I got a I

1365
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:37,399
got to wind it down here but you see

1366
01:03:36,409 --> 01:03:42,679
where I'm going this is all pretty

1367
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:48,410
straightforward right let's fix that the

1368
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:50,538
dot value-packed reversible reference so

1369
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:57,259
a traversal reference I guess is really

1370
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:59,539
just this though right and this is

1371
01:03:57,259 --> 01:04:01,838
really something we want to do yeah I

1372
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:05,630
don't really wanna I want to do this

1373
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:09,548
fairly correctly so I really don't

1374
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:13,210
actually want to to wind down right now

1375
01:04:09,548 --> 01:04:13,210
which is kind of annoying

1376
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:29,809
hmm well I guess I'll do the minimum to

1377
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:39,740
leave it in a compiling state and then

1378
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:54,460
we'll move on let's just say that this

1379
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:59,469
is actually stored entity reference and

1380
01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:02,409
paired entity count paired entities

1381
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:07,308
identifier not found Peck in the

1382
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:20,889
reference array we have our load entity

1383
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:24,099
reference and then we have our head

1384
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:24,098
happening here

1385
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:42,490
when we add the player at this point

1386
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:45,190
yeah we're gonna need to be able to make

1387
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:46,959
that array do its thing which is

1388
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:49,329
actually relatively simple in this case

1389
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,150
right because since in both cases we

1390
01:05:49,329 --> 01:06:00,639
just have one of these we can do and end

1391
01:05:52,150 --> 01:06:08,559
the reference which is like body rs13

1392
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:10,719
reference head riffs one right and then

1393
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:16,210
in here we can just say like oh okay the

1394
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:24,549
body parrot entity reference turn

1395
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:33,909
entities equals body refs head their

1396
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:36,940
identities equals head reps yeah so body

1397
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:42,460
rests zero duck pointer equals head head

1398
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:48,220
riffs 0 dot pointer equals body and off

1399
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:52,869
you go and in both cases aired the

1400
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:59,679
account closed one head or an entity

1401
01:06:52,869 --> 01:07:03,750
chemicals one right so there you go

1402
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:09,819
and in this case we can just do to do

1403
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:14,070
re-enable and we'll say that the body

1404
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:14,070
just doesn't exist at the moment

1405
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:35,440
same here okay and this code we actually

1406
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:37,349
could have done before the head Delta

1407
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:42,010
obviously it's just the distance between

1408
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:48,460
whatever that pair identity is and so

1409
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:51,250
that's fine so yeah I think at this

1410
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,840
point we probably would have a bunch of

1411
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,610
bugs that we're going to have to deal

1412
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,570
with and we haven't implemented half of

1413
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:59,289
the things but I'm gonna leave it there

1414
01:07:55,570 --> 01:08:04,180
so we go to QA let's go ahead and do

1415
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:06,489
that now and I'm not sure yeah like I

1416
01:08:04,179 --> 01:08:10,329
said I'm not 100% sure whether I like

1417
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:12,629
the flexible array thing or not but

1418
01:08:10,329 --> 01:08:12,630
we'll see

1419
01:08:27,939 --> 01:08:32,108
and a/c a fairly simple way to describe

1420
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:33,908
or understand the Infinity norm is to

1421
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:35,798
draw the unit hyper spheres for each of

1422
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:37,750
those common norms the one norm would be

1423
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:39,250
a diamond shape the two norm is the

1424
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:41,048
regular circle hyper sphere the three

1425
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,529
norm gets more squarish hyper cubish and

1426
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:43,269
so on

1427
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:45,159
you'd quickly see that this series

1428
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:49,120
converges towards a square slash

1429
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:50,979
hypercube uh I don't know that that's a

1430
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:52,539
fairly simple way to describe her

1431
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:53,709
understand understand the Infinity norm

1432
01:08:52,539 --> 01:08:55,569
because first people would have to

1433
01:08:53,710 --> 01:09:01,170
understand the mapping of it to the

1434
01:08:55,569 --> 01:09:03,429
sphere but yeah I mean I can see that

1435
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:05,770
FLE dulski have you seen Scott Myers

1436
01:09:03,429 --> 01:09:07,750
talk on CPU caches lesson one of

1437
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:09,850
programming is don't listen to uh Scott

1438
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,960
Myers talk he talks about how it's

1439
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,310
better to stored you to have the same

1440
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,020
type together in memory because they end

1441
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:15,250
up on the same cache line which is good

1442
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,299
for performance is this something that

1443
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:19,119
you think about or will cover in

1444
01:09:16,298 --> 01:09:22,719
hand-made hero so that's not true right

1445
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:24,759
obviously that's not correct the true

1446
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,619
statement is that it depends how you're

1447
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:28,810
processing it you don't want to keep

1448
01:09:26,619 --> 01:09:31,809
data of the same type together in memory

1449
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:35,469
you want to keep data that is accessed

1450
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:39,069
together together in memory right so if

1451
01:09:35,469 --> 01:09:40,239
you're accessing a b and c always

1452
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:42,159
together but they happen to be

1453
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:45,278
completely different types those you

1454
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:48,219
want to put close together you know if

1455
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:50,560
just because i have say a thousand

1456
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:52,750
x-coordinates but i never both process

1457
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,400
my x-coordinates there's no point in

1458
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:57,429
keeping them close together that's like

1459
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:59,469
worse right spacial locality is just

1460
01:09:57,429 --> 01:10:01,630
about keeping data that is used together

1461
01:09:59,469 --> 01:10:04,600
close together and sometimes you have to

1462
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:07,210
make concessions to Cindy where you're

1463
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,679
forced to process data in a bulk fashion

1464
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:12,670
because of the way the floating-point

1465
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:14,350
unit works and that can be true but that

1466
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:17,170
is an aspect of the fact that the

1467
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:19,090
algorithm worked that way not that it is

1468
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:21,489
better to keep things it's still because

1469
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:24,520
you're accessing them together and Cindy

1470
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:26,079
forces you to process things in same

1471
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,620
size bulk like that because you don't

1472
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:30,880
want to transform right so no like if

1473
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:33,309
that's what he said that's just wrong

1474
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,750
but he may have said the right thing and

1475
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:36,880
maybe he just wasn't clear about it or

1476
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,529
whatever but yes we've covered that in

1477
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,829
handy here Oh many times it's not

1478
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:41,779
something you typically think about

1479
01:10:39,829 --> 01:10:44,449
until later in your architecture because

1480
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:46,969
it's not it's something that causes a

1481
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:49,369
lot of cost if you're constantly trying

1482
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:52,579
to do it and most of your code doesn't

1483
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:54,609
need it so you have to be judicious in

1484
01:10:52,579 --> 01:10:58,729
knowing about when you care about that

1485
01:10:54,609 --> 01:11:01,489
part of that is C++ is Fault C++ is

1486
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:03,619
awful at data organization it has almost

1487
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:05,029
no utilities it has almost no features

1488
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:07,430
that allow you to organize your data

1489
01:11:05,029 --> 01:11:09,019
well if you've ever watched John blows

1490
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,190
stream on Jay you can see that he's

1491
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,050
already got some nice features for that

1492
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:14,029
where you can twist the way things are

1493
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:15,909
stored without having to rewrite the

1494
01:11:14,029 --> 01:11:18,469
code so that you can pick better

1495
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:22,670
orientations of them for things like

1496
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:24,199
spatial locality could you use the enemy

1497
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:25,789
parent concept for a vehicle occupant

1498
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:27,829
relationship like an airship and its

1499
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:30,769
passengers and if so how would movement

1500
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:32,449
work on it in our system probably not at

1501
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:34,190
the moment because we already have the

1502
01:11:32,449 --> 01:11:36,229
concept of standing on so you would

1503
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:38,029
probably just put standing on you would

1504
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:39,799
probably just have them standing on that

1505
01:11:38,029 --> 01:11:46,279
the traversable points that are on the

1506
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:47,239
airship steveod 1990 I was just

1507
01:11:46,279 --> 01:11:48,679
wondering why you don't have a

1508
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:50,300
subscriber button for those that enjoy

1509
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,500
your frequent broadcasts for when I

1510
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,550
gather you were offered partnership but

1511
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,949
turned it down to do something in the

1512
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:56,270
contract can you tell me a little why

1513
01:11:54,949 --> 01:12:00,409
you made that decision and what options

1514
01:11:56,270 --> 01:12:03,320
do you have to donate sure yes so first

1515
01:12:00,409 --> 01:12:05,569
of all if you if you do look down in the

1516
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,519
below the video in the twitch

1517
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:09,439
information there are a bunch of links

1518
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,030
but if you just want to remember one

1519
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:13,159
thing you go to hand-made here org and

1520
01:12:11,029 --> 01:12:14,750
we have both a patreon and a way to

1521
01:12:13,159 --> 01:12:16,849
preorder the game so if you're looking

1522
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:18,380
for to support the series both of those

1523
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:20,900
are much appreciated either one or both

1524
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:23,510
or whichever one whatever you want to do

1525
01:12:20,899 --> 01:12:26,869
is is up there on handmade hero org

1526
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:29,449
certainly so yeah that's that's what

1527
01:12:26,869 --> 01:12:32,779
we've got as far as the information you

1528
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:35,689
were asking regarding twitch yes I they

1529
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:39,109
their standard contract has some things

1530
01:12:35,689 --> 01:12:41,989
that we can't sign such as prohibition

1531
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:43,729
on uploading the videos to YouTube until

1532
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:46,880
a certain amount of time has passed and

1533
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:49,309
various other things like this and since

1534
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,750
people a lot of people watch the series

1535
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:52,460
very regularly and watch it almost

1536
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,208
immediately after its broadcast maybe

1537
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:55,880
within an hour

1538
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:57,979
on YouTube I did not want to

1539
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,498
disadvantage those people who cannot

1540
01:12:57,979 --> 01:13:02,689
watch the stream live and make them wait

1541
01:13:00,498 --> 01:13:07,399
extra days to get it potentially due to

1542
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:08,659
a contract with twitch I did try to go

1543
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:11,688
back and forth on the conical of times

1544
01:13:08,658 --> 01:13:13,728
but you know we kind of got a few terms

1545
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:15,050
ironed out and there was a couple of

1546
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:17,599
things left and then they just stopped

1547
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:20,630
ever writing me back so I guess they

1548
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:21,949
didn't care so I've never heard for them

1549
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:23,689
I emailed them like three times after

1550
01:13:21,948 --> 01:13:25,938
that so I tried to get it set up because

1551
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:27,920
people wanted it I

1552
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:29,840
I seriously sent them like three males

1553
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,368
like a couple weeks apart just being

1554
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,538
like what you know how can I've never

1555
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:34,788
heard back about this like what's the

1556
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:35,509
deal and they just never talk to me

1557
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:38,090
again

1558
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:40,039
so that's that's the last I ever heard

1559
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:42,229
of them was a month than a half ago

1560
01:13:40,038 --> 01:13:44,529
right if they didn't ever actually come

1561
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:47,208
say no they just stopped talking to me

1562
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:49,399
which I don't know it was kind of rude

1563
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:51,109
actually but I mean I don't really care

1564
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:55,569
because it's not something we need for

1565
01:13:51,109 --> 01:14:00,018
the series in any particular way so yeah

1566
01:13:55,569 --> 01:14:01,158
that's that's the situation in general

1567
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:03,199
like I said that's not really a problem

1568
01:14:01,158 --> 01:14:04,848
it's not something I really wanted I

1569
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:07,339
don't mind that twitch didn't want to do

1570
01:14:04,849 --> 01:14:09,170
it and their contract is their business

1571
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:11,479
I just people had been asking for a

1572
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:13,130
subscribe button so I figured I might as

1573
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:15,170
well spend the time it took to read

1574
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:16,998
through their contracts and see if it

1575
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:19,699
was something we could sign it for it's

1576
01:14:16,998 --> 01:14:23,149
not particularly good or even useful

1577
01:14:19,698 --> 01:14:26,029
deal for us supporting us via patreon or

1578
01:14:23,149 --> 01:14:27,859
supporting us with by pre-ordering the

1579
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:28,969
game is way better for us and it's way

1580
01:14:27,859 --> 01:14:31,609
better for you because you get the

1581
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:33,979
source code to the games to play around

1582
01:14:31,609 --> 01:14:37,219
with at home if you preorder the game so

1583
01:14:33,979 --> 01:14:38,630
you know I would say it really is no big

1584
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:41,208
loss not having that subscriber button

1585
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:43,609
and if you just want there to not be ads

1586
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:46,359
on this video I don't play the ads I

1587
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:48,259
never play any ads on handmade hero ever

1588
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:51,408
but twitch and search them at the

1589
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:55,309
beginning I think and if you don't want

1590
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:56,899
that you can go to get twitch turbo or

1591
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:58,340
whatever so you can subscribe to twitch

1592
01:14:56,899 --> 01:15:00,348
separately and then you won't see ads on

1593
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,449
the channel more so you can you know

1594
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:04,400
give them some money in exchange for

1595
01:15:02,448 --> 01:15:07,719
that so so that's the full that's as far

1596
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,719
as I know it that's the full story

1597
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:14,229
your term it is it not possible to

1598
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:16,420
subscribe to forum posts anymore now

1599
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:20,139
since the new stuff was made I don't get

1600
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:21,970
any post to my mail I don't know I am

1601
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:28,090
not really involved in the forum suffer

1602
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:30,940
at all so you can ask them about it if

1603
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:33,699
you like there's obviously if you go to

1604
01:15:30,939 --> 01:15:36,099
handmade network.com there's a forums

1605
01:15:33,699 --> 01:15:37,989
for handmade network where you can post

1606
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:44,700
feature requests or ask why something's

1607
01:15:37,989 --> 01:15:44,699
not there I that's all I can tell you

1608
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,880
and yeah Omni Technomancer saying

1609
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:05,319
subscribe doesn't make it that free

1610
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:07,060
anymore twitch turbo makes it bad free

1611
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,399
at least it does for me and ad-free

1612
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:11,140
might not be true it gets rid of like

1613
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:12,939
the ads at the beginnings of any one

1614
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,410
stream like I like i subscribe to

1615
01:16:12,939 --> 01:16:17,139
twitter turbo and I've never seen an

1616
01:16:14,409 --> 01:16:18,489
addon like shawn stream or john stream

1617
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,720
or anything so it got rid of all the ads

1618
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:22,359
that i ever saw

1619
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:24,610
now whether if it's on some big you know

1620
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:28,539
super important stream of like you know

1621
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:29,769
dota special tournament something or

1622
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:33,369
other

1623
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:34,650
then i don't know if that it maybe they

1624
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:39,159
still throw ads and that i don't know

1625
01:16:34,649 --> 01:16:40,989
but on on everything else it got rid of

1626
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:42,609
it whether it's subscribing to a

1627
01:16:40,989 --> 01:16:45,939
particular channel gets rid of the ads

1628
01:16:42,609 --> 01:16:47,109
that i don't know if that might not so I

1629
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:48,819
would say if you're looking at rid of

1630
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:50,109
ads go twitch turbo I can pretty much

1631
01:16:48,819 --> 01:16:51,639
guarantee you that at least right now

1632
01:16:50,109 --> 01:16:54,009
you won't see any ads on handmade hero

1633
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,660
because I don't run any now other

1634
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:58,420
channels who try to make money off of

1635
01:16:55,659 --> 01:17:01,029
their stream they run ads specifically

1636
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:05,470
on the stream and so maybe that you know

1637
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:07,420
is a thing but but for watching handmade

1638
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:08,800
here without ads I never run any ads on

1639
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:10,329
it and I never put any ads in our

1640
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,670
YouTube we are completely ad free and we

1641
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:16,289
generate no revenue from the streams or

1642
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:19,359
from the YouTube ever and so if you

1643
01:17:16,289 --> 01:17:21,130
unfortunately twitch doesn't allow me to

1644
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:22,960
say don't ever run ads on my content

1645
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,520
which honestly is one reason I'd

1646
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,020
probably like to not be on twitch

1647
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:27,520
anymore at some point I'd rather be on

1648
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:31,240
an ad free service if there was one I

1649
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,530
don't know if there is but since I don't

1650
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:35,619
make any money from it I have no

1651
01:17:32,529 --> 01:17:40,289
incentive to run those ads and I don't

1652
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:44,099
want you to have to see ads so you know

1653
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:44,100
there's not much I can do about that

1654
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:28,239
are we done with the Q's no no we're not

1655
01:18:27,099 --> 01:18:30,010
there's one up here

1656
01:18:28,238 --> 01:18:31,598
this entity reference that feels

1657
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,980
premature to me since I don't think we

1658
01:18:31,599 --> 01:18:34,630
have a lot of examples of how it will be

1659
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:36,428
used are you doing it now for a

1660
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:41,109
particular reason

1661
01:18:36,429 --> 01:18:42,849
yes so I'm doing it now because well

1662
01:18:41,109 --> 01:18:45,429
obviously the entity reference stuff I

1663
01:18:42,849 --> 01:18:47,619
assume you mean the the enemy reference

1664
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:49,149
array not the entity references because

1665
01:18:47,618 --> 01:18:51,429
we already did a bunch of entity

1666
01:18:49,149 --> 01:18:52,929
references so the reason I'm doing it

1667
01:18:51,429 --> 01:18:55,420
now is I need some system in there to

1668
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:58,859
start playing with the concept that I

1669
01:18:55,420 --> 01:19:01,270
don't know exactly what input I have

1670
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:03,578
because right now I've been leaning on

1671
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:05,619
the fact that I have an entity type and

1672
01:19:03,578 --> 01:19:07,448
the entity type just knows oh I'm gonna

1673
01:19:05,618 --> 01:19:09,759
use like a head pointer or something

1674
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:12,328
right but I want to start trying to

1675
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,610
write some code that doesn't really know

1676
01:19:12,328 --> 01:19:17,769
so like you know the example would be I

1677
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:19,808
don't know how many legs I have right

1678
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:21,190
like maybe there's just legs sticking on

1679
01:19:19,809 --> 01:19:22,809
me and I know that I want them to kind

1680
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:24,879
of like wobble when I walked I don't

1681
01:19:22,809 --> 01:19:27,429
know how many there are and so I want to

1682
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,309
start having a way of like you know

1683
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:32,380
being able to say like enemies

1684
01:19:30,309 --> 01:19:34,179
when we say that I have a reference to

1685
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:39,159
the entity I actually gonna have a set

1686
01:19:34,179 --> 01:19:41,050
of references right and I suspect that

1687
01:19:39,158 --> 01:19:44,109
I'm gonna want to play with that a

1688
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:46,270
little bit so I want try it here with

1689
01:19:44,109 --> 01:19:48,670
something that only ever really has one

1690
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:50,440
just to see how it looks if I'm sort of

1691
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:52,538
doing discovery and then I'm gonna add

1692
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:54,069
more and see what happens

1693
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:55,509
and I suspect them and I have to like

1694
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:59,349
fuss with it a little till it feels

1695
01:19:55,510 --> 01:20:02,650
right my suspicion is what I'm probably

1696
01:19:59,349 --> 01:20:05,920
gonna have is more than one array so

1697
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:07,960
like the relationship part where it's

1698
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,118
what the relationship in the entity was

1699
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,679
I think that might be a mistake so we'll

1700
01:20:10,118 --> 01:20:13,569
see but I got a try both I don't know

1701
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,309
we'll see what happens when I actually

1702
01:20:13,569 --> 01:20:18,340
play with it but I'm suspecting that I

1703
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:21,190
probably want to iterate over the like a

1704
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:23,110
couple of different arrays like or

1705
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:25,238
something but I don't know I really

1706
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:27,460
don't I have no idea so I'm just gonna

1707
01:20:25,238 --> 01:20:30,759
play with it but I need at least one

1708
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:33,059
array example first to try

1709
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,059
that make sense

1710
01:21:25,078 --> 01:21:30,130
all right so it looks like we're good I

1711
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:34,050
don't see any other questions that I

1712
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:34,050
need to address so I'm gonna close down

1713
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:43,779
all right thank you everyone fronting
