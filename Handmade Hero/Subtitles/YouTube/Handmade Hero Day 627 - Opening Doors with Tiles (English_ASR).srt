00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:06,719
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,200
hero sure we could complete game live on

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,480
stream

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,798
i am going to go ahead and take a look

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,519
at the code that we wrote

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:16,879
last time um did this machine reboot

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,278
sometimes windows reboots machine it did

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,198
not

9
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,359
i always have to check to make sure that

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,600
windows did not reboot my machine

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,039
um because sometimes it just likes to

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
reboot your machine and you can you know

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,439
it wants to

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,038
right you can see it really wants to so

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,119
i'm probably gonna have to do that soon

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,000
and then you know then it undoes my subs

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,320
to drive which

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,320
which you know that i hate anyway

19
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,919
if you remember from last time what we

20
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,200
were doing

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,120
is i just wanted to uh

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
i just wanted to make something that

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,000
would do a

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,799
do like a door and so i wanted to make

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
something

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,759
where if i uh hopped into a part of the

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,198
dungeon

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,479
it would uh have like a blocker there

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,640
and then there'd be something you would

30
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,239
do and the blocker would go away so

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
if i run the game currently you know i

32
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,959
can hop

33
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,118
out of the sort of starting area here

34
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,239
that we set up

35
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,799
there were some bugs we wanted to look

36
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,319
at by the way there was um

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,479
like something in this corner that

38
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,639
doesn't exist remember that

39
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,879
um so there are some things with level

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,719
generation

41
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,879
like maybe it's putting an orphan there

42
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,879
that we don't have tags for or something

43
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,239
right so we want to take a look at that

44
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,839
probably but anyway

45
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,039
uh don't really care about that at the

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
moment because i want to do some other

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,680
stuff

48
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,118
we'll tackle that when we come to it uh

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
so if i come down here

50
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,478
and we take a look at this part of the

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,200
dungeon i think i just set

52
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,239
every dungeon room to have a door in it

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,478
and we didn't really have any door

54
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,640
graphics yet so we just stuck a tree

55
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,599
right as you can see i can't go through

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
the tree at all

57
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,519
right it's not possible and so what i'm

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,439
trying to do here

59
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,280
is uh today i just want to make it so

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,599
that there's a way to open this door

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,560
right so if we take a look down here you

62
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,199
know you can see that there's

63
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
stuff on the other side of it right uh

64
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,719
and

65
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:10,799
i would like to go ahead and make a way

66
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,800
to open the door

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,480
because that's going to be a pretty core

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,400
thing for

69
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,519
how you play the game because again the

70
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
point of this and

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,719
i say this can't say this enough not a

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
game designer

73
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,000
don't have strong opinions about that

74
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,318
not saying this is

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
correct or anything it's just from a

76
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,598
strictly implementation standpoint

77
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
the way that this is supposed to work is

78
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:31,840
it's supposed to be sort of like a zelda

79
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,159
or a

80
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,120
binding of isaac game where you'll hop

81
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,519
into a room

82
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
such as this one and you will have to do

83
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
something

84
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
and then the door will open and you can

85
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,479
go through it right

86
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,959
the only difference that i suspect uh

87
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,840
that i will probably do here is that i

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,800
don't know that i want

89
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,360
um those games will often lock you in

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
meaning when you hop in through a door

91
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
it closes the door behind you

92
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,878
until you do something in the room that

93
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
we may not do

94
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,399
so so i don't know that i care about

95
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
that aspect

96
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,360
of those sorts of games but the aspect

97
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,359
of the games

98
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,119
where you where you have to do something

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
in the room in order for the door to

100
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
open like kill the monster

101
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,800
or whatever those sorts of things i do

102
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
want i have some specific things that i

103
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,560
want to add for that

104
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,798
so that's mostly what we want to do here

105
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,920
is is create something

106
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,360
where that will occur and the way that

107
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,559
i'd like to do this

108
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,280
is i want to make a thing

109
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
uh so you notice this this dude hops

110
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
around

111
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
on squares there's a reason for that so

112
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,200
the way that you open doors

113
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,400
in rooms uh and this will pretty much be

114
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,719
exclusively true i believe is um

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,799
it will be sort of cubert style where

116
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,239
there's things on the floor

117
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,239
like there's tiles here and you have to

118
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
like light up the tiles by hopping on

119
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
them

120
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,959
and then the door will open right so

121
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
what i want to do is create a new type

122
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,959
of

123
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:12,878
thing where there's

124
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,519
some number of tiles in the groundwork

125
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:20,399
of a room and if you hop

126
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,798
and and they start out in like a down in

127
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,918
a

128
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:27,599
in a unset state so they start out

129
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:30,799
like on not lit up they are dark

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,160
right and when you hop over them they

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,199
light up right and

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,720
when you have lit up all of them

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,960
they will become that they will

134
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,560
become activated effectively and the

135
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,839
door will go down

136
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,839
and maybe

137
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,839
again this is really more of a designer

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,519
type question

139
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,679
doesn't it involve us we're just doing

140
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,879
the engine

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,519
maybe we want also the ability so that

142
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,478
that becomes the locked state of the

143
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,478
world now

144
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,839
meaning now what once you have

145
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,839
successfully

146
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:14,959
done that pattern

147
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,439
you you can't undo it so so if you then

148
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,560
go

149
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:22,319
and hop onto one of those tiles

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,639
again they will not change state right

151
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,599
whereas before that maybe they would so

152
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,879
me before that

153
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,400
maybe we have it so they would and

154
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,800
this may just be a property of the tile

155
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,519
so it may be that each individual tile

156
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
uh when we create them has uh properties

157
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,918
so like

158
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
maybe one of the tiles is you hop on it

159
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,680
sets it you hop on it again it unsets it

160
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,120
another one is you hop on it sets it and

161
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,519
then it never unsets it

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,560
right another one might be that you hop

163
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,159
on it sets it

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,839
you hop on it again it sets it to a

165
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
different color you hop on it again it

166
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,239
unsets it right

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
there could be like a bunch of different

168
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
things like that

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,439
um and there could also be ones where

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,840
like you hop on it once

171
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,560
uh like they could be numbered one two

172
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,679
three four five

173
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,478
and like if you hop on one two

174
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
three four five it works if you hop on

175
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,399
like one

176
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,439
three it clears the sequence right

177
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,839
so you have to hop on them in order

178
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,959
would be another one and i just want to

179
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,519
be able to have it

180
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,599
like the engine goal is if you imagine

181
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,959
there was a game designer

182
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,960
like you're handing this off to john

183
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,638
blue and he's gonna design a bunch of

184
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,638
stuff with it

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
it should basically allow him to drop

186
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,600
into this code and do whatever he wants

187
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,599
meaning we want it to be like very

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,199
flexible so that like the designer side

189
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
can do whatever they want

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
and they don't have to do a lot of work

191
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,079
to like change it so so i want it to be

192
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,959
like fairly

193
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,598
full-featured in that sense um and so if

194
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,279
we look

195
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,560
i think what we'd probably want to do

196
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,478
here is make this be a brain

197
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,918
and so it would probably be something

198
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:04,639
like this where we have

199
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,639
like a brain um

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,919
i guess these are switches i don't know

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,039
what these are called

202
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,639
um but these are basically like the the

203
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:18,800
switches in the floor or whatever

204
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,800
right uh and

205
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,079
you know i don't know how many we would

206
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,959
have 16 might

207
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,318
be a bit much so i don't know that we'd

208
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,000
ever use that but since we're basically

209
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,360
saying like look there's 16 blocks of

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,959
these sorts of things

211
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
will just it doesn't hurt us to use it

212
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,598
because we're already saying that's sort

213
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,038
of the size of these brain

214
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:40,079
things anyway um so when we go

215
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:44,719
in here um

216
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:46,800
also i can put that in down here

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,560
let me grab these brain switches drop

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,038
them in the union

219
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,720
uh so if we want to make one of these

220
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,360
now it should be pretty easy for us to

221
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,479
do

222
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,000
we just say all right there's a thing

223
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,519
which is a type brain switches uh

224
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and you know maybe i'll say like these

225
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,439
are environmental brains or whatever

226
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,279
like these are you know this is not a

227
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,839
monster it doesn't move around

228
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:11,119
um but it is a thing that's in the world

229
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,279
right

230
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,720
and so what i want to be able to do now

231
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,679
is in the entity

232
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,879
system you know if one of these things

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,959
is a switch

234
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,560
then it's just going to have a brain id

235
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,120
of switches and that'll gather up

236
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,038
and what we want to do too is in here we

237
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,560
would like to do a thing

238
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:32,479
uh where we maybe

239
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,278
have some data that has to do with

240
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,000
switches like are you set or are you not

241
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,439
and i don't think we have anything

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
really like that in here right we've

243
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
we've

244
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
got some things in the entity but

245
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,080
there's not a lot of it

246
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,278
um and so i probably want a thing in

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
here uh

248
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,000
for switches and so i want maybe

249
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,080
something in here that's like

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,200
um you know switch properties

251
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
uh and then also like maybe a switch

252
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,759
state

253
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,359
and this these i don't really know

254
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,600
like i said we're just gonna kind of

255
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
feel our way around in here

256
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
if i was a game designer i might have

257
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,879
stronger opinions about how it's going

258
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,080
to go

259
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,679
i don't um and also the advice that i've

260
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,959
mainly seen given from people like john

261
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,639
blue who i trust

262
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,239
on game design is that your game design

263
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,759
process should be very experimental

264
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,600
anyway so

265
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,958
i would assume that again the most

266
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,519
important thing when

267
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,319
working on this part of an engine is to

268
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
not

269
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
box yourself in like do whatever is the

270
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,680
most flexible at the time

271
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,839
like just type in the code that you

272
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,879
wanted and don't overthink it

273
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,600
because if you try to do a lot of like

274
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,679
overt structural things you're just

275
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,920
going to box yourself into a particular

276
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,359
game design and that was not the goal

277
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,399
the goal is to experiment with the game

278
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,680
design and feel

279
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,360
like feel out if it's good and make

280
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,919
changes to it that help you get towards

281
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,159
good

282
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,679
so again i'm not really qualified to

283
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,039
give game design advice but all the

284
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,239
advice that i've seen from people like

285
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,078
john who i trust

286
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,519
or daniel ben murguy is another person

287
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,078
who i trust on these sorts of

288
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
uh questions they seem to think that

289
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,799
like

290
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,240
it's the experimentation that produces

291
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,399
the good game design so

292
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,360
so don't box yourself in like don't

293
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,958
don't try to design a system first and

294
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,079
then make the game

295
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:28,319
just let the system be fluid and allow

296
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,958
yourself to do whatever random crap you

297
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,640
think of at the time do that and you'll

298
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,278
get a better result than if you try to

299
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,439
do like

300
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,278
what's my entity system like don't think

301
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,399
that way because you'll just produce a

302
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,838
very generic game

303
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,360
at the end of that so in here i'll just

304
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
make a new function for this that i'll

305
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
stick in and this is purely

306
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
organizational

307
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,879
it could just live in the switch

308
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
statement but i'm going to actually have

309
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,078
one in here where we we don't need input

310
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,159
for these right

311
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,278
um i i don't even know if we need the

312
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,480
sim region

313
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,000
honestly um we might not uh we might

314
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,039
just use the brain

315
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
um but i'm gonna put the sim region in

316
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,799
because

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,639
well you know what here's where we'll

318
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,519
probably need the same region at some

319
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,120
point

320
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,039
these switches need to uh

321
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,039
trigger things like opening a particular

322
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:19,599
door

323
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,599
and i don't know

324
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
i mean i guess we don't really need yeah

325
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,278
we i don't even know if we need any

326
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,159
queries i guess i'll just leave it out

327
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,039
for now

328
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,480
i feel like eventually we would want it

329
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,399
to be in there

330
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,480
um but but i i guess i just

331
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
can't think of it so don't you know my

332
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,120
main thing is that you know i'm not

333
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
going to pass something around that i

334
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,839
don't

335
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
actually care about so you know we'll

336
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,920
add it if we need it

337
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,399
so if we see one of these things where

338
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,879
we have uh

339
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,240
you know switches i'm just going to go

340
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,360
ahead and make a function where we

341
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,320
process logic

342
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,000
involving these switches um and i'm

343
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,040
using the brain system here which i

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,039
actually kind of like

345
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,399
um i don't know if it's a good idea or

346
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,759
not uh because

347
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,799
it was very experimental but you can see

348
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,039
how it's kind of

349
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,838
becoming sort of a nice thing for us to

350
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,599
have

351
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,360
uh which is to say that if you look at

352
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
what happens in here

353
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,560
we have these switches and

354
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,078
i want to think of them in a group so

355
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,679
the brain is really nice because it

356
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,559
gathers them all up for us

357
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,159
right so it automatically just gathers

358
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,199
all of the switches

359
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,519
that are involved in a particular uh

360
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
like room and it will bundle them

361
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,839
together for us which is pretty great

362
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,839
right

363
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,599
so i don't know that seems pretty cool

364
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
um maybe it's not

365
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
but i don't know it just seems pretty

366
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,000
neat

367
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,479
uh the way that that works anyway

368
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so when we come in here we've got uh

369
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
this brain switches

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,720
thing right and i'm just gonna say like

371
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,039
well we've got

372
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,240
uh the switches version of this brain

373
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,919
is there's really not much in it other

374
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,759
than just the switches

375
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,519
uh and really these are going to be all

376
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,399
the tiles that we care about and so i

377
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
think

378
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,078
if i'm not mistaken we can just kind of

379
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
go through

380
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,759
them one at a time and see what their

381
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,879
states are so if i go

382
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:30,480
uh back in here and i say

383
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:33,120
uh and and i just look to see

384
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,759
what the various things are i should be

385
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,278
able to just

386
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,600
run through the switch states and see

387
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,600
what they what they are right

388
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,720
so if i just go ahead and say all right

389
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,839
uh my

390
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:49,839
switch or tile index and i'll just say

391
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
uh

392
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
loop over all of them

393
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
uh and in each of these

394
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,360
i can look at the particular tile in

395
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,720
question like so

396
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,320
right and

397
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,920
i think uh what i

398
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,199
would need to do here is i would need to

399
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,319
have some way of knowing

400
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,799
like that this traversible has been

401
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,240
hit and we may need some like edge

402
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,359
triggering

403
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,839
so basically when we actually

404
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
hop onto the thing that's a trigger and

405
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,519
standing on it

406
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,839
won't like keep re-triggering it i'm

407
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,480
gonna do a simpler thing right now

408
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
uh which is to just look to see whether

409
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,759
or not

410
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,839
it's actually uh being stood on at the

411
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,838
moment

412
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
um

413
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,879
although actually i suppose this

414
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,359
maybe that's better handled on the

415
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,120
actual transaction

416
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
so maybe i won't do that i don't know

417
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,879
i'm not sure what i want to do

418
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,879
there uh

419
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
i'm not sure what i want to do there so

420
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,799
what i'm going to do at the moment

421
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
is i'm just going to go ahead and say

422
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,359
that we're going to do it this way

423
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,639
and what i would like to do here is i

424
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,879
would like to be able to grab

425
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,879
out the particular

426
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,240
so i'd like to know like which door it

427
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,399
is so what i might do

428
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,680
what i was thinking is there's like

429
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,440
doors that are

430
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,719
uh there are doors that are controlled

431
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
by the tiles

432
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,160
and maybe i want those in the brain as

433
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,360
well

434
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,120
you know what i'm saying i don't know

435
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,519
if that makes sense or not but it seems

436
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,519
like it might so it could be like

437
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,759
this kind of thing you know what i mean

438
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,600
so there's like there's things that get

439
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
unlocked by the

440
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,920
by the tiles and then the tiles you know

441
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,399
what i'm saying

442
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,360
so i don't know i i you know i don't i

443
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
don't know

444
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
how i feel about that or or what you

445
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,919
know

446
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,639
whether that's good or not but something

447
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,319
like this and so you know we would go

448
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
through the tiles we would see what the

449
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,879
tile states

450
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,560
are uh and then at the end we would loop

451
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,198
over the things that we unlock and

452
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,198
unlock them

453
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,720
right

454
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,360
and so for things like doors i don't

455
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,759
know that we

456
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
actually need a separate type for those

457
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,720
though or

458
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,800
really anything at all we could

459
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,240
potentially just get rid of them

460
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:37,679
right um because they kind of but but we

461
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
probably want to animate them in some

462
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,958
way

463
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
uh so i'm not sure like exactly again

464
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,919
how we want that to work because we

465
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,120
haven't really worked in this part of

466
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,039
the code much at all like we haven't

467
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,240
really added these kinds of

468
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,198
gamey things um so i kind of need some

469
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,120
way here

470
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,120
of making like

471
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,959
uh making it like

472
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,119
take me like a like a like a basically a

473
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:08,720
transaction that goes to nowhere

474
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,719
would be the way to think of it right

475
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,959
so in other words like

476
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
this function

477
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,558
where we do the transactional occupy

478
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,240
okay so there's where we need the same

479
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,639
region i was like yeah

480
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,359
well we need the summation so like where

481
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,759
we do the

482
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,479
the transaction occupy i'd say okay i

483
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,558
want

484
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,880
like the uh the unlocks

485
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:38,879
id

486
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,839
uh that we're talking about here

487
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,839
like so

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:18,320
yeah so for every unlock

489
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,600
i just want to go and

490
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:26,720
have it go to nowhere basically

491
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,719
right so excuse me

492
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,399
so i don't the the question about how

493
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
this works exactly

494
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
um

495
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,558
i assume what we would want to do and

496
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,839
i just don't know but i'm assuming what

497
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:47,200
we would want to do

498
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:50,558
is make a dummy traversible

499
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,600
that's basically on the door so that

500
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:56,319
when the door is supposed to unlock

501
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:59,678
we just transactionally occupy it to

502
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:59,678
like a traversable that's like

503
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,839
hard-coded to like be like wherever the

504
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,319
door if it should go up or down i don't

505
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,199
know

506
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,200
or to the side

507
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,480
we just place a traversible there that

508
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:17,519
it's supposed to go to

509
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,759
i guess um like i said i'm really not

510
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,759
sure

511
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
i'm really not sure um

512
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,640
well you know what i don't really want

513
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,080
to think about that right now i just

514
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
want to implement the switch stuff so

515
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,480
let me implement the switch stuff and

516
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,079
then we'll come back to this and decide

517
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
how we want to do that because

518
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:42,000
we're just going to need something we're

519
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,038
going to need to decide like

520
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,960
look we're going to put in like an

521
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,079
animation control basically that just

522
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,919
lets the door open

523
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,119
and i have no i haven't really thought

524
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,200
about what that

525
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,399
should even look like on the screen so

526
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,919
we're gonna have to make some decisions

527
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,160
there so what i might do is say

528
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,960
i'm gonna skip transactional occupy

529
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,960
right now

530
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,960
um i might just do a like to do

531
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
to call that and what i'll do instead is

532
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,200
in here where we do

533
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,159
uh the the the

534
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
the one that you're actually uh coming

535
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,799
from

536
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:21,840
so where you were previously

537
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,839
excuse me uh

538
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:30,158
like yeah so the problem here is right i

539
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,558
want desired

540
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,440
for now to just not be anything so what

541
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,639
i'd like to do

542
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,279
is is basically this so uh

543
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,640
you go in here and you say i want to get

544
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,480
the traversible

545
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:49,120
for this oops

546
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:53,120
for unlocks current

547
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:56,399
occupying right

548
00:20:53,119 --> 00:21:00,839
uh and i then just want to say like

549
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,840
it's not there anymore right so then

550
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,839
i

551
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,240
am i doing this right

552
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,200
where's the occupying there it is

553
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,879
so like these um so basically what i

554
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
want to do

555
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,520
is i just want to say like yeah the

556
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,519
occupying one

557
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,640
uh is now gonna be nothing so we're

558
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,840
gonna get a traversable

559
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,919
for that one uh we're gonna clear

560
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,918
it out because we're not there anymore

561
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,200
right so we're just clearing this out uh

562
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,599
and then we're gonna say like

563
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
ours

564
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,079
uh is gonna get cleared is like we're

565
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,080
not on that anymore

566
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,839
right

567
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,279
okay so excuse me

568
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,038
so that would unlock uh the door

569
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,319
by basically just removing it from the

570
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,440
occupier

571
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,839
and i don't actually have any other

572
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,759
like ideas about how i want that to work

573
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,959
so i'm also just gonna say

574
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:34,558
like look just make the z value

575
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,640
b go down by by one

576
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,639
um or you know what right now let's make

577
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,520
it go up by one just so we can see that

578
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,159
it happened

579
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,639
you know what i'm saying uh and and

580
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,640
that's all

581
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,919
so that's what i'm going to do and again

582
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,759
it's not good

583
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,600
i just don't know what i want to do here

584
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,720
so this is just a placeholder so i'm

585
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,439
gonna put

586
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,400
uh something around here where we like

587
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,159
say like

588
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,240
look we don't know what this is but we

589
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,520
know it's probably not that

590
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,038
that's what we do know so then when we

591
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,759
have the tile indexes here

592
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,960
and we loop over all the tile indexes

593
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,079
here's where we want to check what their

594
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,558
states are

595
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,558
and so

596
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,280
i again don't know what we want to do

597
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:30,480
uh for these but for now i'll just do

598
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,678
is it state not zero is all i'm going to

599
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,839
actually do

600
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,038
right so in here we have the switch

601
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:38,639
state

602
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,759
and in here i'm going to do like you

603
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,640
know switches

604
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:47,119
set and actually i guess i'll assume

605
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,120
it's true

606
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,839
right

607
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,479
and what i'll do here is say i'm going

608
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,080
to assume that this switch date

609
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
that all of these are true and if the

610
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,038
switch state

611
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,038
is not true

612
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,599
i'll set it to false so that way when we

613
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,038
come through here i can just say look

614
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,240
don't unlock

615
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,240
unless the switches are set

616
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,360
something like that again not great

617
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,839
but we're just sort of starting in

618
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,678
on the entity side of things and so

619
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,959
we'll have more opinions about how this

620
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,519
works

621
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,200
later right we'll we'll have a stronger

622
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,480
idea of what we want to have happen

623
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,679
there

624
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,079
so now what we need to do is say okay

625
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,240
when

626
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,558
there's a transactional occupy we

627
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,919
probably want to see what happened there

628
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,879
um i'm not sure how i want to set this

629
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,159
up

630
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,240
uh precisely but

631
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,320
you know the yeah cause like the thing

632
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,440
i'm not entirely certain about

633
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:15,839
is how exactly would we

634
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:15,840
want to

635
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,519
the thing that i'm not certain about is

636
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,480
how we want to know when you've hopped

637
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,158
on a thing

638
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,400
because there's lots of ways we could do

639
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,320
it one way to do it is that when you

640
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,480
actually call transactional occupy

641
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,079
that would process things that happen on

642
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,000
that

643
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,119
another way to do it would be inside the

644
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,640
brain these things just

645
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,639
just check right

646
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
so for example inside the traversables

647
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,440
here you know you've got

648
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,558
uh the traversable point stores who's on

649
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,679
it

650
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:52,960
and i don't

651
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,880
know you know you could do something

652
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,720
like this

653
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,039
so inside the traversible point where

654
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,440
you've got who is occupying it

655
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:09,440
uh you could have like who occupied it

656
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,880
last you know what i'm saying to you

657
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
so there would be like an occupier and a

658
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
preview of occupier and you could just

659
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,599
look

660
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,038
to see if those were different and the

661
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,119
interesting thing about that is it would

662
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,400
also let you see like who just left

663
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,839
or who just arrived it would give you

664
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,840
that information

665
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,759
i think i like that better

666
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,278
i feel like that gives you more

667
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,960
information about what you want

668
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:10,480
so i think i'll stick with that

669
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,880
so if we look at transactional occupy

670
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,200
um in here what it's doing is it's

671
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,760
setting the occupier to the entity id

672
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,558
and so what i might say is like okay so

673
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,960
there's a prev occupier and we just

674
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:27,119
every time you switch this thing

675
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,120
right you

676
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:35,839
you move it over

677
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,960
so basically you would take and say when

678
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,079
i switch the occupier

679
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,558
to this thing i change the previous

680
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,918
occupier to the new one and in here when

681
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,960
i clear this out

682
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,278
uh i do the same so if if the

683
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,278
you know

684
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,798
if the place that's if if the uh the ref

685
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,759
that we're actually

686
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,278
setting if that's getting cleared then

687
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:14,319
the previous occupier

688
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,319
for that one also gets saved

689
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,839
right

690
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:25,678
that seems like what i probably want

691
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:29,439
and when you sent this yeah so the the

692
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,440
weird thing is that if desired is not

693
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,120
like i don't quite understand why this

694
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,759
has to

695
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,599
exist because if you want to remove

696
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,158
something from the system entirely it

697
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:43,599
seems like you can't really do that

698
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,000
which seems bad so i would assume that

699
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,278
you would

700
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,519
want actually in here

701
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:49,519
like

702
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,558
when you look at the reference to a

703
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,880
traversable here

704
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,839
it seems like you would want that to

705
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
just work

706
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:13,839
like if this is zero it should be fine

707
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,918
i don't know i think i would prefer that

708
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,840
and maybe that's stupid but

709
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,360
i think i would prefer that so basically

710
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:28,158
like if the

711
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,158
desired occupier uh

712
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,038
oops

713
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,278
like if this comes back no i guess is

714
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,320
what i'm saying

715
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,319
that seems okay

716
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,319
meaning meaning i guess i don't know why

717
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,640
we can't just

718
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,639
do this

719
00:29:53,359 --> 00:30:00,798
like get the dest if there is a dest

720
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,960
then we clear it out right

721
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:08,720
get the desired if there is a desired

722
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,038
then set it but either way

723
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,038
um

724
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,919
this happens

725
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:24,879
right so as long as

726
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,880
this is not true

727
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:37,839
we we definitely do this

728
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,919
uh so yeah

729
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,798
something this is a little more

730
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,799
complicated but

731
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,640
maybe there should be a null traversable

732
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,159
and everyone just gets set onto it or

733
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
something but you know i'm just trying

734
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,519
to

735
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,519
see how this would work

736
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,720
um so i think that's okay so we

737
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,399
basically say all right we're gonna do a

738
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,519
transactional occupy we get the

739
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,839
destination

740
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,960
that we're set like destination's a bad

741
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,720
word here it's

742
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,558
we probably want to call it something

743
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,399
like the mover

744
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,599
right because it's the person it's the

745
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,479
mo it's the

746
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:38,240
reference that's being moved right um

747
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,599
so i might say like look this is the

748
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,599
movers reference

749
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:51,759
so the movers reference we will get

750
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:54,319
we get it and we update it

751
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,319
like so

752
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:02,640
right and then we go and say

753
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,600
where we do we want to go and we get the

754
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
we get that one if it exists so it might

755
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,278
not exist

756
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,919
right it could just be zero if it exists

757
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:16,000
then we look to see if we can move

758
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,038
right if we can move we do like so

759
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,159
um if otherwise we don't if we can't

760
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,119
move

761
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,600
right then then we would do this right

762
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,119
and

763
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:30,240
since we only want to update

764
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,079
where we're coming from uh in

765
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,759
the case where we succeeded this should

766
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,639
probably go in here

767
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,759
right meaning we don't want to clear the

768
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,720
place we're coming from

769
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,319
unless we actually were able to move

770
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,798
which i think this does

771
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:50,798
right so i think that allows us to

772
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,798
keep both of them um

773
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:01,759
properly

774
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,759
yeah also

775
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:11,839
where's the sampling lighting

776
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,839
generator thing there it is

777
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,890
okay um

778
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:19,889
[Music]

779
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,679
so i think that's okay um

780
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,959
and now i just want to create some of

781
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,278
those

782
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,159
uh and i can play around with them right

783
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,759
and since i

784
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,519
did that update also i can get rid of

785
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:40,079
the hack

786
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,079
uh so now this can be proper right

787
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,879
so now i can say okay

788
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:57,158
in transactional occupy we'll move this

789
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,159
[Music]

790
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:10,800
we'll move this guy to nowhere

791
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:14,398
whatever that is to null space

792
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,960
right um so we'll just say look this

793
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,199
this guy

794
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,000
goes away he's he's gone and i'll i'll

795
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,158
leave this

796
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,838
like weird like set the position up

797
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,838
thing and that's just

798
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,440
my way of trying to figure out whether

799
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:26,639
it works or not so i can see if it

800
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,398
raises i mean we can hop

801
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,000
through it because it'll that will be a

802
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,878
trigger that will show us what's going

803
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,918
on as well but just be easier to see

804
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,319
so we'll try this and now what i need to

805
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,398
do

806
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,200
is i can actually handle the switch

807
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:44,319
state stuff in here

808
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:46,319
so what i can do is say all right uh if

809
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,280
the tile so the tile has it

810
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,559
has traversables right and we know that

811
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,560
there's just going to be the one

812
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,159
because each tile that you hop on is

813
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:59,199
only supposed to have one of these

814
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,200
right so we would say okay there's a

815
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:03,838
traversible

816
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,440
and i just want to take a look at this

817
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,480
traversible so i want to say

818
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,480
okay the

819
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,920
the previous occupier in the occupier

820
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,838
oops

821
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,760
if you stepped on the thing these will

822
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,119
be different

823
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:44,240
right and so what i'm going to do

824
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:48,240
is say if

825
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:51,679
they're different and the occupier

826
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:59,519
is valid right

827
00:35:51,679 --> 00:36:02,799
uh then i want to change my switch state

828
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:06,159
or something you know what i'm saying

829
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,200
uh and the only question i have here is

830
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:11,598
what should happen next with these

831
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,639
but i think what i would probably say is

832
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,960
after that

833
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,960
then they are like considered processed

834
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,519
right and i don't know if we want that

835
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,760
to happen

836
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,000
as a sweep like something that happens

837
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:41,839
at the end

838
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:41,838
i don't know um

839
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,240
and that's just whether or not we want

840
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:51,279
to look at that any other time

841
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:54,559
right uh and i don't know

842
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,440
so in terms of is it really true we have

843
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,358
this exact

844
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,679
problem before i thought we'd looked and

845
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,559
to see if entity ids

846
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,118
uh had it at an r equal and i thought we

847
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:08,559
wrote it

848
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,480
oh it's is equal is it is equal

849
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,799
we have is equal and r equal what the

850
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,800
heck

851
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,480
all right

852
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,480
i don't know how i feel about that

853
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,838
i think is equal is officially getting

854
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,839
the boot

855
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,838
um

856
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:52,480
i don't like is equal because it's

857
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:55,679
not things you don't say that in english

858
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,280
right is valid because it's one thing

859
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,960
are equal because there's two things

860
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,480
right that's just

861
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,440
just english you could argue that

862
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,719
english is not a particularly

863
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,079
well-designed language and you're

864
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:09,679
probably not wrong

865
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,320
but we are programming in it

866
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,078
and much like we don't get to not use c

867
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,960
syntax because we don't like the way it

868
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,480
was designed

869
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,920
we don't get to not use english just

870
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,280
because we don't like the way it was

871
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,599
designed

872
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,720
okay so now we need a few more things

873
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,640
first of all we need to create these

874
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,078
switches but also i probably should have

875
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:32,159
some way

876
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,160
of making the switches uh

877
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,399
show that they're down so maybe i'll use

878
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,799
the z trick for those as well

879
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,440
so maybe i'll do something here where i

880
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,280
do like

881
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,679
okay the tile pz minus equals

882
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,480
something right so it'll like sink down

883
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:48,559
into the floor

884
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,838
just temporarily and again we'll have to

885
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,320
decide how we want to handle

886
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,279
like what we want to show in terms of

887
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,838
animation or

888
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,040
like glowing we will want real stuff

889
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,920
there

890
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,000
um so for now i'm just going to do some

891
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,599
random crappy stuff but we'll figure out

892
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,920
what we want to actually do for reals

893
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,920
later

894
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,480
so then when we go into uh room gen

895
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,440
when we set up the door right we had a

896
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,639
thing

897
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,480
uh in here that sets up a door

898
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:23,838
and you can see that happening

899
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,480
somewhere in here right here

900
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:27,358
right so in here where we've got like

901
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,159
doors

902
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:32,239
we're actually creating these doors uh

903
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,279
this is where we would need to create

904
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:39,279
like a brain for this particular

905
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,560
set of switches you know it occurs to me

906
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:57,839
that we create a brain for the room

907
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:57,838
maybe that's where that should have been

908
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,880
what the heck is special brain slot

909
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,838
so it's literally just the zeroth brain

910
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,838
slot

911
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:11,838
right

912
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,400
so i guess what i would say is no it

913
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,078
probably shouldn't be part of the room

914
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,599
because what if we want like

915
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,560
one brain for like what if we want like

916
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,640
two patterns

917
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,000
in the same room that doesn't seem like

918
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,039
the kind of thing that would be all that

919
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,880
far-fetched

920
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:31,119
so we probably don't actually want to do

921
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,119
that

922
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,359
so i'm going to say let's create a

923
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,480
different one

924
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:41,679
instead right so i'll just

925
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,800
create a brain at the top of this thing

926
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:48,639
uh and like

927
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,640
i don't even remember how

928
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,078
i don't even remember how this thing

929
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,838
happens

930
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,960
so in here for example you can see

931
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,838
there's a no brain

932
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,720
so there's a brain id and a brain type

933
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,838
right

934
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,838
and inside the entity

935
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,039
you want to be able to set those both

936
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,240
right and i assume they do get set

937
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:35,838
yeah so

938
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,838
we know like

939
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,880
we know that this is pretty obvious what

940
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,000
that's set to

941
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,000
um that's just set to switches and then

942
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,039
whichever one

943
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,199
of them it is but

944
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,559
i don't actually know how the brain id

945
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,399
was supposed to be set because i don't

946
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,318
see any of these here so i'm assuming

947
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,079
that you just call that

948
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:05,759
um on the actual sim region

949
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,519
or world right because it generates

950
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,200
brains

951
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,199
you just ask for new brains right

952
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,000
like this so i'm assuming what we would

953
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:23,679
want to do is when we go

954
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,199
at the top here uh we would just

955
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,039
create one of these and we could be

956
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,679
frugal and say oh we don't want to

957
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:29,358
create

958
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,039
any brains for rooms that don't have

959
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:35,358
them but who cares

960
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:38,079
it's literally just a number right

961
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,078
it doesn't matter

962
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,039
it doesn't take up any actual storage

963
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:50,719
okay so we want

964
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:54,159
to talk about the sim region

965
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:57,519
which is what in gen region i believe

966
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:59,679
uh off of this because we need to

967
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,838
it looks like ad brain works well

968
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,759
actually i guess you only need the world

969
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,078
so actually i don't even need the sim

970
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,000
region never mind

971
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,640
uh so in this case we only really need

972
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,639
the worlds

973
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,318
although maybe i should go through the

974
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,318
region anyway because i mean i can

975
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,559
because we do have one

976
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:18,559
uh

977
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,199
but it would just be gen world there

978
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,440
right

979
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,439
um

980
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:41,838
so it's that right there so so maybe we

981
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,838
would just do it here

982
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:45,599
so in here we just grab the region that

983
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:50,480
we're

984
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,800
using and we say we need a new brain

985
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,760
i don't have any plans for how we're

986
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,640
going to do this stuff

987
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,160
yet so i assume what i would do is just

988
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,679
randomly pick

989
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:04,318
a particular location just straight up

990
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,318
out of the blue

991
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:09,838
um

992
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:25,358
so in here where we create

993
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:28,639
this entity that's the

994
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,239
a tile right and so we just need

995
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,960
something here which is like

996
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,239
is this going to be one of the switches

997
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,280
right

998
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,959
um and we'll probably want to do this i

999
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,599
guess the way we would actually do it is

1000
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,119
maybe

1001
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,318
using the sort of placement thing

1002
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,680
i guess um because we'd want to have

1003
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:50,960
little patterns that get like

1004
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,960
dropped down into the room

1005
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,358
so it might almost be this thing that we

1006
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,358
would do

1007
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,159
i i really don't know um

1008
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:05,440
where we try to find a place to put an

1009
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,559
entity group

1010
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,838
and then when we slap it down yeah so i

1011
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,799
think this might be where we would

1012
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:12,799
actually want to do this

1013
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,719
so maybe we'll do this uh

1014
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,879
we'll do that in there actually later

1015
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,399
right now i'm gonna do a more hard-coded

1016
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,880
thing

1017
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,160
uh and so i'll just take a look at the

1018
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,358
edit tile here

1019
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:35,920
and and this relative index i believe

1020
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,838
is all we would really need so i could

1021
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,039
just do something where i say

1022
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:47,838
like look if this

1023
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:47,838
um and in fact

1024
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,719
i don't i don't have any idea what this

1025
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,000
is doing

1026
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,000
does this color even get used

1027
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,079
oh it does

1028
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:10,318
and we stopped using it here but anyway

1029
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:15,599
um so if the rel index uh

1030
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,599
x equals i don't know 10.

1031
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,118
uh and the real index y equals

1032
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,599
five let's say

1033
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,639
um i really gotta update my four coders

1034
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,640
that stops happening

1035
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:42,559
drives me nuts um i guess

1036
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:44,480
and i and i i really just don't know

1037
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,639
i just want to see what tile that would

1038
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,639
be

1039
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:57,838
and this is called what again tile

1040
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,640
so now uh i want to see if

1041
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,439
if i go into a room that's sufficiently

1042
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,358
large

1043
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:18,480
will i see a highlighted tile anywhere

1044
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,000
and i don't i don't seem to

1045
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,559
so that that does not seem to have

1046
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,559
worked at all

1047
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,839
am i missing something there

1048
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,679
because it seems like

1049
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,838
like that should have worked

1050
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,598
so i don't know why that didn't work

1051
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,960
exactly let me take a look at what that

1052
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,318
that rail index actually is and we'll

1053
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,519
step through the debugger because i

1054
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:12,558
assume that rail index is what we

1055
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,159
actually want

1056
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:19,599
so like when we look at um iterate

1057
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:23,920
as planar tiles here uh

1058
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,920
i assume this will update that

1059
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,680
yeah so like this should work right

1060
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:37,679
um

1061
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,800
so i feel like that should have set like

1062
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,039
one you know just

1063
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,400
just one but it should have set one of

1064
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:46,239
the tiles

1065
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,240
to be uh

1066
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,400
offset like that

1067
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:56,318
because it or not offset uh to be bright

1068
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:56,318
cyan

1069
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,400
and it does not appear to have done so

1070
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:01,599
so

1071
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,519
maybe i'll just take a look at what

1072
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,039
happens there because

1073
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:08,880
i don't understand why that didn't work

1074
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,719
let me just see does it ever actually

1075
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:17,838
trigger that code

1076
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:17,838
um as a starting point

1077
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,599
all right so in here

1078
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,280
i'm just going to look to see first do i

1079
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,440
ever hit this code

1080
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,440
so i do hit this code right

1081
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:59,838
for some unknown reason it doesn't seem

1082
00:49:49,760 --> 00:50:01,920
to have any effect

1083
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:03,119
i mean it could be that i just can't see

1084
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,519
it i

1085
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,240
don't think that's highly plausible but

1086
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:07,440
let me

1087
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,919
now that i know that it's actually

1088
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,159
firing um

1089
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,760
i could also change some other aspects

1090
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,759
of the tile to see if that's the case

1091
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:23,838
um maybe we're not using that

1092
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,318
uh color anywhere it could be that we're

1093
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,519
not

1094
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:30,159
that would be weird but

1095
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:32,079
you can see like oh no there it is

1096
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:32,558
there's the yellow when i said cyan i

1097
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,720
was

1098
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,640
obviously totally wrong it's actually

1099
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,838
yellow i don't know why i said cyan

1100
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:40,879
i guess i was reading it bgra for some

1101
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:44,799
reason

1102
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,358
so okay so it appears to have worked

1103
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,000
after all because there's the tile

1104
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:51,598
right you can see its reflectivity is is

1105
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,519
yellow

1106
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,240
so let me try something slightly

1107
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:59,599
different here just to make sure

1108
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:02,719
so if i go into the room gen again

1109
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,880
and let's suppose that i

1110
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:07,039
instead set its reflectivity to like

1111
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,079
nothing

1112
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,759
so it's like just not there um or very

1113
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,000
faint

1114
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,000
right

1115
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:24,639
uh and then i'm also gonna say that like

1116
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,318
the entity

1117
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:37,838
brain uh in this case

1118
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:37,838
is gonna be that that brain

1119
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,679
that we created for the room

1120
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,679
yeah so it's going to be the room switch

1121
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,880
brain

1122
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:56,879
and the particular slot in question is

1123
00:51:52,880 --> 00:52:00,000
just going to be like uh the

1124
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,000
tile slots

1125
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,358
so this thing right

1126
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:07,358
uh and

1127
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:17,119
i guess you'd do

1128
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:18,480
this so i say i want the indexed brain

1129
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,640
slots

1130
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:26,400
for the switches

1131
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:28,400
this is the doors zero

1132
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,838
we probably want an actual counter here

1133
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,680
so we can make more than one but at the

1134
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,480
moment i don't have a count or

1135
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,440
i'm only setting it for one tile so you

1136
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,838
would do this

1137
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,838
and then

1138
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:45,280
in the when we create the door

1139
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,160
we would do the same thing so like down

1140
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,839
here

1141
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:52,000
uh when we check for like the door

1142
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,119
back and forth bit so like there's a

1143
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,920
room a room b

1144
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,640
door thing this thing we would just say

1145
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,440
like

1146
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,000
same thing only this one is in the

1147
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,000
unlocks

1148
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,119
right um and this one

1149
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,039
we could pretty easily since we know

1150
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,480
what's going on we could say like

1151
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,759
the door index is 0 here and the door

1152
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,800
index

1153
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:22,079
goes here right

1154
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:29,680
um and we could also like assert

1155
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:32,160
that the door index

1156
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,838
uh is is less than the number that we

1157
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:37,598
have

1158
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,599
right so brain switches

1159
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,839
i don't know if you can you probably

1160
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,838
can't

1161
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,760
c plus is always disappointing so i

1162
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:48,558
don't know why i'm even bothering to

1163
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:57,839
type this in

1164
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:57,839
but assuming that you did this

1165
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,079
hey i don't know if that actually worked

1166
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,519
or c bus plus produced something else

1167
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,680
but like i just wanted to say hey can

1168
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,800
you tell me how big that array would be

1169
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:14,558
normally um so anyway again

1170
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,359
not really sure that this helps us at

1171
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,359
all at the immediate moment but we'll go

1172
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,279
ahead and see

1173
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,639
if any of this code now works so there's

1174
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,599
the darkened one

1175
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,199
you know what i would uh like to do is

1176
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,880
oh that was good so we got a crash in

1177
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:33,118
there which we probably didn't

1178
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,160
quite do that transactional occupy right

1179
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,240
so we'll take a look at that in a second

1180
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,199
but what i was going to say is that lets

1181
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,399
us know it triggered

1182
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:40,480
i was going to say let's also set the

1183
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,680
color to something

1184
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,719
so that we can tell so anyway inside the

1185
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:45,989
brains

1186
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,250
here

1187
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:49,250
[Music]

1188
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,719
let's also say like tile uh there's

1189
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:57,519
pieces

1190
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,519
for this thing

1191
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:01,838
uh and so what i wanted to do was maybe

1192
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,838
say

1193
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:07,838
well let's suppose that

1194
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:16,559
there we go let's suppose that the

1195
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,559
pieces for this thing

1196
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:21,679
are

1197
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,920
going to have their colors changed as

1198
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:23,919
well

1199
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,838
so there's the color

1200
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:38,318
and maybe we'll just do like blue

1201
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:38,318
or something

1202
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,559
okay and then our transaction occupy

1203
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,760
seems to

1204
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,760
not be correct for zero moves which is

1205
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,000
the kind that's happening here

1206
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,880
so when we pass the null space as the

1207
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,239
desired

1208
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,079
so to this thing right uh

1209
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,519
the question is like what happened here

1210
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,359
something

1211
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,798
evidently screwed up and we can

1212
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,960
i don't know try to figure out what that

1213
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:06,960
is

1214
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:17,838
let's take a look at get reversible

1215
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,559
so it should it looks like it should

1216
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,400
allow us to

1217
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:29,359
um produce you know

1218
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,000
null pointers you know what i mean this

1219
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:32,719
should work

1220
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,679
it should return the null since this

1221
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:38,239
won't set it'll set this to true

1222
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:40,078
um then when we go in here it'll say

1223
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:43,519
give us the move

1224
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:48,240
person back so we got that it'll

1225
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:52,079
swap up up it will swap

1226
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:54,879
the occupiers around

1227
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,640
and then complete i don't see where the

1228
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,519
code goes wrong there

1229
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:01,679
so unfortunately i may have to just go

1230
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:03,519
ahead and run this in debug mode

1231
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,440
real quick to see what the heck happened

1232
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:06,960
there

1233
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,200
we should probably add a flag to turn

1234
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,400
lighting off in debug mode

1235
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,199
when we want to because uh the game runs

1236
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,200
just fine

1237
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,639
it's only the lighting that's super slow

1238
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,719
in debug mode

1239
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:21,920
um what i really would like is a way to

1240
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:23,919
just tell it optimize that one file

1241
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,119
but of course you can't do that very

1242
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,318
conveniently it's

1243
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:31,440
real pain in the butt um

1244
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:34,318
in msvc unfortunately but anyway

1245
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,679
so i'll try hopping onto that tile uh

1246
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:36,000
and we'll see what happens although i

1247
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:37,838
guess

1248
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,838
i don't know if i can hop onto this

1249
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:45,279
particular tile

1250
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,279
is this um

1251
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:50,000
oh so actually i don't know if that's

1252
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,679
true it might be fine we just forgot to

1253
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,920
check to see if this is valid

1254
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,838
that's all because there may be no

1255
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,159
unlocks

1256
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,480
so so never mind that was probably the

1257
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:03,279
only problem

1258
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,280
famous last words

1259
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:14,078
um okay so

1260
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:17,680
assuming we go hopping along here

1261
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:20,839
i don't know there's the other tile

1262
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:23,838
um so it's set

1263
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:23,838
and

1264
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,440
okay so so basically this seems to work

1265
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,318
fine

1266
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,880
um right and the main concern we have

1267
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,079
here is

1268
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:45,680
is we'll just we need to

1269
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:48,318
oh man this dude like already opened the

1270
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:48,318
freaking door

1271
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,920
dude that's our door oh

1272
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,440
i like the fact that since it gets lower

1273
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,280
each time eventually

1274
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,358
it will trap him in there because he

1275
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,599
will hop onto it

1276
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:03,119
and it will be too low because i just

1277
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,359
set it down

1278
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,630
from where it is every time you hop on

1279
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:07,759
it

1280
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:11,519
[Laughter]

1281
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,520
that's funny um

1282
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,519
that's pretty great so this dude's just

1283
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,960
screwed like he's just

1284
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,838
that's he's just down there and he's

1285
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,838
never getting back up

1286
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:26,318
that's great um but in theory you know

1287
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,318
i will be the person who who normally

1288
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,440
hops on those things

1289
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,358
um like so so what we would need to the

1290
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,760
ma the only real thing we need to worry

1291
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,358
about

1292
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:41,280
here uh is is like

1293
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:42,558
do we need to is is how do we want to

1294
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,240
make it

1295
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:49,359
so that these uh

1296
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,598
the the animation is synchronized

1297
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:53,838
also why are there no doors on these

1298
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:57,680
lower levels

1299
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,679
oh there are some

1300
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,839
i don't know where how we were setting

1301
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,839
that value

1302
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,960
um so yeah the idea here is just that

1303
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,519
like

1304
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,000
we know ahead of time what will happen

1305
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,159
and so

1306
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,559
that uh it triggers immediately

1307
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:21,279
uh and like well you can't really see it

1308
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,359
here but

1309
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,319
you know this must be an item room

1310
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:28,480
that's why it's

1311
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:30,239
yeah uh so yeah it must be the case that

1312
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,760
like

1313
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:34,959
that those rooms don't get doors or i

1314
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,960
didn't set those for doors

1315
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:43,838
i don't know how did we decide that

1316
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,838
that has nothing to do with it

1317
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:53,838
so here's where we set this thing

1318
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,879
so i really don't know i mean i'm not

1319
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:04,960
sure

1320
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,000
this is a bit weird because like yeah we

1321
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:10,079
you know these don't

1322
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,079
have doors these ones don't

1323
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:21,838
um

1324
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:37,358
ah okay so there's some kind of weird

1325
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,358
nonsense where oh wow okay

1326
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:52,319
so i guess what can happen here is you

1327
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,318
well you know i don't really know

1328
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,880
but i can see why there's like some

1329
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,399
weirdness there so i don't want to

1330
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,000
draw any conclusions from that because

1331
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,200
this code is is kind of crazy

1332
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,798
actually interesting um

1333
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,558
so anyway yeah what i was trying to say

1334
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,798
before is just that like the

1335
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,200
that all seems to work fine and let's

1336
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,480
just try making some more of them first

1337
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,558
and we'll see what happens but really

1338
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,920
the main problem now is just fixing

1339
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:25,119
the fact that um

1340
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,599
there's not enough like there's there's

1341
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,240
not animation synchronization between

1342
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,760
those

1343
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:32,639
so like when i hop it immediately makes

1344
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,480
the door open

1345
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,798
before i've even landed on the tile

1346
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:41,039
because the game knows that will happen

1347
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:44,559
ahead of that's great

1348
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,799
um since the game knows that will happen

1349
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,760
it it starts the animation ahead of time

1350
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:49,280
so that

1351
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,359
is an interesting question like how do

1352
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,359
we want to trigger those

1353
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:57,199
uh animations so that they happen

1354
01:03:55,358 --> 01:03:59,279
more in line with when the actual hop

1355
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,318
finishes and i don't know how we want to

1356
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,599
do that

1357
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:06,318
yet at the moment what i want to do

1358
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,500
is in the room generator i would like to

1359
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:08,719
figure out how to

1360
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,838
[Music]

1361
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:13,838
maybe make a few more of these just for

1362
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:13,838
testing

1363
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:27,838
and i also i guess so

1364
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:27,838
let's see so

1365
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,559
so assuming that i i use a switch index

1366
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,960
here and i and i increment it

1367
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:40,000
i just want like a way of looking to see

1368
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,159
uh what these are so so maybe like i'll

1369
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:55,280
just do a square for now so i'll do

1370
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:59,279
like you know this sort of thing

1371
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:09,839
so i'll say look anywhere

1372
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:09,839
uh in this square is fine

1373
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,200
that should create four switches on the

1374
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:23,838
floor

1375
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:23,838
right

1376
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,960
in theory

1377
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:51,838
uh and so to get out the door you should

1378
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:51,838
have to hop on all four yeah

1379
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,599
so that's fine um

1380
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:19,838
yeah so couple things uh

1381
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,599
since we want the switches to light up

1382
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,519
uh one of the problems we're gonna have

1383
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,960
here

1384
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:38,719
is that this probably implicates the

1385
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,159
renderer a little bit in the sense that

1386
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:43,519
we want those switches to like

1387
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:46,399
actually glow now it's pretty easy

1388
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:48,079
to make them so that dude stop hopping

1389
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,680
on my switches you know what let me just

1390
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,680
let me just make it so that they don't

1391
01:06:51,838 --> 01:07:01,838
do what they're doing right now

1392
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:24,959
so yeah so what we want to do here

1393
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:28,159
is we want to go ahead and say

1394
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,880
if there's an occupier on here we set

1395
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:32,879
the z

1396
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,599
down but if there isn't we set the z

1397
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,599
back up

1398
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:43,838
i mean one way to do it would be this

1399
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,440
so if you went from having someone on

1400
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:11,680
you to not having someone on you

1401
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:14,880
right uh and and then the opposite

1402
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,238
which is a total hack but i mean at this

1403
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,719
point i don't really care because i'm

1404
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:24,238
not i don't have any strong opinions

1405
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:26,719
about what we're doing in here

1406
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,000
oh i think i've got this wrong though do

1407
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,198
i

1408
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,798
no no that's that's correct um so like

1409
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,599
in theory that would make it so that

1410
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,838
they would

1411
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,838
they would go down and then up right

1412
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:39,838
probably

1413
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,838
um so the other problem that i think we

1414
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:06,640
would have here

1415
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:08,238
is i do suspect we might get errors

1416
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,838
so one of the problems that we never

1417
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,278
really solved with the brain thing

1418
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:12,798
because i like the brain thing but there

1419
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,440
is kind of a critical flaw in it

1420
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:17,198
and we we kind of think about it and

1421
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:20,559
that is that

1422
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:25,358
the opening like opening the door

1423
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,359
right all it's doing is checking to see

1424
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:39,599
if for a given simulation region

1425
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,600
if there is a door right

1426
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:45,519
and it will just take all of the

1427
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,519
switches that go with that door

1428
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,600
that are in the region but if you

1429
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,199
imagine taking a simulation region that

1430
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,079
included the door but none of its

1431
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,319
switches

1432
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:58,479
it would immediately unlock right

1433
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:59,920
so the problem is i think you end up in

1434
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:02,399
a situation where

1435
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,199
you don't know how many switches there

1436
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,439
are supposed to be

1437
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,960
for this door because the brain is just

1438
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,439
collecting them and nobody bothered to

1439
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,158
write

1440
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,879
no one no one actually keeps that that

1441
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,960
number

1442
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,640
right so what i want to do to see

1443
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,158
i'm just curious if that's happening

1444
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,679
what i want to do is

1445
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:21,679
maybe say look

1446
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:30,480
when you do the pz for the

1447
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:34,719
um for the door

1448
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:38,319
maybe let's make that be like really

1449
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:40,319
not much so we can still see that the

1450
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,840
thing is like halfway submerged in the

1451
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:45,840
ground or something i don't know

1452
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,840
um

1453
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,520
you know what i'm saying

1454
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:53,599
oh and the other thing is we have to see

1455
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:59,839
this needs a state

1456
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:59,840
as well so we would need like this

1457
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:13,840
so we don't keep doing it right

1458
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:27,840
yeah so this needs one of these

1459
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:45,119
so that way we can just say look if this

1460
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,920
thing already got unlocked we don't

1461
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:48,880
unlock it multiple times

1462
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,399
because we don't want to play like

1463
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,760
multiple sounds or like displace the

1464
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:52,960
thing multiple times or any of that

1465
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,039
stuff

1466
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,480
so i'm just curious to know if i now hop

1467
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:59,439
through here

1468
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:00,959
like do i see doors that are unlocked

1469
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,198
that i didn't unlock

1470
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,800
and for the for for whom the switches

1471
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:08,799
are not down

1472
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:12,320
would be the other way to say it

1473
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,760
um so there's the door dude um and now

1474
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:15,279
you can see it sunk into the floor and i

1475
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:18,960
can hop through it

1476
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:20,840
um so this one didn't have a door

1477
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,679
because this is a special room

1478
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,960
right uh so this is

1479
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:37,840
unsurprising and and fine like that

1480
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:37,840
doesn't matter at all

1481
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:41,759
um so sunk into the ground as we would

1482
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:43,678
expect

1483
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,239
not sunk into the ground yet sunk into

1484
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,239
the ground now

1485
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:55,520
uh sames

1486
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:58,000
so there right so i do think this bug

1487
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,760
exists in practice right and i think

1488
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,079
that's something we would need to figure

1489
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,480
out

1490
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:03,279
how we're going to deal with right the

1491
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,639
brains

1492
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,639
need to have some

1493
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:12,719
some way of coping with that and i don't

1494
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:12,718
know

1495
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:21,119
um

1496
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,119
that's a tough one

1497
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:28,399
there's obviously simple ways to get

1498
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:30,079
around it like the door could be set

1499
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:33,839
to how many switches it needs to have

1500
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:35,600
set and we just check against that value

1501
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,159
and that fixes the problem but it

1502
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,159
doesn't

1503
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,439
it doesn't fix the problem more

1504
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,840
generally

1505
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,199
and i wonder if it's just one of those

1506
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,519
things where like look this

1507
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:57,198
is a problem with with this whole way

1508
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,800
that you do brains and it just can't

1509
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:00,000
really be fixed so you just have to work

1510
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,560
around it

1511
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,960
um and i and i would like to be able to

1512
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,039
i would like to know which it is right

1513
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,480
like is there some more clever way of

1514
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:11,119
doing the brains the way we're doing

1515
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,079
them that

1516
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:16,960
makes this not a problem or is that like

1517
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:16,960
always a problem

1518
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:29,840
uh and i and i just don't know

1519
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,239
so that requires more thought like that

1520
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:38,319
requires me to think

1521
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,599
pretty hard about what i want to do with

1522
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:43,840
those things and

1523
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,840
i just don't know um

1524
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,440
yeah i don't know

1525
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,119
it's neither here nor there we know a

1526
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:02,559
hack that could fix it and the other way

1527
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:03,198
to fix it would just be to not use

1528
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,120
brains

1529
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,559
right you you just have brains be actual

1530
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:06,960
entities that have to get paged in and

1531
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,480
they

1532
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,840
keep with them state you know there's a

1533
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:11,119
whole bunch of things you can do and i

1534
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,960
don't know how we wanted i don't know

1535
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:16,559
how we want to deal with it

1536
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,679
um but that's you know that is what it

1537
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,560
is

1538
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,920
so one thing i would like to do maybe

1539
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,159
just see how hard it would be

1540
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,000
to just move this into the thing that

1541
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:28,158
actually just does placement

1542
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,399
so in the fine place to put entity group

1543
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:30,399
thing

1544
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:38,159
um i was wondering if maybe this

1545
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:53,840
would work so when we do gen

1546
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:53,839
entity at traversable

1547
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,158
i'm wondering if we're going to use this

1548
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,199
to put patterns in so

1549
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:12,079
when we call this you can see this thing

1550
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:13,678
calling the creator function which gets

1551
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:21,840
the region in the base hash

1552
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:21,840
if we were to just pass it instead

1553
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:49,840
so this this looks like searches right

1554
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:03,840
and so if we just made a thing here that

1555
01:16:54,399 --> 01:17:03,839
was just like

1556
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,520
um

1557
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,800
[Music]

1558
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,719
do you see what i'm saying i know this

1559
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,279
is kind of a little bit confusing

1560
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:31,760
but if we did something like this where

1561
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:35,119
inside the gen entity thing um

1562
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:38,079
if this thing just had like a flag

1563
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:39,679
that was like gennady like is switch or

1564
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:42,319
something

1565
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,199
you know what i'm saying where we just

1566
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:47,840
tested it

1567
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:49,599
and used the same process for everybody

1568
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,760
i don't know that that's a good idea but

1569
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,760
like

1570
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:59,679
if you just did that i'm wondering

1571
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:02,399
if you then can just use this system and

1572
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:05,039
go from there and and i don't know right

1573
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:08,479
like maybe you can maybe you can't

1574
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:11,279
um but if we then said all right so

1575
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:14,639
uh we take the room switchbrain thing

1576
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,639
and we put that down here

1577
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:22,158
when we start to do like doors and crap

1578
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:24,879
like so um and then we

1579
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,879
take out this part of the code that was

1580
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,960
monkeying around

1581
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,960
with the you know with with the

1582
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,640
the cube layout stuff all that thing we

1583
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,000
take that out

1584
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:41,840
and we just say all right if we want to

1585
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,840
add a switch we do that here

1586
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,520
like this

1587
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:51,839
i wonder if that if that just works and

1588
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,320
so

1589
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,360
the structural entity is this one here

1590
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:58,399
so i think

1591
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:58,399
you could just say

1592
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,280
that we grab the entity this way and we

1593
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:09,840
modify it like so

1594
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:09,840
i think that would just work

1595
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,360
and we will want to do stuff like change

1596
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:26,559
what it looks like there i suppose

1597
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:30,079
but otherwise i think that would do it

1598
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:33,840
and so uh if we then create

1599
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:39,119
when we're making a room that has a door

1600
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,640
uh like inside the world gen code

1601
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,399
and it places one of these door for me

1602
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:45,440
to be things

1603
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:47,759
then what we would do is place one of

1604
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:49,198
those like entities so much like we do

1605
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:53,280
play snake

1606
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:56,000
here we would do like place tile pattern

1607
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,000
or whatever

1608
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:02,799
right and

1609
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,320
again i don't really know what this

1610
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,600
looks like

1611
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:10,639
but we would say place tile pattern and

1612
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:14,000
we would do like add entity

1613
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:17,679
and the the function here

1614
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,890
would be like nothing at the moment

1615
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:22,239
right and the

1616
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:25,920
[Music]

1617
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:27,839
gen flags would just or in the thing

1618
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,600
and that would be it i don't know what

1619
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,400
place entity does in this case i guess

1620
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:36,079
it just adds it to the list of things

1621
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:38,559
yeah so so we would literally just do

1622
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:40,479
just this and maybe we would do

1623
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:44,880
something slightly differently here

1624
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:44,879
later i don't know um

1625
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,679
but it would literally just do that and

1626
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
i'm wondering if that would do placement

1627
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,158
for

1628
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,158
us

1629
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,199
um that way when we improve that routine

1630
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:57,760
to do lots of different kinds of

1631
01:20:57,198 --> 01:20:59,519
placement

1632
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,239
we'll just get we can piggyback on top

1633
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:04,880
of it right

1634
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:06,158
so i don't know what that would do or if

1635
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,880
that will work at all

1636
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:09,679
uh it doesn't look like it did so i

1637
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,960
guess i'm

1638
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:16,000
i'm wrong um but

1639
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,679
oh wait no that's false we only added it

1640
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,840
to rooms with doors

1641
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:22,158
so when i go down here it should be the

1642
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,719
case that only rooms with doors have one

1643
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:26,000
of these things so there's the door

1644
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:29,840
but doesn't look like it because there's

1645
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,840
no switch right

1646
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,639
and the door is unlocked so it didn't do

1647
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:38,079
anything

1648
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:38,079
oh but this one did

1649
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:46,000
huh that's odd so it was able to place

1650
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:57,840
it in that room but it wasn't able to

1651
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:57,840
place it into this room

1652
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:13,279
i'm kind of perplexed by that

1653
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,399
so that's weird uh i don't understand

1654
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:17,679
why it worked

1655
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:20,719
in everything but that first room

1656
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:22,399
also these guys are too uh

1657
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,000
crazy for their own good they're hopping

1658
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:26,000
all around uh

1659
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,039
so that's odd i don't know what's up

1660
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,679
with that we'll have to look at that

1661
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:31,760
later

1662
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:39,840
um but the reason i cared about that

1663
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:39,840
is that in theory like um

1664
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:50,079
in theory this thing where we like

1665
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:55,279
add

1666
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:56,559
conversations here you can see this

1667
01:22:55,279 --> 01:23:01,279
thing

1668
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:01,280
like appending entities to the group

1669
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,199
this this place of the orphan and this

1670
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:12,960
like appends entities

1671
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:12,960
to the um

1672
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:22,079
you know you using a a mask

1673
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,940
so i assume we can just do this like

1674
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,600
where we do

1675
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:35,839
[Music]

1676
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:35,840
chains like

1677
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,199
something like this

1678
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:49,839
and this could be random as well uh

1679
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,840
in fact sure

1680
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,920
presumably there's a good entropy yeah

1681
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,880
so we just take this entropy here that

1682
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,158
we're using

1683
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,000
and we say look there's going to be

1684
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:07,039
between you know

1685
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,880
two and eight tiles or something again

1686
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:11,600
it doesn't matter

1687
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,520
we're going to go through all the tiles

1688
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:17,840
that we would want to add here

1689
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,840
we'll add them like so

1690
01:24:18,079 --> 01:24:26,238
uh and then when we do

1691
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:28,238
place orphan here when this does it you

1692
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:29,929
can see it does like instead of place

1693
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,519
entity it does append entity

1694
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:33,840
[Music]

1695
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,840
right

1696
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:41,440
and so i just need to do like if tile

1697
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,439
index

1698
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:52,320
else you know what i'm saying

1699
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:52,319
so that way i can i can do this nonsense

1700
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:58,880
uh and i guess this needs to return the

1701
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:12,559
head end

1702
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:14,239
right so

1703
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,480
um and now that i think about it maybe i

1704
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,718
should maybe this should just be

1705
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,718
well

1706
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:27,839
let's do that

1707
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,239
so basically like we we take the first

1708
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,319
one

1709
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:37,599
and we we consider that the one we made

1710
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:37,599
and then for all the rest of them

1711
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:41,839
we do something different and in fact

1712
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:44,000
this this could actually be how we do

1713
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,000
that

1714
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:55,119
all right so that seems fine

1715
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,639
and all we would really need then is

1716
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:59,119
like this thing

1717
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:01,760
would need to be randomized so i don't

1718
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:05,519
actually know

1719
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,520
where those box masks come from at the

1720
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,840
moment

1721
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:18,399
so here are the box masks you can see

1722
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,399
uh you could say what do oh

1723
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,520
so i guess we don't even really care so

1724
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:26,319
so maybe we just say look

1725
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,320
it doesn't matter

1726
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:37,840
for now

1727
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:45,679
okay um so again i'm not sure

1728
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,679
if that's right

1729
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:50,638
and this code probably needs to be

1730
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:51,679
improved because now we're going to

1731
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,199
start to do

1732
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,880
things that have to be gamey so it's

1733
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:58,158
going to need like more awareness

1734
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,159
of what the heck is going on

1735
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,840
but

1736
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,800
i'm going to see if that lets me place

1737
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,679
tiles

1738
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,119
automatically so that at least it's all

1739
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:16,319
going through the same system so that as

1740
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,679
we improve that system

1741
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:22,158
it will be okay i don't know why that

1742
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,158
assertion

1743
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,840
so that looks like

1744
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:42,959
it looks like maybe it was not able to

1745
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,960
place

1746
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:49,359
these i should start with something a

1747
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:50,638
little bit more just to make sure i

1748
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:51,679
didn't screw something else up i should

1749
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:52,560
start with something a little more

1750
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:55,920
obvious first

1751
01:27:52,560 --> 01:28:01,199
probably um

1752
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:04,560
so let me just see

1753
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:06,879
uh um if i do something more modest

1754
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,880
first

1755
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,360
so it looks like it's it's really not

1756
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:20,800
able to do this and i'm not sure why

1757
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:20,799
so um i guess we'll take a look

1758
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:32,159
yes um so

1759
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,158
in here it looks like the problem there

1760
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,879
is that it's not able to actually

1761
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:38,238
place this thing right so when it's

1762
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:42,159
calling place room along

1763
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:45,599
edge it couldn't do it

1764
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:48,719
right so if we take a look at

1765
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:51,840
oops place room along

1766
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,840
edge and i run

1767
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,480
so here we are

1768
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:14,480
you know i'll be honest i don't actually

1769
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:16,719
i don't see how this could affect that

1770
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,718
though

1771
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,840
i mean obviously it must be

1772
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:32,399
because if it wasn't why did we stop

1773
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,760
play but

1774
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:39,839
that code isn't supposed to actually

1775
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,840
look at this yet is it

1776
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,079
so who is actually faulting out there

1777
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,920
like because because we don't ever tr we

1778
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:50,158
don't try to do that

1779
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,359
until we actually go to the room

1780
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:53,119
generator which

1781
01:29:51,359 --> 01:30:07,839
if it failed it wouldn't actually even

1782
01:29:53,119 --> 01:30:07,840
matter would it like it wouldn't

1783
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,238
like if this failed

1784
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,480
who cares

1785
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:22,319
like why would that even cause a problem

1786
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,279
nobody nobody faults on that

1787
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:32,718
so did did i do something boneheaded

1788
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:34,238
there then maybe because it

1789
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,239
right it doesn't look like that should

1790
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:37,919
really be a problem

1791
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:39,919
so when you're doing these identities

1792
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:44,158
here

1793
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:49,520
um and you push these things on

1794
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:51,359
right it should just kind of work

1795
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,400
and let me look at a pen entity to see

1796
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:56,079
what happens here so

1797
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:57,839
you know you pass the parent first which

1798
01:30:56,079 --> 01:31:00,840
is what's happening

1799
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:03,039
the dur mask on the child and that seems

1800
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,779
fine

1801
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:07,149
i don't see

1802
01:31:03,779 --> 01:31:07,148
[Music]

1803
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,480
i don't see anything weird going on

1804
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,840
there

1805
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,520
so i'm not sure i see how this is

1806
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,040
possibly how this is screwing anything

1807
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:31,840
up

1808
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:31,840
by just appending these

1809
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:45,839
like room entity groups shouldn't

1810
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:59,839
shouldn't cause a problem

1811
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,840
do

1812
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,840
do

1813
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:15,119
so i'm not seeing a lot of obvious stuff

1814
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,119
here why this would be a problem

1815
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,840
right

1816
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,600
i can't say i see like i don't see what

1817
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,960
the

1818
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:38,480
i don't see what the weirdness is

1819
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,480
that's that's a real strange one

1820
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,159
because this should not be tied into it

1821
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,960
at all and so the only thing i think of

1822
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:48,839
is that by creating something in a

1823
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:51,359
particular location that

1824
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,199
previously wasn't having something

1825
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,920
placed in it

1826
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:57,519
maybe that means that someone then tries

1827
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,199
to look to see if there's nothing in a

1828
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,880
particular location and finds that there

1829
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:03,439
is

1830
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,719
is like the only thing that i can think

1831
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:06,879
of

1832
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:08,719
that would make that happen but i'm not

1833
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:19,840
sure i don't know who in here is

1834
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:19,840
actually doing that

1835
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:24,238
and if i look at like place room along

1836
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,840
edge

1837
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:47,840
like nobody actually generates these

1838
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:47,840
rooms till they're all put down right

1839
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:15,520
so so like nobody even uses these

1840
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:16,479
during that pass so the only thing i can

1841
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:20,480
really think of

1842
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:22,238
is is just the act of using that entropy

1843
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:23,839
yeah it might just be that because this

1844
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:26,559
code is kind of crappy

1845
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,400
we haven't really done a good layout

1846
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,239
that that is guaranteed to actually

1847
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:34,799
complete

1848
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,799
it might just be that we had entropy

1849
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:40,639
right so in other words

1850
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,799
if that were the case you would expect

1851
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:47,600
to be able to do this

1852
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,600
and without touching the entropy do that

1853
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:51,039
and then it would just work

1854
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:58,319
yes perfect so basically it does

1855
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,439
actually work the only problem is that

1856
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:02,479
now it can't place

1857
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:04,799
that actual group so yeah so basically

1858
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:07,759
we just we're gonna need to like improve

1859
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,039
the way we're generating these layouts

1860
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,079
right

1861
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:13,519
and that's fine um

1862
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:15,118
because we kind of knew that was the

1863
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,880
case anyway

1864
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:18,319
if we look here at the gen room tile

1865
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:21,118
query stuff uh

1866
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:22,079
it's unable to place this entity group

1867
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:25,359
in

1868
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:26,800
whatever this room is right

1869
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:28,479
and if i look at what the entity group

1870
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,600
says uh

1871
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:31,599
i can look here and see

1872
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:42,239
it's 4 just like we expected i

1873
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,238
don't know why it says

1874
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,960
next direction used 0 probably because

1875
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:53,840
it hadn't actually found anything

1876
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:53,840
but i don't

1877
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:03,439
i don't know what that actually expects

1878
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:07,760
it to do in append entity

1879
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:11,279
so in allowed directions for next

1880
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,280
these are all set to zero

1881
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:21,039
which is not

1882
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:22,879
what it should have been

1883
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:25,118
so those should have all been set to

1884
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,118
like

1885
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:33,679
those should have been set to like all

1886
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,800
four bottom bits

1887
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:40,158
right so

1888
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:40,159
why is that

1889
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,719
why is that not setting those bottom

1890
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,840
bits

1891
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,600
maybe it is and then when it tries to

1892
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,639
place them it can't

1893
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,639
and they get cleared

1894
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:03,839
so let's see

1895
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:25,519
it just looks like it does a greedy

1896
01:38:24,158 --> 01:38:28,799
search

1897
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:29,520
right so it looks like it just does a

1898
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,560
complete

1899
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,960
really slow bad greedy search at the

1900
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:38,719
moment

1901
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,719
why would that not work

1902
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:46,639
let's take a look and see why that's

1903
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:50,559
failing because i

1904
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:52,560
don't think it should right

1905
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:56,320
because it should for some reason these

1906
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,320
are zero and this doesn't clear those

1907
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:03,520
it just uses next direction used right

1908
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,520
so it shouldn't

1909
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:13,839
it it should not have that problem

1910
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:23,519
so that's busted um so let's take a look

1911
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,359
at why

1912
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,159
why is append entity not properly

1913
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:41,839
setting that that

1914
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:41,839
that allowed directions um

1915
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:55,839
i can't i can't think of where that

1916
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:55,840
would be

1917
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,840
so here we are in playstyle pattern and

1918
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:08,000
you can see us calling append entity

1919
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,840
here

1920
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,118
uh looking through here right we would

1921
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:16,079
expect the parent now to have those set

1922
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:16,880
uh and that that is what we would expect

1923
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:22,319
to see

1924
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:24,000
right so those should always be set to

1925
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:28,479
15

1926
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:31,520
in all cases uh i would think

1927
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:36,000
and uh let me go ahead and jump forward

1928
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:37,840
to where these like like in here right

1929
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,920
and i'm just going to see if i can stop

1930
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:43,440
on one where we're actually doing

1931
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:50,158
one of these placements

1932
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:51,839
just to see this is not one of them this

1933
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:54,799
is

1934
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,560
so here we're trying to you can see that

1935
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,000
allowed directions for next is properly

1936
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,800
set to 15

1937
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,118
uh for one of these guys and it should

1938
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,840
be

1939
01:41:01,118 --> 01:41:11,599
for long oh

1940
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:11,600
oh they chained together

1941
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,840
okay

1942
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:24,479
oh

1943
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:30,399
what the hey okay so i don't like the

1944
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:33,760
way this works at all but you can see

1945
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:37,039
what happens here this is supposed to go

1946
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,039
like one after the other

1947
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:47,920
which is dumb

1948
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:50,399
so i mean the hack for fixing that is

1949
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:53,600
pretty easy is pretty simple

1950
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:55,118
right it's just that but

1951
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,719
i want to fix the way that works i don't

1952
01:41:55,118 --> 01:42:00,000
like that at all

1953
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:03,920
um that's too cumbersome to use

1954
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,118
in my opinion so that just worked just

1955
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,440
fine

1956
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,399
uh and now these things should be

1957
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:10,960
working but

1958
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:12,079
let's clean that up let's make that what

1959
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,359
we do next weekend

1960
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:15,519
we'll clean up these like layout

1961
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:17,359
placement things um

1962
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:18,880
and get these working better for for

1963
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:29,839
some kind of structures that

1964
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:29,840
you know that make sense gameplay wise

1965
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:52,560
these dudes hop on be hopping on all my

1966
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,960
switches

1967
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,480
i want to hop on the switches yes so

1968
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,198
this works fine now

1969
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:00,879
um and like i said i think we just want

1970
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:02,319
to clean this stuff up a bit

1971
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,600
now that we're going to actually care

1972
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:04,880
but like it's just putting it in the

1973
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:07,760
first available space

1974
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,960
each time which is all it's knows how to

1975
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,199
do

1976
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,158
all right um so i'm going to put a

1977
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:15,039
little to do in here

1978
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:15,039
and be like to do

1979
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:23,679
turn this into a list of some kind

1980
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:25,440
so it works cleaner but more broadly

1981
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:28,560
speaking we're going to have to now

1982
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:32,799
uh take a look at what we want to do

1983
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:39,840
uh for actually trying to get placements

1984
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:39,840
to mean something right

1985
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,719
yeah so regarding the question is it

1986
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:54,319
worth having the renderer check if it's

1987
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:55,439
running in debug mode or not and drop

1988
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:56,479
the number of learning samples to make

1989
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:58,960
it more playable

1990
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:00,399
uh yeah i do think that's a good idea

1991
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,158
what i would prefer

1992
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:04,479
is a separate switch for debug on

1993
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:06,629
lighting

1994
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:09,698
but i don't know uh

1995
01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:09,699
[Music]

1996
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,760
i don't really know how you want that to

1997
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:21,840
work

1998
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:21,840
more broadly um

1999
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:28,960
mainly what i want is just two switches

2000
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:30,479
one for optimization and one for

2001
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,439
optimization on lighting because i want

2002
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,039
to be able to run

2003
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:34,879
in essentially three different

2004
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:37,039
configurations all debug

2005
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,159
debug with release lighting and all

2006
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:39,920
release

2007
01:44:38,158 --> 01:44:41,759
and unfortunately the compiler makes it

2008
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,960
really hard to do that

2009
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,400
like ideally you'd be able to just

2010
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,239
bracket your code with pragmas it said

2011
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:48,079
turn on the optimizer here

2012
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:49,279
but don't think you can do that msvc you

2013
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:51,118
can do the opposite

2014
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,800
so you can have a thing that you bracket

2015
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:56,399
the code with the thing that says turn

2016
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,400
off the optimizer here

2017
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,840
but

2018
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:08,079
follows i'm pretty sure that pragma

2019
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:11,679
optimize can't

2020
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:14,639
turn the optimizer on

2021
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:16,880
it can only turn the optimizer off if

2022
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:20,560
it's already on

2023
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:24,319
so you can like turn the optimizer on

2024
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:27,280
in the switches then you can turn it

2025
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:27,840
off for a region and back on again but i

2026
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:29,840
don't

2027
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,159
know that there's any way to turn on

2028
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:34,719
optimizations that weren't already on in

2029
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:34,719
the switches

2030
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:38,960
if there are please let me know i

2031
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:40,560
believe llvm

2032
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:45,840
might be able to do that but i don't

2033
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,840
think msvc can

2034
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:51,118
the door switch stuff only allows for

2035
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,000
switches to trigger doors that are in

2036
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:54,079
the same room

2037
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,439
or can this work for triggering things

2038
01:45:54,079 --> 01:46:02,479
in other or multiple rooms etc

2039
01:45:57,439 --> 01:46:02,479
um so basically uh

2040
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:07,198
so basically here's the thing that we

2041
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:11,039
don't know

2042
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:14,479
at the moment the brain stuff uh

2043
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:17,039
just all the brain stuff does

2044
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:18,479
is it gathers up things that are

2045
01:46:17,039 --> 01:46:19,679
currently in the simulation region and

2046
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:23,198
simulates them

2047
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:25,920
so that they can work together right

2048
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:28,079
and i use that for a way to make the

2049
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,920
switches because it seems good because

2050
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:31,760
it can just gather things together but

2051
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:34,319
it has problems

2052
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,600
like the fact that if you happen to

2053
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:37,439
simulate something that

2054
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,000
cuts off some switches from a door then

2055
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:43,839
it wouldn't behave properly

2056
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,840
so i don't actually know

2057
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,679
what the best solution to that problem

2058
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:49,840
is

2059
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:52,079
there's lots of other ways you can do it

2060
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,079
right

2061
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,840
but

2062
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,039
i just don't know which way i want to do

2063
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,800
right

2064
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:05,039
and so the problem with having switches

2065
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,440
unlock a door somewhere else

2066
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:09,439
is that if you did that you would need

2067
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:11,839
some way of having that

2068
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:13,279
thing whatever this the the permanent

2069
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,800
switch status is

2070
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:17,439
would need to be something that can

2071
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,600
persist until you get over to there

2072
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:23,519
which it doesn't currently do

2073
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:25,840
right um

2074
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:28,080
and so like i said it's really it's it's

2075
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:30,400
very easy to

2076
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:33,359
there it's there's many ways you could

2077
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:33,359
fix that problem

2078
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:42,638
i just don't know which ways are good

2079
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:46,960
right and so that's really the issue

2080
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:51,600
um it's mostly an issue of me not being

2081
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:53,840
sure how i would like it to work

2082
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,840
so

2083
01:47:55,118 --> 01:48:05,679
i think it just remains to be seen you

2084
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:07,519
turn it on and then wrap the entire

2085
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,199
compilation unit in a pragma

2086
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,119
turning it off then turning it on again

2087
01:48:09,198 --> 01:48:12,079
when you need it uh yes i think you

2088
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:15,198
could

2089
01:48:12,079 --> 01:48:16,000
which is um the only way you could make

2090
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:19,839
this

2091
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,359
sort of work but again i just haven't

2092
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:33,840
been motivated to try to do something

2093
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:33,839
quite that squirrely

2094
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:15,839
all right

2095
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:29,359
thank you everyone for joining me for

2096
01:49:28,158 --> 01:49:30,879
the episode of handmade heroes and a

2097
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:32,158
pleasure coding with you as always if

2098
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,679
you would like to follow the series at

2099
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:35,519
home you can always pre-order the game

2100
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,480
on handmadehero.org and it comes with a

2101
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,040
source code

2102
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,559
so that you can play around with it uh i

2103
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:42,399
will be back here next weekend at which

2104
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:46,239
point i will take a look

2105
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:49,759
at how i want to deal with some of the

2106
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:51,198
brain slash entity placement things

2107
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,520
because now we're going to want to do

2108
01:49:51,198 --> 01:49:54,399
is basically create like different sorts

2109
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,760
of room

2110
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:58,879
types and stuff like that and so we're

2111
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,039
going to need to actually think about

2112
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:03,520
how we want the code for placing stuff

2113
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:04,800
in rooms to actually work

2114
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,159
the sort of stuff we have in there right

2115
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,960
now that just like does a greedy

2116
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:08,319
placement

2117
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,760
doesn't really work for gameplay

2118
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:11,679
purposes so we kind of need something

2119
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:15,119
that's going to be

2120
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:17,118
um more geared towards how we want so to

2121
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:19,598
be placed for gameplay purposes

2122
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:21,598
that may require just custom coding like

2123
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:23,840
we may not want a generic

2124
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:25,199
kind of thing for that so we'll have to

2125
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,639
see what we want to do

2126
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,879
and and basically i guess we'll just

2127
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,480
sort of we'll wing it for a little while

2128
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:32,560
and make some rooms that we think are

2129
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:34,000
sort of what we might want

2130
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:36,480
uh and then we can see whether there's

2131
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,560
stuff we can pull out of that or not

2132
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,000
uh we'll start that next weekend until

2133
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,599
then have fun programming everyone

2134
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,319
and i'll see you on the internet thank

2135
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:46,319
you everybody
