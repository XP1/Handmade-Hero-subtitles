00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:06,179
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:09,839
hero the show where we code a complete

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:11,250
game live on stream and honestly you

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,539
know one of the things and this is kind

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,490
of what I was lamenting just a minute

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:15,959
ago on the pre stream honestly one of

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,028
the things that kind of try to do and I

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,618
forget to say this a lot but it is kind

9
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:21,269
of one of the big reasons for

10
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:23,460
programming the way I program on

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,500
handmade hero is just to try to make

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,650
programming to be fun instead of a

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,778
Drudge you know a Drudge fast and i find

14
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,850
that for me a big part of making

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,469
programming fun is the fact that i am in

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,719
control of everything and i don't have

17
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,969
to worry about like what might be

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,410
happening in some library somewhere or

19
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,759
how something's being filtering this

20
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:44,968
stuff it's like it's all stuff that I

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,549
can go and I can fix and that kind of

22
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,960
helps and it also is you know it allows

23
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,308
me to kind of dive into stuff when I'm

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,149
interested in I can be like I'm kind of

25
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:52,140
interesting this I'm gonna go play

26
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,140
around with this and see what the deal

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,439
is here and that's kind of exciting and

28
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,820
fun and so I like that and what we've

29
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:02,429
been doing lately is kind of fun too

30
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,049
we've been making a debug user interface

31
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,969
for ourselves which is kind of just

32
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,320
really my excuse to show how to do some

33
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,060
simple user interface programming

34
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,009
because I know we won't really have much

35
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,269
of a chance to do that on the rest of

36
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,060
handmade hero there's really no reason

37
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:17,280
for it in the game and so what I'm doing

38
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,780
right now is sort of showing like okay

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,849
if you want to build some user interface

40
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,739
elements for your own use here's how you

41
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:24,539
would do them and so just doing kind of

42
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:26,339
the basic simple way that you could

43
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,860
construct some and give you a little

44
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,780
sort of like prime around like okay here

45
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,129
are some ways to think about you I stuff

46
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,719
and I'd like to jump back into that

47
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:34,949
because it was kind of fun and so I'd

48
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,259
like to explore a little bit more of

49
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,820
that so let's go ahead and do that if

50
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,409
you would like to follow along at home

51
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,508
of course if you've pre-ordered the game

52
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,090
on handmade hero org today is day 1 99

53
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,149
so you want to unzip day 198 source code

54
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,930
into a directory and that's what I'm

55
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:55,259
working with now so let's go ahead and

56
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,030
kind of take a little moment to refresh

57
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,828
here so if you look at the way this

58
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,840
stuff is working now it all kind of

59
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:02,519
works relatively nicely we have a

60
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,189
situation where we can sort of interact

61
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,750
with our our code and stuff here we can

62
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:09,868
make little debug variables that come

63
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,000
out that we can modify and we also have

64
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,379
the ability to insert other things like

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,060
profilers and stuff

66
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,590
you know in here that have kind of

67
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,120
special views and stuff like that and we

68
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,180
even have like little interactions that

69
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,860
we can work on Oh or maybe not looks

70
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,180
like we broke something looks like we

71
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,070
broke something at the end of the last

72
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,340
stream there it looks like the resized

73
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:33,419
profile thing does not always give a

74
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:37,039
valid variable there so that's kind of

75
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:41,669
interesting I'm not entirely sure why

76
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:45,509
but let's take a look here and see what

77
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:49,379
actually is the problem there so if I

78
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:53,219
take a look inside here we are in debug

79
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:58,919
interact yes and it is interacting with

80
00:02:53,219 --> 00:03:02,909
this guy VAR profile what is VAR so far

81
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:06,000
is null at the moment which i assume is

82
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:10,710
just that we got into a resize profile

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,080
somehow without setting that VAR or the

84
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,640
VAR got cleared and i just kind of did

85
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,590
some stuff at the very end of last dream

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,739
and I suspect I probably broke it which

87
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,390
is actually kind of good to be honest

88
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,129
because I think I hinted at this at the

89
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,109
other stream there are some things clean

90
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,519
up why's that we want to do here and one

91
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,740
of the reasons that you want to do them

92
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,780
is so that you don't get a bug like this

93
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,520
or I shouldn't say so that you don't get

94
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,080
a bug like this because obviously you

95
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,640
don't really probably care if you get it

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,560
a bug like this because it's probably

97
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,139
not super hard to fix but more to the

98
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,300
point just to make it easier for you to

99
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,469
manage sort of the state that's

100
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,959
happening in here because it starts to

101
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,389
get a little unwieldy as you can see and

102
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,280
it's just it's just nicer if you can do

103
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,379
it but I want to go verify that we know

104
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,030
what the bug is first before I fix it

105
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,219
because I would rather not do some

106
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,569
changes that will potentially fix that

107
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,129
bug without knowing what the bug

108
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,389
actually is because we may just mask the

109
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,549
bug at that point and I don't like

110
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,259
having a bug that you know may have

111
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,750
gotten mastin and we don't really know

112
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,969
it it's kind of lurking in there so what

113
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,860
I want to do is I want to take a look at

114
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:12,389
the resize profile thing you can see

115
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,590
here that the only way that you could

116
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:19,649
really set it to resize profile is is if

117
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,108
the next hot gets set d'ivoire so I just

118
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,939
want to take a look and see what's going

119
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:26,019
on there why are we getting into a

120
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:28,449
situation where

121
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:31,180
next hot is not being set properly right

122
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,848
like why is that actually happening so

123
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,110
let me take a look and see if I can see

124
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:40,930
why that is the case it looks like so we

125
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:44,680
so we are presumably setting this stuff

126
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,689
here yeah so I mean we're setting our

127
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,389
debug site hot hot interaction drag

128
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:52,959
hearty so the only thing is though that

129
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:56,710
just sets the hot variable and when we

130
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,228
begin interaction you can see you know

131
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:00,939
what this is the problem right here when

132
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:03,639
we made this modification to the code

133
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:05,978
right and we accept a new interaction

134
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,379
we're not accepting the variable

135
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:11,050
potentially it looks like that we should

136
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:13,060
be accepting right because we're looking

137
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,939
at debug hot and that sort of stuff here

138
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,819
and you can see that that we in this

139
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:20,889
case set it but we don't set it in this

140
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,810
case so it never actually accepts that

141
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,180
variable in the case of the hot

142
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,069
interaction so really you know the other

143
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,300
thing we could do there is potentially

144
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:33,218
say something like you know that which

145
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,770
is to say if the interaction got set we

146
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:37,478
always want to set that variable so I

147
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:40,299
might just I might just go ahead and do

148
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,008
that and that's that's the bug that we

149
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,829
had there we just were a little sloppy

150
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:47,050
when we change that and that's fine so

151
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:48,939
yeah so I think we should be fine now

152
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,829
yeah so there we can pull those around

153
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:54,189
we also have the ability to kind of pull

154
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:56,228
off things here and drag them around and

155
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:58,000
stuff like that and so like I said we've

156
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:59,468
kind of got the the beginnings of

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,329
everything here and we've got like the

158
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:04,750
basis of stuff but it's still like kind

159
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:07,658
of janky and ugly and we don't really

160
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,069
have every we kind of haven't done the

161
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,658
refinement necessary to make this really

162
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,098
particularly usable like it's kind of

163
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:14,649
just got the beginnings of it there but

164
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:15,939
it's not actually what we want so what

165
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,739
I'd like to do is start kind of like

166
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,089
poking down through this a little bit

167
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,500
more and just start to clean up the code

168
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:23,138
a little bit and make it into something

169
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,300
a little more usable so the first thing

170
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:29,500
I want to do is we have this sort of

171
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,968
loose concept here where we've got your

172
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,860
this notion of like what kind of

173
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:34,538
interaction is happening and who is it

174
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,180
happening with but it's kind of all

175
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,978
implicit in all these things and we have

176
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,930
you know the interaction and what the

177
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:41,668
hot interaction

178
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,110
as men who were interacting with and

179
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:46,500
what the hot variable we could have like

180
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,629
a lot of stuff and what I'd like to do

181
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,360
is sort of take a step back there and

182
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,029
just figure out a good way to to

183
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,620
formalize that so that we we wrap it all

184
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:57,599
up into something a little more logical

185
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,418
and what I want to point out here is

186
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,379
essentially what we have is we have like

187
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:06,120
sort of a a coupling we have like we

188
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,159
have we have sort of like a relationship

189
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,810
here where the debug interaction that's

190
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,490
going to happen is obviously going to

191
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,720
happen to something so we sort of have

192
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,870
like an interaction and like the

193
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
parameters for that interaction and so

194
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,168
we want something like you know a debug

195
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,299
interaction params or something like

196
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:23,969
this we want to create a structure where

197
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,639
we can bundle these up right so we can

198
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,620
say what the interaction is and we can

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,288
say like what the variable is that it's

200
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,228
interacting with something like this and

201
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:36,990
we can even say you know in there we can

202
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:38,579
say well maybe it's happening with one

203
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,519
of those or maybe it's happening with

204
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:44,879
one of these right and so we can sort of

205
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,069
say like you know what no matter what

206
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,779
you might want to put in here we can

207
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,418
allow you to interact with that thing

208
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,589
whatever that thing is we can make lots

209
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,879
of different things so different

210
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:57,049
interactions if they want different

211
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,899
things can interact differently and

212
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,658
that's you know totally fine so if you

213
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,038
want to do that we just need to come up

214
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:07,288
with a name for this and not for exactly

215
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,879
what it would be we could call this a

216
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:11,069
debug interaction and this a debug

217
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,839
interaction type that's one way to do it

218
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,870
so we could say something like that and

219
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,339
then the debug interaction that we were

220
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,259
talking about before is really just the

221
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,939
type of interaction but the interaction

222
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,129
itself involves whatever those

223
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,250
parameters actually were right and so

224
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:27,779
you can kind of see those here so if we

225
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,399
did something like that then we can we

226
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:30,869
have the opportunity to like kind of

227
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,848
clean these up because then we have the

228
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,709
interaction and then we also have the

229
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,899
hot interaction and then we also have

230
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,879
the next hot interaction and now we

231
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,440
don't have all of these different things

232
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,019
that are happening down here they're

233
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,690
kind of confusing and weird right those

234
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,639
things can kind of go away and now we're

235
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,500
sort of back to something that looks a

236
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,028
little more sane right now we can just

237
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,769
kind of see we've got three things we've

238
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,970
got whichever the one is that kind of

239
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,129
when we do our

240
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,528
testing pass this is the thing that was

241
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:00,720
like you know the mouse was over here is

242
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:02,278
the like last one that we confirmed was

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,259
something that we want to consider being

244
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,850
like hot at the time and here is one if

245
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,050
we actually if the user actually pulls

246
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,060
the trigger on it so it's like three

247
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:11,458
tiers and now they're kind of really

248
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,619
nicely labeled and you can sort of see

249
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,948
exactly what's going on so I want to

250
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,209
start by making that simplification and

251
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:19,438
once i make thats implication i'm going

252
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,328
to have a bunch of compile errors and

253
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:23,818
i'm just going to kind of pile sort of

254
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:26,128
like go through those interactions I'm

255
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:28,528
sorry go through those compile errors

256
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:29,789
fixing them to work with this new

257
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:33,360
structure that's really all I'm going to

258
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:35,789
do so let's do that now so here we are

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,810
in draw a debug menu and you can see you

260
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,519
know what I'm also going to do I'm going

261
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,619
to stop this guy from blanking all the

262
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,980
time since he seems the screensaver of

263
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,019
course really really really wants to to

264
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,789
have them you know it's it's whole

265
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,159
situation occur there all right there we

266
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:53,639
go turn that off I want to be able to

267
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:59,909
see the chat if that makes make sense so

268
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:01,769
here we go we've got this is hot concept

269
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,299
here which is saying it just wants to

270
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,568
know whether this variable that we're

271
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:09,028
looking at at the moment is the one

272
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:11,278
that's being like hovered and so what I

273
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:13,019
want to do there is I'd like to again

274
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,509
just sort of formalize this a little bit

275
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,669
more we now have this concept of a debug

276
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:20,818
interaction and we know what the hot

277
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:22,860
interaction actually is right so what we

278
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:24,838
should be able to do now for is hot is

279
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,930
we should be able to say something like

280
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,949
well okay you know for this particular

281
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:33,958
item I do I know what my interaction

282
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:36,628
would be right I know which interaction

283
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,698
i'm talking about here in terms of the

284
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,829
is hot item color thing so i want to do

285
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:42,990
is basically say there's an item

286
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:45,899
interaction there's whatever interaction

287
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,308
there would be in the item right and

288
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,919
what I want to do is I want to

289
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:51,929
initialize that to be whatever it is

290
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,698
that this thing would normally you know

291
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:56,099
what whatever would normally happen here

292
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:57,599
and I think that's like this guy right

293
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,459
this is the one that sort of saying

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,629
there's no specific interaction but

295
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:05,958
here's the variable right so here's the

296
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:08,159
type of interaction it's one of those

297
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,828
and here is

298
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:17,879
the variable that it that's involved

299
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:19,828
just call that bar and this hierarchy so

300
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,110
once I've made that item interaction

301
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:23,429
then what i can do is instead of this

302
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,528
thing where I'm sort of doing an ad hoc

303
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:30,989
comparison here I can do something like

304
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:33,809
say you know interactions are equal and

305
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,269
I can just say whatever the one is that

306
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:40,619
I was talking about the one that I would

307
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:45,000
be does that match the hot one here

308
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:47,879
right because if it does then I am hot

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,379
if not then not and that also means that

310
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,409
i don't have this situation anymore

311
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,060
where i have to sort of think about what

312
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:56,370
the different you know what these sorts

313
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:59,219
of things are happening we can just sort

314
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:05,669
of let that happen in that in this sort

315
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:08,579
of predicate function right okay so yeah

316
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:10,229
let's go ahead and take that out so

317
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,239
we'll just assume the fat guy knows

318
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,680
whether or not what I'm talking about is

319
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,528
about to happen or not and it will

320
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,899
return it so it can work that way and

321
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,458
then in here where we've got counter

322
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,198
thread list we're going to do well let

323
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:23,638
me let me actually just go ahead and

324
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:28,219
implement this simple version of this

325
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,220
first so that we have it there like so

326
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:34,169
right and so that's just going to take

327
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:39,990
two of these guys it's just going to be

328
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:41,969
like you know a and B and the result of

329
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,198
that's just going to be you know if the

330
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:48,720
a type equals the V type like so and

331
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,399
then we're going to assume I suppose if

332
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,339
these are all going to be pointers for

333
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,230
now we can assume that we can just do

334
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,939
something like a test here so we don't

335
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,709
even have to really crack these out we

336
00:12:56,938 --> 00:13:01,620
can just do something like and a dot

337
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:04,729
test equals V CAST or you know generic

338
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,730
something like that right

339
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:14,088
so assuming that those are true then we

340
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:18,020
assume that things are equal and let's

341
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:20,540
see so if we move down here what else we

342
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,639
got so in this state we have the exact

343
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:24,469
same situation right and you can kind of

344
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,019
see what I'm doing is I'm like moving

345
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,050
this stuff up so that it's more related

346
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:32,629
it's like instead of having an ad hoc

347
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,829
testing and then setting regimen where

348
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:35,360
we kind of go like let's test

349
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,370
something's ad hoc and then we'll set

350
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,259
something as ad hoc I'm actually making

351
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,810
it so that the thing that gets tested is

352
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,539
the same thing that gets set right so

353
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:46,759
once I test this in here what i would do

354
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:49,490
is say like oh if i'm in this rectangle

355
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,799
then the next hot interaction is going

356
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,419
to be my item interaction so that whale

357
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,949
again we get rid of that redundancy and

358
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,539
just say like okay this is the item

359
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,820
interaction and that is what we will set

360
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:00,620
here right and the same thing would be

361
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,899
true here like the next site interaction

362
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,450
here equals you know that item

363
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,039
interaction so then again you don't have

364
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,450
that situation where there's what kind

365
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,719
of multiple people doing multiple things

366
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,009
that may conflict or not line up so then

367
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,230
the only real thing we have to do now is

368
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,028
do that again for this guy because we

369
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,639
have this size box so this is like our

370
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:21,889
size interaction and the size

371
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,679
interaction again is pretty wrote it's

372
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:26,208
just saying the exact same thing in

373
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,278
terms of the variable it's going to

374
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,958
interact with the variable not

375
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,269
definitely a fused with the variable

376
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:34,609
like I guess we say interact with a

377
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:39,049
variable right so we're going to do a

378
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:41,329
resize profile think here and we're

379
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:49,849
going to have it so that so that that

380
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:52,849
interacts this way okay and then we've

381
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,800
got you know the standard stuff that we

382
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:57,470
were doing before what we want to do now

383
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,769
when we test that is hot again we want

384
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,000
to just do interactions or equal instead

385
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,159
and in fact you know what I suppose the

386
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,929
other thing we could do is interaction

387
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,059
is hot we could actually have an

388
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:11,000
interaction is hot called which actually

389
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,799
just takes the debug state itself and

390
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,028
then the item interaction and so we

391
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,919
don't even have to think about the fact

392
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:18,860
that there is a hot interaction we can

393
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,549
just say interaction is hot and expect

394
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,430
that it

395
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:24,199
ohs the fact that there is a debug state

396
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:26,149
and how to get the hot interaction out

397
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,560
of it right and so that would be

398
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,570
something that just thunks through to

399
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,079
interactions are equal bypassing debug

400
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:36,379
stayed hot interaction and and letting

401
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,509
it do that comparison you know so if i

402
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:40,730
do that i could say interaction is hot

403
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:42,588
right and get rid of that whole

404
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,990
situation that's happening there which I

405
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:46,820
don't like and now say that I just want

406
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,730
to say if the size interaction is the

407
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,930
hot interaction then I know that I'm

408
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:57,889
going to have the colors like so and

409
00:15:52,929 --> 00:16:00,078
that all is pretty happy and fun again

410
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:03,019
just cleaning it up here next hot

411
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:06,259
interaction is going to become this size

412
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:09,289
interaction in that case and then i'll

413
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:11,689
go ahead and and recompile all right so

414
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:13,338
here we are this is our kind of little

415
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,079
hacky code i guess that we did that we

416
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,250
haven't really talked about much yet we

417
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:18,919
were just kind of throwing around making

418
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,360
sure we could move that stuff so in this

419
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,569
case it's the sack same thing again

420
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,100
right the exact exact same thing and we

421
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,990
can kind of see here we didn't even

422
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,480
bother because we were so lazy and it

423
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,459
was so janky to do we didn't even bother

424
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,139
doing a highlight for this guy but again

425
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,969
now it becomes a lot easier to do a

426
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:37,220
highlight and I think it will become

427
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:42,310
easier still at a second here but we can

428
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:44,870
again just call is hot interaction or

429
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:47,629
try to what is it is interaction hot

430
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:52,100
sorry whatever it is what is it I don't

431
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:55,909
even remember now hot interaction is hot

432
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:58,639
if interaction is hot and I can pass

433
00:16:55,909 --> 00:17:01,250
this move interaction i guess that for

434
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,139
doing here if that interaction is hot

435
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:07,818
we'll go ahead and do it there was not

436
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,620
so there we go and I just need again to

437
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,659
make one of those interactions so here's

438
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:14,239
the move interaction and it's just going

439
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,500
to store again the stuff that we were

440
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,359
storing before it's just these two

441
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,240
things here and this time it's going to

442
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:25,139
store that hierarchy guy

443
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,730
slide it right like that and that's it

444
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,800
and then this is actually going to do

445
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:35,630
next hot interaction it's going to do

446
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:38,909
the move interaction ok so moving along

447
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,320
now for these guys this this all needs

448
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,730
to work slightly differently now right

449
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,000
we've got hung interaction it's hot in

450
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,099
debug state hot interaction type right

451
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,599
so assuming that that's the case then

452
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,419
what we want to do is we want to just

453
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:52,649
accept the whole interaction and that

454
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,090
gets us out of this business right here

455
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,040
where we had to like pick up stuff

456
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,389
because now the interaction type and the

457
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,099
thing that it's interacting with are

458
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,200
bundled together which is what we wanted

459
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:02,639
it's now like a logical thing that

460
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,400
doesn't have to be like fuss with in

461
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,020
that way so if the hot interaction type

462
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,630
is a thing then that's great if the hot

463
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,250
interaction type is not a thing but the

464
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,800
hot interaction actually does have

465
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,420
something to go with it in fact now that

466
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,558
I think about it you know if you really

467
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:22,529
at the end of the day we probably just

468
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,420
want to make this be something a little

469
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:27,928
bit smarter we could actually get rid of

470
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,179
all of this logic I think probably for

471
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:34,410
the most part you know what I'm saying

472
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:41,210
if I'm looking at this here I feel like

473
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:41,210
it's probably something we could do yeah

474
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,160
to be honest we don't really need I

475
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,689
don't think to do what we're doing here

476
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,670
because like where we've got this sort

477
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,759
of toggle value and drag value and that

478
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:56,340
sort of stuff I think probably all we

479
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,829
need to do there is do something like

480
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:02,639
this right we could just do something

481
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:04,649
like okay assuming that there's that the

482
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,950
hot interaction actually is some kind of

483
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,519
interaction right of some kind and I'll

484
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,830
just get rid of this thing here let's go

485
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,220
ahead and do that

486
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:21,629
and what is happening here this is if

487
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,250
the hot interaction type otherwise we'll

488
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,320
just go ahead and send to enough okay

489
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,659
there we go so if we want to do

490
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,119
something like this again just trying to

491
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,470
clean this up in stages if we want to do

492
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,808
something like this what we could say is

493
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,750
you know oh if the debug hot interaction

494
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:41,069
type is equal to some special thing

495
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:46,528
which is like you know an auto detect

496
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:49,099
right so if it's like you know auto auto

497
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:51,929
modify variable or something like this

498
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:53,819
so if we see that that's the type then

499
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,970
what we'll do is we'll switch on

500
00:19:53,819 --> 00:20:02,879
whatever the hot interaction variable

501
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:05,610
type is and we'll set the hot

502
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,940
interactions type to be whatever it

503
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:10,678
should be in that case so it just kind

504
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,240
of like puts it into a more tiered

505
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,519
approach where basically we're saying

506
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,870
like okay we're assuming that someone

507
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:17,548
will tell us whether they want to be in

508
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:19,288
an auto modify state assuming that they

509
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:21,658
do want to be we'll go ahead and do that

510
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:24,148
right and similarly we'll just assume

511
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:25,919
that oh if if it is auto modify variable

512
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:27,839
then also will lift that all too i kick

513
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,370
in where it will go ahead and change the

514
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,048
tariff value if we're in that state and

515
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:33,239
then at the end it will just always

516
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:37,619
accept whatever that hot interaction

517
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:40,528
actually was right so that seems totes

518
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,359
totes reasonable to me and now all that

519
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:45,839
means is that when we set we're setting

520
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:50,219
none before over here right where we set

521
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:52,079
it to debugging interaction none for

522
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,839
variables what we actually want to do is

523
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,388
just set it to auto modify variable

524
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,819
right and that seems that seems totally

525
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:02,298
reasonable why is this get set go get

526
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:05,700
set it interact as well yeah right okay

527
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:09,929
okay so that's all good I think and

528
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,740
let's go ahead and fix that guy up that

529
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:16,600
looks nice

530
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:19,539
and right there we go so that's fixed

531
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:23,500
debug and interact assuming that the end

532
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:25,450
interaction type is not not then we are

533
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,539
going to see I guess what's actually

534
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,830
happening here and I suppose really this

535
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:32,558
should this should really be like a

536
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:34,750
switch I would assume where we take a

537
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,970
look at what's actually happening here I

538
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,400
feel like because this is essentially

539
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,880
this is the entirety of our UI code

540
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,710
right like this is basically it this is

541
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,750
what does all of the sort of the

542
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,210
interactions here is these three

543
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,799
functions and so what I'd like to do

544
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,269
there is just go like okay we only have

545
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,970
a few things that we want to do we want

546
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:57,789
toggle the pool or expand the group on

547
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,569
the end of it so we probably want to do

548
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:03,819
something like okay whatever the type is

549
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:05,558
you know there's there's only i guess

550
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:06,789
like two things that we care well

551
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,220
there's only one I guess that we care

552
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:11,049
about it's this one but we might have

553
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,690
more later so I just want to leave that

554
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,869
you know kind of a kind of thing open

555
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,759
right and then in here we could do

556
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:21,849
something like this we just said like

557
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:30,279
all right let's grab the bar out from

558
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:34,230
the interaction XO poops and then we can

559
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:36,579
go ahead and work on that as well right

560
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:40,929
that all seems fine and then in the

561
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:44,500
default case I guess you know we don't

562
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,580
really have to write in all the cases to

563
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,349
be honest with you I think a lot of

564
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:51,939
cases don't need to have any writing

565
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:54,209
happen but I don't know it's hard to say

566
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,920
we're going to leave it that way for now

567
00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:00,069
we're just just because we probably

568
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,130
should all right so let's see we've got

569
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:05,409
interaction generic we're going to clear

570
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:09,270
this guy out dragging hierarchy doesn't

571
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:14,620
exist anymore and so that I think is all

572
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:16,119
good ok so moving on we've got our debug

573
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:17,709
interact when we're taking a look at the

574
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,239
interaction here again we're going to be

575
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,650
doing exactly the same thing as we did

576
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,410
before we're just going to say all right

577
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,009
if the interaction type is not you know

578
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,930
nothing

579
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:27,849
we're going to go ahead and play with it

580
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,860
here we don't necessarily know that we

581
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:31,899
have of our but we can pull the bar out

582
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:33,579
anyway because I guess people who use it

583
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,880
will know to use it people who don't

584
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:38,559
will know to not and so if we have here

585
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,540
like you know our move hierarchy for

586
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,460
example now that doesn't have to be

587
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:44,920
using some blind other function here in

588
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,420
fact we can also get to do this where we

589
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,230
pull out the debug hierarchy as well

590
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,120
it's variable hierarchy like so we could

591
00:23:50,230 --> 00:24:01,660
say that where we have the variable

592
00:23:52,119 --> 00:24:03,609
hierarchy and then in here we can do you

593
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,170
think we can go ahead and grab that out

594
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,399
as well and so now we know that we're

595
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,500
using the hierarchy that was actually

596
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,460
associated with the interaction itself

597
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,160
we don't have to have some kind of

598
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,890
mysterious extra global variable there

599
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,600
and that's all good so the same thing I

600
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,180
think would probably go for here we

601
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:21,429
would use in you know if the hierarchy

602
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,840
is not a thing yet then we would say

603
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:29,850
that that the debug variable hierarchy

604
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:33,009
oops the debug state interaction

605
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:38,589
hierarchy is going to be equal to this

606
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:44,289
new one that we create right like so and

607
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:45,730
then we will also set it equal here and

608
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:49,349
then this guy can just work off of that

609
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:51,640
right so that's pretty straightforward

610
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:53,019
don't think we've got much else to do

611
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,600
actually we're kind of giving at the end

612
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:57,039
of this porting when we add the variable

613
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,949
reference again that's going to be the

614
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,869
interacting VAR i guess so this is like

615
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,690
turns it originally has a VAR and this

616
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,979
turns it into interacting with the

617
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,460
hierarchy itself which is kind of

618
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:13,899
interesting actually I kind of like that

619
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:16,340
anyway I'm sorry interaction

620
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:19,699
alright so what else we got here we've

621
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:21,378
got debug state this is just this right

622
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,940
here is just setting the next ought to

623
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:24,709
be the hot so this is just the hot

624
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,269
interaction becomes the net hot

625
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,590
interaction that's that's really it we

626
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:31,579
don't need any of these other things now

627
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:32,808
I don't think dragging hierarchy I don't

628
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:34,158
know if that actually got said anymore I

629
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:36,739
don't think it does no it doesn't so

630
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,629
that's good and this stuff can all is

631
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:41,119
just like a clear right so the next hot

632
00:25:38,628 --> 00:25:43,538
interaction is just going to be this is

633
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:46,638
just going to be cleared out every time

634
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:49,339
and these guys are all just now taken

635
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:51,858
care of by that one clear I think so

636
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,628
let's see where we're at with that like

637
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:56,569
just see if everything still works after

638
00:25:53,628 --> 00:26:00,558
all that manipulation looks pretty good

639
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:02,569
right alright so we got one here that's

640
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,038
not good and that is that it's trying to

641
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,229
print out some kind of variable that

642
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:08,769
doesn't actually exist yet so that's

643
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:12,200
probably not a good thing say the least

644
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:14,378
so that looks like and let me take a

645
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,690
look at what actually happened there

646
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:19,248
during that ad so when we do the debug

647
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,528
ad variable reference we use the

648
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:23,149
interaction variable cure and I'm

649
00:26:21,528 --> 00:26:24,950
assuming that after we do that ad

650
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:30,488
hierarchy it does not like that very

651
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,489
much although i'm not exactly sure why

652
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:42,048
so we add the hierarchy with the root

653
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:45,859
group and then we go ahead and and fuss

654
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:50,239
with that so I wonder if it doesn't

655
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:51,470
quite realize so this is this is kind of

656
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:54,950
dumb what I did here this is actually

657
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,479
not correct at all now that I think

658
00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:00,019
about it this isn't going to work

659
00:26:56,479 --> 00:27:01,999
because this is this tear value thing

660
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:04,429
actually needs to do something on the

661
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:05,538
mouse down because otherwise it's never

662
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:06,739
going to know because this is just a

663
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:08,929
shadowed variable this is the same

664
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:10,548
variables in the union right so it's not

665
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,369
going to work at all now that i think

666
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:14,749
about it to have both of those be to use

667
00:27:13,368 --> 00:27:17,269
that in the sort of hacky way that we

668
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:19,368
were using it before so what I should

669
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:21,378
really probably do is when you do the

670
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:23,480
begin interaction that's when it should

671
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:25,939
actually occur so when you do the begin

672
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,058
interaction and it sees that the

673
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:32,999
interaction

674
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:34,798
right is is that type right so it'd be

675
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:39,499
something like it'd be something like

676
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:42,418
this right it'd be switch on the type

677
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:44,519
well honestly we'd probably want to

678
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,190
still do this part here and then after

679
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,499
we'd already decided what the type was

680
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:52,679
then we just say okay of the interaction

681
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:55,230
types that we've got assuming that I

682
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:57,559
want to do the tear value one then we're

683
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,240
going to do sort of this this thing here

684
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:02,940
right that's actually the cleaner way to

685
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,599
do it that actually makes a lot more

686
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,850
sense because that's actually doing the

687
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,829
thing instead of like lazily evaluating

688
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:13,558
a variable which isn't you know useful

689
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:14,939
at all so if i go to terror value then i

690
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,069
will create the new group that we're

691
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,700
tearing off i'll add the reference to it

692
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:22,349
right and enough we go but these are all

693
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,298
on the hot interaction at this point

694
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,498
although i guess you know actually may

695
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:26,878
be able to do it on the regular now so

696
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:28,980
i'll say except the interaction at that

697
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:31,408
point ma'am no you know what i like it

698
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,690
better on the hot I do like it better on

699
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:38,639
the hot I think it's a little bit better

700
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:41,700
that way okay so there we go so I think

701
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:45,479
that's actually what I want to do that's

702
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,399
that's a much nicer system there and

703
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,480
there we go so there I've pulled out the

704
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:53,748
renderer and I can drag it around and

705
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,230
all those other sorts of nice things

706
00:28:53,749 --> 00:29:00,089
I've got the profile here and there we

707
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:04,548
go and I can drag that box as well and

708
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:06,808
that's all good so I think that's

709
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:07,980
reasonably better now you know things

710
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:11,069
are starting to clean up a little bit

711
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,378
they're not squeaky clean at all in

712
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:16,349
terms of like things that I might want

713
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:17,638
to sort of have compressed out just to

714
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:22,319
get it a little more a little more

715
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:25,439
thorough but definite looking better

716
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,118
than it was so at this point the other

717
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,710
thing that I would like to say is you

718
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:31,199
know we've got that sort of sizing

719
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,149
interaction and I feel like that sizing

720
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,860
interaction is probably something that

721
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:37,079
you would want to have in a more generic

722
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:39,418
sense as well and so one thing that I'm

723
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,529
wondering is like you know if we think

724
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,590
about it here

725
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:51,329
we could do something like this right

726
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:52,589
where the resize profile guy and in fact

727
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:55,289
I think there's going to be kind of neat

728
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:59,009
when we actually think about this year

729
00:29:55,289 --> 00:30:00,450
so if this resize profile right it

730
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:02,250
doesn't really have to be called resized

731
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,850
profile in theory it could just be

732
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:08,099
called resize I suspect and what it

733
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:12,109
could do is it could just say instead of

734
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:14,789
losing the VAR it just uses like the v2

735
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:19,589
that's in the hierarchy if that's in the

736
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:22,170
interaction itself like this and it just

737
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:25,879
kind of goes like okay like you know I'm

738
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:28,860
just I'm just operating on some some

739
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,600
position right and I don't care what the

740
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:32,819
position actually is like doesn't matter

741
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,879
you know right i just want to write an

742
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:37,649
interaction on a position like this and

743
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,330
then it will just work no matter what

744
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,310
position it actually is that i was

745
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:45,480
working on and similarly you know like

746
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:47,220
move hierarchy for example could do

747
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,130
exactly the same thing it could just be

748
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,319
called move at some level and it could

749
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:55,620
just work on that p as well like this

750
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,899
you know so that seems like free

751
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:59,309
reasonable and it also seems kind of

752
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,350
reasonable because then you could just

753
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:03,629
get rid of terror value all together if

754
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:06,959
you wanted to and you could do something

755
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:09,330
like okay so you know let me go ahead

756
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,789
and make these guys so we've got resize

757
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:13,379
and move which are just generic

758
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,359
operators that just operate on stuff

759
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,750
that you know can tell me what position

760
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,979
it actually wants me to do there and

761
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,809
here i can just say like okay this is a

762
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,009
resize action and i'm just going to set

763
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:27,929
the position to to resize that profile

764
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,970
dimension right or whatever it's called

765
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,640
I don't remember what the actual thing

766
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:37,200
was called in there it's something like

767
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:41,250
that just do something like something

768
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,470
it's called dimension oh I sent why did

769
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,900
I spill it all the way out and we don't

770
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,240
spill it all the way out anywhere else

771
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,769
yeah who knows so anyway we can just

772
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,299
take the address of that right and then

773
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:54,210
we can interact with that guy and then

774
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:57,750
that's all fine right so similarly

775
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,340
got move hierarchy here and we could

776
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,960
just change that to be moved we don't

777
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:02,429
have to actually specify that the

778
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,779
hierarchy and then we can just say that

779
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,370
whatever the hierarchy is your IP is

780
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:08,269
we're just going to take the address of

781
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:10,529
that and then it will just work you know

782
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:12,269
so all I have to do to make that happen

783
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:15,960
is change these guys to like actually

784
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:17,700
pointers since now it's not an actual

785
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,190
thing that we're working on it's

786
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,460
actually just a yeah it's actually a

787
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:25,740
pointer to a v2 but I think at that

788
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,930
point it just works with whatever you

789
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,490
want to throw at it right so now I can

790
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,680
just do something we're like okay I'm

791
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,630
moving well or just won't work at all

792
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:38,100
there's also that is another nice thing

793
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:40,400
that's pretty great oh whoops that's

794
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:43,500
because that I don't know why I did that

795
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:47,460
that's still supposed to be d-mass p

796
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,490
folks that should not have changed so

797
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,630
that's pretty obvious why that does work

798
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,160
yeah if you had the thing to itself

799
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,170
turns out it's not a very good thing so

800
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,230
that that should be fine because that

801
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:00,870
means now like I said we can do kind of

802
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,579
whatever we want there let's let's get

803
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:03,959
this one working as well so now what I

804
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:06,029
have to do to make that one work since

805
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,680
the move already works just fine the

806
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,420
only thing I have to do now is terror

807
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,000
value doesn't have an interaction oops

808
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:14,550
doesn't have an interaction anymore so

809
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,559
if i go to tear value when you actually

810
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:20,639
start carrying it what we would say is

811
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:23,149
like okay the hierarchy that we add here

812
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,940
this hot interaction hierarchy that

813
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:29,160
thing it's uip is going to start out

814
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:31,259
being wherever the mouse is and then i'm

815
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,240
going to change our hot interaction

816
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,410
right in fact you know what you don't

817
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,319
even have to do this it's just debug

818
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:39,390
variable hierarchy here where we just

819
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:40,740
get the hierarchy briefly we then say to

820
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,240
the higher cuz you IP is wherever the

821
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,130
mouse started and then we say that

822
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,109
actually what the interaction is

823
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,550
actually going to be about is not going

824
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:48,750
to be a terror value interaction it's

825
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:50,639
just going to be a move interaction so

826
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,910
it started off as a chair it becomes a

827
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,970
move and the thing that it's moving you

828
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:00,060
know I'm saying is the is the

829
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,710
hierarchies uip that's the like that

830
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,519
that's the actual vector type it's

831
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,730
moving

832
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:09,329
right oops okay insert an errant

833
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,559
character there alright and so now when

834
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,599
we grab this you can see that it works

835
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,269
exactly the way it did before but now

836
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:19,679
the move is actually moot it's actually

837
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:22,110
moving generically so now anything that

838
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,929
we wanted to move could be moved that

839
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:27,390
way right like we don't need a specific

840
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,849
thing we don't need a specific one for

841
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:31,349
hierarchies versus anything else that

842
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,360
maybe we would want to move in the

843
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:35,429
future right which is kind of nice and

844
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,240
the same is true for resizing so if we

845
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:41,210
added another thing here another type

846
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:45,629
that kind of wanted to have that sort of

847
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:47,820
thing to it we could do that right and

848
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,890
so lets you know just just for sake of

849
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,809
argument I'm just going to show what i

850
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,599
mean by that because it may be a little

851
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:56,969
obtuse what I'm saying and so what I'd

852
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:00,599
like to do is kind of extend that notion

853
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:03,359
up look like just extend that notion 11

854
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,920
up so let's say it for example we had

855
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,300
debug variable that actually was like a

856
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:13,309
bitmap or something I and so like you

857
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:19,890
know what I'm what I'm talking about is

858
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:21,570
in here if we had a bitmap ID as one of

859
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:23,549
the variable types right because you

860
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,900
know we got these bitmaps and all that

861
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,120
sort of stuff so suppose we had like a

862
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,740
bitmap ID in there and one of our debug

863
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,369
variable types wanted to be like a

864
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:33,839
display of a bitmap or something and so

865
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:36,029
I guess you know now I think about too I

866
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:41,070
probably want to make it so that this

867
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:43,019
thing for the bitmap ID is a little bit

868
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:46,519
more expressive than that I probably

869
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:49,980
want to do like a debug you know bitmap

870
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:53,429
display or sometimes something like that

871
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,170
so it's got like a bitmap ID and it's

872
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:57,089
got you know like a dimension or

873
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,070
something or an r32 which is like size

874
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:02,900
or something like that you know what I

875
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:04,849
mean or I guess I should say of each you

876
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,460
it's like sighs

877
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:09,440
you know and so if I want to do that i

878
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:15,679
could go ahead and say like this guy's

879
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:17,659
in there we've got a bit map display and

880
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,998
you know and maybe this thing has other

881
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:21,440
stuff like you know Alfred I don't know

882
00:36:19,998 --> 00:36:22,459
something like that weird like it says

883
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,019
whether or not to use the alpha channel

884
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,509
or something like this who knows what's

885
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:29,179
got in there and what we want to do is

886
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:31,548
be able to display bitmaps and so what

887
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:32,778
we do is we'd go into here where we're

888
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:34,400
displaying other things and we've got

889
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:38,679
like our profile counter or whatever

890
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,759
right and when we display this stuff

891
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:44,690
we'd have another one that's like the

892
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:46,759
bug variable type and it's going to be

893
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,619
this fit map display guy and I suppose I

894
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:50,690
probably need a type in their form as

895
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:55,039
well so you know this is like the bug

896
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:56,749
variable type fit map display and so we

897
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,329
throw this in here and we say we've got

898
00:36:56,748 --> 00:37:01,909
a bit map display and then what we do is

899
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:04,009
we go all right whatever the like the

900
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:06,409
thing was you were doing here we're

901
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:07,789
going to do exactly the same thing and

902
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:10,460
we're just going to grab this and like

903
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:12,739
literally just stupid for now and don't

904
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:16,190
get too concerned about that it's ok

905
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:17,088
really everyone just relax we'll we'll

906
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,068
sort of take a look at that a little

907
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:21,608
more detail in a minute we really like

908
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:23,869
literally exactly the same thing here ok

909
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:25,308
and one thing I am going to do is I'm

910
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,568
going to say that if you're in the

911
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,769
rectangle of it it doesn't have an

912
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:29,568
interaction right now because at the

913
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:31,669
moment we don't really have a way of

914
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:33,650
interacting with bitmaps so we're just

915
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,088
going to leave that off for the time

916
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:41,180
being ok so game here instead of drawing

917
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:42,679
profile in like that we're not going to

918
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:44,449
do that and instead we're going to use

919
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,940
this bitmap thing here where we've got

920
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:49,189
bar you know bitmap what I call it

921
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,289
bitmap display and that that has a

922
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,579
dimension so it's going to use that and

923
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:55,789
I'm you know I'm not gonna I'm going to

924
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:57,559
try not to repeat past mistakes going to

925
00:37:55,789 --> 00:38:00,650
make that din because that's what we

926
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:05,420
have been using so it's ginn good map

927
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:06,710
display like so and then the rest of

928
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,298
this stuff is pretty much the same the

929
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,940
only difference is here we're going to

930
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:12,650
do a push bitmap call obviously instead

931
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,719
of the rest of stuff that we were doing

932
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,979
and when we have our size interaction

933
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,269
the size interaction will actually say

934
00:38:15,978 --> 00:38:17,639
the same it's just going to be whatever

935
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:21,750
that

936
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,798
map display tim was right and then

937
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,929
everything else pretty much stays

938
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:28,199
exactly the same so in the push bitmap

939
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:30,538
call again we kind of have to now take a

940
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,578
look at that render code which we

941
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:36,599
haven't really looked at in a while but

942
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:39,089
the thing that does push bitmap that's

943
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:41,240
going to take this stuff here right so

944
00:38:39,088 --> 00:38:43,558
it's going to take the render group

945
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:46,259
which we have it's going to take the

946
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,298
bitmap ID which comes from you know

947
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:53,250
bitmaps lay whatever our bitmap ID is

948
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:56,460
here and we've got a height and that's

949
00:38:53,250 --> 00:39:00,630
going to be I guess whatever our size P

950
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:05,099
is here so well I guess it's this thing

951
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:07,829
it's got the bitmap Jim why and then

952
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:11,250
we've got an offset which we don't need

953
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:13,260
I guess oh well we do need to do that we

954
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:16,858
need to place it so we need to place it

955
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,500
in like the center I guess of our of our

956
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:21,960
region so we have our bounds here so i

957
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,548
guess i just say get center of what the

958
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:29,429
bounds are that's where it would be

959
00:39:23,548 --> 00:39:31,858
right and we don't really care where it

960
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:33,419
isn't Z so then we have a color we don't

961
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:38,250
need to set I think that's basically it

962
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:41,818
for the most part and yeah oops we're

963
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:45,329
off to the races so that's really it for

964
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:47,548
a bit map display and you know I I need

965
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:50,579
obviously to have some way of ever

966
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:54,869
having one of these actually occur right

967
00:39:50,579 --> 00:40:00,480
so if I come in to debug variables debug

968
00:39:54,869 --> 00:40:03,180
where are you debug variables and I want

969
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,619
to add one of these guys then what i

970
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,419
would do is just kind of do the exact

971
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,009
same thing i did here where we do debug

972
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,170
that variable and this time it's a

973
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:13,500
bitmap ID and you know you pass the

974
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,940
value and I think that's all fine

975
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,889
although i don't know if you can

976
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,740
overload on these laughs to see if you

977
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:22,710
can or not i don't remember but we'll

978
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:26,038
see and so then that just is a bit map

979
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,539
display it in here when it does the pic

980
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:31,470
map display stuff it's going to do

981
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:35,250
bitmap display at dot ID equals the

982
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:36,868
value will set the dimension a to I

983
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,940
don't know what you know normally it's a

984
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:41,099
hundred by a hundred or something or

985
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:46,380
maybe it's just like 25 by 25 minutes

986
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:48,119
tiny and we'll set the Alpha to be true

987
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:54,660
we're not actually using that alpha yet

988
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:57,269
but might as well set it so um what is

989
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:00,298
the meaning of this you're saying ID is

990
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:02,088
not a member of that guy yeah that's a

991
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:04,409
good point let's go ahead and fix that

992
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:06,778
because it shouldn't have to say bitmap

993
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:10,798
ID since we know it's a bit map alright

994
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:14,039
so I've got that now and I will go ahead

995
00:41:10,798 --> 00:41:16,380
and call it so in here done at the end

996
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:20,430
as part of the test let us to debug

997
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:22,619
variable listing to add one of these

998
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:24,768
listings here and I guess the only

999
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:28,588
problem with this is I don't really know

1000
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:30,989
I guess I don't really know very much

1001
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:34,199
about what bitmap i would add as a

1002
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:36,058
bitmap ID so I'd have to kind of look it

1003
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:38,939
up in the asset system to be honest with

1004
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:43,700
you I look I'd have to do like get best

1005
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:47,849
match asset from so i don't know like

1006
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:50,818
get best match get map run and we'd

1007
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:53,278
probably do something like this you know

1008
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:55,858
I don't know to try to get the head in

1009
00:41:53,278 --> 00:42:01,318
there something like that and in order

1010
00:41:55,858 --> 00:42:10,199
to do that you know we would need see

1011
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:13,199
we would need to actually have the

1012
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:15,479
assets which I don't know if we do I

1013
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,369
don't know if we do at this point since

1014
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:19,468
we're just kind of hacking around I will

1015
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,180
see if maybe we do have the render group

1016
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:24,539
at this point I just don't know if we

1017
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:27,568
created them yet and and let's take a

1018
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:32,039
look and see if we have or if we haven't

1019
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:34,228
so there's that debug state coming

1020
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:38,039
through or where are we here no that's

1021
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:41,129
not it we need to look at where we call

1022
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,019
debug create variables so here it is

1023
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:47,699
we're in debug say so we get the assets

1024
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:49,558
passed in and so we could actually do it

1025
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:52,499
here in fact let's just do it out where

1026
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,548
we actually have that so here we go so

1027
00:42:52,498 --> 00:42:55,379
if we were in here where we do the

1028
00:42:53,548 --> 00:42:58,739
profile math sort of stuff I'm going to

1029
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,838
go ahead and do this sort of thing where

1030
00:42:58,739 --> 00:43:04,920
we where we go ahead and add it may be

1031
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:08,009
right here in fact that seems a little

1032
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:16,079
bit better to me and then we when we add

1033
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:18,748
this this guy here there we go i will

1034
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,829
see if that works so in here will do

1035
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:25,318
debug got the context debug ID variable

1036
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:27,989
reference this is going to be like our

1037
00:43:25,318 --> 00:43:30,478
test fit map here's our ID for that

1038
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:33,079
bitmap and let's see how that works

1039
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:33,078
let's see how that goes

1040
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,550
entity facing direction face of

1041
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:46,030
direction we don't care about at the

1042
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,680
moment debug variable reference none of

1043
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:51,250
the two overloads could convert all of

1044
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:55,059
the argument types that's entirely

1045
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:57,039
possible let me take a look and see d

1046
00:43:55,059 --> 00:44:04,019
book at variable Pittman body value so

1047
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:04,019
its context name and bitmap ID that's

1048
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:09,190
seems oh because it should be just debug

1049
00:44:07,059 --> 00:44:11,469
ad variable that's why should not be

1050
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:13,510
variable reference so let's see if

1051
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:15,639
that's going to work I don't know if oh

1052
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,020
and now we are supposed to just be using

1053
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:18,519
assets directly that's the whole reason

1054
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:19,989
I put it there was so we didn't have to

1055
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:25,239
go access something that we hadn't

1056
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:30,549
actually done yet so okay so I don't

1057
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:32,289
know if this will actually work I don't

1058
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,960
know and I don't really know I guess

1059
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:36,429
it's okay to keep that assert their

1060
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,960
because just so we know when we're not

1061
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:39,250
writing things out to the config file I

1062
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,690
suppose it's better than not knowing

1063
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,039
it's going to be a little bit of a pain

1064
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:44,710
because it's going to assert every time

1065
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:46,420
we add a new type even though a lot of

1066
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:50,039
the times we don't actually want to

1067
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:53,650
write the types out you know what I mean

1068
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:56,829
so that's a little bit annoying but you

1069
00:44:53,650 --> 00:45:00,849
know it's fine so this is a map display

1070
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:04,210
and I feel like where's the is the

1071
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:06,219
profile how is the profile stuff

1072
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:09,369
intercepted oh it's in debug should be

1073
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:10,829
written so the way that we've decided to

1074
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:13,389
do this is with debug should be written

1075
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:16,179
and so I guess we'll just do it that way

1076
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:17,980
right so we know that these guys are not

1077
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:19,809
and what we could do in the future is

1078
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,429
kind of segregate those into a set where

1079
00:45:19,809 --> 00:45:23,049
we can just do a raincheck like here's

1080
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:24,819
the ones that are written there you know

1081
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:30,789
this this range of values and here's the

1082
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:33,820
one that aren't right so yeah so anyway

1083
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:36,279
okay so anyway point being right it's

1084
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,500
pretty easy for us to create a thing

1085
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,930
here where we can just really trivially

1086
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,849
still use the same resize interaction to

1087
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:45,369
resize it and this is actually the

1088
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:47,799
bitmap we just have one problem here

1089
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:50,019
which is that the offsets the alignment

1090
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,619
offsets and everything are still going

1091
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:52,059
to be you

1092
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:54,369
used because that's sort of the way that

1093
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:56,470
they're defined inside the renderer

1094
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:58,088
right so if you look at here you know

1095
00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:00,038
when it does this push bitmap call and

1096
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,960
does all these sorts of things it's

1097
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:04,299
still going to do like alignment and all

1098
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,710
that kind of thing right it's going to

1099
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:07,059
use its going to do like the get fit

1100
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,940
mapped in thing where it does all this

1101
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:12,700
sort of stuff and you know what we would

1102
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,679
rather be able to do is be able to sort

1103
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:18,639
of push one of these things a little bit

1104
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:20,379
more directly so that it didn't do a lot

1105
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,118
of that stuff where it goes through the

1106
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,400
alignment and stuff unfortunately I

1107
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:26,108
don't really I don't know what's the

1108
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,150
best way to add that here because it's a

1109
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:30,518
strictly debug function you know I could

1110
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,108
add a flag that gets pushed on here I'm

1111
00:46:30,518 --> 00:46:33,429
a little reticent to do that but you

1112
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:35,469
know it seems like the easiest thing to

1113
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:38,528
do would be if you added something where

1114
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:40,689
it was like no trust me I want you to do

1115
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:41,980
this a little more specifically you know

1116
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:45,730
and it would and it would do that for

1117
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:46,630
you so I'm trying to think how I'd wanna

1118
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,490
do that and it would basically be

1119
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,710
something where you know it doesn't go

1120
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:52,899
through the transform it just gives you

1121
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:57,970
kind of the direct interpretation of

1122
00:46:52,900 --> 00:47:00,940
that particular bitmap so yeah what I

1123
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:02,858
want to do that and i suppose what i

1124
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:06,789
could do is make a separate function for

1125
00:47:02,858 --> 00:47:10,989
doing that but one which was not doing

1126
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:15,130
this sort of nonsense where I you know

1127
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:18,130
which which had this stuff baked a

1128
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:19,838
little bit more directly right because

1129
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,730
if this stuff part of the problem here

1130
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,518
is when it does the get bitmap call this

1131
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:26,588
sort of stuff is baked into the the push

1132
00:47:24,518 --> 00:47:28,238
bitmap so if i were to duplicate the

1133
00:47:26,588 --> 00:47:32,108
bush push him up call to have another

1134
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:33,400
one I'd have to duplicate all that and I

1135
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:34,989
don't want that I want that running

1136
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,519
through the same code path and so I'm

1137
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:38,949
not sure how I would want to do that

1138
00:47:36,518 --> 00:47:40,528
exactly because it's this is the actual

1139
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:44,048
function that kind of needs to be

1140
00:47:40,528 --> 00:47:45,309
specified and so it's a little bit it'd

1141
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:48,788
be like you'd have to have a preamble

1142
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:53,579
and a post amble for it which is just a

1143
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:53,579
little genki so I think

1144
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:05,180
hmm I think I may not quite do it that

1145
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:07,848
way so these guys will all still work

1146
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:11,358
the only thing I want to get rid of is

1147
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:17,180
that that Hadamard for the alignment you

1148
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:20,299
know and so if we look at what's

1149
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:22,489
happening with that alignment really all

1150
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,430
it does is it modifies that offset and

1151
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:27,649
so I feel like probably what I want to

1152
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:29,598
have happen there is allow you to

1153
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:32,450
specify some kind of a multiplier on

1154
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:36,800
that alignment right like I want

1155
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:38,899
something like a a coefficient you could

1156
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:45,079
multiply to turn the alignment off if

1157
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:52,030
you wanted to something like that yeah

1158
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:54,680
this sort of thing you know I'm saying

1159
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:58,519
and then what would happen in here right

1160
00:48:54,679 --> 00:49:02,659
is you'd have one of these as well again

1161
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:05,630
I don't love it but it's the thing that

1162
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:06,980
comes most of mind at the moment and so

1163
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:10,369
I'll just I'm going to go with it for a

1164
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:14,119
second and we'll see what happens here

1165
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:17,289
and so yeah if you call push bitmap here

1166
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:20,150
when you do the push again you can

1167
00:49:17,289 --> 00:49:22,338
specify that if you want to as an

1168
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:26,960
optional parameter and that will come

1169
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:32,838
through like so all right so let's see

1170
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:38,260
here we've gotta get bitmap call like I

1171
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:40,789
just kind of had a slight idea I haven't

1172
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,220
have an idea that's in the wrong place

1173
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:45,230
all right so all right so if i go

1174
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:46,969
through cure what's this this is on the

1175
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:48,740
code point stuff so these guys obviously

1176
00:49:46,969 --> 00:49:50,209
when they call get the map in we're

1177
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:52,909
going to want to use the standard

1178
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:55,159
alignment so that's all good but now in

1179
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:57,889
you know in the debug code we can go

1180
00:49:55,159 --> 00:50:03,699
ahead and turn that off now so we could

1181
00:49:57,889 --> 00:50:06,239
say let's see here inside that that code

1182
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:10,509
where we do

1183
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:13,808
good map display we could just say like

1184
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:16,599
okay when we're going to do that that

1185
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:22,720
push pic map we would like you two to

1186
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:25,838
nullify the alignment transform we don't

1187
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:31,989
want you to do that that's like not on

1188
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:33,369
the table right okay so now of course

1189
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:34,750
the other thing I have to think about is

1190
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:36,970
what happens when you nullify the

1191
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,650
alignment if you notify the alignment

1192
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:41,409
then the bitmap would be in the bottom

1193
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:42,730
corner and so we also have to translate

1194
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:44,288
our stuff so that it's at the bottom

1195
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,818
corner I think right now I'm passing the

1196
00:50:44,289 --> 00:50:47,349
center because that's I don't even know

1197
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:49,900
why I decided to pass the center I just

1198
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:54,940
randomly did so I think we want to do to

1199
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:56,680
get the min corner of our bounds I think

1200
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:00,039
is the way that that routine works

1201
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:03,190
pretty sure not not a hundred percent

1202
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:05,859
sure and yeah that does look like it and

1203
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:07,929
that's the correct size as well because

1204
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:10,298
again when i export of these bitmaps I

1205
00:51:07,929 --> 00:51:12,159
didn't actually trim them so they are

1206
00:51:10,298 --> 00:51:13,329
actually it's the whole size of the guy

1207
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:17,078
who just doesn't have anything down

1208
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:19,539
there so that's actually correct which

1209
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:22,329
is kind of cool so yeah so that's all

1210
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:24,849
good that's what we wanted and we could

1211
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:27,759
also draw the bounds of the guy in there

1212
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:32,769
so for example I could do something like

1213
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:35,170
this where where I you know put a

1214
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:37,629
wrecked in there where we just say like

1215
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:42,789
okay whatever the bounds of this thing

1216
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:45,099
is this thing right here and there's no

1217
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:48,809
hot for it it's just going to draw like

1218
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:52,269
some black stuff on the background

1219
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:54,700
behind a bitmap so that you can see it

1220
00:51:52,268 --> 00:51:58,298
there you can actually see the actual

1221
00:51:54,699 --> 00:52:01,328
bitmap in theory of course I also at

1222
00:51:58,298 --> 00:52:04,869
this point I guess have the problem if I

1223
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:08,079
use the width I don't I always maintain

1224
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:09,730
the aspect ratio of the bitmap which

1225
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:13,240
honestly i think is probably something

1226
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:16,108
that we would want to do like I feel

1227
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:17,969
like that's something that is desirable

1228
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:20,159
so I'm not

1229
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,868
or what I would want to do to sort of i

1230
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,059
don't really want them to be squishy and

1231
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:26,160
so what i could do is make it so that

1232
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:28,349
this actual thing when you drag it

1233
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:34,889
always does actually maintain the aspect

1234
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:38,130
ratio as well just by it'll take the it

1235
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:40,170
would it would take sort of the the

1236
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:41,760
height and always multiply it out that's

1237
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:44,240
not really that hard to do believe it or

1238
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,380
not i know it sounds a little bit tricky

1239
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,389
but at the end of the day it's actually

1240
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,550
not so bad because if you if you look

1241
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:53,039
for example of how the the bitmap stuff

1242
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:55,980
actually works in here you can actually

1243
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,108
get the bitmap information pretty easily

1244
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,750
yourself right you can get this used

1245
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:03,598
bitmap dim and you can do sort of this

1246
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:07,250
this whole process at some level so if i

1247
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:11,039
wanted to i could do something like

1248
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:14,760
let's see your get bit mapped in like

1249
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:17,190
we're actually doing for the fonts right

1250
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,560
and so you can kind of see it happening

1251
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:22,760
here where i could just do that exact

1252
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:25,230
same thing for the bitmap display and

1253
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,690
right in line with it I could say like

1254
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:29,280
okay let's let's see what the bitmap

1255
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:31,710
actually is whatever that bitmap

1256
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,830
actually is that we're going to be

1257
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,889
looking up so I can just go like all

1258
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:40,619
right whatever the bitmap display is

1259
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:42,299
whatever that ID is I'm going to go

1260
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:44,400
ahead and grab that so tell me what that

1261
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:50,430
is and then I'm going to get the

1262
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:52,320
dimensions of it back right and I don't

1263
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:54,809
know what the bitmap scale and bitmap

1264
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,609
offset things are here but I assume that

1265
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:59,940
they're just going to be whatever I was

1266
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:01,920
passing in for for this stuff right

1267
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,480
there just going to be whatever when I

1268
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,789
call push bitmap they're going to be

1269
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,980
whatever I was passing in here so this

1270
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:09,300
would be again the scale and I guess I

1271
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,519
could sort of formalize those are going

1272
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,070
to say the fit map scale is whatever I

1273
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,230
was going to pass in here you know in

1274
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:19,980
the and then I'll just actually pass it

1275
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:24,500
here as well map scale and the bitmap

1276
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:29,530
offset is going to be this stuff right

1277
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:32,619
so like the X part of that

1278
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:34,720
won't change so this stuff can actually

1279
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:37,299
come out here because the min corner is

1280
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:39,159
just the min corner we don't even have

1281
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,260
to do the bounds part I guess because

1282
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:42,879
the min corner is known so this part was

1283
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,910
really kind of a done it I can just say

1284
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:50,519
min corner and I think we're good right

1285
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:55,199
so I can just say there's the min corner

1286
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:58,929
I'm here there's the mid corner again

1287
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:01,779
something like that and that should do

1288
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:03,009
it right I think that all works now it

1289
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,180
won't actually do anything that I just

1290
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,250
want to test to make sure we're still

1291
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:08,109
displaying properly we are and so now if

1292
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:10,269
we want to make it be aspect ratio

1293
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:13,300
correct all we would have to do is say

1294
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:16,989
you know fix that size since we're only

1295
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:22,810
using the size why just fix the size of

1296
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:27,399
the variable itself to actually use the

1297
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:30,670
dim that comes back in X here right that

1298
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:39,099
makes sense so I think that's really all

1299
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:42,159
we need to do oops I don't actually

1300
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:44,829
remember what this has on it it's called

1301
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:47,469
size because of course I can never I

1302
00:55:44,829 --> 00:55:51,549
always have to call dimensions something

1303
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:54,730
different apparently that's just that's

1304
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:57,880
just my thing alright so let's see if

1305
00:55:54,730 --> 00:56:01,119
that does it a little bit better and

1306
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,470
there we go so now you know again we've

1307
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,420
kind of got it locked a little bit

1308
00:56:02,469 --> 00:56:07,919
better and now we can see the actual

1309
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:12,190
bitmap which is kind of nice as well and

1310
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,329
so yeah I mean that's well I guess

1311
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:15,070
there's not a lot more to it than that

1312
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:16,630
that's kind of just the way that goes

1313
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,800
and again so that was just kind of me

1314
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:20,110
showing how you could use you could

1315
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:24,820
overload the same interaction right use

1316
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:26,200
that same code to just do it and you

1317
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,890
could sort of see the other nice thing

1318
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:32,109
about that was that again because of the

1319
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:34,779
way that this UI code is written to be

1320
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:36,700
sort of more it's designed to sort of be

1321
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,230
more flexible and more about debug stuff

1322
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:39,719
we can just add things quickly and you

1323
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,190
don't have to spend a lot of time

1324
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:43,299
fussing with giant frameworks or higher

1325
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,130
cuz just look like that

1326
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,110
having doing something like constraining

1327
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,519
to an aspect ratio is as simple as just

1328
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,530
when I'm going to display it to just

1329
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:52,389
just look at the aspect ratio and fix it

1330
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,860
right I didn't have to go like overload

1331
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:55,150
a bunch of crazy code or do anything

1332
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,160
weird you just go into the place where

1333
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,900
it doesn't and you know you fix it and

1334
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:00,219
that's the really nice thing about doing

1335
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,809
you I this way as well especially

1336
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:03,519
because you know what a debug scenario

1337
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:04,989
the most important thing by far is that

1338
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,929
you can add stuff like that easily if

1339
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:09,789
you want to and so yes you can see how

1340
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:12,759
that's you know 10 20 minutes to add a

1341
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:14,860
display for bitmaps that works right

1342
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,900
with directly in our system and loads

1343
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,120
exactly the thing and all that stuff is

1344
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,320
pretty great right and to have you know

1345
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,839
you have resizing and all that sort of

1346
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:24,580
stuff as well and again yet also you

1347
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,059
know like Oh basil of our stuff and does

1348
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:30,190
all that things so yeah so that's pretty

1349
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:31,900
good and like I said that's kind of the

1350
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,980
goal of this sort of stuff so we're

1351
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,630
getting we're getting a little further

1352
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,190
right we've abstracted our interactions

1353
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:37,960
or instructions work pretty well where

1354
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,579
we're not quite at yet we've got a

1355
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,260
couple things we need to do like we're

1356
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:42,789
not quite out yet is here is this stuff

1357
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,410
is still kind of janky it's kind of all

1358
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:46,210
over the place not laid out very well

1359
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:48,609
and we're still doing a lot of that code

1360
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,929
manually right you know with what's are

1361
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,550
the size of things and that sort of

1362
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:53,230
stuff and we don't even have clipping

1363
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,150
passing through right so things can draw

1364
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,010
over the end there which in this case I

1365
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:59,019
suppose we kind of want but you know in

1366
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,910
general we probably don't want we would

1367
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:03,070
like to be able to not have that so I

1368
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:04,089
think focusing next kind of now that

1369
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:06,670
we've got the inter axis clean up a

1370
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:11,019
little bit maybe next week eynde of

1371
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:13,450
start to clean up that other part of the

1372
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:15,550
you know of the whole situation now

1373
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:17,199
again we do have sort of a thing that we

1374
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:19,480
could decide to address here as well and

1375
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,339
I don't know if we want to but we could

1376
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,260
and that is that you'll notice that we

1377
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:27,670
sort of have this notion that over here

1378
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:29,920
they're like these parameters that are

1379
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:31,119
associated with the viewing which are

1380
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,950
maybe not so associated with the

1381
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,210
variable and what that means is that you

1382
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:35,739
know when we pull something out and

1383
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:39,340
we're looking at a particular debug

1384
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:41,259
value we you know we don't have the

1385
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,910
capability to have these things we

1386
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,110
different sizes and that's another thing

1387
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:46,149
that maybe we might want to do which is

1388
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:47,920
just a structural change that we could

1389
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:49,360
do where the sizes could be separate on

1390
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,710
different ones I think that might be

1391
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,329
something we want to do because of the

1392
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:55,009
very least I think why am I not grab

1393
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,119
okay there we go at the very least one

1394
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:57,650
thing that I think we would want to do

1395
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,650
is we want to make it so that like the

1396
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:01,910
collapsibility is is separated so that's

1397
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:04,548
also we could do and maybe that's the

1398
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:06,379
best thing to do tomorrow alright for

1399
00:59:04,548 --> 00:59:07,518
now I'm going to try to go to a QA but

1400
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,650
I'll be honest with you I don't think

1401
00:59:07,518 --> 00:59:12,169
it's actually going to work because my

1402
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:15,469
internet is not really able for some

1403
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:17,479
reason to get reliable data back from

1404
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:19,068
twitch it's just like right now it just

1405
00:59:17,478 --> 00:59:21,169
says sorry we were unable to connect to

1406
00:59:19,068 --> 00:59:26,420
chat reconnecting in two seconds and

1407
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:28,659
that's all it says right so I really

1408
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:32,479
just don't know what to do about that I

1409
00:59:28,659 --> 00:59:34,670
wish I did but I will try to see if I

1410
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:36,498
can go to the thing ladies and gentlemen

1411
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,999
never like actually like reinstall a

1412
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:39,588
system like this basically what happens

1413
00:59:37,998 --> 00:59:42,009
i reinstalled linux on the system and

1414
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:52,308
now like the Wi-Fi doesn't work and

1415
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:55,369
everything else you know how it is all

1416
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:58,099
right okay i can actually see the chat

1417
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:00,170
now so maybe try to throw a cute colon

1418
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:02,449
or two towards me that I can answer just

1419
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:04,639
so we can have some summits of a QA and

1420
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:05,778
i'll try to figure out why the wireless

1421
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:07,248
doesn't work on this machine anymore

1422
01:00:05,778 --> 01:00:13,759
although i guess the answer is probably

1423
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:15,909
just that linux doesn't work and there

1424
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:15,909
you go

1425
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:30,739
so yeah do we have any Q Cohen's bang a

1426
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:32,059
chance make you Colin's anyone anyone of

1427
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:33,979
course there may be tons of you clones

1428
01:00:32,059 --> 01:00:37,720
that I just can't see right now is your

1429
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:42,490
the thing so that's kind of also a

1430
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:46,118
lovely aspect of the whole situation

1431
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:46,118
which is pretty fantastic

1432
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:01,650
okay oh so I actually can see some Q

1433
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,849
Colin's how about that maybe I'm

1434
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,920
misunderstanding but it's a desired

1435
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:06,719
behavior for the tear feature to tear

1436
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,700
all groups below it even if they are on

1437
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,230
the same level in the hierarchy I would

1438
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:12,509
think you would only want to tear the

1439
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:14,219
current group and subgroups not other

1440
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:16,470
groups on the same level for example you

1441
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:18,809
wouldn't want the profile group to get

1442
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:21,569
torn when you tear the particles group

1443
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:24,480
yeah this is why I saying like so so

1444
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:26,460
right now all we're doing is we just

1445
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,170
tear whatever the actual thing is we

1446
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,539
just tear a reference to that thing and

1447
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:32,789
so whatever that thing was doing it

1448
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:36,210
would it's like it's it's not even

1449
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:38,340
really a copy at all it's just a pointer

1450
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:40,139
to here and so anything that you tear

1451
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:43,320
your going to get the stuff below it if

1452
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:46,980
you were one above right for the most

1453
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,360
part and so that's against something

1454
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,400
that we like I'd like to fix

1455
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:54,210
structurally because I also I want to

1456
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,130
fix the fact that they both expand

1457
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:58,019
because like like I said right now we

1458
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,000
don't actually ever run a copy and we

1459
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:03,000
want to sort of actually clone the

1460
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,889
references which is again really easy to

1461
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:10,219
do but we have to actually do it so so

1462
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:10,219
we should do that

1463
01:02:16,338 --> 01:02:21,518
if I bought a ticket for the con that I

1464
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:24,978
can't use can i donate to someone I

1465
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:27,409
don't see why not you could always email

1466
01:02:24,978 --> 01:02:29,239
me and tell me what you're like order

1467
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:30,828
number was and I could change the name

1468
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:35,749
to somebody else's name if you would

1469
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:40,548
like can the new bit baptist lady torn

1470
01:02:35,748 --> 01:02:42,228
off as well yeah I don't see why not I

1471
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:44,838
mean like I said the tearing stuff is a

1472
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:46,399
little zygote ish at this point but it

1473
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:54,528
seems like it would be able to i'm not

1474
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:56,568
sure i guess right now so the only

1475
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:58,818
reason we can't tear it off right now is

1476
01:02:56,568 --> 01:03:02,929
because there's no interaction set up

1477
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:05,028
for it so so here's the deal we would

1478
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:08,179
need so this part prevents it from being

1479
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:10,338
the fact that this is not set up is the

1480
01:03:08,179 --> 01:03:12,228
thing that would prevent it so if we did

1481
01:03:10,338 --> 01:03:14,659
that if we actually allowed it to have

1482
01:03:12,228 --> 01:03:15,978
an item interaction so it knew it was an

1483
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:20,440
item then I think we could just tear it

1484
01:03:15,978 --> 01:03:20,439
off like like so right

1485
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:32,039
you know I'm saying so so that's fine

1486
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:37,088
but you have to have an item interaction

1487
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:40,059
because if you don't then you can't

1488
01:03:37,088 --> 01:03:42,210
actually do that so you know but what

1489
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:44,619
you well you know what we could do

1490
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:50,260
actually is we could say debug

1491
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:53,010
interaction tear interaction right and

1492
01:03:50,260 --> 01:04:04,720
you can just say tear interaction type

1493
01:03:53,010 --> 01:04:06,310
equals equals not is it not where's it

1494
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,838
auto modify available so i don't

1495
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:09,519
remember exactly what we said the

1496
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:13,779
criteria was the terra thing is like I

1497
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:16,088
said a little bit janky alt you I so

1498
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:18,730
only if it's auto modified variable is

1499
01:04:16,088 --> 01:04:20,318
the only kind but what I could say is

1500
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:23,289
it's just like I could just say you know

1501
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:28,380
it's it's tear it's always tear and so

1502
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:32,650
tear interaction bar equals equals me

1503
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:33,940
which is this bar and so then there

1504
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:35,740
wouldn't be an interaction other than

1505
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:44,470
tearing so basically just be like okay

1506
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:45,729
you know yeah or maybe not huh alright

1507
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:46,959
so they'll be honest I don't understand

1508
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:48,250
why that didn't work I would have

1509
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:56,050
thought that I would be able to tear

1510
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:58,179
that value off oh not if I don't ever

1511
01:04:56,050 --> 01:05:04,480
actually tell it that that's the

1512
01:04:58,179 --> 01:05:06,309
interaction that that would do it so now

1513
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,389
the default for bitmaps is just a tear

1514
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:12,568
right that's just the interaction that

1515
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:12,568
they do

1516
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,630
so

1517
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:26,278
let's see here

1518
01:05:39,108 --> 01:05:43,400
and so for us is it worth doing so much

1519
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:47,989
do I work if the game will not feature

1520
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:50,180
much you I um so I'm not sure what the

1521
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:52,849
question is are you asking like if you

1522
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:54,379
were on a game project and you had to

1523
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:59,749
like make a decision about how much time

1524
01:05:54,380 --> 01:06:01,369
to spend on you I i would say in that

1525
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:02,929
case the answer is probably definitely

1526
01:06:01,369 --> 01:06:05,119
yes because we haven't really spent any

1527
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:06,949
time on you I I mean you know like if

1528
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,298
you're going to make a debug you I you

1529
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:10,429
should spend a couple weeks on it I

1530
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:14,599
would think so i would think you'd spend

1531
01:06:10,429 --> 01:06:17,748
you know i'd probably spend you know two

1532
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:19,489
three weeks at least which is something

1533
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:22,548
like 90 hours of programming time

1534
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:24,440
probably and so all toad will probably

1535
01:06:22,548 --> 01:06:27,639
have spent like 25 hours or something

1536
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:30,409
like that which is actually pretty low

1537
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:31,548
now if you're asking on handmade hero

1538
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:32,719
should we spend time on it I would

1539
01:06:31,548 --> 01:06:34,130
usually say like I think we should spend

1540
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:35,328
time on hammer here on anything that's

1541
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:37,190
an interesting programming thing that's

1542
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:39,710
worth exploring right that people should

1543
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:43,249
probably know how to do usually I try to

1544
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:47,179
do some of it you know and so will we

1545
01:06:43,248 --> 01:06:49,159
make the world's best UI system no but

1546
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:51,348
we will have something relatively decent

1547
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:53,989
like I said which we kind of do have now

1548
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:55,609
it's not quite there yet but you know a

1549
01:06:53,989 --> 01:06:58,548
couple more days and I think we'll be in

1550
01:06:55,608 --> 01:07:04,028
pretty good shape for the stuff that we

1551
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:04,028
might want you know so

1552
01:07:12,099 --> 01:07:25,750
thus Isaac can you add variables to

1553
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:25,750
change the match vectors we could yeah

1554
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:31,909
it might take a little while and there's

1555
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:34,450
some things we should probably we would

1556
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:39,129
want to probably think about for that

1557
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:39,129
but yeah I mean obviously we could

1558
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:58,368
I do not see any more q Coleman's have

1559
01:07:54,619 --> 01:08:01,369
we come to the q Collins I mean if you

1560
01:07:58,369 --> 01:08:03,170
again like if you wanted to have the

1561
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:05,990
match variables be changeable in that

1562
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:09,909
way then one of the things that you have

1563
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:13,909
to do is that you'd have to query them

1564
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:16,399
like every time you drew it so you

1565
01:08:13,909 --> 01:08:20,329
wouldn't be storing a bitmap ID you'd

1566
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:23,629
actually store a type and a vector now

1567
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:26,179
that's not necessarily a bad thing but

1568
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:27,529
you know and you I guess you wouldn't

1569
01:08:26,179 --> 01:08:36,109
have cured everything to desecrate /

1570
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:37,790
type of change I suppose but Briana gore

1571
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:39,679
will there be a menu system like

1572
01:08:37,789 --> 01:08:41,689
pressing start and Zelda to change items

1573
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:44,960
nothing fancy but just something to get

1574
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:47,059
us started on how to do it no not in

1575
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,890
this game there is not a there is not

1576
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:52,489
that kind of interaction I don't really

1577
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:55,690
like those very much I find them to kind

1578
01:08:52,488 --> 01:08:55,689
of really take you out of the game and

1579
01:08:55,750 --> 01:09:02,140
like basically inventory of screens I

1580
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:04,759
really really don't like a lot like I

1581
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:09,890
mean I think there are some ways you can

1582
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:12,229
do them that maybe I don't dislike but

1583
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:14,000
like those kind like specifically the

1584
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:16,608
Zelda kind I really very strongly

1585
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,529
dislike I feel like they take you really

1586
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:26,200
pretty far out of the game experience in

1587
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:27,910
it and I and I don't like that so

1588
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:30,189
I can't remember there was a game like

1589
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:34,380
like dead space or something where they

1590
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:38,250
did the UI in the game or whatever and

1591
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,250
those are a little bit better but

1592
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:01,329
alright I don't see any mark you colon

1593
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:09,270
so I'm going to assume that we have Q

1594
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:09,269
colon doubt let's see let us see here

1595
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,659
alrighty thank you everyone for joining

1596
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,239
me from there sort of handmade hero to a

1597
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:19,720
pleasure coating with you as always if

1598
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:22,289
you would like to follow along yourself

1599
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,970
with a source code at home you can do so

1600
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:26,590
you can go to handmade here org the

1601
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,970
source code comes with pre-orders of the

1602
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:29,680
game so if you peer out of the game you

1603
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,750
get the source code even at the moment

1604
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,700
well we are still in the midst of

1605
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:34,989
developing it so you can check that out

1606
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:36,220
we also have patreon page you want

1607
01:10:34,989 --> 01:10:37,869

1609
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:41,529
a forum site where you can go to ask

1610
01:10:39,909 --> 01:10:43,599
questions and watch anti devis i gotta

1611
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:45,069
catch on like past videos we have a

1612
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,020
tweet bot which of course i forgot to

1613
01:10:45,069 --> 01:10:49,269
update this weekend but normally almost

1614
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:51,850
every weekend I I remember to update the

1615
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:53,200
tweet bot so the tweet bot can always

1616
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:54,430
tweet out schedule at use if you want to

1617
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:57,849
get to stream live that's the easiest

1618
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:59,800
way to do it that's it for today I will

1619
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:01,329
be back here tomorrow at five p.m.

1620
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,940
pacific daylight time same time same

1621
01:11:01,329 --> 01:11:07,800
place or we'll do a few more debug you I

1622
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:09,849
things in the sort of like in the

1623
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,230
pursuit of just getting it to a place

1624
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:14,920
where we can do most the things that we

1625
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:17,889
want to do and we have a few more things

1626
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:20,770
we'd like to be able to do and a big one

1627
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:24,430
there is being able to really easily

1628
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:25,810
inspect our performance profiles and any

1629
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:27,400
other profiling that we may want to add

1630
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:29,470
for example if we want to add some

1631
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:30,909
memory profiling in the future which is

1632
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:32,920
a big one that I would like potentially

1633
01:11:30,909 --> 01:11:34,210
to add that would be something we'd want

1634
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,190
to be able to show there and so we don't

1635
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,649
really quite have the UI at the point

1636
01:11:36,189 --> 01:11:39,939
now where it's it's been fun you know

1637
01:11:38,649 --> 01:11:41,349
polished enough to be able to really do

1638
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:43,929
stuff like that so that's the thing that

1639
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:45,520
we really kind of want to push on so a

1640
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:51,490
couple days of pushing and I think we'll

1641
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:53,800
be there until then well assuming i will

1642
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:55,119
see you tomorrow until then have fun

1643
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:58,170
programming and i'll see you guys on the

1644
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:58,170
internet take these everyone
