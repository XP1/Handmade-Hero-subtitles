00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,160
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,039
here the show recode complete came live

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,230
on stream we are well I don't we're

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,709
going to do today but we might do some

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,789
memory profiling or we might just not

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,150
I'm not sure I care about it I might

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,108
save it for some time later so I don't

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:20,429
know what I'm in the mood to do I'm

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,380
going to do whatever I want to do which

10
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,579
is basically what you should do it cuz

11
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:25,169
you know with not like we don't have

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:29,518
plenty of things to choose from that we

13
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,679
can do to move the engine forward so I'm

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,119
going to go ahead and get to it today

15
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,549
270 so you're going to want to go ahead

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,699
and grab 28 269 source code if you're

17
00:00:35,549 --> 00:00:41,429
trying to follow along at home that's

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,410
really all I have to say so where we

19
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:50,039
left off let's see here where we left

20
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,808
off is we've kind of got our debug

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,539
system doing most of the things that we

22
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:58,259
wanted to do and i made like a little

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,420
nice kind of like headline like a heads

24
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,968
up thing that so when the debug system

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,010
is completely collapsed it kind of just

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,420
shows us a quick little little piece of

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,820
information that tells us like the frame

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,740
rate and those sorts of things so this

29
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,089
is a little sluggish everything is kind

30
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,890
of slow because I had to reboot the

31
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,868
machine those of you who were watching

32
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,269
this live know that like Windows decided

33
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,489
to kind of poop out on us but it's back

34
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,379
now and so I think we're all good looks

35
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:26,938
like we're running correctly so here's

36
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,709
our little line you know when we drop it

37
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:32,188
down we then get a bunch of information

38
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:36,688
that we can look at if we want to and

39
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:39,809
all of that is fine and dandy so I don't

40
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:43,139
know let's just like I said do whatever

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,899
I want to do I can be whoever I want to

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,790
be it's it's a free world in a free

43
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,200
country so let's go well some countries

44
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,868
so that's where you're watching it from

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,759
to lesser and greater degrees depending

46
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:55,349
on where you're watching from it's a

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,840
pseudo free country here in the US so

48
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:59,399
you know you can make sort of a game

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,780
that you want to make as long as you

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,310
don't try to publish it unlike the apple

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,509
store or something because then you

52
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,469
can't make the game you want to make you

53
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,700
got to make the game that they're going

54
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:07,468
to let you publish which is a different

55
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,420
game probably but doesn't matter point

56
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:13,509
being here we go into handmade

57
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,809
good world mode I'm gonna see like okay

58
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:19,509
so you know we've run the game right now

59
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,509
and maybe it'd be a good time to sort of

60
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:24,939
like get get this stuff a little more

61
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:28,120
under control because I now kind of know

62
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:30,009
I finished off how all the design stuff

63
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,180
works and I now pretty much know how all

64
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:36,549
of these things are supposed to work and

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,980
I much to the chagrin of people who are

66
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,390
really love smooth scrolling there is

67
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:42,518
not going to be any smooth rolling in

68
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:43,839
the game at least you know if we want to

69
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,989
make it smooth scroll when you go from

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,580
screen to screen that's okay but this is

71
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,750
not going to be happening in the game at

72
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,510
all because there's essentially no

73
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,340
there's everything in the game has to

74
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,169
have the concept of like a room that

75
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,200
you're in and so even when you're on the

76
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:05,349
out like the in the outside part of the

77
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:08,199
world it wants to be more like a

78
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,659
traditional game where you go from

79
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:15,009
screen to screen and not you know you're

80
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:16,870
never going to have that sort of i'm in

81
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:19,000
between two screens kind of a thing so

82
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,950
for example if we go up here you're

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,430
never going to have the thing where like

84
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,988
this where i can walk between these two

85
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,760
segments that's never going to be a lab

86
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,709
like you pretty much have to walk to the

87
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,389
edge and then hit hit edge and hit this

88
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,750
and then you can be in another room and

89
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:36,578
go right so that's just that's just how

90
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,949
the design work so that's just it's

91
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,049
non-negotiable I'm afraid but you've

92
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,879
seen how we did the scrolling stuff so

93
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,310
if you are making a game that does want

94
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,930
to be more about smooth scrolling and

95
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,219
that sort of thing you know feel free to

96
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,609
do that but we're not going to be doing

97
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:53,439
that here so anyway what I kind of

98
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:57,129
wanted to do I guess is maybe we should

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,039
start thinking about cleaning up that

100
00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:01,479
that sort of code there that world code

101
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,298
and if you remember when you go into

102
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,919
world mode the way that this works is we

103
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:08,409
sort of have this concept that the first

104
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,798
time through you know if it hasn't

105
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:15,729
initialized things right it initializes

106
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,288
them and so when we come through here in

107
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,079
fact I guess I don't really even

108
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:22,509
remember exactly how we decided to

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
write it up or when the world gym

110
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,840
happens i guess now i think about it

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,379
world jen i guess still happens out in

112
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,688
does that still happen out in the game

113
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,710
state stuff i wanna because we kind of

114
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:35,650
pulled this stuff out but we haven't

115
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:40,348
really looked at it in a while so we

116
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:43,478
kind of have this this this sort of

117
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:45,938
state where I were I don't remember if

118
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:48,008
we pulled out the world Jen stuff like

119
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:51,939
you know add wall was a thing right

120
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:54,848
where did that end up going so here it

121
00:04:51,939 --> 00:05:01,210
is and it's in this particular thing

122
00:04:54,848 --> 00:05:03,128
play world and yeah so it looks like it

123
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:04,899
looks like what we do is when we call

124
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:06,340
yeah so we pulled it out to the extent

125
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:08,408
that when you actually say we're going

126
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:11,609
to play world it does the world generate

127
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:13,990
in here right and that's how that works

128
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,110
makes a bunch of random stuff for you

129
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,110
and then you start playing so that stuff

130
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,908
to get pulled out so that's all good so

131
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,919
anyway first order of business here is

132
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:25,478
ground chunks are not a thing ground

133
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,579
chunks are gone so we have to pull the

134
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:31,329
ground chunks so they're they're going

135
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:33,848
to go away and one of the things that's

136
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,109
nice about that too is that'll let us at

137
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:36,848
some point we want to clean up the

138
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,098
renderer since I don't think we're ever

139
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:40,838
going to be rendering in a background

140
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:43,658
task anymore which was something we were

141
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:47,228
doing before this will let us not have

142
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:49,139
to worry about that situation which i

143
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:51,038
think is kind of a nice thing because

144
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,449
yeah we had to make a bunch of

145
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,668
concessions to make the ground chunks

146
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:56,468
work and so we could pull those

147
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:59,408
concessions back out again and simplify

148
00:05:56,468 --> 00:06:01,750
some of the code in the future in ways

149
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:03,158
that would probably be nice so I'm going

150
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,509
to go ahead and nuke the ground chunks

151
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:09,899
ground chunks are gone goodbye it wasn't

152
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:12,009
really all that nice to see you actually

153
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,959
so I'm going to get rid of all of these

154
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,150
and I'm going to get rid of the ground

155
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,180
chunk like storage and all that stuff so

156
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:23,138
anything before where we had ground

157
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,180
chunks uh has to go now those should

158
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,418
have been in here somewhere in they

159
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,519
should have been stored in in the state

160
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:32,699
somewhere i'm assuming they ended up not

161
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:35,319
getting moved over

162
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,789
get to the storage yes oh they're still

163
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,920
in here you can see them in the

164
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,200
transient state so those grand buffers

165
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,169
are going to go away and they're not

166
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,610
going to be around anymore here's our

167
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:52,079
low priority queue stuff for processing

168
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:54,310
and now that I think about it I don't

169
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:58,418
really want to delete the low priority

170
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:02,560
queue entirely I don't think because

171
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:04,810
that's how we load things as well yeah

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,310
so those those I want those to remain I

173
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,560
don't know if they need to be there

174
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,819
necessarily but i do want those to

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,459
remain so it's just the grand chunk

176
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,409
stuff that i want to get rid of so these

177
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:18,609
are gone we don't have the concept of

178
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:21,400
them anymore so so goodbye to you and

179
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,650
you did indent that over and let's see

180
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:28,839
ground buffer count this is the stuff

181
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:30,609
that recompute those ground chunks in

182
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,279
the case where the X people got reloaded

183
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,770
and I don't want that either so all that

184
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,589
stuff should be gone and now when I run

185
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:40,269
this we should be good although of

186
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:41,619
course we you know we could go fix that

187
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:44,949
texture thing today to is another thing

188
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,300
we could do that might be fun so now

189
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,740
when I run this I should see exactly the

190
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,370
same thing but now that ground chunk

191
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,769
stuff is gone which is kind of nice so

192
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:57,759
all right so what I would like to do now

193
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:59,049
is start to kind of pull this this world

194
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,550
rip stuff together a little bit more I

195
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,870
want to kind of tighten this stuff down

196
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,600
I just want to kind of go through

197
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:09,668
everything kind of get it ready for a

198
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:13,180
game code implementation right and this

199
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:14,969
game like I said design-wise oh I don't

200
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:20,160
have my mischeif come on mischief

201
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,160
mischief mischief here we go

202
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,159
once this takes a little bit to load

203
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:43,220
because we've got a lot if that makes

204
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:51,710
sense we've got a lot okay so what I was

205
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:54,320
trying to say was so hmm what I would

206
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:57,500
what I need the game to actually be able

207
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,050
to do now is I want to be able to make

208
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,559
it so that there's the concept of a room

209
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:06,769
and that doesn't necessarily have to be

210
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:09,229
baked in to any sort of data structure

211
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:11,389
or anything we could have different

212
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,039
sizes if we want to like zoom out or

213
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:16,610
zoom in since we can do that with the

214
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:19,399
camera pretty trivially right but there

215
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,730
is going to be an actual grid so there's

216
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,309
gonna be like this actual visible like

217
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,340
very obvious concept that there are

218
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:29,539
individual squares and as I implement

219
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,300
where of the game I think you'll kind of

220
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:35,500
see why that is but i need to actually

221
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:38,659
have this concept of grid squares and so

222
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:44,179
things are not really going to be

223
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:46,129
allowed environmentally speaking there's

224
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:49,250
there's this very heavy prioritization

225
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:53,629
of of that grid and so i'm going to want

226
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,129
to sort of pull back sort of gather back

227
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:57,110
a little bit of that ability to sort of

228
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:01,070
specify where things are in terms of a

229
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:04,430
grid basis and I so I'm going to want to

230
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:09,020
do something where I say like there's a

231
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:11,209
int you know 32 or whatever that is the

232
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:13,220
grid square index and be able to talk

233
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,320
about those so that as the world is

234
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,330
generated I know where I'm talking about

235
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,780
in terms of these grid squares and I can

236
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,460
make them okay and then we're going to

237
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:26,029
do some stuff for drawing later when we

238
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,290
add another art pack to the game but for

239
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,909
right now I just need some way of

240
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:32,088
drawing where those grid squares

241
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:35,269
actually are so what I'm going to do is

242
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm going to make their be I

243
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:41,659
think actual I want to make their be

244
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,780
actual grid squares so there's actual

245
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:47,839
entities and the you know there's grid

246
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,819
entities so that I'm not sure how to

247
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,649
explain this so I actually want to make

248
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,680
an entity for each grid square and that

249
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:57,620
entity would have liked how you get

250
00:10:53,679 --> 00:11:01,039
information about that tile right and I

251
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:07,519
don't the reason that I want to do that

252
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:10,879
at the moment is because I I want to be

253
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,610
able to push the combinatorial aspects

254
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,889
of the game as far as I can and so

255
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,149
although it's going to be mean that

256
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:18,769
there's a lot more entities than there

257
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,659
should be because there's going to be

258
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:22,970
like hundreds of entities on the screen

259
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:25,009
that wouldn't necessarily have to be

260
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,690
entities per se because we could

261
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:29,500
compress them down and talk about them

262
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:33,350
in a more simplified fashion right um

263
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,809
I'm actually not going to worry about

264
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,330
that because I just want to make the

265
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:41,689
decision in this particular game that

266
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,210
it's more about having a wide diverse

267
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,850
way in which things can interact and

268
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,629
react and so everything is going to be

269
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:53,210
simulated including like the ground and

270
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:54,889
so because I want to do that I'm just

271
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,490
going to say up front that I'm going to

272
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:02,419
accept the inefficiency that that brings

273
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,460
because this is an important part of how

274
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:07,189
the games going to work and anything

275
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,930
that flows from that requiring more

276
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,820
memory like you know maybe this games

277
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:12,649
footprint has to be bigger maybe it's

278
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,879
slower and like can't run on his lower

279
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,789
and plat for us because we're simulating

280
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,379
to what stuff who knows whatever it is

281
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:21,709
I'm just making a decision to make that

282
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:24,679
you know I'm making the decision that I

283
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:27,259
want that to be the way that it works so

284
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,779
I'm going to go ahead and start to make

285
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:31,669
that change and again this is not really

286
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,169
a big change or anything this is sort of

287
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,309
like how we had it working initially

288
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,009
when we just start out with a towel map

289
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:39,919
thing and all I'm doing is I'm sort of

290
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:41,809
making a tile map with the entities so

291
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,250
that they can still kind of be arbitrary

292
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:44,869
and we may even want to play with that a

293
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,419
little bit in the game as we go forward

294
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,190
we may want to make it actually

295
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:51,799
eventually so that

296
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,810
you know uh not everything is a regular

297
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,529
grid like we could then make irregular

298
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:59,359
grids out of entities and still the game

299
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:03,049
works the way it works or whatever right

300
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,570
that could be a thing but I want to be

301
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,159
able to recreate those grids so what I'm

302
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,940
going to do first is I'm going to go

303
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:14,809
into that world mode situation here and

304
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,980
I'm going to look at the ad wall which

305
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,959
is this is the thing that we were doing

306
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,480
before and I'm kind of looking at how

307
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,090
this stuff got added and this stuff I'm

308
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,649
going to start to probably hit a little

309
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,940
harder I'm going to like start to

310
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:27,559
streamline this and make this a little

311
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,530
bit more real because it's all kind of a

312
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:32,750
little bit so I go dishes i think the

313
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:38,750
word i've been using it's a little bit

314
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:40,429
like underbaked right okay so here is

315
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,860
the code that creates this you can see

316
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:45,919
that the code creates but it creates

317
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,600
things per screen already and you can

318
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,209
see that what it's doing right here is

319
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,360
it's a sort of calling code to create a

320
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,759
room and that room is passing the

321
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,320
parameters that are based on how many

322
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,779
tiles there are and that sort of stuff

323
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,930
right and we have the concept of the

324
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,980
tiles / tiles / width and all that sort

325
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:07,399
of stuff I don't know where where is

326
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,250
that stuff tiles / there it is being 17

327
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,539
by nine and all that and so when we call

328
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,419
the function that creates the standard

329
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:17,059
room the reason that we're getting you

330
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:20,870
know this this as our room is because I

331
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:22,819
set that 17 by nine to be the the whip

332
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:30,340
that I wanted so we end up with 1 2 3 4

333
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:30,340
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 16 17 right

334
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:36,139
123456789 now in this the way that we

335
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,940
were doing this we had a bunch of things

336
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,588
out here that were like space entities

337
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:44,000
and these other sorts of things and

338
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,670
those entities were we were sort of

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,059
playing with how we were going to

340
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:51,588
represent the movement of the player and

341
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:53,569
again it was it was kind of useful to do

342
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,100
that sort of stuff and again like I was

343
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,270
kind of showing the basis of that and as

344
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,009
the rear scan exploring how the engine

345
00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,079
work that's a good thing but now that I

346
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:02,870
know specifically like I've solidified

347
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,759
exactly how I want move into work

348
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,089
the way that movement actually works in

349
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:12,830
this game / the design is that you move

350
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:18,680
from a cell to another cell always so

351
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:21,560
your your dude cannot stand in between

352
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:24,039
two cells the game doesn't actually

353
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,838
allow that to happen if that makes sense

354
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,399
and you'll again that stuff will sort of

355
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,460
get to as you get a little bit further

356
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,459
down into the implementation but what

357
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,700
that means is that I want or rather I

358
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,330
need to represent how you move from

359
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:44,509
place to place in a way that's more

360
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,629
specific than just a vector that I add

361
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,379
and I allow the player to move around

362
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,210
it's going to be a little more

363
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:51,409
complicated than that and so again

364
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,810
that's what I'm going to start working

365
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:58,009
with now so the first thing to do is we

366
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:59,929
have this concept of entities I don't

367
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:01,789
know if you remember it's it's been a

368
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:05,000
long time obviously but hey if I

369
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:07,610
remember you should remember so we have

370
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,740
this concept of entities and there's

371
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,528
types in the entities i think is it in

372
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,409
sim region where we have the entities

373
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:18,350
yeah and we have some things here that's

374
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:20,419
like like space and what we said is that

375
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,570
space is a carved out area where you can

376
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:27,469
move well that's actually not going to

377
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:29,839
be I don't think necessary anymore I

378
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,490
don't think we need to create extra

379
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,839
entities which are spaced entities which

380
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,028
are what you know telling you that you

381
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,620
can go somewhere what I said I think I

382
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:39,230
want to do is just there's the causative

383
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,060
an entity that and I mean in some sense

384
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,370
we are keeping it it's it's but it's

385
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,409
floor right in others the entity type is

386
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:48,230
now like a square you can stand on like

387
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:50,059
a standable thing and so instead of

388
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,670
calling this space which is not really

389
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:55,278
indicative of what I actually am trying

390
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:57,860
to say what I actually would call this

391
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,389
would would be you know floor or

392
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,519
something or something like that right

393
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:07,250
and or a standable I don't know any

394
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:09,189
typos or play like you know a place you

395
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,429
can stand what would that called perch

396
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:15,380
placement a node graph I don't know I'm

397
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,670
just going to call up floor because even

398
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,780
though a lot of times it just

399
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,220
grass or something that isn't

400
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:22,970
technically a floor will know what I

401
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:25,880
mean all right so let's go ahead and

402
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,829
actually make this happen you can see

403
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,290
here that we call add ground identity

404
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,509
for the standard room and we make one of

405
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,730
these edit e space things that's not

406
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:37,220
going to be useful to us anymore because

407
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,650
I want an entity in each of the tiled

408
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,440
positions that that creates the actual

409
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,410
conceptual floor so what I actually want

410
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,170
to do here is I want to do a like a for

411
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:50,060
I loop to create one in each of those

412
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,880
positions so what I'm going to do is you

413
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:56,000
can see here we get like this position

414
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,880
here for the AB style x y&amp;z what I

415
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,400
actually want to do is loop over with

416
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,860
you know using an offset that takes

417
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:09,230
whatever the standard room size is and

418
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:14,649
does that that 17 by nine thing to it

419
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:17,660
right so let's let's do offset x 0 right

420
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,610
and I guess technically if we wanted to

421
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,120
do these rooms as if they were centered

422
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:25,519
rooms which maybe we do right we would

423
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,519
start the offset off if we were talking

424
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:32,210
about 17 we would start the offset off

425
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:35,930
as being negative 8 right and we would

426
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,910
let the offset X get up to eight so that

427
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:41,840
way we would create 17 but they would be

428
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:45,310
a balanced 17 if that makes sense so I'm

429
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:49,659
going to go ahead and create those here

430
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:52,190
you can kind of see it happening like so

431
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,940
and what I want to do now is I just want

432
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,370
to say again the 17 by 9 so 9 would be

433
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,250
the same it would be you know negative 4

434
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:03,289
24 and we'll see if we will you know

435
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,940
we're probably parametrize that in a

436
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,139
little bit but you know because now

437
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,880
we've got that kind of fine in two

438
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,020
places but that's again not really a

439
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,340
concern of mine at the moment because

440
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:13,039
I'm just you know just going to sort of

441
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:15,230
push through this code once and make it

442
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,659
be representative of how the game

443
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,190
actually works at its core so when I do

444
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,890
this out standard room here we go i'm

445
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:25,970
going to do this add got identity bit

446
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:28,310
here and I'm doing the standard room

447
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,579
collision thing standard room collision

448
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,309
is really presumably now

449
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,470
entered floor collision right and

450
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,240
standard floor collision I don't know

451
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,089
that we really need standard for

452
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,640
collision in the way that it was before

453
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:43,949
in some sense this entity doesn't really

454
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,950
have any collision because you can't

455
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,779
really run into it it's just a floor

456
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,519
tile that you can hop too and there's no

457
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:53,460
way to like bump into the floor tile I

458
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:56,129
don't think mm I don't know maybe that's

459
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,970
not true I it depends I guess how we

460
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,740
want to look at it but anyway that very

461
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,660
least would be standard for collision

462
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,880
not standard room collision and when we

463
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,320
say that it's traversable what I don't

464
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:13,010
actually want that 22 probably mean the

465
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,950
same thing as it does but it's a good

466
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:19,019
it's a good name right and in some sense

467
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,289
maybe that traversable is actually a

468
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:27,119
very good name for the entity type that

469
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:29,190
we're talking about here it could be

470
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,500
that this entity type is a traversable

471
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,480
in fact it's just a thing that's sitting

472
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,839
there and so I don't know like should it

473
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,440
be a flag maybe it should be a flag I

474
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,949
don't know that's it that's a tough

475
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,500
decision that's a really tough decision

476
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,480
and I'm not sure I guess technically

477
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,589
since we had a flax from there ready

478
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,759
maybe I'll stick with the flaxen just

479
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:52,199
say when you make something you tag it

480
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,640
as traversable then it's going to be a

481
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,319
floor thing that you can stand on and

482
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:00,120
that seems fair enough yeah I would say

483
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:02,519
ok so we have our ab style x and i'm

484
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:10,079
going to Pat like add in that offset

485
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:11,700
right at this point and to be honest I'm

486
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,769
not sure why these are you 30 tues

487
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,590
because I thought that we had centered

488
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:19,099
the world around 0 and so I don't

489
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:27,809
understand why the tile values aren't

490
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:29,579
like plus and minus e I like you know

491
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm saying like I don't know why they're

492
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,240
you 30 tues

493
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,830
don't don't understand why I guess I

494
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,330
only go up or down with them but I don't

495
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:46,819
like that's not something we're going to

496
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:50,839
want to keep so that probably has to get

497
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:53,980
changed in the future all right so let's

498
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:57,199
take a look at standard room collision

499
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,569
here's the make simple grounded

500
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,380
collision thing and this is this is

501
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:05,839
going to be just one tiles one tile big

502
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:10,300
right that's that's all it's going to be

503
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:12,799
for now and standard floor collision

504
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:14,629
well standard floor collision is the

505
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,039
name that I made for this thing and I'm

506
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,570
going to have to change these ones up

507
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:22,879
here so we actually have like let's see

508
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:28,549
wall collision floor collision room

509
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,800
collision and I I guess I don't really

510
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:33,559
need to call it floor either standard

511
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:38,119
really because it's not sized in any

512
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:39,769
particular way anymore so okay so when

513
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,899
we add standard room there is no way to

514
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:43,250
return a single entity anymore because

515
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,890
there's a bunch of entities that are

516
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,779
created for that room and so that's just

517
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,280
not going to work we just we're not

518
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:50,539
going to be able to give that back if

519
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,279
someone wanted it they're going to have

520
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:55,190
to be a sad panda because they're not

521
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,920
going to get it so anyway I'm going to

522
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,740
go ahead and fix up these last parts

523
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,050
here and so when we draw one of these

524
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,809
floor tiles I'd like to be able to see

525
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:07,669
it and so I think what I'll do here is

526
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,289
again we'll just use the same thing

527
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,230
we're doing before we'll do a push

528
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:14,329
wrecked outline on the collision volume

529
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,759
so that we can see where its volume

530
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:20,319
actually is and I just want to see what

531
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,490
that actually ends up doing for us so

532
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:25,099
yeah so now we're creating a ton more

533
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,599
entities so we're going to have to

534
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:28,369
reduce the number of screen counts we do

535
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,599
because right now we still have some

536
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:31,069
hard coded stuff in there we were like

537
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,750
this is the maximum number of entities

538
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:35,269
you can have I think we'll probably get

539
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:39,140
rid of that a little in a little bit as

540
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:41,389
well what is this ground chunk rendering

541
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,810
ground chunks are gone I deleted ground

542
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,810
chunks

543
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:53,660
goodbye all right uh so yeah so anyway

544
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,250
in here I'm just going to make it so

545
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,500
that we don't create very many screens

546
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,849
at all you know we'll just do the one

547
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,309
we're starting on for now and then we'll

548
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:03,230
increase it a little bit but that way we

549
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:06,500
don't have to wait for anything weird

550
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,019
like that so okay so now you can see I'm

551
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,960
picking these and hey we did create them

552
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:14,389
so that's nice right and that's all good

553
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,920
because this is you know I can actually

554
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,830
see them there in fact if I want to I

555
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,470
can even use our little system here to

556
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:26,799
sort of show where they all are and

557
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:30,799
that's all great right fantastic okay um

558
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,129
so I would like to draw them perhaps a

559
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,869
little bit more permanently though uh

560
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:39,620
when I do the drawing here I want to

561
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:43,789
actually I guess I'm not at the moment

562
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:45,829
drawing the the floor things I think cuz

563
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:47,690
yet because it's turned off I do want to

564
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:50,569
actually draw these always I just want

565
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,210
to draw them with actual art but for now

566
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:55,609
we'll just draw the collision rectangles

567
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,980
which seems fine but yet but there we go

568
00:24:55,609 --> 00:25:01,039
so now we can see them all and that's

569
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:04,759
much better but we're still not really

570
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,920
doing what I wanted to do yet because

571
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:12,230
what i want to do now is I want the are

572
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,490
the character to move specifically you

573
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,890
know from from one of these together and

574
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:18,620
to understand Winnie's on a particular

575
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:22,100
one and not right so basically like the

576
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:26,329
character should be aware of that fact

577
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:28,099
and should we need to start considering

578
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:31,129
these things differently than we were

579
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:32,449
right there not traversable in the way

580
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,280
that we were thinking the before

581
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,880
traversable before we're like empty

582
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,859
spaces and that you could move through

583
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,360
continuously as part of your collision

584
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:48,019
and that's not really what I want to do

585
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:54,349
if that makes sense so what I would like

586
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:57,019
is what I'd like to I just need to think

587
00:25:54,349 --> 00:26:02,329
through how exactly I want

588
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:05,660
these to be used for starters I probably

589
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:08,779
will want these to be able to have

590
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,540
different elevations and so that's going

591
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:12,710
to be kind of shouldn't say probably i

592
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,599
know that i want to have different

593
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,279
elevations the only question is how

594
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:18,230
meaningful that is in terms of like

595
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:21,589
whether that one can be so high that you

596
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:25,759
can't go to it if it's next to you if

597
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:33,289
that makes sense so we'll see you about

598
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:35,119
that in a second but that that just in

599
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:36,680
general again is something that I kind

600
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,619
of have to start thinking about more

601
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,570
through the pipeline so the way that we

602
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:43,099
did collision volumes before right is we

603
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,869
have this concept that a thing

604
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:46,849
references a collision volume and that

605
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,289
collision volume has stuff in it and so

606
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:51,230
the way that we were doing movement is

607
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:54,349
just by saying hey if something's

608
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,720
collision volumes say that you can move

609
00:26:54,349 --> 00:27:00,079
into them then that's like a walkable

610
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,140
region and that's how this that's how

611
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,210
this dude is moving right that's how

612
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,690
that's how I'm moving around here if

613
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:15,680
instead we were to say oh when we create

614
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:20,660
that room like in here if instead when

615
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:22,850
we did add standard room if we didn't

616
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,570
always add this like let's say we did

617
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:30,889
something where we said like if offset x

618
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:34,250
is less than negative 3 or something

619
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:38,509
like that or maybe greater than negative

620
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:40,970
3 then we add the flag then we would end

621
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:43,579
up in the situation where you couldn't

622
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:46,430
move into those squares even though

623
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:48,529
there's not an obstacle blocking you you

624
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:51,529
just can't go and so you see that happen

625
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:57,829
here look I can't get any further it

626
00:27:51,529 --> 00:28:01,970
passed this past that boundary right

627
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:04,519
that's not something I can do and the

628
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,009
reason for that right is because if we

629
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,170
select this guy I guess there's we don't

630
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:10,740
have a good any good selection tools for

631
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,970
when there's entities on top of

632
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,000
each other i'm not sure what we would

633
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:18,600
how we necessarily fix that but what's

634
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,039
happening there right is when i when i

635
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:26,009
try to move into this region i think

636
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,589
what i like is i don't really know but i

637
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:31,140
guess what happens currently is you can

638
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:32,639
go up until you would hit the end of it

639
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:37,580
with your end that's what it looks like

640
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:40,710
right because negative 3 would be what I

641
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:47,819
what did I say so it goes to negative

642
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:50,250
where's the midpoint 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so

643
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:54,899
8 on either side and this would be the

644
00:28:50,250 --> 00:29:00,359
midpoint so negative 3 this would be 0

645
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:04,679
negative 1 negative 2 negative 3 yeah so

646
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:06,299
essentially essentially it looks like

647
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:11,460
that's the way our our thing was working

648
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:15,149
before and I think I could keep doing

649
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,319
this that way and we could make it so

650
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,920
that it worked that way but I'm not sure

651
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,589
that that's useful I think what I

652
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:26,940
actually want to do is say that

653
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:31,500
traversable 'he's just have a point that

654
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:36,058
you can stand on right and when you are

655
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:37,710
moving you go to that point and when you

656
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,599
want to go to the next one it looks to

657
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,900
see in that direction if there is one

658
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:48,509
for you to go to go to if that makes

659
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:50,910
sense uh that's what I actually want if

660
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:52,740
that makes sense so that's actually some

661
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,910
work right in order to to make that

662
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,700
happen that's going to be more

663
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,269
complicated but what that means is also

664
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,460
that like the way that we do movement

665
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:06,269
the part that is people colliding with

666
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,160
other people or obstacles that still

667
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:10,589
makes sense but the part that we did

668
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,360
that was moving through empty space I I

669
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:13,740
don't think does anymore because we're

670
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,659
it's not about moving through empty

671
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:21,919
space is about moving between specific

672
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:21,919
points and so yeah so there's that

673
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:32,519
ok so again so now if I kind of come

674
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:36,060
back to that what I'm going to do is I'm

675
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:40,170
going to say for you know for the sake

676
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:42,299
of like pushing this slowly forward I'm

677
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:46,220
going to take a look at the way where's

678
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:49,859
my sim region doing my sim region again

679
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,839
I'm going to say that the Samana t I

680
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:55,079
like that the category regular butter I

681
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:59,189
like that we that introspection stuff is

682
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:03,689
so funny I don't know why it was called

683
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:10,140
regular butter I wish we knew all right

684
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:13,019
anyway so pure and cemented e what I

685
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,900
want to do is say okay if this thing if

686
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:18,809
this entity has one of these collisions

687
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,180
volume groups the like I could just

688
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:26,220
probably use that same concept like

689
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:30,960
these collisions volume groups there we

690
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,789
go these collision volume groups are you

691
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,920
know they have a series of things that

692
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:37,079
tell us how the thing collides what I

693
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,600
want to do is say well maybe in addition

694
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:43,069
to that there's also liked the concept

695
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,069
of traversable points

696
00:31:49,740 --> 00:32:09,548
is it able or herbal don't know anyway

697
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:10,808
so if we have one of these at the moment

698
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:11,889
it's just going to be a pee but I don't

699
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:15,490
know we might want more information

700
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,299
there at some point but point but point

701
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:22,450
being if we have one of these and

702
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:25,480
there's a traversable there then you can

703
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:29,769
move to it and if not not and so that's

704
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,779
sort of more what I was thinking and

705
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,429
again yeah don't know how good of an

706
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:35,859
idea this is or if it's a good idea at

707
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:39,009
all but I'm just thinking that that's

708
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:40,869
how I want to implement it as a start

709
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:42,609
and so that way you know we could have

710
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:45,189
things and say that there were multiple

711
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:48,189
points like a single entity that moves

712
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:50,080
around could have multiple traversal

713
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:55,269
points on it that you can move between

714
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:57,548
if that makes sense but you know it's

715
00:32:55,269 --> 00:33:05,349
always a specific set of points that you

716
00:32:57,548 --> 00:33:09,009
can actually stand on and like I said

717
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:10,959
most of the time this is just a grid but

718
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,819
I figured we might as well implement it

719
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,620
in a way that allows us to build nan

720
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:19,058
grid things if we want to because it

721
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:21,189
like for example you know if you're

722
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:24,490
moving along these these things you know

723
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:26,230
maybe sometime you know you want to do

724
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,909
like a little like snakey little path

725
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,860
like this or something and that just

726
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:33,280
might be fun to be able to do that

727
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:37,178
instead you know just something to think

728
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,470
about so so I'm going to say that

729
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:40,929
there's this set of traversable than

730
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,279
anything that is has one of these clin

731
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,230
value if so you can have collision

732
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,839
volumes for things that you cannot move

733
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,429
through but it can also have traversable

734
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:52,990
which are things that you can stand on

735
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:56,080
our points that you can stand on and so

736
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:59,230
then I'm going to go ahead and take a

737
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,279
look at the collision routines which I

738
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,839
believe her in here

739
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:06,670
in move entity so you can see in here

740
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:10,539
the way this works it's kind of annoying

741
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:14,980
a crappy code that we kind of played

742
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:16,269
around with but you know until we want

743
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,679
to actually sort of rewrite the

744
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:18,759
collision texture I'm gonna leave it the

745
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,639
way it is we're not going to fuss with

746
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,080
it we're just going to leave it in it's

747
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,918
sort of all in its it's sort of

748
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,750
prototype II state but the hero i'm

749
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:30,190
going to delete this because we don't

750
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:34,000
really need to break when it's the hero

751
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,980
specifically at this point oh well you

752
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,360
know what I'm sure we'll probably use

753
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,280
that again actually so maybe we will

754
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,730
maybe I won't delete it even though it's

755
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,820
not necessary at the moment so when we

756
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,070
do this stuff and we've got these

757
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:55,780
iterations that we're going through so

758
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:58,120
what I actually want to do here is what

759
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,090
I actually want to do here is I want the

760
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:05,829
there to be some sort of conceptual way

761
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:10,120
that this this code works that's largely

762
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:12,489
semantic so I need this and like I said

763
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:16,059
it's going to be contra key I need this

764
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:18,519
function to still work with the

765
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:22,929
collision volumes but I just need to

766
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:25,300
pull out the part where it I need to

767
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:29,079
remove the part that's talking about the

768
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,490
traversable right so the part where it

769
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:35,139
looks to see if something's traversable

770
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:38,409
which is like here I i need to to remove

771
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:43,119
that right and let's see this is if it's

772
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:45,879
traversable and can collide so we all of

773
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,210
this stuff let's see how we're doing

774
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,940
here so this is all just kind of

775
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:53,820
refreshing my memory of how we did this

776
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,650
handle events based on area of lapping

777
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,230
collision loop you

778
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:02,789
and so here's the ground stuff so yeah

779
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:04,980
so get entity ground point now so this

780
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:06,179
is going to be very formalized because

781
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,610
now what's going to happen is the

782
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:14,279
entities ground points are always going

783
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:17,670
to be specifically tied to that that

784
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,590
information about the traversable 'he's

785
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,269
so you're always going to be standing on

786
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:24,120
one of those and when you're moving

787
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:26,400
between two of them you're going to be

788
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,859
like that's an actual thing that's known

789
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,099
so entities move between two of these

790
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:36,300
points and they can't change that

791
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:39,539
traversal really right part of the rules

792
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,610
of the game are like when you decide to

793
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:43,529
go from one square to another you have

794
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:47,190
to touch that square you decided to go

795
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:48,930
to you can't like even if you steer and

796
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,429
decide to go down like you know I was

797
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:52,859
going left and then I decided to go down

798
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:54,299
if you've committed to that square

799
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,640
you're still going to touch you're going

800
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,500
to technically go through it and that's

801
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,759
just like I said part of the rules of

802
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,349
the way the game works so so yes if

803
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,220
you're always doing that there is no

804
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:11,969
such thing as like gravity really or Z

805
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:15,119
freefall you're always going to a

806
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:17,909
particular Z so in some sense yeah

807
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,190
gravity is not really a thing at all in

808
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:21,869
fact we can really get rid of this this

809
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,519
stuff can go there's no such thing as an

810
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:28,380
unsupported entity there's no such thing

811
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:33,239
as as being in free fall it's just plain

812
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:37,079
not allowed so yeah so we're going to

813
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:41,459
get rid of this gravity goes away and

814
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:44,009
that is supported thing that has to go

815
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,840
away as well so I don't even know was

816
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,580
that just a flag that was set up here is

817
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,850
supported as you support it that's what

818
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:52,650
it was so Z support is not here what

819
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:55,769
does this say does it make more sense a

820
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,300
flag neckla collides non-spatial yeah so

821
00:37:55,769 --> 00:38:00,239
some of this again some of this stuff is

822
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,310
going to go as well a traversable also I

823
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,129
guess technically we don't really need

824
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:07,619
that flag because it's just that would

825
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:09,250
just be if we want to optimize because

826
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,400
really it's just if you have a

827
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:14,050
Percival point then you do you know so

828
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,760
the concept that something's traversable

829
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:17,650
is known from looking at its collision

830
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,010
group so that just seems like it's not

831
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:22,869
really an issue anymore so yeah so Z

832
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:26,050
supported I'm going to go ahead and get

833
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:27,609
rid of this stuff so ground plus equals

834
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:29,560
like all of this stuff where we take the

835
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,440
ground and we we change that stuff this

836
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,750
this is all not this is this is not

837
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,030
allowed anymore all of this is gone so

838
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:41,460
let's see blah blah blah blah blah blah

839
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:46,810
blah blah blah that's that's going away

840
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:49,210
and yeah so the isset reversible thing

841
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:50,949
basically I want to neuter all of this

842
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,900
stuff because that's going to kind of

843
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:54,279
get handled in a separate phase so I all

844
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:58,300
I really want this cousins active

845
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,460
routine to do anymore is I really just

846
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,070
want it to collide if there's you know

847
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,900
two entities that are trying to move and

848
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,880
they hit each other that's the only

849
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:10,480
thing that this routine is supposed to

850
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,400
be doing at all and so I just want it to

851
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,130
like handle that case it's not supposed

852
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,170
to check whether you can go stand

853
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,820
somewhere you can always go stand there

854
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:21,550
if you don't run into an obstacle in the

855
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,830
way so that concept that we had before

856
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:26,260
about also defining the space which you

857
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:28,779
can move and the ground area like that's

858
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:32,470
that's no more that's not that's not how

859
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:35,500
we want this to work anymore so yeah so

860
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:40,500
is set entity traversable and this thing

861
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:42,969
and can collide what I don't know is

862
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:47,530
where do we handle the things that

863
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:50,319
aren't traversable like where do we

864
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:56,110
handle colliding with things that are

865
00:39:50,320 --> 00:40:00,130
non traversable right oh here we go it's

866
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:01,840
an or so yeah so what I really want to

867
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:05,440
know is I really want to know the can

868
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,570
collide thing right I really just want

869
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,909
to know can collide so if it's can

870
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:12,700
collide then we go through and we do the

871
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:17,559
volume test we see whether or not we

872
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:20,009
would hit this thing right and that's

873
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:20,009
all good

874
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,119
I'm not sure where the traversable part

875
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:29,579
was exactly so we go through the volumes

876
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,489
we say for each test volume we do our

877
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:35,750
Minkowski dilation we see whether or not

878
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:38,309
we would hit the walls of this thing

879
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,190
here is the traversable part okay so we

880
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:43,549
say if it's reversible then we allow

881
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,079
ourselves to to go through it I guess

882
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:48,390
and that's the part that we're gonna

883
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,090
have to change this case is no longer

884
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:54,599
really happening right so really all

885
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:57,840
we're doing is this one case here which

886
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:09,029
is the case where the thing is an

887
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:13,800
obstacle okay and we also need to make

888
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:18,230
it here where I think the tmaxx is all

889
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,230
we really have to do with the tmaxx

890
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:27,119
before we were computing the furthest we

891
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,500
could go by using that t max value so

892
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,469
now we just have to assume that the

893
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,840
furthest you can go is all the way right

894
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:36,480
so we really as long as we just set t

895
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,090
max to always be one I'm assuming that

896
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,949
that will solve the problem that we what

897
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:42,510
we use to do is we use the collisions

898
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:45,989
are to figure out how far I could go

899
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:49,350
through movable space right and that's

900
00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:52,079
going away now so now this entity flag

901
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:54,299
traversable bit that actually I can get

902
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,630
rid of because now what we're going to

903
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,970
do is when we create that rounded

904
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:03,690
collision or ground identity whatever

905
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:05,789
collision what I want to do is take the

906
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,490
floor collision and add one of those

907
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:11,750
points that you can stand on so where I

908
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:14,549
do this make simple grounded collision

909
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:17,130
what I need to do is make this one's a

910
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,560
little bit more specific and so what I'm

911
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:24,470
going to probably do is is go get that

912
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,469
code make simple grounded collision oops

913
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:34,290
I'm going to take this and I'm going to

914
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:37,099
make like another one of these that's

915
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:40,108
that's fancier so make simple

916
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:44,579
traversable or make simple floor

917
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:47,608
collision something like that and and

918
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:50,579
there we go so I don't really know what

919
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:53,460
the tile depth so this was making like

920
00:42:50,579 --> 00:43:03,599
an empty area with a certain height to

921
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:05,909
it and the floor is actual to extend

922
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,349
downward a bit right it's not supposed

923
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:12,989
to extend upward anymore so I'm not sure

924
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:15,030
exactly how we want to do that but I

925
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:17,818
guess tile depth and meters is the thing

926
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:23,329
to pass here probably and when we call

927
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:27,150
this function make simple for collision

928
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:32,280
what I'm going to do here is say that

929
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:34,139
that dims eCos out the bottom so what is

930
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,170
this Dogma not world arena change using

931
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:40,289
the fundamental types arena etc oh ok

932
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:43,170
well we Creek recruit we recreate these

933
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:44,670
every time though so why am i

934
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,019
complaining about that I don't know why

935
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:48,000
we would need a fundamental types arena

936
00:43:46,019 --> 00:43:49,440
I guess just so we don't like why

937
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,088
wouldn't you just create these every

938
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,950
time you started the game I don't know

939
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:53,880
that seems like a stupid to do but i'll

940
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:55,469
leave it for now because we're not

941
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,180
thinking about that stuff right now so

942
00:43:55,469 --> 00:44:03,269
maybe it wasn't as stupid as it sounds

943
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:05,519
who knows anyway so this volume stuff at

944
00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:07,710
the moment i actually don't need this

945
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,630
thing to have a collision volume now

946
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,559
that doesn't mean i won't want it to

947
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:15,059
have a collision volume in the future

948
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,920
because like i said i want some of these

949
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:19,230
to be like higher up potentially than

950
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,490
others and things like that and so you

951
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,199
know we may go ahead and do that a

952
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:24,649
little bit in the future but for right

953
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:28,759
now i don't actually want that to happen

954
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,760
so let's

955
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:37,558
let's go ahead and make this happen

956
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:58,139
there we go so here's my traversable

957
00:44:44,980 --> 00:45:04,719
point what's the total volume hmm i

958
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:06,848
don't have a total volume here i want to

959
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:10,838
include the Traverse little point in the

960
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:12,099
total volume well I don't know so I

961
00:45:10,838 --> 00:45:14,259
guess what I would say is the total

962
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:18,220
volume is still going to be that

963
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,319
dimension and the offset p is is at this

964
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:23,768
point I think going to be 1 point 0 dim

965
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,778
Z in the sense that it's displaced

966
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:28,389
downward right I guess I don't know what

967
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:30,190
the offset p the ossipee would be up so

968
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:36,328
from the carpenter so it's actually

969
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:38,259
negative it goes like down or I guess

970
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:40,930
given the way that we wrote that if it

971
00:45:38,259 --> 00:45:44,139
point 5 is the amount we do it be 0 so

972
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:46,028
it would be entirely below it right I

973
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:50,409
think that's how I love to go read let's

974
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:54,730
go see how that's actually listed but

975
00:45:50,409 --> 00:46:00,250
anyway so in here I would then say okay

976
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:03,849
I want to do my traversable 'he's that

977
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:05,768
first reversible is going to be at the

978
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:07,930
zero zero zero point right it's that

979
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:09,129
middle point so I really wouldn't even

980
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:10,750
have to initialize it but that just

981
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,818
gives me that one traversable that I

982
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:16,690
wanted right and I'm going to go draw

983
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:21,509
these so we can see them no binary oh

984
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:25,650
right stop key so in here where we do

985
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:28,599
volume count and we draw the volumes out

986
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,700
for what we were doing so let's see

987
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,278
where was that that was in the floor

988
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:37,000
right so where we draw these out here

989
00:46:33,278 --> 00:46:38,500
i'm also going to do a thing where we

990
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,909
draw the traversable sand what I should

991
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,900
do is I should pull this out into a

992
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:44,210
thing that's like draw collision volume

993
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,030
I don't know why it's not that way as as

994
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:55,429
is we'll probably do that in a second so

995
00:46:47,030 --> 00:47:02,950
here's that traversable point and wish

996
00:46:55,429 --> 00:47:02,949
we had more screen real estate all right

997
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:21,980
and I'll just make this called

998
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:26,119
reversible index so what I'll do here is

999
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:28,429
I'll do a push wrecked that just

1000
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:35,329
basically draw like a point at wherever

1001
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:40,239
this thing is and so I think I just do

1002
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:45,559
whatever the volume whatever the

1003
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:48,679
reversible p is I don't know that I want

1004
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:51,349
to do anything else with it and then

1005
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:54,319
we've got the volume dim XY that's what

1006
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:56,539
I want Oh what's not a volume it's so

1007
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,420
really this is just a dim so I don't

1008
00:47:56,539 --> 00:48:03,619
know what the dim should be you know

1009
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:10,570
some number and then we would draw this

1010
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:10,569
as a point you can stand off oops

1011
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:22,530
so yeah that's not great I'm continually

1012
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:26,199
moving upwards everything else was fine

1013
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:30,160
but i guess that ground point bit was a

1014
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:32,858
problem hold please I don't actually

1015
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:36,598
know how we recompute where the ground

1016
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:42,579
point for the entity is but let's check

1017
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:49,030
player Delta eg and let's see do we have

1018
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:51,598
a dot Z coming in anywhere here I can't

1019
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,599
see where I am

1020
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:16,129
so what exactly do we do with this

1021
00:49:10,429 --> 00:49:19,699
ground handle overlap at ground testing

1022
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:22,849
the index can overlap entities overlap

1023
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:28,969
handle overlap what does the handle

1024
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:32,119
overlap do pray tell that just does

1025
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:34,879
stairwells I'm going to pull that for

1026
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:38,119
now because we don't have that concept

1027
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,420
at the moment so let's just simplify

1028
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:43,818
things a little bit here and say that

1029
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:50,690
handle overlap is going to go away for

1030
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:52,308
the moment so this all goes away and now

1031
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:55,400
we just the figure out why we're getting

1032
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:57,079
that movement upwards I assume it's just

1033
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:02,269
an offset like you saw what I'm talking

1034
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:09,740
about right like see I'm floating

1035
00:50:02,268 --> 00:50:11,868
upwards not good so let's see so what is

1036
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:14,538
the position that we actually except we

1037
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:17,000
take entity DP and updated so now we've

1038
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:19,490
got the velocity that we're going to try

1039
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,588
and then I assume through here we've got

1040
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:28,548
the TMNT max and when we get out to the

1041
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:32,389
bottom we take our team into max we take

1042
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:37,849
our player Delta and we move the player

1043
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:40,368
by that amount so where is the player

1044
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:44,289
Delta getting a Z displacement from

1045
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:44,289
would be my first question

1046
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:58,058
because i'm not sure why we would ever

1047
00:50:53,659 --> 00:51:00,798
get anything into the z-component there

1048
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:03,609
like that doesn't actually meet a whole

1049
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:03,608
lot of sense to me

1050
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:19,170
I'm going to go ahead and just check to

1051
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:22,440
see if player Delta is the thing I'm

1052
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:24,360
just going to say player Delta Z equals

1053
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,599
zero to see what happens if we prevent

1054
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:30,570
any amount of Z motion at the moment all

1055
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:35,909
I know if it still does it okay so

1056
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:39,870
apparently that was it so we are getting

1057
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:52,469
Z acceleration in there for some unknown

1058
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:55,309
reason okay so anyway I think that's

1059
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:58,259
probably about time to stop for today

1060
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:59,250
but I guess I've got a couple more

1061
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,020
minutes left so I'm just going to look

1062
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:04,349
into this where we're getting that Z

1063
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:07,050
motion where we're getting that from so

1064
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:10,049
we come in here and we are passing in an

1065
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:12,330
acceleration so I guess the first thing

1066
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:15,690
I would check is is the acceleration

1067
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:20,090
ever being set to something positive so

1068
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:22,530
if I was to zero out the Z acceleration

1069
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:24,030
would I still get the upward motion my

1070
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:25,110
assumption would have been yes because I

1071
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,930
don't think we're ever telling it to

1072
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:29,880
accelerate upwards right so what that

1073
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:31,679
says is that it's nobody's ever

1074
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,660
accelerating anything upwards but we're

1075
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:37,250
still getting some upward stuff anyway

1076
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:41,339
so where is that coming from so here's

1077
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:44,909
some we're doing some multiplication of

1078
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:47,039
the DDP here to to normalize it and we

1079
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:48,750
take it multiply the MU spec speed if we

1080
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,070
started out with zero here then we're

1081
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,769
not going to get any we shouldn't ever

1082
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:56,100
get any other zeros here same thing with

1083
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:59,909
this if we never got any pot n Easy

1084
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:02,279
velocity we should never see any of that

1085
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:05,519
happening so I'm not really sure what

1086
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,430
the deal is with that and then through

1087
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,469
here obviously still like none of this

1088
00:53:08,429 --> 00:53:12,359
stuff seems like it should generate Z

1089
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:14,849
and so what I'm wondering is do we

1090
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:21,539
somehow have velocity that's pointing

1091
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:22,519
upwards somehow when and where is that

1092
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:24,769
happening

1093
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:27,889
so the first thing I'm going to say is

1094
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:31,789
let's go back and look to see when we

1095
00:53:27,889 --> 00:53:33,769
have handmade world mode I'm going to go

1096
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:36,259
take a look to see what happens in our

1097
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:49,639
movement code here do we ever specify

1098
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:53,830
some kind of upward motion if DZ is not

1099
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:53,829
equal to 0 DZ equals what

1100
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:11,409
hmm the entity so this looks like there

1101
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:18,909
was some jumping code in here it looks

1102
00:54:11,409 --> 00:54:22,139
like but oh my seriously you know what

1103
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:26,048
that is the fact that the space bar

1104
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:28,480
starts the game and causes the hero to

1105
00:54:26,048 --> 00:54:32,349
jump still is where that velocity is

1106
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,748
coming from because we didn't put any

1107
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:36,338
hysteresis on it so it will trigger that

1108
00:54:34,748 --> 00:54:38,858
it'll actually trigger the jump code

1109
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:44,619
that's what we're seeing that's

1110
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:51,639
hilarious so right now it's this this is

1111
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:53,369
the code that is the problem it's one

1112
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:56,139
initial jump that I'm doing essentially

1113
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:59,019
so like space far to start was like

1114
00:54:56,139 --> 00:55:04,328
being interpreted as a jump that's

1115
00:54:59,018 --> 00:55:10,238
hilarious all right well at least we

1116
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:11,559
know at least we know all right so I'm

1117
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:16,230
going to call it for now we're going to

1118
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:16,230
go to QA anyone has any questions hit me

1119
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:13,690
no queues going to be an early night

1120
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,119
Colonel dragon so how will this tell

1121
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:52,279
based movement work we still be able to

1122
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:57,320
move freely within a tile or will the

1123
00:56:52,280 --> 00:57:01,580
character actually snap to a tile to to

1124
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:06,590
be to be demonstrated later it is

1125
00:57:01,579 --> 00:57:08,840
actually neither of those things if you

1126
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:12,858
con when will we sort out the coordinate

1127
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:14,960
system uh probably like what I'd like to

1128
00:57:12,858 --> 00:57:17,900
do is I'd like to sort of clean up the

1129
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,480
sim path thing and then I'd like to

1130
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,820
clean up the storage which is when I

1131
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,010
assume the coordinate system stuff can

1132
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,010
get can get store sorted as well

1133
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:36,538
for godin is it possible to get access

1134
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:42,960
to the source code if I lost access to

1135
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:45,119
my old email account on not so there's

1136
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:49,519
two things that you can use for access

1137
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,519
one is the link that you got when you

1138
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:53,940
when you purchase originally and the

1139
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,760
other is your email address but if you

1140
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,889
have neither of those two things then

1141
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,829
there is no way for us to know if you're

1142
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:05,639
someone who purchased it so we can't

1143
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:07,798
actually determine whether right like we

1144
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:11,308
don't have any way of associating you

1145
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:13,619
with something else if you have like

1146
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:15,298
even a paypal reference number would

1147
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:17,309
probably be sufficient maybe for us to

1148
00:58:15,298 --> 00:58:21,630
dig it up but you need some piece of

1149
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:23,819
information that nobody else could Forge

1150
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:27,680
that proves that you're a person who

1151
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:27,679
purchased the thing if that makes sense

1152
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:35,729
so usually you're going to need either

1153
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:37,680
the link or the email but if you happen

1154
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:42,298
have something else like a paypal but

1155
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:45,750
proof of purchase kind of a thing that

1156
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:47,838
may be okay depending on what it has in

1157
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,838
it

1158
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:56,710
midlo how about stairwells dirt reversal

1159
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:58,780
used to be seamless as far as i remember

1160
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:00,670
now that the rooms are locked have will

1161
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:02,760
stairwells work what will happen is

1162
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,930
you'll move between them still and it'll

1163
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,970
run between them you but you can't

1164
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:09,159
change direction on the way down or up

1165
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:11,259
and that's very intentional actually

1166
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:13,389
because most of the time when you go

1167
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:17,380
down a thing you're you won't be able to

1168
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:20,559
get back up again like it's like you

1169
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:22,920
gotta commit so so that's actually by

1170
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,920
design

1171
00:59:33,518 --> 00:59:37,028
the I burley any plans on changing

1172
00:59:35,259 --> 00:59:38,739
vigils to do code instead of the full

1173
00:59:37,028 --> 00:59:41,498
IDE i believe the full debuggers

1174
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:48,548
included well two things 1 i'm not sure

1175
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:50,048
why we would but two I actually at least

1176
00:59:48,548 --> 00:59:54,338
on the Linux one that people were

1177
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:55,688
talking about it didn't have even close

1178
00:59:54,338 --> 00:59:57,009
to all the features like they didn't

1179
00:59:55,688 --> 00:59:59,828
show disassembly and stuff like that

1180
00:59:57,009 --> 01:00:01,119
apparently and so I don't if I don't

1181
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:05,739
know if there's like a Windows one

1182
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,088
that's better or something but someone

1183
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:08,588
would have to verify that it's like

1184
01:00:07,088 --> 01:00:13,989
better in some way otherwise i'm not

1185
01:00:08,588 --> 01:00:15,518
sure why we would long billion what are

1186
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:19,148
the benefits trade us in having each

1187
01:00:15,518 --> 01:00:21,038
tile be an entity so the reason that i

1188
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,659
want to every tile to be an entity was

1189
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:23,919
because i want you to be able to do

1190
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:28,509
anything to a tile that you could do to

1191
01:00:23,918 --> 01:00:31,778
anything else right like you know i

1192
01:00:28,509 --> 01:00:33,458
don't know how far we'll push it in

1193
01:00:31,778 --> 01:00:35,259
terms of when we're actually trying to

1194
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:37,509
like for lack of better term tune which

1195
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:39,429
is again not really my job description

1196
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:43,139
but when we're trying to make sure that

1197
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:46,239
the game is like playable and fun I

1198
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:48,249
don't know how much of it will use but

1199
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:50,679
obviously like let's say you have a

1200
01:00:48,248 --> 01:00:53,138
ground tile and there's the concept of

1201
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:54,999
some spell or something that causes

1202
01:00:53,139 --> 01:00:56,318
things to levitate or that makes

1203
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:59,348
something heavy or that turn something

1204
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:02,079
into water we just want everything to

1205
01:00:59,349 --> 01:01:04,209
work everywhere basically and so if you

1206
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,709
want this to happen the floor should be

1207
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:08,078
able to react to everything just the

1208
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:10,868
same way everything when else does so it

1209
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:13,809
should participate fully in every

1210
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:17,108
transaction that occurs if that makes

1211
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:19,749
sense so having them be entities that's

1212
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:21,998
a bonus and the other bonus is we can

1213
01:01:19,748 --> 01:01:24,818
create our levels out of non grid

1214
01:01:21,998 --> 01:01:26,618
patterns if we want to whereas if we

1215
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:31,148
force it to be a grid we could never do

1216
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:34,239
that so I'm just deciding to go that

1217
01:01:31,148 --> 01:01:35,498
route instead because I mean one of the

1218
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:40,478
things that's true as computers are very

1219
01:01:35,498 --> 01:01:42,188
powerful and so you know in a 2d game

1220
01:01:40,478 --> 01:01:44,138
sometimes it's a good idea to try and

1221
01:01:42,188 --> 01:01:46,178
use that horsepower to do interesting

1222
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:47,230
things because you're not using that

1223
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:49,809
horsepower to

1224
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:51,130
3d rendering fancy photorealistic stuff

1225
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:52,960
so you want to put that horsepower

1226
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:55,750
somewhere you don't just want the game

1227
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:59,230
to run at fifty thousand frames a second

1228
01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:01,300
and be boring right and so what I'm

1229
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:03,699
going to try and do is like focus a lot

1230
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:07,170
of that energy on entity simulation so

1231
01:02:03,699 --> 01:02:15,189
all of those cycles were not spending on

1232
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:16,450
3d calc stuff we put into the sim yeah

1233
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,519
so but as far as the trade-offs are

1234
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:20,889
concerned if we had made it in a grid we

1235
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:22,420
get to compress a lot of that down and

1236
01:02:20,889 --> 01:02:23,529
if they aren't entities because then we

1237
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,880
could just store the minimal amount of

1238
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,350
information we can store it in a 2d

1239
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,760
array and it's much more compact so

1240
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:29,920
we're not wasting as much memory

1241
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,840
bandwidth we're not wasting as much a

1242
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,289
testing time there's a lot of stuff that

1243
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:38,650
we can eliminate if we just assume that

1244
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:40,119
everything is always a grid so basically

1245
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:45,608
we're giving up a bunch of optimizations

1246
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:47,019
is what we're giving up Toby Peters are

1247
01:02:45,608 --> 01:02:49,750
you al kidding your image on the heap or

1248
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:54,789
stack heap right could you even allocate

1249
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:57,820
enough on the stack so part of the

1250
01:02:54,789 --> 01:03:00,159
problem with that question is that heap

1251
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:02,170
and stack like when you say on the stack

1252
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:04,059
you mean the stack for function calls

1253
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:05,530
and the answer is no we're not

1254
01:03:04,059 --> 01:03:08,440
allocating on the stack for functions

1255
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:09,670
called function calls but sure you could

1256
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,050
allocate them on the stack for function

1257
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:13,119
calls if you wanted to for some reason

1258
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:15,670
but you don't want entities to be

1259
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,019
tracked on the stack for function calls

1260
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,119
because their lifetime has nothing to do

1261
01:03:17,019 --> 01:03:22,840
with the stack for function calls if

1262
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:26,710
that makes sense right we don't allocate

1263
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:30,930
them on the heap in any real sense of

1264
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:33,699
the word because the heap is actually a

1265
01:03:30,929 --> 01:03:35,519
layer down from virtual Alec right

1266
01:03:33,699 --> 01:03:37,689
virtual Alec isn't really the heap

1267
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,579
because there actually is a thing that

1268
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:41,980
is the heap and they keep we aren't

1269
01:03:39,579 --> 01:03:43,539
using that's if we were calling keep a

1270
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:46,199
lock or something like that right so

1271
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:49,210
there actually is there's there's the vm

1272
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:52,059
there's a virtual memory system which

1273
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:53,470
you might call the heap then there's the

1274
01:03:52,059 --> 01:03:55,269
heap which is built on top of the ritual

1275
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:57,339
memory system we're not using that and

1276
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:58,358
then there's the stack which is also

1277
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,950
built on top of the virtual memory

1278
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:00,579
system and we are using that because we

1279
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:02,319
kind of have to

1280
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:06,730
see does it automatically in something

1281
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:07,990
we can do about that right so we're

1282
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:10,659
we're allocating stuff is we have

1283
01:04:07,989 --> 01:04:12,389
essentially our own stack that is not a

1284
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:15,369
function sack it's just a regular stack

1285
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:17,139
that we use in memory and wii virtual

1286
01:04:15,369 --> 01:04:19,210
alec a block of memory and we just

1287
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:21,960
allocate from that stack and that's what

1288
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,960
the entities are right now

1289
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:08,969
hey Mark Hughes

1290
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:55,010
BTN games says he asked q where is your

1291
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:55,010
Q BTN games

1292
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:01,800
do you foresee complications with the

1293
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:03,480
new greed entity flora system and the

1294
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,789
texture slats given that you want a

1295
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,010
variable height / traversal entity like

1296
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:11,099
I said before I knew to the texture

1297
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:12,420
splats so that's not how it's rendered

1298
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:16,460
anymore that's why i deleted the ground

1299
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,460
chunk that those were the grand chunks

1300
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:38,760
dude in basement handle RB ne1 r or l

1301
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:41,649
our confusion over Atomics who is

1302
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:54,309
written all are and what is this

1303
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:58,030
confusion over Atomics if modern CPUs

1304
01:06:54,309 --> 01:07:01,210
usually reorder or merge rights how do

1305
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:04,410
they use memory mapped registers can you

1306
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:10,000
even bit bang a serial protocol with it

1307
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:13,149
yet I mean the the important thing to

1308
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,980
remember is that the CPU is as strongly

1309
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:16,539
ordered as you need it to be because you

1310
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:19,539
could put in fencing and stuff like that

1311
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:21,159
so the complete answer to that question

1312
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:24,699
is it depends exactly what you're doing

1313
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:27,250
right first of all certain areas of

1314
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:29,618
memory like pages of memory are marked

1315
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:31,298
in specific ways so for example some

1316
01:07:29,619 --> 01:07:32,829
memory is right combining memory some

1317
01:07:31,298 --> 01:07:37,210
memory isn't right combining memory blah

1318
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:38,798
blah blah so most CPUs when they're that

1319
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:42,519
have a memory management Union that

1320
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:45,519
memory management unit knows information

1321
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:48,730
about pages that are mapped so it's not

1322
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:50,559
like the CPU behaves the same way when

1323
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:53,619
it's talking about a page that's mapped

1324
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:59,048
for hardware io versus a page that's

1325
01:07:53,619 --> 01:08:00,760
mapped for just use by the CPU right so

1326
01:07:59,048 --> 01:08:02,829
first of all the MMU will do different

1327
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:05,410
things depending on when it when it

1328
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:08,109
knows that it's a special kind of memory

1329
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:10,598
that's looking at and then the other

1330
01:08:08,108 --> 01:08:13,659
thing is the CPU obviously can be

1331
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:15,640
instructed to put barriers and fences in

1332
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:17,979
between things so that the reorder

1333
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:24,189
window will not reorder things above and

1334
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:26,019
below specific markers so you know you

1335
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:28,000
can put it in mm fence command or

1336
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:31,990
various things like this that will say

1337
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,229
you know this is not supposed to

1338
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:36,729
move any store commands above this you

1339
01:08:35,229 --> 01:08:40,809
know thing in the reorder buffer or

1340
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:44,219
anything below it so when you are are in

1341
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:46,450
a situation like an OS or driver writer

1342
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:52,630
past you know will find themselves in

1343
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:55,720
when dealing with the hardware you have

1344
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:59,380
to know your CPU you have to know your

1345
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:01,860
memory subsystem and you have to you

1346
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:09,010
know take into account all of it right

1347
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:10,559
and do it correctly in the old days

1348
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:13,750
obviously was really easy because

1349
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:18,160
old-school CPUs there was none of this

1350
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:22,359
there wasn't a cash you know so and

1351
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:25,199
there was no such thing it's like out of

1352
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:25,199
order execution

1353
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:34,489
long bullion what is the plan with

1354
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:35,809
rendering when the hero walks behind a

1355
01:09:34,488 --> 01:09:39,459
piece of terrain that is on a higher

1356
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:45,109
level and obscures the hero I don't know

1357
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:46,399
to be honest I'm not sure what I wanted

1358
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:48,940
you to render that I'm not sure how

1359
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:53,179
often that would ever actually happen

1360
01:09:48,939 --> 01:10:01,009
but I don't know I'm not sure how we

1361
01:09:53,179 --> 01:10:02,329
want to render that Jim's 0 will this

1362
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:05,000
system fix the collision areas getting

1363
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:06,909
stuck in each other if stacked example

1364
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,710
two heroes loading at the same position

1365
01:10:06,909 --> 01:10:11,750
when we do our final collision detection

1366
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:13,670
we will make sure that stuff works but

1367
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,619
right now i'm not actually i'm not

1368
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,960
actually trying to improve the collision

1369
01:10:15,619 --> 01:10:20,359
detector I'm just changing the game to

1370
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:24,380
work the way that the final design wants

1371
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:27,939
it to work it's not trying to improve

1372
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,940
the quality that makes sense

1373
01:10:48,408 --> 01:10:57,500
all right not much cues today so I guess

1374
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:57,500
that's good let's go ahead and shut down

1375
01:11:01,659 --> 01:11:04,819
alright thank you everyone for joining

1376
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:05,810
me for an episode of handmade hero it's

1377
01:11:04,819 --> 01:11:07,159
been a pleasure coding with you as

1378
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:08,690
always if you would like to follow along

1379
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:10,579
at home you can always go to the game on

1380
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:12,409
handmade here org the handy dandy

1381
01:11:10,579 --> 01:11:13,729
pre-order button and it comes with a

1382
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:17,809
source code so you can follow along with

1383
01:11:13,729 --> 01:11:19,489
with it at home we also a forum site you

1384
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:23,240
can go to which will be shutting down

1385
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:26,809
this weekend for two days while they

1386
01:11:23,239 --> 01:11:28,579
test it's going to move to a handmade

1387
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:31,039
network and they're going to be testing

1388
01:11:28,579 --> 01:11:34,880
it this weekend before bringing it back

1389
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:37,069
up again so yeah so go check out the

1390
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,319
forum site but be aware that sometime

1391
01:11:37,069 --> 01:11:41,719
friday night i'm guessing they'll be

1392
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:44,840
shutting it down and then it'll be back

1393
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:46,340
on monday for our stream we also a

1394
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,779
patreon page you want support the video

1395
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,829
series we have a tweet bought the tweets

1396
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:50,420
the schedule at you if you want to know

1397
01:11:48,829 --> 01:11:53,029
when the series is going to be live on

1398
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:56,319
stream and we also have this little

1399
01:11:53,029 --> 01:11:58,550
handy dandy button which you can use

1400
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:01,699
which tell you the next time it's going

1401
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:03,050
to be live of course in this case it is

1402
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:05,449
actually alive but it would give a

1403
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:08,570
little countdown camera normally that's

1404
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:10,189
about it until then until tomorrow which

1405
01:12:08,569 --> 01:12:12,439
I guess well you know what tomorrow's

1406
01:12:10,189 --> 01:12:14,869
Thursday so I won't be here so I'll be

1407
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:17,659
back here friday i'll be off tomorrow

1408
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:18,979
i'll be back here friday until then have

1409
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:22,720
fun programming and i will see you guys

1410
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:22,719
on the internet tickety's everyone
