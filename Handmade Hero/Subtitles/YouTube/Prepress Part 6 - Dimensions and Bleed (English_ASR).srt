1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
so now let's move on to talking about

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,699
the actual print process so how is this

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,500
stuff gonna work because once you

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:13,169
actually know what you're doing and you

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,849
have you know a way of producing good

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,138
quality CMYK you understand your flap

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,778
like you read flax you know how to pick

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:20,519
color textures you know all this stuff

9
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:23,278
there's still some minutiae that you

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,079
want to be aware of that it just saves

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,939
you time if you know this stuff up front

12
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,979
right there's mistakes or not even

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,778
mistakes really but just like things

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,340
that we could have just pre-planned for

15
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,320
that we just had no idea because until

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,859
you go through posture you don't know so

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,988
the first one already actually came up

18
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,750
in the chat when someone was trying to

19
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:43,738
estimate what the pad of the paper was

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,149
but basically let me walk you through

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:46,799
how this printing process is actually

22
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,390
going to work because then you can start

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,869
to see why there are these subtleties

24
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,170
involved in it so if you imagine you are

25
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:57,468
the printer what are you actually doing

26
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:01,829
well what you're gonna have to do is

27
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:07,109
you're going to have to make actual

28
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:10,049
physical plates right that have the

29
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:13,170
images on them for where the ink gets

30
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,259
deposited for cyan magenta yellow and

31
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,849
black right these are actual physical

32
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,069
things so we're gonna have to make

33
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,589
actual physical things for depositing

34
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,079
ink why do you have to do this well if

35
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,368
you use a process like an inkjet process

36
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,109
where you actually just have like a

37
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:29,759
moving like printhead or something like

38
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,500
that like the way that like a normal

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,019
printer works like a household printer

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,090
or an office printer there's no way

41
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,859
you're gonna get the volume up the time

42
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,478
it would take even a fast one of those

43
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:42,299
going back and forth to for it to forget

44
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:46,920
it right there's no way you're turning

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,560
out enough press material to print you

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,310
know ten thousand copies of some book

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,689
right at that rate so what they need to

48
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,118
be able to do is they need to be able to

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,489
do a process for a graphic novel that's

50
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,899
a lot like you know I mean a scaled-down

51
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,609
version of how you print like the New

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,468
York Times right you need those big

53
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,509
rolling drums that the paper just like

54
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:09,179
goes through and gets inked slap down on

55
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,378
it right now it doesn't have to be the

56
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,598
New York Times because you're not

57
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,419
printing millions of these things but

58
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,579
you need some

59
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:17,229
like that so they're gonna have to take

60
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,790
the files that you give them and they're

61
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,949
gonna have to make some physical

62
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:23,439
elements that will actually deposit that

63
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:25,000
ink down it's a lot of set-up cost and

64
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,889
they call these plates even though

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
they're not necessarily plate shaped

66
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:30,879
anymore because you know they might be

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,349
going for like a rolling thing but then

68
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,030
they're going to have to mount these

69
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,829
into a press and they're gonna have to

70
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,270
put paper through the press now in the

71
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,430
case of the New York Times it's actually

72
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,769
like a roll of paper like the paper is

73
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,840
like spooled off of giant rolls and it

74
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:46,180
rams through the machine in like this

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,530
one continuous process that's probably

76
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,879
not how a graphic novel is gonna be

77
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,669
printed because that's usually for

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,349
printing like SuperDuper high volume so

79
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,899
if it's a graphic novel it's probably

80
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,489
being printed on cut sheets but those

81
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,980
cut sheets are still going through

82
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,259
roughly the same process they're large

83
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:04,149
much larger than the book and they're

84
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:06,340
getting fed through some kind of an

85
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,769
element that's like stamping out inks

86
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,840
one at a time cyan first magenta yellow

87
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,620
black let's say or Panos what order they

88
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,700
go in at only your printer knows and

89
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,099
you're probably gonna do these on both

90
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,969
sides of the paper at the same time so

91
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,259
you don't feel like take it out the

92
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,840
other end and flip it over and then put

93
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:25,209
it through right so most modern presses

94
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,250
I think you know the typical one would

95
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,420
actually print on two sides at once so

96
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,500
we're gonna mount those two elements are

97
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:32,530
gonna feed through a sheet and that

98
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,229
sheet is gonna want to contain more than

99
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,030
one page because it's huge right you

100
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:41,530
don't want to pick like put like one

101
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:44,379
little piece on there right so your

102
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:48,310
printer is gonna have to lay out all of

103
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:50,500
these pages onto a larger page so

104
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,590
they're gonna put like 16 pages at a

105
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,150
time tiled across like a page they're

106
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,099
gonna feed that through the press and

107
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,609
when they get all the pages out on the

108
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:01,719
other end they're gonna cut them right

109
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,790
so this is where we get into some

110
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,949
pre-press concerns that we didn't talk

111
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:08,169
about that are relevant to this fact

112
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,729
that okay now that we're not just

113
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,229
talking about just how the in-center

114
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,689
come out we as they're talking about

115
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:18,099
like the shape and size of a page

116
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:22,389
because it matters okay so the first

117
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:25,000
thing is because the printer has to fit

118
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:26,709
multiple pages onto a single sheet that

119
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,228
runs through the press

120
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:32,138
and then they have to cut it apart to

121
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:35,409
bind it into an actual book it means

122
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:39,389
that you have to prepare for having some

123
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:42,580
bleed around the edge of the actual

124
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:45,310
artwork right so what does this mean

125
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:48,848
well if we take a look for example at

126
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,439
one of the in fact I actually happen to

127
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,418
accidentally pick one right here so I

128
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:56,439
don't actually have to go to the book

129
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:58,089
for this but suppose we bring up this

130
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,819
particular plate that we talked about

131
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:05,579
before and we look at what the actual

132
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:09,759
graphic looks like for this page okay

133
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:12,459
this image extends all the way to the

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,270
edge down here it doesn't really matter

135
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:20,138
because it's just some flat black

136
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:23,109
throughout right but up here well not

137
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:26,860
really like it kind of all just goes all

138
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,430
the way out to the end so what's gonna

139
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,129
happen when this page gets printed onto

140
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,759
a giant sheet with lots of other pages

141
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:39,819
and then it has to get cut is some

142
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,129
amount of variation just like the inks

143
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:45,339
can't be perfectly lined up there's

144
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:47,680
gonna be some minor little amount of

145
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,060
variability potentially and again

146
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,509
depending how good the press is it could

147
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:56,199
be more or less accurate in how

148
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:59,800
razor-sharp that cut is right so they're

149
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,620
never gonna put two pages right next to

150
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,870
each other there's got to be a gap in

151
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,879
between the two and that gap is

152
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,530
generally called the bleed it's called

153
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,889
the the you know the bleed or the

154
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:14,379
cropping region and so when you actually

155
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,819
make an image like this and we knew this

156
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,348
ahead of time because we have had some

157
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,689
experience so when we started making

158
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:21,430
miaow the infinite way back when Anna

159
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:24,848
first before she even drew the first one

160
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:28,000
we knew there had to be some bleed we

161
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:30,310
artificially patted all of the frames

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,279
with an eighth of an inch around the

163
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,620
entire outside knowing that that way

164
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,329
there is plenty of room for cropping it

165
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,350
without ruining it

166
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:43,019
right so our page size that we tailed

167
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,110
printer is actually smaller than this

168
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,180
page size and it gets cropped out so

169
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,759
when this actually appears printed it

170
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,139
will be a 1/8 of an inch shrunk all the

171
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,509
way around because that's the actual

172
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,189
page size but we added that bleed so

173
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,379
that when the printer is printing it and

174
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:00,149
then they have to cut it it doesn't

175
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,069
matter how accurate they are it will be

176
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,569
a good-looking page either way there

177
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:07,019
won't be like a little bit of a like

178
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:09,209
replication distortion or garbage there

179
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,009
right because normally what a printer

180
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:13,109
will do if you hand them stuff that

181
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,149
doesn't have a crop region is they'll

182
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,189
just have to like duplicate what the

183
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,589
pixels are on the edge and then you'll

184
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:21,629
get a little bit of a bend in that line

185
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,669
right because as it gets duplicated out

186
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:25,439
instead of it continuing right

187
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,939
everything should continue but instead

188
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,610
it would just get duplicated you don't

189
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,230
I'm saying so that's a pre-press concern

190
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,600
that you probably want to plan for

191
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,680
having a 1/8 border or something like

192
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,470
that one eighth of an inch border all

193
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,660
the way around and again that's just

194
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,370
there so the printer has enough to work

195
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,020
with and then when they do their layout

196
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,850
they know how much tolerance they need

197
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,379
it might not be an eighth of an inch so

198
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,840
they may only need a sixteenth of an

199
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,699
inch or 1/32 of an inch who knows but at

200
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,009
least they now have as much as they need

201
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,750
and they can pick the size they actually

202
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,939
want to print and then they'll cut it

203
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,529
down to the correct size knowing that

204
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,879
even if they're off a little bit it

205
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,459
doesn't matter they're gonna get a

206
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,259
great-looking page out of it so that's

207
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:06,810
the first thing that you can kind of

208
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,699
into it from that printing process the

209
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,730
fact that the pages aren't actually

210
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,979
going through as like individual little

211
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,900
sheets that match the book size they're

212
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,080
actually all printed on very large

213
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,750
sheets that then get cut down okay so

214
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,870
the second implication that that has for

215
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,810
not so much a pre-press process as much

216
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,579
as just your decision making process is

217
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,740
here's where you can reason about the

218
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:33,059
age-old question that nobody seems to

219
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,830
have an answer for and there's a reason

220
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,779
for this as you'll see in a second which

221
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,960
is how big should the page be what

222
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,968
should the page size be right and there

223
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,030
is no answer to this question and let me

224
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,560
sort of give some elaboration as to why

225
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:49,139
the first reason that there's no answer

226
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:52,588
to how big the pages should be in a

227
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,278
graphic novel is because look we're

228
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,199
printing it on a giant sheet of paper

229
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:57,909
it doesn't matter what size you pick

230
00:08:56,198 --> 00:09:00,068
because no matter what size you pick

231
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:02,318
it's not gonna be that big nobody could

232
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:03,669
read a graphic novel so unless you're

233
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:05,139
doing like an art installation piece

234
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,360
you're never gonna print a graphic novel

235
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:09,310
page that's going to be as big as one of

236
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
the actual source sheets of paper so no

237
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:12,638
matter what size you pick they're gonna

238
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,649
be able to put it on that page and print

239
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,769
it cut it and bind it so you can pick

240
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,839
whatever size you want right so that's

241
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,519
one fairly reassuring answer there's

242
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,629
really no way to completely screw up

243
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:29,169
picking the size but that said there are

244
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:32,230
some concerns if you want to really

245
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:35,860
minimize the total cost of printing and

246
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,680
you're like a super duper optimization

247
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,839
head it's possible that you might

248
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,179
actually want to think about the effects

249
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,509
that the paper size sorry the page size

250
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:49,688
versus the paper size has on your actual

251
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,879
costs and here they are the larger a

252
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:54,969
page is the more ink it takes to print

253
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:58,209
period because the same image on a wider

254
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,079
page takes more ink right there's just

255
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:06,399
more coverage so that drives up your per

256
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:08,708
book cost if there is wasted space

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,278
on the page so when you're tiling these

258
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:14,708
images to fit onto one sheet of paper if

259
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,389
there's wasted space there because you

260
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,859
can't fit another much of another page

261
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,980
there's like half a whole page missing

262
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,350
on this side or something that drives up

263
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,199
your paper cost right so your per unit

264
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,680
cost goes up so you want to try and pick

265
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:35,318
a size that will nicely tile perfectly

266
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:37,088
or close to perfectly one sheet but will

267
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:42,159
not have pages that are overly large

268
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,829
they don't use too much ink right if

269
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,719
only it were that simple

270
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:49,808
after that you're not thinking to

271
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,639
account that when you actually cut and

272
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:55,149
bind all these books they're gonna go

273
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,188
into pallets and boxes those boxes may

274
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:59,678
be specific sizes and if you can only

275
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:01,389
fit certain numbers of books in a box

276
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:02,948
that may change your storage and

277
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,079
shipping costs and if there's

278
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:07,269
warehousing involved that warehouse may

279
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:07,689
have size constraints that would affect

280
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:10,720
your page

281
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,120
this size decision right so if you

282
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,440
really really really want to get down

283
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,700
the nitty-gritty those are all the

284
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,250
parameters that you might need to be

285
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,850
thinking about right so it's a little

286
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,950
bit complicated we just were like all

287
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,450
right we're gonna pick a size we like we

288
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,850
know we can't go to wrong with something

289
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,350
that's in like the six inch by nine inch

290
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,659
range so we're gonna be like roughly

291
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,330
around there and we just kind of looked

292
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:36,730
at graphic novels we liked and you know

293
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:40,480
went with one that we thought would feel

294
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:44,080
good that's how we did it but you can

295
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,600
get more hardcore on that if you want to

296
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,520
you could go nuts also if you plan on

297
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,960
working with a publisher that publisher

298
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,079
may have standard sizes that they

299
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,060
already prefer for their logistics

300
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,400
supply chain so you could always ask

301
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:59,289
them but most people who are starting a

302
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,149
comic don't have a publisher so it

303
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:03,219
really doesn't help you because no two

304
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,189
publishers necessarily have the exact

305
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,930
same thing in mind for how they want

306
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:16,720
their whole process to work right so

307
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:21,819
it's tricky that's all I can say so that

308
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,310
print process does have one relatively

309
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,610
hard constraint on how you layout your

310
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:30,459
book and that is the number of pages in

311
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:34,629
the book can't really be arbitrary I

312
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:36,400
mean it can but you will incur all kinds

313
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,470
of additional costs from your printer if

314
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,840
you truly want the number of pages in

315
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:46,210
your book to be arbitrary as a simple

316
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:50,950
example if meow the infinite were 208

317
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:54,580
pages it would be $80 cheaper than if it

318
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:57,240
were 200 pages and that's just literally

319
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,310
the actual pricing from our printer

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:04,299
Sullivans say that again if meow the

321
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:07,959
infinite were 208 pages long it would be

322
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:10,079
$80 cheaper to print than if it were 200

323
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,250
pages long

324
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,639
why is this

325
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:19,330
well the reason is because the printers

326
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:21,610
print process has a number of actual

327
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,910
physical steps involved that work in

328
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,879
specific multiples and if you were

329
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:31,240
trying to do something that breaks those

330
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:34,330
multiples it may end up costing you more

331
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,779
even though you're doing less so in this

332
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:40,810
case our printer is set up to print on

333
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,679
16 s for our page size and our paper

334
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:44,079
stock and all those things

335
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,359
I don't inquire too deeply about their

336
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,660
processes so I don't actually know

337
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,310
exactly when the 16 rule applies it may

338
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,049
only apply to certain types of bindings

339
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:58,239
certain types of paper stock who knows

340
00:13:53,049 --> 00:14:00,759
right or certain tilings of that page in

341
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,919
order to do a print process that wasn't

342
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,350
a multiple of 16 you needed to add a

343
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:07,449
special step in the process that just

344
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,920
cost more money so you would never

345
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,200
really do it unless you literally

346
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:18,069
couldn't think of anything to do with

347
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:20,650
those eight extra pages so again be

348
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,300
aware this is a physical process there

349
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:25,299
are physical limitations of the process

350
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:27,699
there are physical labor costs there are

351
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:30,669
specific material costs and there are

352
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,790
certain machinings that will all imply

353
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:37,569
constraints on the process in so much as

354
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:40,269
you can find a printer to work with and

355
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,810
ask them all these questions as often

356
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:45,850
and as early as you can because the more

357
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:48,849
information you have about the actual

358
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,950
print process you will be using the more

359
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,970
you can do to make sure your book

360
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:57,460
doesn't hit any bad cost elements that

361
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,899
you know you wish you wouldn't have to

362
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,900
pay right
