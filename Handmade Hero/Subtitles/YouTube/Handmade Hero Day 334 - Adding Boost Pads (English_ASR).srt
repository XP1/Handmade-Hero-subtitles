00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,799
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,570
hero the show we could a complete game

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:15,838
live on stream we yesterday came to a

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,510
sort of unfortunate realization about

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,230
how you know the game might function

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,570
graphically I had been hoping to

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,149
preserve a certain visual effect that I

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,429
liked and it requires quite a bit of

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:32,009
work to do so but we did that work but

10
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:33,988
unfortunately i don't really know of a

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,530
solution to one particular artifact that

12
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,549
it has it does seem a little bit like a

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,020
showstopper to me and so today i was

14
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,828
just going to talk about that a little

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,859
bit and verify that we can't really work

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,299
around it or not unless or come up with

17
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,378
some idea about how we are going to work

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,569
around it and yeah so that's where we're

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,320
at i'm just going to briefly demonstrate

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,820
what the problem is today is day 3 34 so

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,759
i am doing this demonstration with day

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,170
333 s code so if you want to follow

23
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:08,188
along at home that's the code to be

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,769
working with so yeah if i go ahead and

25
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:14,279
compile the current version of the code

26
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:17,399
base and then I you know boot it up you

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,650
can see when I run here uh that I've

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,659
kind of got a little bit of a stair step

29
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,270
pattern that i created here and much

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,520
like we said that we wanted to do before

31
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:29,129
i've made it so that now they're

32
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,489
completely orthographic so they don't do

33
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:34,109
any prospective transforms there right

34
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:37,908
but then what happens when I kind of go

35
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:40,859
up I still have this nice a sort of

36
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,109
upper floor kind of fade in effect that

37
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:47,728
I really kind of liked and I thought it

38
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:50,399
was nice but we then come to this sort

39
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:53,280
of unfortunate situation where what

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,769
happens now when the player wants to

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,590
transition up to this you know next

42
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,390
floor or whatever and so we just kind of

43
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,070
have this bad discontinuity where the

44
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,930
player will just kind of pop up there

45
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:08,098
and it doesn't look particularly good

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,219
right so I don't really know what the

47
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,679
solution to this problem is i I'm not

48
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:17,780
really sure

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,640
are some obvious issues with it and I

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,378
think they're worse than they would be

51
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,328
if only the hero could transition

52
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:26,179
between floors I would like to make it

53
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:28,790
so that other characters who wish to can

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,670
transition between floors for example

55
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:33,408
these little snake things or whatever

56
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:34,818
you know if they want to go down the

57
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:37,789
stairs I want to make sure that they are

58
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:45,828
able to go down the stairs as necessary

59
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:48,469
and and so on and so forth because as

60
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:50,060
you know over time at when we start to

61
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,430
build sort of the gameplay part of the

62
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,280
game you know I want to be able to have

63
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:59,239
characters but you know NPCs who are

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,340
sort of smarter the smarter NPCs let's

65
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,259
say who can kind of navigate around the

66
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,030
world a little more freely potentially

67
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:07,039
than just some of the stupid ones you

68
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:10,158
know maybe some of the stupid creatures

69
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:13,938
they just stay in one particular room

70
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:16,218
and don't really do much else but you

71
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:17,810
know some of the smarter and PCs would

72
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:20,598
want to be able to do you know that kind

73
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,030
of moving around sort of thing so I

74
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:25,578
guess what I would say here is I don't

75
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,128
really know how to solve this problem we

76
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:31,609
tried a couple things it seems to me

77
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:33,620
like there's a couple issues so I'm

78
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,530
gonna say what the prime that the most

79
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,129
severe what I think is that if you look

80
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,949
at what happens here it's really hard to

81
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:46,280
even tell where those stairs really even

82
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:48,769
are right because one of the nice things

83
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,109
about when they used to be in actual

84
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,539
perspective is that you could sort of

85
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:56,840
tell how they connected neatly to the

86
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:59,030
floor above them but now in the

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,408
circumstance that we see here you can

88
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,688
kind of see that like I don't really

89
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:04,878
even know where that floor is really

90
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,128
because it's in this like separate

91
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,459
coordinate system that doesn't sort of

92
00:04:07,128 --> 00:04:13,399
work seamlessly compared to my other one

93
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,259
right so I really don't even know where

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,840
I am relative to it like if you look at

95
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:20,750
where it actually is it's roughly like I

96
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,418
don't know like on this level right it's

97
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,569
like here that's where it is right you

98
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:28,490
can see if I hop I'm hopping on this row

99
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:32,000
and that just doesn't look like

100
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,430
intuitive at all so we fundamentally

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,100
have this problem I think we're the

102
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,379
orthographic nature of how things are

103
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,160
displaced in that way just doesn't

104
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:46,100
actually work if you start to have a

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:59,990
real perspective transform on above

106
00:04:46,100 --> 00:05:04,100
floors so not great uh I I don't I don't

107
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:07,699
love it uh so that's a big problem now I

108
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,490
guess what I don't know is if I were to

109
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:18,860
allow these things to scale you know

110
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:19,970
would that help enough right oh and I

111
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,580
don't know that that would help enough

112
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,590
either so there's a lot of stuff that I

113
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:28,849
just I don't know that I really don't

114
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:30,619
see a lot of potential here and so it

115
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:35,750
kind of is frustrating to me because I

116
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,490
like this effect and you know it we did

117
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,939
the work to make sure that it that it

118
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,920
would happen but I just don't see a lot

119
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:46,750
of ways that we can keep movement

120
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:54,170
between floors working if that's the way

121
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:57,500
if that's the situation I just don't see

122
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,629
it now I mean one thing that is true is

123
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,550
I suppose what we could do is say well

124
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,519
maybe you can't really transition

125
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,680
between floors in that way you know one

126
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:08,180
thing i could do is say all right so you

127
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,129
know maybe I don't really care about

128
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,800
stairwells anyway like who cares about

129
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:15,889
stairs I just need ways of getting from

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,670
one floor to another floor quickly and

131
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:22,189
maybe that works better I don't know it

132
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:25,160
certainly seems like something that

133
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,930
could be okay and in that case we would

134
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,660
have a situation where there'd be sort

135
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,540
of more of a like a like a you know

136
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,890
thing you jump on it bounces you up and

137
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,330
then another thing that you could jump

138
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,899
where you could jump down or something

139
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,899
like this right

140
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,959
so it'd kind of be more like a jumping

141
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:49,288
area uh and that seems reasonable

142
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,089
because then along only on that jump

143
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:53,128
would we do sort of the transition

144
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,859
between the two levels we could still

145
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:58,560
keep that sort of animated fade and fade

146
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,680
out you know uh and so you know in

147
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:12,598
theory I could see that being somewhat

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:16,288
useful I'm just not sure you know I

149
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:18,180
think that I think maybe that is is

150
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:20,339
perhaps the best way to go because

151
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,699
here's the thing let me just say say

152
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,468
something sort of game design even

153
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,150
though like I'm not a game designer and

154
00:07:25,468 --> 00:07:29,819
I try to keep the game design talk to a

155
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,709
minimum I guess what I would say is I I

156
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:35,069
didn't really like the idea of the

157
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:36,388
stairwells in terms of the gameplay

158
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,749
implications that I felt that they had

159
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,460
either and the reason for that is simply

160
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:43,830
that what happens when you're standing

161
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,508
on the stairwell you know you're kind of

162
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:47,699
standing on this in-between point

163
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,740
between two screens and it's like oh you

164
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,728
know does it become this game about like

165
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,348
I want to try and get up on the

166
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,269
stairwell and sort of hit people from

167
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:57,269
the stairwell because then it's easier

168
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,740
for me to avoid people up here or you

169
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:00,628
know is the stairwell become some kind

170
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,370
of weird like place that you know

171
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:04,080
monsters get stuck in or whatever you

172
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,439
know like it's just kind of this weird

173
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,508
thing that that gameplay-wise I didn't

174
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,729
have any real reason for there to be a

175
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,199
stairwell it's just this thing that's

176
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:14,968
like well in the real world we have

177
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,550
stairs so you know there's stairs or

178
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:24,120
something right so I would say that I do

179
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,949
fancy the idea of saying okay maybe

180
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,050
there's no stairwells instead we just

181
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,838
have a thing that you hop on and when

182
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,190
you hop on it it teleports you kind of I

183
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:34,440
mean and you don't really teleport will

184
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,300
draw you animating to it but you don't

185
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,690
control your emotion between those two

186
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,429
you know I just hop on it and it's like

187
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,740
you know like a bounce pad it bounces me

188
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,088
up to a higher level or I can jump on

189
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,860
one at the higher level that has a

190
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,230
bounce pad down and it'll just bounce me

191
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,450
down right so they're kind of like

192
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,850
instant shoots sort of thing

193
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,940
and that's much nicer because then the

194
00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,240
player is never spending any time

195
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,310
actually like hanging out in between two

196
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,769
levels because the gameplay doesn't

197
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:08,579
really support that like the gameplay it

198
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:10,049
doesn't really have any real concept of

199
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,610
what that would mean or why you would be

200
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,129
doing that or why it's interesting and

201
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,810
so just saying you're either in one room

202
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:17,669
or another in terms of gameplay is

203
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:20,099
actually what I would prefer anyway and

204
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:21,839
so maybe what I can do to say there are

205
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:27,210
there is no connective tissue between

206
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:29,370
two levels vertically there is only sort

207
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,550
of a connector pad that can go in either

208
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,139
direction and maybe the pads are

209
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,219
generally unidirectional so there's a

210
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,600
path that goes up but a path that goes

211
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,550
down if you can go both directions then

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,170
both pads exist but a lot of times you

213
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:42,000
can only go down or only go up for

214
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:44,990
example because that is another thing

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,730
that I want you know in keeping with the

216
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:52,169
concept of say being like Legend of

217
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,490
Zelda are binding of isaac or these

218
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:55,199
sorts of games which are kind of like i

219
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,180
said kind of the direction that we

220
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,390
wanted the game to sort of go in roughly

221
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:02,189
in terms of its structural components

222
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:05,879
for example binding of isaac only allows

223
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:09,450
you to go down right you you more or

224
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:12,120
less cannot return to a higher floor

225
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,370
once you have gone down to a lower floor

226
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,350
and there's a number of reasons why that

227
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,929
is a good mechanic to have and there's

228
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,330
certainly plenty of places in handmade

229
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:23,189
hero in terms of the design where I

230
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,670
wanted that to be true where you you can

231
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,840
only go downward and it's not really a

232
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:30,029
biting about the kind of thing in that

233
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,230
you can never get back up again but it

234
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,059
is the case that generally you're

235
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,430
supposed to proceed downwards in certain

236
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,839
segments and it will only be once you

237
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:38,159
kind of get to the bottom that you will

238
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:46,320
ever be able to return back to the top

239
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:48,809
again so in that way I think if this

240
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,090
makes a lot of sense so I think perhaps

241
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:54,839
the answer this problem is just to say

242
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:57,480
all right there just there isn't the

243
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,690
notion of a stairwell you know that's

244
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,149
not a thing there's just the notion of a

245
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,290
teleporter and pad or it's not really

246
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,039
teleporter i guess but just a little

247
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:10,049
convex

248
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:17,099
pad or whatever and that pad does that

249
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:19,409
that particular motion right that seems

250
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,269
pretty good and then I think everything

251
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,519
just works because the only problem

252
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:25,589
right now is the stairwell so all we

253
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,289
need to do is is when you're on that

254
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:31,860
sort of transition between the two we

255
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:34,679
would just have the whoever is moving

256
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,778
along the pad just do sort of whatever

257
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:42,508
it is whatever that linear interpolation

258
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:50,519
is between the floor zzzz and now would

259
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:53,959
do that so I'm relatively happy with

260
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,778
that you know I think that's fine I

261
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:59,789
think that's totally fine so maybe we'll

262
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,350
try that today maybe i'll see if i could

263
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:03,299
implement something like that just to

264
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,490
verify that that's okay because i think

265
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,019
that's really it for RZ i don't think i

266
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,089
have anything else i really want to do

267
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,709
with z because now we've pretty much got

268
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:17,910
everything that we want we've got the

269
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:19,768
you know alpha fading we've got we've

270
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:21,389
got sort of multiple floors stacked on

271
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:23,490
top of each other so we're pretty much

272
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,709
full easy capable now everything is very

273
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,899
smooth so I like everything other than

274
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:31,018
the effect of that stairwell and so let

275
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,240
me see maybe we'll just try and see what

276
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:36,328
happens if I try putting in some of

277
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,539
those pads as we spoke about and then

278
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:41,879
we'll kind of go from there so that that

279
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,399
that seems like a pretty good idea to me

280
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,409
and while you know while the entities

281
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,818
are hopping around if they hop on one of

282
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:50,399
those pads it'll spring them up to the

283
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:52,438
next level or if we hop on down pat it

284
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,509
will spring them down to another level

285
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:57,269
right and the way that I could do that

286
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:59,909
is just we have that notion of those

287
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:03,089
sort of traversable s'right I could just

288
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:05,338
tag one of those one of the operations

289
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,439
that are traversable could have on it is

290
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,689
that it could you know basically be a

291
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:10,948
teleport to another traversable so that

292
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,889
when you hop on it you sort of

293
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:18,609
automatically end up going on this this

294
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:20,379
traversable all right so let's try that

295
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,450
uh we don't have a lot of time left

296
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:27,009
because I've been blabbering blabbering

297
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:33,509
and whatever you want to call that and

298
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:36,850
I'm out of tea and that's no good at all

299
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:41,200
so who knows how far we'll get but let's

300
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:43,990
give it a shot okay so first things

301
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,540
first imma pull the concept of the apron

302
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,659
stuff out of here because I don't

303
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:52,569
actually want it now we had this next

304
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:55,299
floor z piece of information I'm going

305
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:58,629
to get rid of it I don't want it it

306
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:02,349
needs to go away so there it goes and

307
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:05,078
now it's gone I'm going to go back here

308
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,899
and take a look at this situation and

309
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:10,028
say that it's going to be going to and

310
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,820
so I think all we're gonna do is just

311
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:17,409
pass that floor Z and be done with it

312
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,940
that's all that's all there is okay so

313
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:21,578
that's nothing you know we're still

314
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,430
exactly the same no no change their

315
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:25,778
basic exactly what it was before so then

316
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:29,679
I'm going to go and I'm going to take a

317
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:31,299
look at those traversable and I'm going

318
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,629
to take a look at what we have as far as

319
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,458
traversable here so we have these entity

320
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,379
traversable point things and you can see

321
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:42,518
that we've got like a v3 P and we've got

322
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:46,208
an empty that's an occupier right so on

323
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,879
one of these traversable points if

324
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,559
someone lands on it then now we sort of

325
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,139
have this idea that something might

326
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,479
happen here right and so you can imagine

327
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,679
if this was sort of a teleporter or some

328
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,778
you know if this was one of those sort

329
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,849
of teleporter things then what we want

330
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:02,230
to do is have a way of this thing to

331
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,570
sort of say hey there's another

332
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:08,079
traversable that you're kind of kind of

333
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,360
go to if you're you know if you're one

334
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,219
of these things right and so there's

335
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:18,820
something in here that's going to be you

336
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:20,528
know like let's say that we've got

337
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:27,480
another traversal reference and that

338
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:27,480
reversible reference is you know

339
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:33,549
propel I don't I'm uncomfortable using

340
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,190
the word teleport because I feel like

341
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:37,059
teleport means that I'd like

342
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,649
instantaneously move you to something

343
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,169
like there wouldn't be an animation

344
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,458
between the two but in this case I'm not

345
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:44,769
really talking about that I'm talking

346
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:47,559
about moving you smoothly between the

347
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:52,089
two so it's not really teleport it's

348
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:54,159
more like a you know boost to it's like

349
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,439
I'm going to give you a sort of a boost

350
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,179
to it I'm going to argue over to it I

351
00:15:56,438 --> 00:16:01,958
don't know exactly what the right word

352
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:03,698
for that is I'm guess I'm going to say

353
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:05,018
like Auto booster to because I have no

354
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:07,740
other idea what it should be called so

355
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:11,078
I'm just going to call it that for now

356
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,209
so that auto booth to is going to be the

357
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:15,969
thing that you're going to go to when

358
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:18,188
you land on one of these guys and so I

359
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:24,579
just going to sort of start by making

360
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:29,528
that be something that we set so inside

361
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:32,620
a handmade world mode when we add a

362
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:36,000
standard room here we've got sort of

363
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:38,409
this this notion that at the end of it

364
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,028
you know we sort of had these stairs and

365
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:43,059
that sort of stuff I'm going to sort of

366
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:45,009
nuke that temporarily so i'm going to

367
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:48,609
say let's let's say that we don't have

368
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:50,259
any of that sort of stuff and we're

369
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,829
going to need is some way of sort of

370
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:55,600
having these these like pads make make a

371
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:57,219
little bit more sense we're going to

372
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,699
have to have some way that they could be

373
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,079
sort of placed in an intelligent fashion

374
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:04,119
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

375
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,428
say that when we when we do ad stated

376
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:09,849
room I'm going to say that there's maybe

377
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:11,829
like the notion of like a where the hole

378
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,869
is you know is the hole on the left side

379
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:17,408
or is the hole on the right side so that

380
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:20,139
different rooms can have holes where you

381
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:21,449
can go down a hole and there isn't the

382
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,860
whole isn't always in the same place

383
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:29,620
right so I'm going to have like a you

384
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:32,889
know left hole right hole or something

385
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:35,319
like that and so then if we try to come

386
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:39,700
down here what i could do is say like

387
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:42,369
okay I we've got hold down to the floor

388
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:44,650
below and so this thing would

389
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:46,239
say like okay if you wanted a left hole

390
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,580
and you're in the left whole area then

391
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,609
there's a hole down to the floor below

392
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:53,649
otherwise if you come through in here

393
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:58,299
then you sort of have a thing that's

394
00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:00,220
like well we don't want the stairs

395
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,599
nonsense so we're going to kind of pick

396
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,529
put this and we're going to move it down

397
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:08,109
here and say get rid of all of that and

398
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:10,599
say okay if we're in sort of the place

399
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:13,000
where we would have had that this other

400
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:19,269
hole as well then we're going to go

401
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:24,160
ahead and take hidden that little

402
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:29,139
cleaner that area that used to have the

403
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,880
whole and use that directly I don't know

404
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,179
what we don't care about this anymore so

405
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:41,290
I feel like I'm just going to do that as

406
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:43,509
well and so now when we add a standard

407
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:45,970
room what we could do is I believe these

408
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:48,579
things are always kind of stacked on top

409
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:53,140
of each other right now so let's just

410
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:54,220
say that they stack multiple times and

411
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,980
then what I'm going to do is say okay

412
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,670
when I add the standard room I'm going

413
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:05,380
to say if the screen index you know mod

414
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:08,200
2 gets a left hole and if the screen

415
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:12,490
index and I guess I could say left full

416
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:15,580
equal screen index mod 2 and right hole

417
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,170
equals not left hole so basically every

418
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:20,490
other one it'll alternate like left

419
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:30,250
right left right left right left right

420
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm saying so in theory well I guess in

421
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,750
theory what we actually have is some

422
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,970
kind of a

423
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,970
a problem with the fact that I added

424
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:52,679
oh I accidentally placed someone on

425
00:19:50,190 --> 00:20:01,650
something that doesn't exist it looks

426
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:05,850
like well why did I do that let me take

427
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:08,280
a look here I probably inverted when I

428
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:09,359
did the ads gender we should probably we

429
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:11,160
gotta hurry up and get to world

430
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:16,189
generation stuff so I can stop slumming

431
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:19,200
it with these weird kind of crazy tools

432
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:21,779
yeah so I had this backwards so this is

433
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,880
if we want the whole right that's if we

434
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:30,649
want the whole so we're we're doing this

435
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:36,210
this is what we actually wanted to do

436
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:44,780
you go so let's go ahead and run and so

437
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:49,440
here is like that whole and I can't

438
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:54,690
unfortunately I'm unable to Oh does that

439
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,549
still work it did yeah it doesn't I'm

440
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,110
think so I was going to say we used to

441
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:59,579
have a thing where we could add heroes

442
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:00,750
by pressing the spacebar and I was like

443
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:03,990
I didn't think that's the work done it

444
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:06,539
doesn't anyway what I was going to say

445
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,700
is yes so we've got these these holes it

446
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:10,829
and so now what I want to do is I want

447
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,350
to add those little pads so that they

448
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:15,299
can kind of do the you know the hopping

449
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:21,539
back and forth so what I'm going to do

450
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:24,210
is when i add a standard room i'm going

451
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:26,009
to take the standard rooms and make sure

452
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,630
that i remember the previous standard

453
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:30,029
room so i can just connect them right

454
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:33,930
pretty basic so into a standard room you

455
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:43,379
know a pre room or something like this

456
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:46,460
and actually i guess uh I guess I can

457
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,460
just do that down here

458
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:56,450
so now I'll know what the previous room

459
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:58,879
was and so I should be able to connect

460
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,499
these up right you can kind of see us

461
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:03,378
going through here and adding things

462
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:06,769
like trees and whatever and we do those

463
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:09,408
sorts of things by using the indexes

464
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:12,229
like you can see here we can we can use

465
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:15,139
the dot ground part of things to figure

466
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:17,179
out like what the traversable references

467
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:22,459
that we're talking about in any

468
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:23,989
particular circumstance here right so if

469
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,210
I have a particular traversable

470
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:30,139
reference that I want to be able to

471
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:34,840
modify in that way I need to be able to

472
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:37,908
say that that thing whatever it is I

473
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:40,878
need to be able to tag whatever that

474
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:43,940
thing is by saying that it sort of has

475
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:45,558
this back pointer right and I think part

476
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,889
of the this is this is kind of a little

477
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:50,450
bit of a this is kind of a little bit of

478
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:52,189
a problem for us because we don't really

479
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,048
have any of the Royal gem stuff in here

480
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,320
we don't really have a good way of

481
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:58,638
actually connecting these things up the

482
00:22:57,319 --> 00:23:02,720
reason for that is because it's already

483
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:08,538
kind of impact it you know into it's

484
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:11,358
already been sort of packed down into

485
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:12,950
its permanent storage form and we don't

486
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:18,220
really have a way of reaching back in

487
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,720
there to sort of take it back out right

488
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,058
so we kind of have the situation where

489
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,429
we want to sort of leave you know you

490
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:28,598
can let me let me explain it a little

491
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:30,979
more detail what I'm talking about here

492
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:32,569
and maybe this is circumstance where we

493
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:35,058
have to start building some actual world

494
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:36,288
building tools first before we can

495
00:23:35,058 --> 00:23:38,569
really test this out in any particular

496
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:40,908
way but I feel that can hack it without

497
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:42,769
too much trouble either way anyway so

498
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:44,269
what happens here like let's take a look

499
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:47,569
at what happens when we do add standard

500
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:50,690
room right so what happens when we do

501
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:52,759
add standard room is we go ahead and we

502
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,558
create these entities right so for

503
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:57,528
example will create begin ground entity

504
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,529
and has a traversable like so but when

505
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:02,480
we call end entity that entity is now

506
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:06,259
act and it will be packed into the grid

507
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,299
at that location right what that means

508
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:10,819
is that we can no longer edit that into

509
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,259
edit e without unpacking it again right

510
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:14,689
because again we store everything kind

511
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:17,059
of impact format and so we're not really

512
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,190
able to edit it once we finish packing

513
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,690
it down what that means is once we've

514
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,250
added a standard room we're really not

515
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,840
able to change any of the elements or

516
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,529
those entities again without opening the

517
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:32,480
backup which we don't really want to do

518
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:35,299
right so kind of what we need here is we

519
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,620
we more need the ability to create these

520
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:41,359
entities open do a bunch of operations

521
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:43,219
on them and then pack them down once

522
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,159
we're no longer needing to talk about

523
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,319
that room anymore right so we kind of

524
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,480
need the concept of an editable room

525
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,750
it's it's basically just the sim region

526
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,190
right but without any of the sim part of

527
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,920
it and without the apron it's just like

528
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,049
a little room with all the entities

529
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,700
stored and it's still open and then we

530
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:06,619
just end them all right they go end end

531
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,940
end end end end end so that is the

532
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:09,229
problem that I'm talking about and

533
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,360
that's the thing that we would need to

534
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:16,460
be able to do because otherwise I can't

535
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:18,349
really set that teleport yet so I feel

536
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,390
like that is definitely a situation

537
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:22,669
where you know the world gen stuff kind

538
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,560
of again wants to be up there but I

539
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,750
guess what I could do for now is just

540
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,179
say well all right let's just only make

541
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,000
forward like things that go forward

542
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,529
because or backward or whatever right

543
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,779
that like we could we can do one

544
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:39,440
direction pretty easily without having

545
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:44,839
to actually start having a World tools

546
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,190
that we would need right and so the way

547
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,199
that I would do that is i'll just say

548
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,390
like okay well and you know when i

549
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,340
probably could even do i could probably

550
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:55,280
even do it by just making the standard

551
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:58,519
room be something that can be kept open

552
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:01,609
a little bit longer now that i think

553
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,730
about it because we don't have to really

554
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:09,969
call and entity I don't really remember

555
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,970
exactly how this works but begin entity

556
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:17,179
yes so creation buffer intact index

557
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:19,788
there's this world mode creation buffer

558
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,409
concept right and that means you can

559
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,509
create up to four out of these we could

560
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:25,850
just make that be you know a very large

561
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:28,099
number right that number could be 512 or

562
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:30,199
something and then you could create all

563
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:31,849
the entities for a room at leave them

564
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,980
open create all the LEDs for the next

565
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:35,868
room link them up and then close the

566
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:40,548
previous set of entries right that would

567
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:42,678
be relatively straightforward to do and

568
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:44,898
we could do something like that but

569
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:46,730
again it seems kind of janky and really

570
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:48,079
like i said the solution there is it's

571
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,730
not a very good solution the better

572
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,278
solution is to just sort of have the

573
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:56,329
ability to open up regions edit them and

574
00:26:52,278 --> 00:27:00,730
and then close them as necessary i right

575
00:26:56,329 --> 00:27:05,148
so it it's not particularly compelling

576
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:10,460
unfortunately either but yet so I don't

577
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:13,638
know yeah so when we create a new room

578
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,700
in this case we could just choose to put

579
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:18,740
the hero not on the zero with floor I

580
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:28,669
believe right now what happens is we put

581
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:35,240
the hero on the zeroth floor but I'm

582
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:37,730
going to take a look here so we do for

583
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,378
camera P so it's really just the camera

584
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:44,538
that determines this when we create the

585
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:48,819
world we just use whatever whatever is

586
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,819
closest to the camera and in this case

587
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:58,128
the camera P is just using sort of

588
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,320
whatever the screen base Z is so we

589
00:27:58,128 --> 00:28:06,199
could just put the hero up at the top

590
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:10,329
right let me see your screen base Z we

591
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,330
could just put the hero up at the top

592
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:19,129
yeah and abs tiles II as it comes out of

593
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:21,649
here would just be one off of where it

594
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:24,080
should be so we could just use whatever

595
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:27,408
the last you know kind of used one of

596
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:30,138
these was and in fact I could save that

597
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:32,059
specifically so i could say that we'll

598
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:33,798
just put you on the final screen and

599
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:36,648
that would presumably solve the problem

600
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:42,710
so if we want to do you know less screen

601
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:47,199
x last screen why why are these you 30

602
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,200
tues by the way shouldn't they be s 32 s

603
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,429
does anyone know why that is that's a

604
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,429
bit weird

605
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:08,649
feel like you should be s 30 tues

606
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,368
so since I can't use the message that

607
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,840
I'm going to because I think those

608
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:25,329
should be yesterday too since they kind

609
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:34,528
of go in either direction anyway so I'm

610
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:34,528
going to say last remix last screen why

611
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:45,788
and last screen z I'm just going to go

612
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:48,309
ahead and take these and say before we

613
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:52,329
do any of the updates here we'll just

614
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:54,579
kind of set these or actually I guess

615
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:56,710
we'll just set them right here right so

616
00:29:54,579 --> 00:30:01,868
we'll just say like hey the last one we

617
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,788
created here's what it is and so then if

618
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:07,749
we want to we can make the camera up

619
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:09,788
here at the top the final one instead so

620
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:25,599
I'll just say you know less three necks

621
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:29,700
oops last screen why last screen z and

622
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,699
that should be AB Stiles e

623
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:39,769
yeah and so now as you can kind of see

624
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:46,370
we're starting off like on top right and

625
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:47,720
you know we we can't actually get down

626
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:49,639
there but you can kind of see that there

627
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,350
is something down there and so the goal

628
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,960
would just be to make it so that we can

629
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:57,409
kind of like hop on this thing and have

630
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,000
that sort of make us jump down to the

631
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:04,580
tile that would be directly below us

632
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:09,559
there right yeah and that's all I really

633
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:16,490
want to do okay so that'll be fine so if

634
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:19,579
we do that and yet all i need to do to

635
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:23,019
sort of make to make those things

636
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:27,169
connect now is just say like okay

637
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:30,589
whenever i go up a level I'll just keep

638
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:33,440
the last room which is this guy here

639
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:36,439
i'll just keep the last room and i'll

640
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,000
connect something at the top of at the

641
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,330
room above it i'll connect one of the

642
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,490
traversals to the one below it right and

643
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:46,609
so in order to do that I really just

644
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,890
need to set for one of these when we do

645
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:51,079
the ad standard room before it closes I

646
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:56,630
need to set one of those sort of

647
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:59,480
traversable targets so in the case where

648
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:05,020
I have a left hole right I'm trying to

649
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,019
do something that looks like this

650
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:19,879
I've got and I guess I should draw this

651
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:22,600
a little bit more conservatively here so

652
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,910
in case where I have a hole on the left

653
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:29,839
then underneath I won't have a hole

654
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:32,269
underneath it right and the case where I

655
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,549
have a hole on the right same thing

656
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:36,109
underneath it I won't have one here

657
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:39,379
they'll be one here because they're

658
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:42,829
alternating so what I want to do is say

659
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,660
when I build this floor if it's got a

660
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:47,149
hole on the left then what it needs to

661
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,690
have is a teleporter here that goes down

662
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:52,190
to their right and if I'm talking about

663
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,980
one that has a hole on the right then I

664
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:58,460
need to build a little teleporter here

665
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:04,599
that comes down there right so pretty

666
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:08,299
straightforward so if I see a left hole

667
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:11,869
then I need to take whatever the this

668
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:20,089
pre room thing is here I need to take

669
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:22,489
that guy and take whatever the ground

670
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:24,819
thing is and pass you know some

671
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:33,640
particular thing I guess in this case

672
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:33,639
what i will do is wear a standard room

673
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:42,139
all to say ok there's a traversable

674
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:49,429
reference and this is the target ref or

675
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:51,670
whatever that thing if there's a left

676
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:51,670
hole

677
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,139
or if there's a right hole will get set

678
00:33:56,069 --> 00:34:04,740
differently if there's a left hole the

679
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:13,828
target riff should be yeah you know I

680
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:16,409
don't know like let's see the left hole

681
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:21,210
is like negative 5 negative 3 so it

682
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:29,220
should probably be like- you know that

683
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:32,760
the thing would be at a probably

684
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:38,818
negative 2 so we'd be hopping down to

685
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:46,919
negative 1 right I'm sorry to negative 3

686
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:50,369
and this is accessed XY yes yes and so

687
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:52,500
the Y values your one let's say it's

688
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,050
zero right so you know that's what the

689
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,690
target riff might be for that for a

690
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:01,349
right hole we've got three you know the

691
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:05,358
offset X is 3 so we kind of know that

692
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:08,280
it's definitely hopping down to three

693
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:10,529
and then we it's between negative 2 and

694
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,970
2 so let's just say the other one was at

695
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,000
the top let's say this one's at the top

696
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:18,539
so we'll say it's negative 2 as well

697
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,760
right and so in this case those are what

698
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:23,608
they are but of course we we have to

699
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,560
offset them in this this is kind of

700
00:35:23,608 --> 00:35:27,539
annoying right but you can kind of see

701
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,068
we've got to offset them this is why we

702
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:31,949
need some actual world building tools

703
00:35:29,068 --> 00:35:33,210
here because this is a mess right you

704
00:35:31,949 --> 00:35:34,889
can see how this is totally

705
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,880
unsustainable like we're not going to

706
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:37,588
want to do this when we're actually

707
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,930
trying to create the real game world is

708
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:41,789
just it you know everything here needs

709
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:46,799
to be made into nice utilities that just

710
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:49,699
work okay so in this sense we can just

711
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,140
do those guys not really anything

712
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:56,009
particular go around there what I would

713
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:59,639
like to do is say in the case where we

714
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:01,619
have the first screen there's nothing

715
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:04,078
below the first one so I'm going to say

716
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:06,599
that there's no left hole and no right

717
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,810
hole on the bottom most guy that makes

718
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:12,170
sense

719
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:19,369
and and that'll be that so now if I go

720
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:25,039
back to my ad standard room to make this

721
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:26,869
sort of makeshift crappy test case we're

722
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,489
going to pass the target ref here and in

723
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:34,339
the case where we know that we have a

724
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:35,659
left hole I'm going to say that this

725
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:37,820
entity you know when you're standing

726
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:40,670
optical entity that I create if you're

727
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:43,130
standing on the the particular entity

728
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,440
that I need you to be standing on for a

729
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:49,849
left hole or right hole or whatever then

730
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,190
the boosts you know the the auto boost

731
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:56,329
target or whatever is going to be equal

732
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:58,300
to that target ref so like I just need

733
00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:01,730
to say you know if you're at a left hole

734
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:12,289
and your offset x equals this and your

735
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:15,050
offset y equals this or you're right

736
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:17,659
hole and your offset x equals whatever

737
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:23,410
it equals and your offset y equals

738
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:25,549
whatever it equals you know I'm saying

739
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:29,239
then you're all good right so you have

740
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:33,160
left tool XY right volt XY these X wise

741
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:36,319
are whatever they were so in the case of

742
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:38,960
the left hole then like I said it's

743
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,700
going to be like one off of where it was

744
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:46,250
going to be like negative 2 is where the

745
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:48,379
teleporter is and the y is 0 and what

746
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,429
did I say it was going to be here y is

747
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:55,700
negative 2 and the X is what for I

748
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:56,960
believe yeah so that's where the club or

749
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:58,759
I guess maybe it should be on the other

750
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,349
side of it probably I guess it probably

751
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,390
should be too because you're going the

752
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:03,500
other direction i guess i don't know it

753
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:07,639
doesn't really matter but you get the

754
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,170
idea uh so yeah in either of those cases

755
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:12,409
then we're going to set the auto boost

756
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:16,159
to target and I think that's create the

757
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:18,710
linkage again only in one direction now

758
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,929
at the moment unfortunately we don't

759
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,329
actually have any way

760
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:25,519
to see these can these that these things

761
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:28,220
are set so what I'd like to do is just

762
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,469
quickly add of something fairly simple

763
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:33,439
just a really basic thing to show that

764
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:34,848
we actually set them at all so inside

765
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,858
the entity stuff when we're rendering

766
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:38,030
the traversable what I'm going to do is

767
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:40,338
I'm just going to add a little bit of

768
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,710
color there just so I can see what's

769
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:45,529
going on like that they got set at all

770
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:49,119
before I bother trying to actually wire

771
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:51,230
them up to anything because you know

772
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,050
like I said we have no world building

773
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:57,469
tool so it's a little bit presumptuous

774
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,420
and finicky so I'm going to say that

775
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,308
we've got a color value here we've got a

776
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:05,150
color value based on whether you've got

777
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:06,800
an occupier right like so and I just

778
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,269
want to make this now into something

779
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,309
that's a little more complicated to how

780
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:11,630
you set the color so the first thing I'm

781
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,130
going to do is say well let's just go

782
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,750
back to saying that there's a default

783
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,460
color this is Lex let's say the default

784
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,650
color that we're going to render these

785
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,150
reversals as and then I'm going to do an

786
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:23,358
if statement here where say like if you

787
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:28,220
have an occupier then you will set the

788
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:30,469
color to this other color right and

789
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:32,659
furthermore so here I can also say well

790
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:35,689
whatever this entity is if the auto

791
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:36,858
boost to is valid I don't know how to

792
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,608
test for that because I don't remember

793
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:44,828
anymore at all let's see here

794
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:49,730
traversable reference there we go so

795
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:52,670
traversable reference I don't know how

796
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:56,449
to check to see if one of those is

797
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:58,190
actually doing anything you know what I

798
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:03,019
want to do is basically say like gifts

799
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:05,389
is this a valid thing and maybe all i

800
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:10,159
have to do for that is just say whether

801
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:13,608
or not the traversable reference whether

802
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,500
the pointer is nominal or not that might

803
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:17,989
be sufficient because the pointer would

804
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,480
be null in a case where oops where it

805
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:21,588
wasn't that's anything but basically

806
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,530
what i want to do is something like that

807
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:26,389
if it's a valid thing that we've set i'm

808
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,390
going to make it like some kind of

809
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:34,460
hideous pink just so i can see that it

810
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:36,588
actually is is there right so yeah so

811
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,079
so I don't like I said I don't know we

812
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:40,750
don't seem to have one of those I'll

813
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,509
take a quick look in here to make sure

814
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:48,230
so here's a get reversible right and

815
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:53,420
that returns a pointer so you know maybe

816
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:58,280
in a it's it's just the right thing to

817
00:40:53,420 --> 00:41:01,099
do to say like get traversable and see

818
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,040
if it returns non-null and so that seems

819
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:05,480
pretty reasonable of a way to do it so

820
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:06,949
you can see I'm not actually getting

821
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,599
think you're so now I'm a little bit

822
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:10,759
nervous like did those things not get

823
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,980
set for some reason I'm not sure I have

824
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,710
no idea I don't really know what's going

825
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:18,019
on right so that's what I exactly what I

826
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,000
wanted to know so let's take a look and

827
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:26,179
see whether or not those things are ever

828
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:32,659
being set or what's going on there okay

829
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:35,239
so yeah inside handmade world also I'm a

830
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:37,608
little bit interested to know what it

831
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:39,469
where our performance goes I'm assuming

832
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:42,259
that it's all still going to the just a

833
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:44,389
path that simple path on it yeah get

834
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,980
closest reversible so I just want to

835
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:48,799
make sure that that's still what was

836
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:56,119
causing us to be slow since it's very

837
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:58,450
accelerated OpenGL render commands also

838
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:02,150
seems to have quite a bit of work to do

839
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:03,949
nice it's okay anyway that's the

840
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,809
unoptimized build we're still probably

841
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:07,759
60 frames a second no problem when the

842
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:09,619
the optimized one so it's not really a

843
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,790
big deal anyway but and just like to

844
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:16,550
make sure that nothing pops up there

845
00:42:13,789 --> 00:42:18,170
okay so I want to see what this is

846
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,910
getting set to like if it's never

847
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:22,159
getting set to anything or what's going

848
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:23,509
on there or you know or am I thinking

849
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,369
about this problem wrong so I just

850
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,470
wanted when we actually create the world

851
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:29,750
I just want to go through and watch to

852
00:42:27,469 --> 00:42:31,459
see whether its ever being said at all

853
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:41,920
just to give myself a little bit of a

854
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:44,510
bearing on the situation so first off

855
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:53,619
let's see if that code ever gets called

856
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:57,670
at all okay and it does so that's good

857
00:42:53,619 --> 00:43:02,750
it gets in this case it's getting set to

858
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:10,789
an index but no Envy pointer which would

859
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:19,219
not be helpful so in in that case that

860
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:20,929
seems problematic to me because we

861
00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:22,339
should have had two things there should

862
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:24,469
two of those things should have been set

863
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,160
I would think let me take a look at that

864
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:27,159
to make sure

865
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,338
oh no that's okay so having the index be

866
00:43:35,028 --> 00:43:40,190
set something should be sufficient so

867
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:41,929
that does seem okay so that entity auto

868
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,358
boost to is there so that all seems good

869
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:45,949
so I think you know now I think about

870
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:48,980
the only problem is we didn't add any

871
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:53,000
unpack code to it so that's probably all

872
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:59,838
we really need to do to fix it actually

873
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,599
now that I think about it yeah because

874
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:15,980
when these things going to impact here

875
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:18,380
we kind of come through it and we do we

876
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,699
do pack traversal reference so we have

877
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,690
to make sure that we're actually do

878
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:26,028
those packings like with occupying and

879
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:28,909
came from we need to do auto boost to as

880
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:33,409
well and the same would be true on the

881
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:40,608
other side of things right load

882
00:44:33,409 --> 00:44:42,649
traversable reference for example also

883
00:44:40,608 --> 00:44:44,750
has to be loaded so let's take a look at

884
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,269
that that may have been the only problem

885
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:49,278
but there could be yeah so there we go

886
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:51,288
Oh looks like I was backwards a little

887
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:52,548
bit there but ok so that's set now and

888
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,140
so what I want to do is make it so that

889
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:56,179
I hop on that that one's not set to the

890
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:57,469
value that I actually wanted so that's a

891
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:59,719
little bit of mistake let me go ahead

892
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:01,879
and fix that and we only have about two

893
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:04,189
minutes left so I probably won't try to

894
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,608
do the animation stuff yet although i

895
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:09,829
don't know maybe I will maybe ammo but

896
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:16,429
yeah so in here what I want to do is say

897
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:18,740
like okay my why I was thinking that the

898
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:20,239
higher why the was the negative 1

899
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:22,909
because I always think of why is going

900
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:25,219
down I can't ever seem to shake it but

901
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:27,909
it's not it's going up so that's

902
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:31,009
actually supposed to be a 2 there and

903
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:32,149
the same is true of this guy was was set

904
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:33,440
to the wrong values they were the low

905
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,750
value so I wanted them to be the high

906
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,068
values so I'm just going to go through

907
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:42,108
and undo that that mistake so yeah

908
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:45,018
instead of negative 2 it's 2 instead of

909
00:45:42,108 --> 00:45:45,619
10 it's one and so now they should be at

910
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:46,909
the top

911
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:49,338
the things that's just that's just where

912
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:50,659
I mentally picture them it doesn't

913
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:52,038
really matter for anything but I just

914
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:55,489
that's what i wanted so i'm going to fix

915
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:57,259
it alright so now those should all be

916
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:59,298
set properly and so tomorrow we should

917
00:45:57,259 --> 00:46:00,889
be able to just make it so that we when

918
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:03,170
we hop on one big boost the star to the

919
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:05,058
next one and that should be about it so

920
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:06,999
i'm going to go ahead and go to the Q&amp;A

921
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:09,640
now because i don't want to start that

922
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:13,449
yet since i won't have time to finish it

923
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:13,449
even though it is relatively simple

924
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,329
in the meantime I want to take a look at

925
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,329
the Headroom here

926
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,619
yes that's so basically like when we

927
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:55,170
compile in in optimized mode we are

928
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:57,599
basically entirely in the graphics which

929
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:01,490
is good that's what we want to see

930
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,489
certainly so

931
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,970
about my first question will i be able

932
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:24,710
to view it again because i was really

933
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:27,980
interested about your answer you can use

934
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:32,059
the twitch archive which keeps it for

935
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:34,340
about two weeks so you can view it via

936
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:36,820
twitch i think for two weeks and then it

937
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,820
disappears

938
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,480
are using entity component system

939
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,510
architecture or different different we

940
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,590
are using a very experimental

941
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:02,200
architecture which we haven't really

942
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:03,789
determined whether it's good or bad yet

943
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:05,889
because we haven't really gotten to the

944
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:09,190
point where we actually need to do the

945
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:11,619
part that matters when we actually get

946
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,030
further down the game implementation

947
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:18,549
part of the game rather than the engine

948
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:20,560
part will know but there's several

949
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:22,450
streams on this so I would encourage you

950
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,429
to go back and watch those if you're

951
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:26,919
interested in the approach that I

952
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:30,029
decided to take for ND systems it is not

953
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,030
an entity component system

954
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:41,368
although it's worth mentioning it's

955
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:44,250
definitely closer to an entity component

956
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:46,619
system than it would be to say a C++

957
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,108
inheritance hierarchy based nnd system

958
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:54,240
or something like that so in terms of

959
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:57,920
like things that are similar to it it's

960
00:48:54,239 --> 00:49:01,429
it's closer to that that it would be to

961
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,430
certain other kinds

962
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,850
if you come for the story for the game

963
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:41,070
yet uh yeah we don't really deal with

964
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:45,869
story and design stuff on the stream so

965
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:46,950
this is just for programming I recall

966
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:48,299
when you were writing the head body

967
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:49,739
behavior code you want to ensure the

968
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,110
player always had control over the head

969
00:49:49,739 --> 00:49:55,319
is this auto hopping going to interfere

970
00:49:52,110 --> 00:50:00,630
with that uh no I don't think so because

971
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:04,950
he already does autohop right so the

972
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:07,110
body always goes on a hop right so

973
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:09,149
you're only actually able to control the

974
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:12,570
head to a certain extent like you can

975
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:14,070
move the head I freely but it has to

976
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,380
stay within range of the body and the

977
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:19,320
body always does hop from one position

978
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,300
to another so this is fully in keeping

979
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,070
with that and it would feel it's exactly

980
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,680
what I would want to have happen right

981
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:27,240
it's that the body once you commit the

982
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,210
body has to go where it's going to go

983
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:32,939
and the head has to go with it to a

984
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:36,380
certain extent it can you know lag by

985
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,380
however much we allow it to lag

986
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:51,849
can the player fall in the hole versus

987
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:55,669
jumping on purpose I don't believe so

988
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:57,769
there's no real reason why I would allow

989
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:03,318
that I don't think in the game that I

990
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:05,809
can think of in theory these could these

991
00:51:03,318 --> 00:51:16,279
jump pads be on the same level and use

992
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:18,559
like jump pads in Portal 2 so I I really

993
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,599
don't need them for anything other than

994
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:27,430
just getting up and down between floors

995
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:29,660
so I wouldn't necessarily say that I

996
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:32,058
wouldn't necessarily say that there's

997
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:33,649
any reason why we couldn't experiment

998
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:36,319
with them if we felt like that was

999
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,548
important later on if it looked look

1000
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:44,088
like there was something cool to do

1001
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:51,670
there but i would say i don't anticipate

1002
00:51:44,088 --> 00:51:51,670
needing that for any pic eula reason but

1003
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,970
torgue door will multi-part entities

1004
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:10,730
like the snake be able to go through

1005
00:52:04,969 --> 00:52:13,969
holes I think so I don't see any reason

1006
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:16,940
why they wouldn't be able to because as

1007
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:19,039
long as the snake just always follows

1008
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,470
the same rule which is that each segment

1009
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:25,279
follows the previous segment once one of

1010
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:27,409
those segments jumps onto the pad it

1011
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,880
will jump the next jump will be down and

1012
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:30,349
then the next segment we'll jump onto

1013
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,970
the pad and they'll all just kind of

1014
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:36,500
jump down so you know I soom that that

1015
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:40,489
will be the way that goes and the same

1016
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:42,889
will be true of like the floating heads

1017
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:46,819
right now the heads are allowed to float

1018
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:48,889
like directly to their target which we

1019
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:52,180
don't want to do there they we haven't

1020
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:54,469
actually written that code yet like the

1021
00:52:52,179 --> 00:52:57,109
familiars would not be able to go like

1022
00:52:54,469 --> 00:52:58,819
directly through the floor normally but

1023
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:02,740
they currently can but so we would force

1024
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,740
them to also use the pads probably

1025
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:43,340
what are your thoughts on voxel

1026
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:46,309
rendering and or ray tracing do you mean

1027
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:49,870
to ask what are my thoughts on voxel

1028
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:52,340
rendering and/or voxel ray tracing or

1029
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:57,380
what are your thoughts on voxel

1030
00:53:52,340 --> 00:54:03,140
rendering and or ray tracing unrelated

1031
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:06,829
like just retracing in general and I

1032
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:09,049
guess what I would say is I like some

1033
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:11,139
aspects of voxel rendering there are

1034
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:14,990
obviously some attractive elements to it

1035
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:17,000
my problem is just the heart that you

1036
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:19,969
often want surfaces to be kind of

1037
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,849
defined cleanly and it's very hard to do

1038
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:24,289
that with voxels a lot of the time so

1039
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:26,360
you kind of end up having to do these

1040
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:29,659
sort of hacky things where you create

1041
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:32,210
ways of like carving the voxel elements

1042
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:34,579
into surface elements and stuff like

1043
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:36,079
this and and I just don't feel like you

1044
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:37,250
know I don't follow the literature on

1045
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,489
that I haven't followed the literature

1046
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:43,099
on that very closely lately so they may

1047
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:47,809
have gotten further towards making that

1048
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:51,110
clean and you know not super hacky like

1049
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:53,299
it was but I never really saw back in

1050
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:55,880
the last time I looked at that five

1051
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:59,180
years ago let's say I never really saw

1052
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,650
anyone who really like presented a clean

1053
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:04,429
way that that was going to really work

1054
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:07,550
for real right which is not to say that

1055
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:10,129
it won't I just had seen the real sort

1056
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:15,500
of clear way that that works if that

1057
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:17,269
makes sense uh so you know that's what

1058
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,340
I'd say about fox surrendering it's got

1059
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:22,400
some really nice advantages I just don't

1060
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:25,970
know how you get back if the surface

1061
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,670
part of its going to work out you know

1062
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:30,799
in a maybe the answer is just that like

1063
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,930
hey eventually we have computers that

1064
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,640
are so powerful that the resolution of

1065
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:37,279
the voxels is so tiny that they're less

1066
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,719
than a pixel large always in which case

1067
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,610
then you don't care about the surface

1068
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:46,039
element of it but you know we're not

1069
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,660
there yet so it's hard to say will we

1070
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,829
get there when will we get there if we

1071
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:51,659
get there I don't know

1072
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:56,039
as far as ray tracing I love ray tracing

1073
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:57,869
ray tracing is is my favorite the

1074
00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:59,820
problem is just nobody really knows how

1075
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:02,880
to do it efficiently enough yet right

1076
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:04,980
even the most advanced ray tracing

1077
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,880
engines right now just are not capable

1078
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:12,690
of running a real game you know if you

1079
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,340
if you take a look at the brigade engine

1080
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,740
let's say which i think is the furthest

1081
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,829
along actual sort of game engine I've

1082
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:23,609
seen it just can't hold a candle to

1083
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:26,400
something like you know the current doom

1084
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:29,930
render or something in terms of the

1085
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,430
visual quality that it actually produces

1086
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:35,239
with animating objects and all these

1087
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:37,859
other sorts of things so you know it's

1088
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:39,899
got some obvious strengths you know it

1089
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:41,880
does perfect reflections well and it

1090
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,590
does things like you know global

1091
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,170
illumination really cleanly and stuff

1092
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:47,250
like that but it just can't get it

1093
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,960
doesn't seem to be able to get to the

1094
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,639
point where it sufficient enough to have

1095
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,639
like big moving scenes with lots of

1096
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:56,429
stuff in it and actually produce enough

1097
00:56:53,639 --> 00:57:01,980
noise free samples to really work you

1098
00:56:56,429 --> 00:57:03,929
know but you know who knows again I

1099
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,369
think it's like anything else we really

1100
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:08,069
just don't know what the future holds

1101
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:13,769
because we don't really know what kind

1102
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:15,330
of horsepower we will top out at so we

1103
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:17,789
don't really know what what I think the

1104
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:23,880
final render or quote unquote will look

1105
00:57:17,789 --> 00:57:25,409
like dr. s80 regarding head body the

1106
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,090
player controls the head out of the jump

1107
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:28,829
pad but then the game needs to animate

1108
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,570
both the head and the body down right I

1109
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:32,340
thought so far the head was always

1110
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:35,690
sponsored two player input not tight

1111
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:40,019
animation the body just followed no so

1112
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:43,860
the the head right at the moment the

1113
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:45,389
head is is kind of not correct you can

1114
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,769
move the head where you would not

1115
00:57:45,389 --> 00:57:49,529
normally be able to move the head so for

1116
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:51,210
example right now I can do that that's

1117
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,800
totally not actually allowed in the game

1118
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:56,820
what would actually happen is the head

1119
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:58,800
would stop like right there right and so

1120
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:02,460
you know it should be more like this

1121
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:04,289
right so no the player basically the

1122
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,449
the head is tied to the body and the

1123
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:08,550
player can move the head around but when

1124
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:12,299
the body is somewhere the head asked to

1125
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:14,070
stay within one-half displacement so if

1126
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,050
you hop on the pad you will get moved

1127
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:19,080
down with the body and that is the way

1128
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:21,330
it it is designed to work everywhere

1129
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:24,179
this is the same if you were on a moving

1130
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:26,880
platform same deal it will move the head

1131
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:28,710
along with the body once the body is you

1132
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:37,170
know is pulling the head away kind of

1133
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:39,389
thing opinion on Vulcan other than it

1134
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,579
being really hard I don't really think

1135
00:58:39,389 --> 00:58:44,309
of it as being really hard I think it is

1136
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:48,259
being unnecessarily complicated and not

1137
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:48,259
particularly mapping well to the problem

1138
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:54,510
you know I think of it as basically like

1139
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:57,030
not a very poorly designed API that

1140
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:59,849
attempts to give you access to roughly

1141
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:01,589
what the union of current hardware or

1142
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:03,030
rather should say the intersection of

1143
00:59:01,588 --> 00:59:05,909
what current hardware is capable of

1144
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:08,099
which I just don't I don't like that

1145
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:12,149
goal I think that was a bad design

1146
00:59:08,099 --> 00:59:14,130
decision given the situation of the

1147
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,720
graphics industry at the moment so I

1148
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,760
guess what I'd say is philosophically I

1149
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,319
disagree with Vulcan I don't like the

1150
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:27,599
approach that was taken and I think it's

1151
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:31,980
problematic but you know it is what it

1152
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:33,690
is now so you know we'll probably end up

1153
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,909
having to use it because if that's what

1154
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:37,200
hardware vendors decide to support then

1155
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:42,389
you don't really have a choice you know

1156
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:44,250
you're this is the the real problem with

1157
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:45,629
the graphics industry these days is you

1158
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,519
know they don't give you a chip to

1159
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:49,079
program they give you an API to program

1160
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:50,639
and if they do a really bad job

1161
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:57,469
designing that API then you're just

1162
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:57,469
stuck with it so

1163
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:16,490
how are holes and teleport pads going to

1164
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,230
help us find the variable well because

1165
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:19,729
in order to find the variable you must

1166
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,960
search everywhere in the world and if

1167
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:22,670
the only way you can get up and downs

1168
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:37,840
with these pads but then obviously

1169
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:37,840
you're going to need to use them so

1170
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:09,069
any tips for someone interested in game

1171
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:16,380
engines considering getting into the

1172
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:16,380
chemistry not really other than what

1173
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:20,969
other than what I say on the stream you

1174
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:20,969
know

1175
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:37,460
and also yes this year's handmade cod

1176
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:46,469
will have a job fair which we will be

1177
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:48,809
announcing more about soon do you have a

1178
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:50,279
set streaming schedule well you know

1179
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:51,329
since the stream has ended it's actually

1180
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,250
the perfect time to mention that I

1181
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:55,250
suppose so we'll just go right into that

1182
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,710
let's go ahead and do that thank you

1183
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:03,298
everyone for joining me for a handmade

1184
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:05,159
hero it's been a pleasure coding with

1185
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:07,230
you as always if you would like to

1186
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:08,788
follow along at home you can always peer

1187
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:10,740
to the game on handmade here org and it

1188
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:13,559
comes with the source code so you can

1189
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:15,029
play around with it we have a forum site

1190
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:16,530
if you want to ask questions we have a

1191
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:18,750
patreon page you want to support our

1192
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:20,430
video series we have a schedule bot if

1193
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,920
you would like to know what our schedule

1194
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:24,449
is so you can catch the stream live and

1195
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:28,048
we have an episode guide that let you

1196
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:29,689
catch up with old editions of the show

1197
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:32,219
since we just got to ask that question

1198
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:33,750
do we have set screaming schedule yes

1199
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:36,449
you can always find out what the set

1200
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:38,309
streaming schedule is by looking at the

1201
01:02:36,449 --> 01:02:39,838
tweet bot and you can see here that at

1202
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:42,269
the beginning of the week will give you

1203
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,028
the entire schedule for that week and

1204
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:46,769
then it will tell you every day what

1205
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:48,690
that day's schedule is going to be as

1206
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:52,619
well if you're just curious about that

1207
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:56,278
so definitely you can follow that bot or

1208
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:59,369
just come to this page and and check it

1209
01:02:56,278 --> 01:03:03,440
out if you need to know also typically

1210
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:06,778
on this page if you refresh this page

1211
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,639
when there is not a show live so for

1212
01:03:06,778 --> 01:03:11,309
example this this episode just

1213
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:13,139
technically ended this little countdown

1214
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:14,670
timer will count down to the next time

1215
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:18,900
it's live if the schedule has been

1216
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:20,548
posted so that's about it thank you

1217
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,778
everyone for joining me I will be back

1218
01:03:20,548 --> 01:03:23,219
here tomorrow for the last few min the

1219
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:25,920
week I'm off the end of the week but

1220
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:28,639
then we'll be back here again the

1221
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:32,130
following week so just a brief break

1222
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,960
that's about it so i'll hopefully see

1223
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:36,000
you guys tomorrow until then have fun

1224
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:40,010
programming and i will see you on the

1225
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,010
Internet take it easy everyone
