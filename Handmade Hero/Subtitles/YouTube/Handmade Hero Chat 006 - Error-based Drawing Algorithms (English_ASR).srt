1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:06,240
welcome to handmade hero show where we

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,820
code a complete game live on stream

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,388
except not these past two weeks because

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,339
I am an RSI break but I'm kind of hoping

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:17,070
that will be a fireside break maybe next

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,420
week I don't know so I was kind of

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,439
hoping this might be the last week for

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,990
it but no promises because well nobody

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,689
really knows very much about RS I part

11
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:29,729
of the problem and so you never really

12
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,308
know what the deal is and getting

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,920
diagnosis is pretty tricky so so who

14
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,140
knows but point being in the meantime

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,420
instead of just not streaming I decided

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,619
to still do essentially q and A's

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,679
because I can draw with my right hand

18
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:46,199
just fine and so there really isn't a

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,670
whole lot of issue with taking basic

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,719
questions from the audience like we

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,160
normally do so we had some questions for

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,780
some reason and i'm not going to

23
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,929
probably spell this right but let's say

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,549
that it's called brezin ham but i feel

25
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,350
like there's maybe some other letters in

26
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:08,959
here so let's just put quotes around

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,960
that and say that like spelling may vary

28
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:14,250
but people were asking sort of about

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,759
brezin ham in terms of how you do a

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,670
breast and ham line drawing or present

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,200
ham I I feel like probably the easiest

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,790
way to address it is to say that in

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,259
general there's a sort of a conceptual

34
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,700
thing here instead of calling it a

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,189
present ham drawing scheme or whatever

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,719
we could instead just call it error

37
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:38,368
based rasterization and i think there's

38
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,868
probably a correct term for it but it's

39
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:41,430
been so long since I've studies so I

40
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:43,109
don't even remember what the term is but

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,659
I think there is it's not digital

42
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,659
differential analyzer because that's

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,430
only if you if you add EDA is when you

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,990
actually transform it into a slightly

45
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,030
different format so I think it's

46
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:55,949
actually called something else but point

47
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,079
thing I'm going to explain the technique

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,609
they're based on and you can use it to

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,929
draw anything you don't have to use it

50
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,000
to just draw lines you can use it to

51
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,390
draw really any shape that has an

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,408
implicit formalization of some kind but

53
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,408
first I'm going to bite my fingernail

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,860
because I have OCD tendencies it's fine

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,519
all right so let's talk about this let's

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,870
talk about this this method so I don't

57
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,090
really know why people wanted to know

58
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,750
this I have no idea I just know that

59
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,098
they did and i think it was Charlotte 93

60
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,419
who asked about it originally but I saw

61
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:34,000
other people mentioning it as well so

62
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:37,689
apparently multiple people wanted to

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,400
know I have no idea point being what is

64
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,479
a breath and ham algorithm what does

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,280
that even mean what does the president

66
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,328
lighter why do we care why did anyone

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:52,449
ever care well in the old old old old

68
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:54,909
old days and I mean old days way back in

69
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:56,979
the dawn of history when people rode

70
00:02:54,908 --> 00:03:01,750
around on mastodons and all these other

71
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:05,169
sorts of things you used to try to draw

72
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,120
things a pixel at a time directly to the

73
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:10,419
actual buffer that was on the screen

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,489
most of the time right so we're talking

75
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:19,418
about the days when like literally there

76
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:22,030
was like a frame buffer and this frame

77
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:23,769
buffer was literally being drawn out to

78
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,009
the monitor and it was you know it was a

79
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,599
CRT it was a cathode ray tube right it's

80
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:31,090
kind of like doing a soul scan out and

81
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:34,298
literally this frame buffer here was

82
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,128
getting drawn directly out and drawing

83
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,829
graphics was incredibly expensive like

84
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:41,289
processors were super slow and like you

85
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:44,139
drew things like one pixel at a time and

86
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:45,608
you hoped you could sort of draw it fast

87
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:48,069
enough that the user didn't get bored

88
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:50,500
watching it and I mean watching it like

89
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:52,810
the user would literally watch your

90
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,848
program draw the graphics on the screen

91
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,949
and if you don't believe me go watch

92
00:03:54,848 --> 00:04:00,098
some like original capture videos of

93
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:02,650
like the original say King's Quest you

94
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:05,259
could literally watch it fill in the

95
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,789
shapes of the graphics on the screen as

96
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:14,488
you SAT there I'm not kidding so yeah

97
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:17,439
like we're talking old old days old days

98
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,348
so in those days the performance

99
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,719
characteristics of algorithms looked a

100
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:24,610
lot different than they look now it was

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,080
about minimizing cash effects it wasn't

102
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,900
about trying to keep him like a certain

103
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,979
memory footprint it wasn't about

104
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:34,079
paralyzing instructions it wasn't about

105
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:37,030
multithreading you literally had the CPU

106
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,620
was the total gating factor so you were

107
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:40,779
just trying to minimize the number of

108
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,340
operations it had to do to draw a line

109
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:46,000
that's what you were trying to do and

110
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:49,119
furthermore you were also trying to make

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,889
sure that those operations were very

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,079
cheap because you didn't have things

113
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,519
like fast floating-point multiplies you

114
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:56,229
didn't have things like floating point

115
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,490
multiplies at all if you wanted to

116
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,020
multiply two floating point numbers

117
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,819
together you probably were going to have

118
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:03,310
to write code yourself to do it so

119
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:07,029
everything was in fixed point or integer

120
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,500
math okay and that's sort of the state

121
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,779
of the world where these sorts of

122
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,990
algorithms came about at least as far as

123
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,399
I know I wasn't there I I wasn't present

124
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,530
ham I think invented his line drawing

125
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,159
algorithm before I was born I think

126
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:22,629
probably as born in 76 I suspected dates

127
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,669
before then because people were doing

128
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,949
raster display stuff before I was born

129
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:30,329
so I'm assuming I don't know we could

130
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:33,519
look it up so anyway in that in that

131
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:37,269
context a line drawing algorithm that

132
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,189
may seem a little bit silly now makes

133
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:41,349
potentially a lot of sense which is to

134
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,149
say that thinking about a line in terms

135
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,300
of starting at a particular pixel and

136
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:48,759
literally moving along each individual

137
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,180
pixel until the line is drawn like this

138
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,509
and even if that line goes all the way

139
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,400
down the entire screen doing it that way

140
00:05:54,509 --> 00:06:00,399
today would be kind of a laughable idea

141
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:02,469
right because what we want to do is we

142
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,469
want to break up things into lots of

143
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,380
pieces where oh my goodness what just

144
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,090
happened okay I didn't want that to

145
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:13,269
happen but that's fine that was my

146
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:14,529
drawing tablet helping me we want to

147
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:16,930
break things into lots of little tiny

148
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:19,509
pieces we want to do parallelizable

149
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,478
operations and so on so the concept that

150
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,459
we would start out at a particular point

151
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,779
and then draw the whole line it doesn't

152
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:28,539
make any sense we would never do that

153
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,459
right which is not to say that brezin

154
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,620
hands algorithm can't have applications

155
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:34,538
in a modern day not saying that at all

156
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,189
because you could imagine maybe adapting

157
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:37,959
it and clipping the line in doing us

158
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,920
just saying in those things they weren't

159
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,299
thinking about any of those things

160
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,400
they're thinking about literally

161
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,160
starting at a point and then you know

162
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,709
drawing the line pixel by pixel and

163
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,060
that's what they're trying to accomplish

164
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:53,500
okay so how do we do this right how do

165
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,509
we actually construct an algorithm that

166
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,540
does this well obviously if you're

167
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,599
trying to draw a point from p0 to p1

168
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,340
okay if you're trying to do that you

169
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,760
obviously know two points that are on

170
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,709
the line p0 and p1 right so you have a

171
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,649
starting point if you will you could

172
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:14,019
choose to start at say p 0 you know one

173
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:15,819
point that's on the line so the concept

174
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:17,500
of an algorithm that wants to start at

175
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,230
the start of the line and go towards the

176
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,699
end of the line you immediately have

177
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,530
something you can start doing which is

178
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:27,250
you can fill whatever pixel you're at

179
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:29,319
right at that moment right so if you

180
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,540
imagine us trying to create a present

181
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,029
hands line drawing routine you could

182
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,920
imagine us saying okay well we're trying

183
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,489
to create this thing and I want to start

184
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,350
by drawing pixels I want to start by

185
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,180
placing myself in the pixel that the

186
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,850
line starts at right and maybe that's

187
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,829
here maybe that's p 0 so the first step

188
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:49,629
of a president lime drawing algorithm is

189
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:52,389
pretty trivial you would just draw this

190
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:56,319
in right but now where the present hands

191
00:07:52,389 --> 00:08:00,099
line drawing part comes in is the

192
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,939
obvious question of what do you do next

193
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,160
right because I've got this line and I

194
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:08,410
want to know that it fills in these

195
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,790
pixels right I want to know what pixels

196
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,189
it fills in I want to know that it fills

197
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,980
in that pixel and that pixel and that

198
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:17,319
pixel and that pixel and so on right I

199
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,990
want to be able to draw this line by

200
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,360
filling in the appropriate pixels so the

201
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,759
question is what is and this is what

202
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,160
sort of i assume brezin ham was asking

203
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,209
himself when he came up with this

204
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,040
assuming that that's a dude I don't even

205
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:31,389
know to be honest with you that I that I

206
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,769
don't even know normally I know more

207
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:34,870
about people who made algorithms this I

208
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:36,870
have no idea I know it's called it I

209
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,929
assume this named after him who knows

210
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,190
anyway the question that the algorithm

211
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,859
designer would sit down and ask

212
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,230
themselves at this point was well what's

213
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,389
the simplest possible what's with the

214
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,700
fewest number of basic operations I

215
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:54,159
could

216
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,810
to figure out the next pixel I need to

217
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,059
fill because I'm going to sit in some

218
00:08:55,809 --> 00:09:01,028
loop here right I'm going to do like a

219
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:03,669
while loop ok and I'm going to fill a

220
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:07,000
pixel each time through this loop and

221
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:08,740
what I want to do is no okay which of

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,278
the pixels am I going to fill because

223
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,110
that pixel fill operation is some fixed

224
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:15,850
costs and I can't get away from that

225
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,700
I've got to actually fill the pixel

226
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,200
right but then however much work it

227
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,879
takes me to figure out what the next

228
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,730
pixel is to fill that's basically the

229
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,740
whole speed of my line drawing routine

230
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,250
ok so the less work i can do to figure

231
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,970
out what pixel it is the better for me

232
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:38,169
makes sense okay uh so what the breaths

233
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,490
and ham family of functions do because

234
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:41,169
you can imagine that's kind of kind of

235
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,909
crazy right it's like oh well what am I

236
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:45,009
going to do with I got no floating point

237
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:48,370
like maybe I have no floating point mass

238
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:49,929
right how do and so this line like I

239
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,730
don't even know I can't normalize its

240
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:54,458
slope or anything I can't I can't

241
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,350
compute how far it takes me to step to

242
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,719
here cuz that'd be like a divided I got

243
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,980
a guy you know it's like everything you

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
might start thinking of that would be

245
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,459
trivial for you to do today and you

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,290
wouldn't even care is actually like

247
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:08,049
maybe crazy back then when you only have

248
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:09,519
integer units and they're very basic and

249
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:11,049
you know a multiply even an integer

250
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,870
multiplies expensive and blah blah blah

251
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:20,169
right okay so the concept of these

252
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,980
algorithms is to say well let's think of

253
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:27,099
it this way okay if I'm drawing this

254
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:31,720
line I'm going to do one of two possible

255
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:34,930
things okay I'm either going to move one

256
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,839
pixel sideways or I'm going to move one

257
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:40,599
pixel down and no matter what kind of

258
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,500
line I'm drawing I could always phrase

259
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,200
it in these terms because no line ever

260
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,870
goes both down and up and no lie either

261
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,930
goes both right and left so no matter

262
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,839
where the line goes I could always start

263
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:57,789
with just a little bit of preamble and

264
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,070
know that in my while loop I will always

265
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:02,740
be choosing between one of two possible

266
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,870
motions either a sideways motion whether

267
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,850
it's left or right but

268
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,690
always be one of those for that for that

269
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,759
given line or up or down and so the

270
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:19,020
present look the key thing to present

271
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:24,028
ham is to turn line drawing right into a

272
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:26,278
choice a binary decision basically it's

273
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:28,259
to say instead of thinking about what

274
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,320
pixel I need to go to next and trying to

275
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,809
calculate that pixel let's acknowledge

276
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,690
the fact that I know the only two

277
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:38,959
possible pixels it could be and let me

278
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:43,410
figure out how to choose between them

279
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,570
right so that is how a breath and hand

280
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:49,669
rolling algorithm works what it does is

281
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:53,220
it says while you know i'm not at p1

282
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:55,289
right I say let you know it's the wrong

283
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:00,420
direction I say like you know start at

284
00:11:55,289 --> 00:12:03,929
p0 while I'm not at p1 ok I'm going to

285
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,219
fill the pixel I'm on right Phil p or

286
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,099
actually I should probably do this the

287
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,990
other way should probably this is a do

288
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,250
loop because I always want to fill even

289
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,629
if it's a zero-length line I'd probably

290
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,100
want to fill it depends on what your

291
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:16,019
fill rule is whether you're going to

292
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,409
fill p1 or not let's say we're always

293
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:24,720
going to fill both ends ok so we'll say

294
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:26,250
p equals p 0 will say do fill p right so

295
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,450
that's just puts a pic you know fills

296
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,870
the pixel with the color or whatever

297
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,730
whatever that has to do and then we

298
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,320
basically make a decision we say like

299
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:42,600
decide you know up or sorry we say

300
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:46,110
decide vertical or horizontal right and

301
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,800
then you know p equals you know new pity

302
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:53,278
or whatever then whatever that move is

303
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:55,109
okay and so the entirety of the loop the

304
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,509
entirety of the present and part is just

305
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,129
this part right here it's saying we're

306
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:02,659
going to decide whether to move

307
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:06,208
vertically or horizontally at each step

308
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:08,129
and you might say that the probably the

309
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:10,259
important part of present hams is just

310
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:12,509
that is literally the fact that it turns

311
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,309
into a decision problem do I move up or

312
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,529
down I just do one of the other right

313
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:17,759
and I maybe should i maybe should write

314
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,730
this a little more clearly let

315
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:29,659
say I read it like this right it's more

316
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:34,920
like if you know horizontal is better

317
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:37,289
than my PX you know plus equals Delta X

318
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,849
right so whether I'm going forwards or

319
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:43,709
backwards this will either be a positive

320
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,779
1 or negative 1 otherwise then we assume

321
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:51,210
that vertical was better and we move

322
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:52,559
vertically right so that's basically the

323
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,030
entire thing we're going to we're going

324
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,349
to talk about for a present and I

325
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:57,959
enjoyed routine we're going to fill a

326
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,090
pixel we're gonna say if we should move

327
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,980
horizontally move for a Zaun tily if we

328
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,629
shoot more vertically or or if sorry

329
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,889
should say otherwise the only other

330
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:07,350
choice is we've replaced so move

331
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,939
vertically and then before we do

332
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,560
anything else you know up here we could

333
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,250
pre initialize this to saying you know

334
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:16,439
is DX positive or negative right is is

335
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,690
dy positive or negative and that would

336
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,570
just be a check it would just be which

337
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,250
direction does this thing go so for

338
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,570
example if we want to do this really

339
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,340
trivial you could just say whatever the

340
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:33,060
sign is of p 1 minus p 0 right is is the

341
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:37,129
Delta for either one so the DX would be

342
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:37,129
that way and dy would also be that way

343
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:45,209
right so you can imagine saying okay i'm

344
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,860
going to subtract these i'm going to get

345
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,930
the vector right so here's my p 1 here's

346
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,450
my p0 i'm gonna get the vector whatever

347
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:53,250
the sign is of the y component that's

348
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,320
the direction I will move the Y and

349
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,080
whatever the sign is of the X but that's

350
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,120
the direction I will move the X make

351
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,360
sense right so it's literally just

352
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,549
saying hey at before i start figure out

353
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,080
whether this is an up line or a downline

354
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,609
and figure out whether this is a left

355
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,800
right or left line or a right line

356
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,990
that's it and then from then on the loop

357
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,519
is the same right I just either it i'm

358
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,659
either like incrementing to the left or

359
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,909
incremental to the right or whatever

360
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:22,439
right so that's it that's the entirety

361
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:25,649
of the present game loop so the question

362
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,320
is just how do we compute this how do we

363
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:31,389
know whether a horizontal movement or a

364
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,420
vertical movement is better

365
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:36,850
like which one is it and that's why I

366
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:39,939
use the term error based drawing before

367
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,980
remember I said I use this term I sort

368
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,840
of described it i said error based well

369
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,370
the other sort of interesting part of

370
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,370
resin has besides that turning into a

371
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:51,970
decision problem is the cleverness of

372
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:54,669
how you determine this and the reason I

373
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,790
say that is because well it's a kind of

374
00:15:54,669 --> 00:16:00,370
clever idea it's sort of second nature

375
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:02,049
today because we've sort of had such a

376
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:06,009
long time of thinking about problems in

377
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:07,779
this way but if you think about it and

378
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,480
we if we want to decide whether this or

379
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,559
this would be a better choice if I'm

380
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,720
here do I move here or do I move here

381
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:20,949
well all we really have to do is say

382
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,110
what is the the error at this pixel

383
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:26,950
center what's the what's the distance

384
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:30,460
from the actual line right how far away

385
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:33,070
would I be from the line here okay

386
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,190
versus how far away from the line would

387
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:39,370
I be here right like which one of these

388
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,530
more closely approximates of the line

389
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,690
and as you can kind of see even just

390
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:45,429
from this drawing since this is this is

391
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,930
obviously the better move this is a

392
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:52,299
closer point to the line than this is

393
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:54,849
and so what these routines essentially

394
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:58,870
do is they say let me compute an error

395
00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:07,900
term which tells me which movement would

396
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:10,119
have actually been better okay now in a

397
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,690
modern context the way that we would

398
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,679
probably want to do this right is

399
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,680
because we might want this to be

400
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,509
completely paralyzed and not have any

401
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,120
dependencies on previous iterations of

402
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:24,299
the loop or who knows what else you can

403
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,039
imagine us computing this whole thing

404
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,839
from whole cloth every time so we might

405
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,659
say oh we have the equation of the line

406
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:34,990
we know what this point is so let's just

407
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:37,240
do that entire thing right and we can do

408
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,120
that right so if this is a prospective

409
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,599
point right this is like one point we

410
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,479
might be considering let's see what what

411
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,759
I might call

412
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,079
what do I want to call that let's call

413
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:53,900
that I don't know let's call this a and

414
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:58,490
B so I have two choices right I have my

415
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:01,940
a choice and my B choice alright so what

416
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:04,819
I know here is I essentially know that

417
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:09,769
I've got this this you know I've got

418
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:13,039
this this line and I have to figure out

419
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:14,960
some way of computing this this sort of

420
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,589
separation right I want to know what

421
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,259
this thing is and similarly I want to

422
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:24,048
know what this thing is well you know

423
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:26,150
like i said modern days we could do this

424
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:28,190
pre simply in fact just looking at the

425
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,809
diagram this is not something I've ever

426
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,279
actually thought about before I think

427
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,480
the last time I implemented in present

428
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,389
hams line drawing routine I was like

429
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,829
reading a present hams thing and just

430
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,690
did what it said to do it was like oh

431
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:40,039
yeah that makes sense but just looking

432
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,019
at the diagram I can tell you right now

433
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:44,149
we could solve this ourselves right we

434
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:46,190
don't eat you know put setting aside the

435
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,900
more clever way that the resident hand

436
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,298
stuff works just looking at this by

437
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:54,290
itself I can sort of see well okay if i

438
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:55,879
took p 1 minus p 0 right then if they're

439
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:57,048
on top of each other then i only have

440
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,790
one pixel to fill and I don't need to

441
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:00,889
draw a line anyway but if they aren't

442
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:03,168
then what that's going to give me is

443
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,910
that's going to give me some you know

444
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,530
some line vector here right that's going

445
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,580
to give me a V that's basically the

446
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:12,259
vector that goes from p0 to p1 okay and

447
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:13,490
if i were to normalize that remember

448
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,839
we've talked about all of this on hammer

449
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,069
hero we know how to normalize right we

450
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:18,709
divide a vector by its length we

451
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:20,750
normalize it right so if i were to get

452
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,269
some kind of a normalized vector here by

453
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,808
saying ok take p and divide it by its

454
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:28,789
length right I would have a vector of

455
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:32,569
unit length that points along the line

456
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:36,409
and now if I want to know which of these

457
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:38,359
two is closer to the line right well I

458
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,610
don't know if you guys remember again

459
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:41,869
I'm hoping everyone just has like all of

460
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:44,298
that handmade here and it's in their

461
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:49,279
brain right now how do we figure out

462
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:50,839
this distance right how do I figure out

463
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:55,119
that distance quickly if I have an A or

464
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:57,949
a B well remember this guy right here

465
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,028
right triangle right that's a right

466
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,490
angle right there that's perpendicular

467
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:08,480
that distance right so if I'm looking at

468
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:13,120
this and I've got this guy out here I've

469
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,788
got this guy here how would I take and

470
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:18,739
find this distance well remember our

471
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:21,138
friend the dot product remember this

472
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:26,569
remember all this stuff we talked about

473
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:29,509
this guy so the inner product or dot

474
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,980
product which we spent a bunch of time

475
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:32,629
talking about in handmade heroic is very

476
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,230
very valuable extremely important

477
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:38,899
function the dot product if this is a

478
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,278
unit vector which we know we have we

479
00:20:38,898 --> 00:20:44,689
have a unit vector that points along

480
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:48,109
there right then we know that if we dot

481
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,028
the vector to a right if we dot the

482
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:54,219
vector from p0 to a which is just a

483
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:58,970
minus p0 if we were to dot that with v1

484
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:01,339
what would we get right what we would

485
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:05,720
get from that well we would get whatever

486
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:11,449
the length of a is right and we would

487
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:13,759
get that x cosine theta right so this

488
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:23,090
this right here this cosine theta term

489
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:24,379
would be would be this right I'm not my

490
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:27,980
brains a little addled right now for

491
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,159
some reason let me try saying that one

492
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,159
more time

493
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:37,170
because we are multiplying by the cosine

494
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,630
of theta right and because this is the

495
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,700
hypotenuse right this is this is the

496
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,210
length of a right here if we want to

497
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,130
know this this part we are getting it

498
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,319
for free because we're getting the

499
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,720
length of a time's the cosine of theta

500
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:56,039
which is the proportionality to this so

501
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,870
this term is literally this length we

502
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:01,740
are getting the length of that of that

503
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:05,069
side right because again sine theta

504
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:08,519
times the hypotenuse is this side right

505
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:11,069
and cosine theta times the hypothenuse

506
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:13,680
hypotenuse is this side right just basic

507
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:16,019
trig and we're getting that from the dot

508
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,009
product already so literally just the

509
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:24,900
dot product alone tells us this so

510
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:26,879
without any actual state at all we can

511
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:32,400
literally just take our dot product a

512
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:36,600
minus p0 TV one and we can just compare

513
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:44,160
this we can say if that is less than B

514
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:46,289
minus p0 TV one right whichever one of

515
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:50,820
these is less is the one that's closer

516
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:54,149
to the line and we should pick it make

517
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:56,460
sense hopefully that makes some sense so

518
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,750
what I'm basically saying is hey just

519
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,400
stop product this this vector here right

520
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,200
dot product this vector with the unit

521
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,790
vector dot product this vector with the

522
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,069
unit vector and we get these two lengths

523
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,529
we compare the two and whichever one was

524
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:12,569
the shorter that's where we go and then

525
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:14,639
we repeat the algorithm from there right

526
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:16,259
and whichever one you know just keep

527
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,570
going whichever one is closer whichever

528
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:21,029
one's closer whichever one's closer

529
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:22,200
that's it and that is basically a

530
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,660
present man's line drawing routine

531
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,809
that's exactly what that is now this is

532
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,550
not the actual construction they use if

533
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:31,919
I remember correctly because again

534
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:35,099
saying something like normalizing the

535
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,050
vector is not something you ever would

536
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,119
have wanted to do and the reason for

537
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:42,480
that is because it requires floating

538
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,979
point math right so while we actually in

539
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,429
fact what I just wrote down might be

540
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,899
better

541
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,059
than the present an algorithm for today

542
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:49,528
for all I know because it involves

543
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,778
floating-point math and 20-point math is

544
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:54,659
faster and this requires no state so who

545
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:57,450
knows I don't know but if you put on

546
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,999
your hat of i only have integer

547
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,580
operations there is no floating point so

548
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:03,990
i need something cleverer here than that

549
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:05,849
i need something that's not going to

550
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,200
just do the mathematical construction i

551
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:11,009
got to start thinking in terms of

552
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,100
integers right then you get more what

553
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:21,118
brezin ham actually did if that makes

554
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:24,719
sense which to be completely honest I

555
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:27,928
don't even remember four lines what it

556
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:32,788
actually is I remember four circles what

557
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:34,350
it is because it's just an implicit line

558
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:36,210
evaluate it's an implicit function

559
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,788
evaluation I'm trying to remember if

560
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,829
that's what it is for lines as well so

561
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:42,898
let me think about that so if it was

562
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:47,368
going to be an implicit evaluation for a

563
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:53,038
line then you're going to get something

564
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:58,138
like uh it would have to be sort of a

565
00:24:53,038 --> 00:25:02,970
cross product would it hmm what would be

566
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:08,778
the I don't actually know I really

567
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:08,778
couldn't tell you I guess so so maybe

568
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,249
yeah to be honest I really don't

569
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,690
remember I'll show you the one for

570
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:17,368
circles and then we'll look up the one

571
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:24,149
for lions cuz I don't remember how they

572
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:29,249
did it it's how did they do it this is

573
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:30,178
the way my brain just did it and I feel

574
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:32,220
like that's me because I'm a

575
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,929
floating-point math guy and so sometimes

576
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,079
I have a hard time looking at something

577
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:39,690
when I like when I know how I would

578
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,308
solve it and then I'm like no wait but

579
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,440
that's not the solution they used I

580
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:45,569
don't remember i'll show you the circle

581
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,460
one that i do remember and then we can

582
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:51,240
look up the line one it's very simple

583
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,308
it's just like how did they do it I just

584
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,700
don't remember I think it's basically

585
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:58,829
like they precompute the

586
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:04,019
they pre compute the slope and see which

587
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:05,909
one is closer because ok I will simply

588
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:07,139
say that the way they do it has

589
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,570
something to do with the fact that you

590
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,190
record an error term that you keep

591
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:13,950
throughout the loop so you don't

592
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,330
evaluate the pixels in a vacuum every

593
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,580
time you step in a direction you

594
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:20,009
accumulate the error term if I remember

595
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:21,689
correctly and so that avoids the

596
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:22,980
floating-point math pneus of it because

597
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,370
they just have an accumulator so they

598
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:30,029
don't have to worry about that part if I

599
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:32,369
remember correctly yeah I'm pretty sure

600
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:33,869
so let me just go ahead and show you the

601
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:36,059
circle one first because that's when I

602
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:37,109
actually do remember and then we'll come

603
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,970
back to the line one in a second

604
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:40,379
hopefully everyone understands this like

605
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,569
I said it's pretty straightforward if

606
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,790
you remember the dot product you can

607
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:47,189
pretty quickly come up with a very easy

608
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:50,519
way of determining which one would be

609
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:52,230
closer and stepping to that one but that

610
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,150
is just not how brezin have did it

611
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:57,809
because even though this is incredibly

612
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:00,269
simple calculation I it wouldn't have

613
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:02,309
been simple for them at the time this

614
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:06,240
would have been very expensive at the

615
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:14,149
time all right so superior I draw a

616
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:16,500
circle right same constraints apply and

617
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,580
maybe when I'm doing this because I

618
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,410
happen to remember how this is all

619
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:20,909
remember enough about the line that I

620
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,529
can go back and remember how they did

621
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,019
their line one but I don't know probably

622
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:28,529
not all right so let's say I've got a

623
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:30,210
center and I've got a radius well again

624
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:33,149
just like the line case it's trivial for

625
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,009
me to figure out a point that would

626
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,730
start things out right if this is the

627
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:40,109
center and this were the radius right so

628
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,509
like I centers here wow that's really

629
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:45,359
bad I centers here and my radius is like

630
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:46,799
one two three or whatever right then I

631
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,779
know that this is a pixel that's on the

632
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:52,319
circle so I know I know that that's not

633
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:54,180
hard so now that I've already told you

634
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,879
how bressingham style things work you

635
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,620
know what we're going to do and that is

636
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,690
we're going to turn this drawing problem

637
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:03,779
into just a decision problem of from any

638
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:06,360
pixel which direction do i go right and

639
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,859
so from here I've got two choices i

640
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,879
could go cure or I could go here and the

641
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:13,109
question is which one do i pick okay

642
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,150
so this one's pretty straightforward

643
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:17,009
because the circle already has a

644
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,590
parameterization that you know is

645
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:20,910
perfect for what we're going to do which

646
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:21,809
makes me think again like if I just go

647
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,160
back and look at the line when I can

648
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,299
probably just come up with the way the

649
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,980
parameterization of the line works

650
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:27,180
probably you would just use y equals

651
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,299
that my sweet you know what that's

652
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,980
probably what they did now that i think

653
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:35,039
about it probably what they did is they

654
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,599
probably used y equals MX plus B and you

655
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,430
had a special case the drawing of a

656
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:40,349
vertical line which I in my head was

657
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,250
avoiding using y x equals that's because

658
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:46,589
I'm like well then you could draw over

659
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:48,029
line I bet they couldn't see they're

660
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:51,569
here to there we'll go back there in one

661
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:52,740
moment and we'll see okay so you know

662
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:54,359
one point that's not a circle so you

663
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,250
know you can start there so the question

664
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:59,579
is which direction do you go you go to a

665
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,259
or do you go to be well we know the

666
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:03,589
equation for a circle the equation for

667
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:09,720
the circle is x squared plus y squared

668
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:13,259
minus R squared equals 0 right very very

669
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,809
straightforward nothing weird about this

670
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:17,220
at all now that assumes that the circle

671
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:19,019
is centered around the origin which we

672
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,240
could trivially do but you know if we

673
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:24,960
wanted to make a fancy right we can just

674
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:29,210
say X minus Center X right I should

675
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:33,420
probably do p x minus center x squared

676
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:37,200
plus py- sentir y squared minus R

677
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,759
squared equals 0 okay very very simple

678
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,930
so now we have the center we can say

679
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,519
where the center is we can say what the

680
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,210
radius is there's our circle equation

681
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:48,269
well what we know is this is actually an

682
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,680
implicit why why drawing tablet I got a

683
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:51,389
disabled that there's like it's got this

684
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,890
little weird thing I can like it's like

685
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,020
a scratches like a record scratch pad

686
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,850
protector which are way too real right

687
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:59,009
it's like I don't want that I don't want

688
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:00,990
to be at the club right this is not

689
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:03,450
dance time this is not a rave I did not

690
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,799
drop X we need to just like not have

691
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:10,529
that happen anyway point being this

692
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,779
equation is the implicit equation for a

693
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:16,799
circle and we talked about implicit

694
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:18,839
equations right oops implicit equations

695
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,059
versus explicit equations earlier in

696
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,669
handmade hero so again you might have

697
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,579
put on your rewind cap but an X listen

698
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:29,039
equation is an equation like our classic

699
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:32,970
interpolation one or whatever it's it's

700
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:36,779
one of the form you know p equals one

701
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,430
minus T p0 plus tp1 remember I've said

702
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,839
this many many times I said it was my

703
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,070
desert island equation even if I could

704
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,799
only have one equation i take this one

705
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:46,379
right this is an example of explicit

706
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,559
equation i say a tea that I want to put

707
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,200
in right I say I've got to put in a tea

708
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,559
and then I get out a particular point on

709
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,630
a line okay it's literally like an

710
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,149
equation that I put in a value between 0

711
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:02,310
and 1 and I get out points on my line

712
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,410
line segment if I put on points above

713
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:06,179
one I go off the law I continue the line

714
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,620
pass the end of the line segment if I

715
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,930
put in negative 1 right that's the

716
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:14,549
example of an explicit equation for a

717
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:17,190
line similarly would be in the case of a

718
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:20,099
circle right if I wanted to say that

719
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,600
i've got a P of T for my circle and

720
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,859
probably we might say theta because

721
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,480
right we'd probably / impress as an

722
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:26,669
angle but you could imagine it being a

723
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,890
tea as well I put in a tea what's the

724
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:31,410
equation for a circle well I know what

725
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,509
that is to write that equation is just

726
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,509
going to be you know my radius times

727
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:42,420
cosine T right if I want t to go between

728
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:49,440
zero and one it would be it would be a 2

729
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:51,539
pi t right right but i can i can write

730
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,250
an explicit equation for a circle as

731
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,109
well and this is one where i put in a

732
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,460
value between 0 and 1 let's say and by

733
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,509
the way explicit has nothing do is zero

734
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,250
and one that's just how we tend to do

735
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:00,869
things in math obviously so it could be

736
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,579
anything we could have said theta and

737
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:06,629
had it range from 0 to 2pi whatever

738
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:08,549
doesn't matter point being I can draw a

739
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,080
circle by saying I'm going to give you a

740
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:11,369
series of T values and you're going to

741
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,389
give me back points on a circle right

742
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:17,579
this is explicit but this is not

743
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,710
explicit there is no single parameter

744
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:22,529
that I put in and I get out points on

745
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,440
the circle in fact from this equation I

746
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:29,009
have no idea where the circle even is

747
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:31,230
okay it's implicit the circle is and the

748
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:33,599
way that I find it is by testing points

749
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,329
and this equation tells me how far from

750
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,819
the circle they are when it equals

751
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:41,099
as the equation demands the point is on

752
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:44,339
the circle when it is greater than zero

753
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:46,168
or less than zero it is on or I'm sorry

754
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,509
is off the circle in one or two

755
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:52,559
directions either inside it or outside

756
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:54,839
it right and hopefully what you can see

757
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,778
is that an implicit parameterization of

758
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:59,519
a circle is very helpful for doing

759
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:01,890
something like a president if I have two

760
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,450
candidate points and I want to know

761
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,399
which one to pick well I don't have a

762
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:07,230
problem anymore I just use the implicit

763
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,449
equation for the circle I evaluate each

764
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:11,700
point and whichever one comes back with

765
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:14,460
a lower absolute value is closer to the

766
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,819
circle this is effectively a distance

767
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:24,360
function that tells me how far I am from

768
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:26,428
the circle very very handy right and so

769
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,469
that is all we would have to do now you

770
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:30,600
may ask you already have a function an

771
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,730
explicit function that tells you points

772
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,918
in the circle why do you care about this

773
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,389
why would you ever have done this well

774
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,100
think about it there's a number of

775
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:41,069
problems with this explicit version if

776
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:43,469
I'm trying to draw pixels right first of

777
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:46,259
all I don't know how far in T to advance

778
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:49,829
to get to the next pixel if I implement

779
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:52,619
in chromatic salai go way around the

780
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:54,960
circle and so I have no idea how much to

781
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:57,058
step by to feel individual pixels so if

782
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,190
my goal is to fill a bunch of pixels

783
00:33:57,058 --> 00:34:01,019
this doesn't help me hardly at all this

784
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,610
only helps me if I knew I wanted to draw

785
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,829
a circle with a certain number of

786
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:07,288
segments like if I was creating lines

787
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:09,179
around the circle like maybe drawing it

788
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:10,769
by passing it to a graphics card to draw

789
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,750
as line segments or something like this

790
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:14,369
well yeah then i could say i want to

791
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,250
draw it with three two segments so I

792
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:18,659
step T by 1 30 second every time and

793
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,869
those are my points around the circle

794
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,159
works great right good for you

795
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:25,200
congratulations explicit function does

796
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,389
not help me in this choice situation at

797
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,069
all because I want to go exactly 1 pixel

798
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:31,349
well I know how far one pixel is I just

799
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:35,010
don't know which one of those pixels is

800
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:36,570
on the circle but now I do implicit

801
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,899
function that's all I need to do so

802
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:44,690
literally I will plug in as the p I will

803
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:50,139
do you know ax minus CX squared plus

804
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:52,510
coops plus a plus a y minus C why

805
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:56,049
squared minus R squared and I will just

806
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,610
say if the absolute value because i want

807
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,780
the total distance right i don't care if

808
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,630
it's inside or outside the circle

809
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:10,630
preferentially whichever one of these

810
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:13,240
two guys is going to be less that's the

811
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,340
one I pick and I can just keep doing

812
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:24,279
that to like it all the way around my

813
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:27,100
circle right pretty easy with that in

814
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,320
mind I'd also point out there's actually

815
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,759
a ton of other things you do here so if

816
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,039
you're actually doing brezin hands on a

817
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,380
circle some other things you do is you

818
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,139
say well hey guess what a circle is

819
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:44,200
symmetric so every time you plot x comma

820
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:46,389
y also plot y comma X right to think

821
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,329
about it so r example i'm going to plot

822
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:51,129
this I always plot that right and if I'm

823
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:54,099
going to plot this I always flop that

824
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:56,890
but hey guess what anytime you plot x

825
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:59,409
comma y you also plot negative x comma y

826
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:02,319
right because I'm going to plot this I

827
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:04,149
definitely plot that similarly anytime

828
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,200
i'm going to plat x comma y i also plot

829
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:10,240
x comma negative y right so you keep

830
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:13,000
doing all these you do you can do all

831
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:16,750
the different symmetries and you can

832
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,190
draw your circle extremely quickly by

833
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,849
taking advantage of the fact that it's

834
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,679
literally n way symmetric right so all

835
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:25,539
you actually have to do is just draw

836
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:31,539
these three pixels and then you do like

837
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:33,550
x y y x- y x- x y blah blah blah right

838
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:36,489
so you draw all eight quadrants at once

839
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:38,200
by just starting here going to there and

840
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:40,259
that's it you don't as soon as you cross

841
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,460
into the next quadrant you're done

842
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,690
that's neither here nor there and

843
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,920
probably not anything anyone needs to

844
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,179
know any more about point being when you

845
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,860
actually did present ham circle drawing

846
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:49,179
in the old days since computing the new

847
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,620
points with the expensive part and

848
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:52,089
there's no such thing as like cash

849
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:53,769
locality for the frame buffer any of

850
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,360
these other things what you always did

851
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:57,099
is you computed the point and you drew

852
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,370
all 8 quad that's at the same time so

853
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:01,170
you only had to compute 18 of the points

854
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:03,639
obviously a big time saver

855
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:07,030
congratulations yet bv geograph

856
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:09,279
it's all fun all right so let's go back

857
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,430
here and let's assume that what they did

858
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,710
was use y equals MX plus B something I

859
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:17,469
would never use today because obviously

860
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:22,269
it can't handle vertical lines but what

861
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:24,939
you gonna do okay the bonus of y equals

862
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:29,769
MX plus B obviously is that it is an

863
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:33,820
implicit equation for the line if we

864
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:35,949
want to be right because we can

865
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,140
basically transform this equation that

866
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:40,449
into one that looks exactly like our

867
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:43,299
circle equation right what we can do is

868
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:47,559
say the equation for our line is you

869
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,850
know MX plus B minus y equals zero right

870
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:50,469
we just take this and we move it over

871
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,960
the other side looks exactly like a

872
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:54,549
circle equation right exactly like when

873
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,000
in fact let me write it even closer to

874
00:37:54,550 --> 00:38:05,230
the circle equation MX minus y plus B

875
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:08,139
equals zero make sense so if we just do

876
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,670
that well now we can evaluate those

877
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:11,619
points on the line pretty trivially

878
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,650
right all we do is exactly what we did

879
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:17,259
for the circle we plug in x and y for

880
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,059
you know our test pixel a we plug in the

881
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,260
x and y for Texas will be and we see

882
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:25,659
which one of them is closer to zero

883
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:29,500
that's it right same exact thing no

884
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:32,289
problem I'm assuming that's what brezin

885
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,369
ham did don't remember I'm assuming

886
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,869
that's what he did and i'm assuming

887
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:37,420
furthermore that what they did is they

888
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,769
basically special case lyon such that

889
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,920
for example one thing you could do is

890
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:44,199
this equation for a line can exchange x

891
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,300
and y right I couldn't say say that the

892
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:51,129
I could instead say that the equation

893
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:53,700
for my line was I was not y equals MX

894
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,140
plus B but something else entirely right

895
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:59,500
which should not have that that problem

896
00:38:56,139 --> 00:39:01,690
of the M on the X I could say instead

897
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:08,559
well in fact I could say something like

898
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:12,340
I have MX minus y plus B equals 0 or X

899
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:15,279
minus my plus B equals 0 right and all

900
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:17,619
I'd have to do is just flip which one

901
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,119
you know which

902
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:21,068
which one I was using I could even

903
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,170
include another multiplier in there if I

904
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:25,210
wanted to so I could basically write my

905
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,028
line drawing routine twice which again

906
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,099
was very common back then 14 lines that

907
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:32,349
are vertical ish and ones for ones that

908
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:33,970
are horizontal ish pick which one of

909
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:36,700
them they were based on the initial

910
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:38,439
points that i got and then just use

911
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:40,389
whichever equation this would be

912
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,528
slope-intercept form for the y axis this

913
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:43,150
would be for the slope-intercept form

914
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:45,369
for the x axis right or I should say

915
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,220
about the other way around this is slope

916
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:50,230
intercept form where B is wearing a sex

917
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,629
the y-axis this is slope intercept form

918
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:55,389
where it intersects the x-axis right

919
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:57,369
because every line has to intersect one

920
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:59,818
or the other you can't have a line which

921
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:04,660
intersects neither the xnor the y-axis

922
00:39:59,818 --> 00:40:06,940
right it's not a line in that case so

923
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:11,498
that's probably exactly what present ham

924
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:13,920
did I'm guessing let's let's see let's

925
00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:13,919
see if I'm right

926
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:35,369
let's find out okay Hey look look

927
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:39,269
familiar yeah that's exactly what they

928
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:41,039
did so they just yep they just do y

929
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:43,650
equals MX plus B you can see this right

930
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,900
here there's your why there's your be

931
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:48,030
right and they just chose to make the

932
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,950
y-axis coincide with the the first point

933
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,810
makes perfect sense right and then

934
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:59,219
here's that slope change in Y over

935
00:40:51,809 --> 00:41:00,420
change in X right yep there you go so I

936
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,939
guess it didn't fall completely out of

937
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:07,829
my brain up in fact there's the actual

938
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:10,050
line equation right there uh so yeah now

939
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:12,059
I don't know if this gets into it and

940
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:15,119
we're out of time so I'm not going to

941
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:20,699
get into it but I will simply point out

942
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:24,720
some additional things about this that I

943
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:27,299
remember hopefully you know what I

944
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:34,009
should probably check the chat do you

945
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:37,530
guys uh did you guys did that make sense

946
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:39,570
to the people who actually were asking

947
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,840
about brezin ham wanted to know how it

948
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,519
worked did that all make sense like is

949
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,930
that did that get you where you need to

950
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,179
be in a headspace so that you can go

951
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:51,169
read about it on your own or implement

952
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:51,169
it on your own

953
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:17,110
elvin I remember reading that brezin ham

954
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:18,969
works for the first octant and they had

955
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,130
two cases to handle slope greater than

956
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:23,919
equal to 1 and slope less than one will

957
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:26,890
this DX equals sine X 1 minus X ur

958
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,409
address both of these concerns um so the

959
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:36,039
way that I said to do it would work in

960
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:38,529
all orientations this this not really

961
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:41,079
brezin hams thing that I constructed

962
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,580
this guy where you do the dot products I

963
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,819
think that one will just work always

964
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:48,190
because that's totally generic and does

965
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,110
that's a implicit function for the

966
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:56,550
distance from a line that does not

967
00:42:50,110 --> 00:43:01,240
actually involve any directionality in

968
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:02,920
fact you could you could even get rid of

969
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,779
if you didn't care about the performance

970
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,180
at all or weren't thinking about that so

971
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,100
much this sign part you wouldn't even

972
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:11,469
have to care about that sign part what

973
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:13,989
you could actually do instead is test

974
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:20,379
all four points every time through the

975
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:23,739
loop right if you wanted to I mean yeah

976
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:26,230
I it doesn't but you know I think you

977
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:27,939
would rather do like what i said is do

978
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,530
the sign here and yes that addresses all

979
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,789
them because that it doesn't matter what

980
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:32,170
direction the line is going once you got

981
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:36,369
those signs in there you're done you're

982
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:39,780
good to go but this is not like i said

983
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:39,779
this is not traditional present hams

984
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:54,809
and no we don't ever drew line drawing

985
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:57,569
on handmade here really I mean if we may

986
00:43:54,809 --> 00:44:04,078
be weak I don't know we we don't even

987
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:05,849
ask the GPU to draw it but Alvin I'm

988
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,380
still not a hundred sure president how

989
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:08,760
President figured out if horizontal is

990
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,050
better you mentioned they use the line

991
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,880
equation how does that help them in

992
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:14,190
knowing if horizontals better because

993
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,880
it's the it's it's just you test both

994
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:20,550
points right so let's say I've got I'm

995
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:26,838
here right this is P and this is a and

996
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:31,109
this is B so here's my pixel grid right

997
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:34,559
so if I want to know which of these is

998
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:36,480
better a or b I just need an equation

999
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,539
that gives me back a distance from a

1000
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:46,139
line and y equals MX plus B is exactly

1001
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:50,909
that equation right so 0 equals MX minus

1002
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:52,949
y plus B okay the further away you are

1003
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:55,078
from the line the higher the actual

1004
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:56,789
evaluation of this will be because if

1005
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:58,980
you're 0 you're on the line and anything

1006
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:01,139
higher or lower than 0 the absolute

1007
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,559
value of that is what tells you so all I

1008
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:06,809
need to do is plug both a and B into

1009
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,358
here and compare the results so what I

1010
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:14,940
would say is what's the absolute value

1011
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:21,059
right of ma X minus a y plus B right or

1012
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:27,079
I should say yeah plus B if that is less

1013
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:30,328
than m bx minus B Y and I guess beith

1014
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,280
having 2 b's is not good so let's call

1015
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:38,190
this let's not call this B let's call

1016
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:40,650
this a and M D for some reason so there

1017
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:45,838
we go so that's magical pointy so let's

1018
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:48,269
say m DX minus dy plus B right so this

1019
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,078
is what tells you which is better and it

1020
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:50,608
has nothing to do with telling you

1021
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,619
horizontal or vertical is better it's

1022
00:45:50,608 --> 00:45:54,119
just a or b and i happen to call those

1023
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:55,140
horizontal cuz the horizontal movement

1024
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,338
and vertical because the vertical

1025
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:58,318
movement but you could have picked any

1026
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:59,639
two points in the world and this will

1027
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,889
still tell you which one is a better

1028
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:02,940
choice we're just

1029
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:04,109
opening to use it to figure out which

1030
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,420
direction to move and we know we only

1031
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,760
have two places we can go you know

1032
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,130
vertical or horizontal so you plug it

1033
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,470
into both and that equation for the line

1034
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,660
tells you which one is better and so if

1035
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:17,489
it's less than right then I want this

1036
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:19,170
one if it turned out to be greater than

1037
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:22,729
I would want this one I would want to go

1038
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,730
to be instead that make sense

1039
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:41,250
elvin there were multiple extensions

1040
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:42,839
observations done present him like

1041
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,849
drawing only half the line and mirroring

1042
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,350
it and run slicing by a brash and

1043
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:47,579
symmetric double step by whoo any

1044
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:49,139
thoughts on those yeah those were the

1045
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:50,610
things that I was about to say when I

1046
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,440
turned to the chat and said you have any

1047
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:56,010
questions that I was like before I go

1048
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,929
any further I was going to mention that

1049
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:00,480
one of the things that turns out to

1050
00:46:57,929 --> 00:47:03,359
happen really quickly that you notice

1051
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,000
when you draw a line is that it always

1052
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,640
does basically the same stuff as it

1053
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,159
moves so typically if you know if you

1054
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,500
have something where you're drawing the

1055
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:14,969
line what people noticed is like oh you

1056
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,409
know no matter what the line is it

1057
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:19,559
always ends up doing something like

1058
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:22,379
going to then going three then going to

1059
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,119
then going three or whatever right so

1060
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,550
why don't we just pre-compute whatever

1061
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:29,369
that is and then replicate that pattern

1062
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:30,539
right and similarly like you said there

1063
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:32,779
are other things where they were sort of

1064
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:35,400
figuring out like oh we could you know

1065
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,230
we could draw from the back in the front

1066
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,780
at the same time or blah blah blah so

1067
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:41,309
there's plenty of our stuff there's also

1068
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,530
anti-alias present hams which are ones

1069
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:46,650
that tell you to fill more pixels than

1070
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:48,030
just these and to give them darker or

1071
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:52,110
lighter weights depending on their

1072
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:55,410
distance so there's lots of surroundings

1073
00:47:52,110 --> 00:48:00,599
of brezin hands but they're all really

1074
00:47:55,409 --> 00:48:02,609
not that interesting they're not super

1075
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,489
interesting the more interesting part is

1076
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,390
just the implicit function part to me

1077
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:08,369
that's the part that's more relevant

1078
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:10,259
today because remember implicit

1079
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:12,900
functions is how we filled our triangles

1080
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,040
so that part is always true it's a day

1081
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,590
if you were going to draw a line you'd

1082
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:17,639
still use an implicit function

1083
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:19,710
formalization but you wouldn't care

1084
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:21,569
about all these other things like like

1085
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:26,760
the doublet slicing or the sort of those

1086
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:28,830
optimizations right pseudonym 73 little

1087
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,840
known fact brezin hams method predates

1088
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:32,460
frame buffers by about five years it was

1089
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,990
actually designed for a drum plotter

1090
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,730
that's insane but again like I said when

1091
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:40,109
you think about going that far back it

1092
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:42,659
makes sense why they did things these

1093
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:44,370
way because even when I was in high

1094
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:48,839
school this was the fastest way to draw

1095
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:50,819
a line right so like all the way from

1096
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,940
probably the 80s back

1097
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,680
you you didn't think about things in the

1098
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,619
same way that you think about them now

1099
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:01,250
when you're trying to draw stuff so

1100
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:01,250
that's just the way it is

1101
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:25,640
oh and for people who said like they

1102
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,680
feel like it should be deciding between

1103
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,509
move right and move diagonally right and

1104
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,460
down instead of either left or down as I

1105
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:35,420
presented it depends on what kind of

1106
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:42,199
line you're trying to draw so there's

1107
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:44,989
two ways you can do it right and one way

1108
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:47,478
is that you don't want to overfill so

1109
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:50,088
you're only going to do like a line that

1110
00:49:47,478 --> 00:49:52,969
looks like this let's say and you don't

1111
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:55,099
want to fill in this and if that's the

1112
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:59,028
case then yet you need to do whether you

1113
00:49:55,099 --> 00:50:01,009
move what you well my saves you always

1114
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:02,389
move in the primary direction and then

1115
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:05,599
you're just deciding whether you want to

1116
00:50:02,389 --> 00:50:07,759
move down but if you do want to fill

1117
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,559
this one in then you do what I was

1118
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:13,670
saying so it depends on which way you

1119
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:16,670
want to fill and there are brezin hams

1120
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:19,670
for both right because he because it

1121
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:21,019
again the concept doesn't change the

1122
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:23,420
concept of deciding which one to go to

1123
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:28,129
doesn't matter it's just whether or not

1124
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:32,200
you want to whether you want to include

1125
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,200
those or exclude them that makes sense

1126
00:50:53,108 --> 00:50:57,259
elvin can that method be used to draw

1127
00:50:55,579 --> 00:50:58,910
wireframe triangles or is there a faster

1128
00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:03,440
way to draw wireframe triangles like

1129
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:06,518
flat bottom flat top triggs again when

1130
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,250
you say faster what do you mean you know

1131
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:12,500
faster in 1985 no like President ham

1132
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,940
line drawing with optimizations with you

1133
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,739
know like operations like a brush

1134
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,778
straight or whatever nothing was faster

1135
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:19,459
than that nowadays yeah of course you're

1136
00:51:17,778 --> 00:51:21,559
never no one would ever draw them this

1137
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,659
way I don't think I mean maybe I'm wrong

1138
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:25,220
about that but you'd want to do simdi

1139
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:27,920
evaluation of a bunch of pixels at the

1140
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:29,509
same time so you would be doing more of

1141
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,858
an implicit rasterization which again is

1142
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:34,880
related to present hands but it's not

1143
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:38,298
the same expansion pack is this ever

1144
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:41,630
used for uniform grid pathfinding uh I

1145
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:43,130
don't know probably not I mean because

1146
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,960
it's a little bit limited it doesn't

1147
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:47,798
really find a path it just goes straight

1148
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,798
you know

1149
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:23,110
nixie for tomorrow given an entity with

1150
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:26,570
a position and a current velocity and

1151
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:28,820
maximum acceleration and a target

1152
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:32,420
position how do you determine the

1153
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:40,809
correct acceleration each frame so that

1154
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:45,920
you stop on the target point that's

1155
00:52:40,809 --> 00:52:52,880
probably pretty involved so basically

1156
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:56,180
that's like I mean you gotta basically

1157
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:01,730
you're basically solving a quadratic

1158
00:52:56,179 --> 00:53:09,259
right and I don't know that the

1159
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:10,699
direction I think I don't think there's

1160
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,680
that much I don't know that there's

1161
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:15,079
really any directionality to it because

1162
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:19,579
that they're separable right so I think

1163
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:22,340
you'd solve it in x and y the same so do

1164
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:24,559
you mean do you mean to say that your

1165
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,800
acceleration is constrained in some way

1166
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:34,730
because otherwise it's it's a 1d problem

1167
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:37,700
still right nixie would that be am I am

1168
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:39,079
I correct in in interpreting the problem

1169
00:53:37,699 --> 00:53:42,469
you're saving to say that it is

1170
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:46,940
separable and therefore the 1d solution

1171
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:49,719
applies to to all dimensions or are you

1172
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,720
asking a different question

1173
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:58,349
let's see pseudonym this is how I used

1174
00:53:56,789 --> 00:54:01,800
to derive brezin hams algorithm and

1175
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:04,250
there's a paste bid what's on the

1176
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,250
pastebin

1177
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:28,360
floating point later we will assume that

1178
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:29,650
X simplicity oh that's kind of neat well

1179
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,539
hopefully people will click on that

1180
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:40,950
should click on you should click on

1181
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:42,969
pseudonym 73 to paste bin let's see

1182
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:44,589
Elvin was the cast from float to int

1183
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:47,169
really expensive at the time versus

1184
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:49,800
nowadays Elvin you're asking the wrong

1185
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:55,360
question there was no floating point at

1186
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:56,980
all the processor didn't do it it had

1187
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,579
nothing to do with the cast there was

1188
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:02,619
literally no floating point operations

1189
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:05,369
very few processors had floating-point

1190
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:05,369
units in them

1191
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:20,379
let's see nixie acceleration is

1192
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,869
constrained to a maximum amount uh but

1193
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:28,539
again it doesn't matter right like that

1194
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:30,070
eat does that make sense like it's still

1195
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:31,420
separable whether it's constrained to a

1196
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:34,588
maximum oh you're talking about it's

1197
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:37,389
constrained to a maximum out in a

1198
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:40,989
combined not like I said an x and y oh I

1199
00:55:37,389 --> 00:55:47,500
see that's pretty tricky that sounds

1200
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:48,429
tricky to me wouldn't you agree look I

1201
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,900
feel like that's not something I'm going

1202
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:52,348
to drive on stream because I got to

1203
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,349
think about it

1204
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:08,619
long billion was this also used for

1205
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:10,179
bezier curves uh hmm I don't think so

1206
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:12,489
because busy acres don't have an

1207
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:19,539
implicit parameterization I don't think

1208
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:23,409
I mean that's not true I should probably

1209
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:26,250
say it'd be very complicated implicit

1210
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:26,250
parameterization

1211
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:39,788
so I think they usually tried to do

1212
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:42,068
stuff like figure like calculate how

1213
00:56:39,789 --> 00:56:43,869
much would move them to the next pixel

1214
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:51,849
as a step in T and actually did that I

1215
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:53,048
think but I don't know Kubica off topic

1216
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:54,490
but still on the topic of math during

1217
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:56,288
these RSI streams you think you could go

1218
00:56:54,489 --> 00:57:02,529
over the math for replacing see math

1219
00:56:56,289 --> 00:57:03,760
specifically the trig functions I'd

1220
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:07,869
probably rather do that when we actually

1221
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:09,039
replace them captain craft just opens

1222
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:15,010
you'll have this stuff implanted already

1223
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:16,210
what stuff it has line drawing elleven

1224
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:18,190
if you were to implement a line during

1225
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:24,608
function in handmade hear what algorithm

1226
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:28,210
would you go for I mean I'd probably do

1227
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:31,150
something that tried to fill four pixels

1228
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:36,639
at a time and evaluated them all filled

1229
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:39,010
them all at that time would be my guess

1230
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:44,739
so it would just be an implicit it would

1231
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:46,028
just be an implicit test probably it

1232
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:47,229
would probably be very much like the one

1233
00:57:46,028 --> 00:57:49,989
I described where you did the dot

1234
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:53,909
product and that if the dot product is

1235
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:53,909
less than 1 or whatever then you fill it

1236
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:20,750
alright think it is time to wrap things

1237
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:20,750
up it is time

1238
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:33,469
yeah hands feel good today hope that

1239
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:37,369
keeps up let's go ahead and close things

1240
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:39,259
down here all right everybody thanks for

1241
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:43,190
joining me for another episode of

1242
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:45,140
handmade hero chat addition I have been

1243
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,849
uploading these to youtube so you can't

1244
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:50,000
actually get them now if you want to

1245
00:58:46,849 --> 00:58:51,349
view the chats the the ones from last

1246
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,530
week in the ones for this week will be

1247
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:57,710
up there they're just under chat instead

1248
00:58:54,530 --> 00:59:00,490
of under day so if you want to check

1249
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:04,608
those out there in the video archive as

1250
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:07,788
for everything else if you want to hang

1251
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:10,989
out for another chat tomorrow you could

1252
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:14,270
go ahead and look at the tweet bot

1253
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:15,618
because the tweet pot tells you and it

1254
00:59:14,269 --> 00:59:18,108
will say what schedule is but I believe

1255
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:19,730
