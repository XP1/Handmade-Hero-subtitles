00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,949
stop recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,639
welcome to handmade hero the show where

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,309
we could a complete-game live on stream

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,919
yesterday we organized some stuff into a

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:16,320
hierarchy because we wanted to draw it

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:18,028
hierarchically and so today we're gonna

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:27,149
do exactly that we're gonna draw it

8
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:31,800
higher ARCA CLE H AI R a RC H Ali Lee

9
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:33,808
it's a very hard word to spell scholars

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,570
have been debating how to spell it for

11
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:37,729
generations and no one's really ever

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,869
figured it out

13
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:42,238
it's kind of like William Shakespeare

14
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,820
his last name there's debate there's

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,299
vigorous debate about how it was felled

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,079
and so the important part for us is that

17
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,038
we don't really have to learn how to

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,939
spell it we just have learn how to

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,550
implement and that's we're gonna do

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,198
today so if you or someone would like to

21
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:57,359
follow along with the programming today

22
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,039
is day 195 you will want to unpack day

23
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,878
194 source code that is what I'm

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,750
starting with today

25
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,688
right and here we go let's do this let's

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,450
get this going

27
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:15,239
let us get it going let us run it so

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,590
what we did was we sort of took all our

29
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,938
debug variables the ones who are coming

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,500
up in the radial menu and we wanted to

31
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:20,699
kind of put them over here so we

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,049
organized them and we did the work

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,368
yesterday to make it so that that would

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,570
be possible to do but we have not

35
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:26,519
actually done the thing that draws them

36
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,219
so what I'd like to do now is just do

37
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,810
exactly that I just like to go implement

38
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,090
it so I can see that on the little side

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,409
of the screen that is what I want to

40
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,368
have happen that is what I'm going to

41
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,719
make happen

42
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:42,599
and you honestly I really can't stop me

43
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:46,679
I'm doing it I'm just doing it so here

44
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,298
we go we have obviously a function that

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,540
already does this you can see it here

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,409
right and you can see here that I'm

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,649
iterating over the the variables right

48
00:01:54,409 --> 00:02:00,299
and what I don't necessarily know at

49
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,310
this point now that what I'm like

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,750
looking at this you know I don't really

51
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,030
necessarily want to cut and paste this

52
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,500
code because both you know when I look

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,598
at this I'm like this is looking kind of

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,209
complicated and so if I go and write

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,649
something that you know this is this is

56
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:19,080
the code that saves our variable

57
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,200
if I couldn't paste this now I've got

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,900
two copies of this you know it's not too

59
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,000
crazy but it's a little bit intricate

60
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,580
and it involves like an inorder walk of

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,840
the tree right and the thing that's a

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,599
little bit confusing to me it's like

63
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,830
okay you know maybe I could just pull

64
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,459
that out into an iterate or something

65
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:41,209
and use that you know so don't have to

66
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:45,299
do it once but the problem with that is

67
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,909
every little piece here where I might

68
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,790
have done something probably will do

69
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:53,129
something slightly different in the

70
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:59,280
actual hierarchy the the hierarchical

71
00:02:53,129 --> 00:03:00,719
printout so I feel like although I don't

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,840
really want to cut and paste it I'm

73
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,459
going to cut and paste it first right

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,459
the code that I actually want the way

75
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,140
that I want it and then I'm going to set

76
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,939
it again take that sort of compression

77
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,759
oriented approach where I say I'm going

78
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,769
to wait till I see both of them and then

79
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:18,629
when I see both of them I will then make

80
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,030
the call about whether they can be

81
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,680
condensed into a utility function or

82
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,000
whether I think it's better that they

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,159
are separate because they really sort of

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,650
represent two different things okay

85
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,079
so if I was to do that I guess I've got

86
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,150
your debug main menu it's right here in

87
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,439
fact so what I'll do is I'll just go

88
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,000
ahead and like I said we're doing

89
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,919
essentially the same thing here so I

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,919
should be able to just cut and paste

91
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,988
this in here and now write a thing that

92
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,700
actually displays the menu in our game

93
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,129
rather than writes it to a file which is

94
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:54,119
what we were doing with it before right

95
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:57,659
so I guess the the most straightforward

96
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,980
thing here again is to sort of just go

97
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:03,090
alright we don't really need to yeah I

98
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:09,539
guess we don't really need to do

99
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:14,069
anything too fancy we're just going to

100
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:16,978
print out some debug text so if I want

101
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:18,569
to I should be able to just use like you

102
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,238
know like this debug text out thing for

103
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,009
example to print whatever it is I'm

104
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,679
going to print out and presumably I

105
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:27,689
should be able to do something like this

106
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,610
where you know I have a little

107
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,288
that I use I just filled that buffer

108
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,729
with whatever the thing is that I want

109
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:34,769
to fill it with right so if it's a

110
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:38,490
boolean if it's a group or whatever I

111
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:41,189
can just print it out and so again I

112
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,990
want to use the same routine for

113
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:45,000
everything because like I said I want to

114
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,639
replace the dependency on the C runtime

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,560
library at some point perhaps even

116
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,090
relatively soon and so I want everything

117
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,478
to call through one function so I only

118
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,859
have to like replace one function I

119
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,449
don't have to write like 50 million

120
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,439
different like printf Saur other weird

121
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:05,660
things like this so yeah so if I'm going

122
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:09,769
to do that it looks something like this

123
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,680
and then what I want to do is I want to

124
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:16,829
just print out the name of the variable

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,288
like so so I would say here's the name

126
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:21,508
and then I guess based on the value I'll

127
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:23,908
either print true or false so if the

128
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,038
value is set to pop to some you know

129
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:27,418
thing that would be nonzero then I'll

130
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:28,649
print out true if it's if it said

131
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,258
something else I'll print out false

132
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:34,258
that's how I'll do my text then in here

133
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:38,158
I've got groups groups like are only the

134
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:41,908
name that's all they have and so again

135
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:46,319
I'll just print that out and you know

136
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:48,839
oops and so once I've got that it's

137
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,750
pretty trivial for me to say okay print

138
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,000
out whatever was in the buffer I know

139
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,668
I've got you know sort of color that I

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,139
want it to be and let's say so I can

141
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:59,579
keep that concept will just make it

142
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,400
white for now but you know we can change

143
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,899
something else later based on you know

144
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,769
what it is or what state it's in or

145
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,120
other fun things like that and then when

146
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:14,490
we come down through here and I do the

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:17,069
walk you know things happen right so the

148
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,259
the biggest change here is this

149
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:24,089
operation where I descend to the child

150
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:27,379
that is going to be dependent on whether

151
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:31,560
or not this group is collapsed I think

152
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,699
because if if we remember I want a

153
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,019
hierarchal list so I want to be able to

154
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,468
expand and collapse it like a tree view

155
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,468
or something like that

156
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,540
so I don't want this to happen if the

157
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,459
group is supposed to be collapsed I

158
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,050
guess I won't worry about that first

159
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,639
because I suppose would be a little bit

160
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,350
better first to make sure that we have

161
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,620
everything else working so we'll go

162
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,800
ahead and do that first and just get a

163
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,090
some stuff up on the screen but then I

164
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,180
think what I want to do is like go ahead

165
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:02,759
and handle that collapse tough alright

166
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,000
so now let's see let's start things off

167
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,500
by taking I think we have in here some

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,110
information about where things should go

169
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,209
right we've got left edge and this sort

170
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,000
of stuff right so if I want to

171
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:21,799
initialize things I've got that left

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,990
edge and that app why there it is

173
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:32,430
so I want something like this where I'm

174
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:39,210
going to do this sort of thing right

175
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:43,050
start here and I think we just need some

176
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:45,299
like that font info where is that guy

177
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:49,710
that font in for something that we have

178
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,810
cached if I remember correctly yeah in

179
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:54,599
fact now that we have the debug font

180
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,530
info cached this stuff this is this is

181
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,330
just something we should have collapsed

182
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:03,659
a long time ago that should have just

183
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:04,859
been that right yeah so anyway this will

184
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,210
start us at the top corner of the screen

185
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:12,540
so there we have our edx we know already

186
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:15,000
that this is the left edge and what we

187
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,560
should probably do as well is subtract

188
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,720
two times this because we have a line

189
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,879
there already although maybe we just

190
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,040
stopped printing that line it might be

191
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,639
the other way to go because we have like

192
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:31,590
a debug text at bank text fine for

193
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:34,189
compiling yeah so maybe what we do is we

194
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:37,288
do something a little fancier than that

195
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,180
so in here we would do like we'll just

196
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:40,799
always call our debug drop menu for

197
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,288
right now and maybe we'll let that

198
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,490
advance the app why so these things will

199
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:47,279
start at the bottom

200
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,740
so I'll just I'll actually just take the

201
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,909
debug States

202
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:54,909
at why we'll do that and then at the end

203
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,400
I'll set them equal because we probably

204
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:04,669
will get rid of that concept in it in a

205
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,409
bit here anyway all right so now I just

206
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:09,409
need to know where this text actually is

207
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:12,049
going to be and I don't know that I need

208
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:14,809
the text bounds necessarily for this

209
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:16,490
process because I think I want to start

210
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:17,869
at the corridor anyway because we're

211
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,060
starting at the left edge so that should

212
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,649
actually be fine for now so at the

213
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,779
moment I think we can just do something

214
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:25,579
where we say okay we have the text be

215
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:28,069
the text be is just the add X that why

216
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,250
there's nothing to it really we can just

217
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,020
go ahead and use that so if I do that I

218
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,600
can I'm not really sure like I just kind

219
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:38,059
of like hacking this out there oh right

220
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,970
and of course we will need to actually

221
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:44,229
advance after we do this we will need to

222
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:47,840
move the @ y forward by whatever that

223
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,120
that height the the like you know the

224
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:57,139
baseline to baseline height is of the

225
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:59,389
font right so at y plus equals should we

226
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:05,019
have another one of those somewhere key

227
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:08,569
bug text where are you keep up text up

228
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:13,370
so you can see it in here should I

229
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:16,190
should be able to advance it at Y right

230
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,840
there it is get line advance for like I

231
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,030
know we have it I just don't remember

232
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,860
what it was I'm too old to remember

233
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,490
stuff I only do for an hour a night it's

234
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:30,590
true long past the point where I'm too

235
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:32,419
old to remember those things so what I

236
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,430
want to do is after we print out every

237
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:37,299
single one of these right I want to go

238
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:43,339
ahead and move forwards by that much

239
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:45,409
and there we go and again we already

240
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:50,310
have font info so I don't need to read

241
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:52,259
get that just all there into

242
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:54,929
and so that should give me I think a

243
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,049
list of all the variables and and there

244
00:10:54,929 --> 00:11:00,299
they are right and that all looks fine

245
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:02,789
so what I want to do now is I guess

246
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:05,370
indent things based on how far in they

247
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:07,469
are great how how deep down the tree

248
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,929
they are which is pretty easy because we

249
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,129
already were tracking the depth before

250
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:13,559
so it's pretty free for me to just go

251
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,269
like I don't know how much I want maybe

252
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,639
I can say that we've got the line

253
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:20,189
advance is a thing because I find that

254
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,799
sometimes a handy thing to do to keep

255
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,890
your stuff working well with any font is

256
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,439
to take how big a line is and use that

257
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:31,439
as the indent amount because that tends

258
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,110
to look about right and it will scale

259
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,400
properly with whatever the font is so

260
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:40,080
I'm just gonna go like four line

261
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:43,350
advances in and see how that goes oops

262
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,210
that's not good got to actually multiply

263
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,950
it by the depth and maybe maybe four was

264
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:52,560
a little too much we'll try to yeah

265
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,500
so now we've got a horrorcore printout

266
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,909
right you can see that we've got the

267
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,830
printout here we've got all of our

268
00:11:56,909 --> 00:12:00,209
variables that we previously were using

269
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,089
in the radial menu they're all printed

270
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:05,519
out here and they all look like they're

271
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,260
doing the correct thing so what I'd like

272
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,329
to do now is make it so that I can

273
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,159
interact with these in some way and like

274
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,379
I said maybe expand and collapse them do

275
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:15,329
that sort of a thing like you would see

276
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:19,889
in a tree view you know like a Windows

277
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:24,629
tree viewer or an outliner or something

278
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:27,269
like that so if I wanna do that again

279
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:28,649
pretty trivial what I need to do is I

280
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:30,480
need to have some way of figuring out

281
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,759
whether you know I can interact with

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,500
this thing and so this is where again

283
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:40,830
that get text bounds would be kind of

284
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:42,839
handy because if i text bounce there it

285
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,940
is it's trying to help me and I'm not

286
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,290
letting it if I know what the text

287
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,640
bounds are I could see whether or not

288
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:50,549
the mouse is inside it and then do

289
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,259
something with that right so I can do

290
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:56,039
something where I say like okay you know

291
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:58,169
I'm gonna get these text bounds for the

292
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:59,429
text that I've produced and then I'm

293
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:01,588
gonna check to see whether or not I'm

294
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:03,039
inside those text bounds and if I am

295
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:05,980
inside those text bounds

296
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:10,000
then I'm going to consider I'm gonna

297
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,850
consider it clickable you know there

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,559
should be it inside or is in rectangle

299
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,060
there we go

300
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,369
so if I go ahead and pull that out here

301
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:20,078
I can just say like alright if I am

302
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,730
inside the rectangle and this would be

303
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,649
again another place where I could then

304
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,980
lean on that item color I could just say

305
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:28,958
well if I'm inside the text bounds with

306
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,269
the mouse P which I'm already getting

307
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,768
cuz I'm the menu then I'm gonna set the

308
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,379
mouse I'm sorry because that the item

309
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:38,560
color to yellow just so I can see if I'm

310
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:40,208
detecting the hit location correctly and

311
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,969
I guess the other thing here is the text

312
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:46,028
bounce also is not offset by the text P

313
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:52,569
so I also need to do something like this

314
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:55,269
right to get the actual rectangle that I

315
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:56,969
want and so here you can see that the

316
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:01,389
hit detection is is now working

317
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,430
correctly so that's all good and what I

318
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:05,889
can also do now is I can just say well

319
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:09,129
alright let's do you know let's do

320
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:11,409
whatever we were gonna do when the mouse

321
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:14,679
got clicked so I will need something

322
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:17,198
like a you know some kind of an

323
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,539
interactive ear I guess we could just do

324
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,679
something like clicked for now but well

325
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,480
you know what I'm gonna I want to make

326
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,879
it a little more I'm gonna make it a

327
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,690
little fancier than that because we

328
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:32,318
probably want to probably want to do

329
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:36,250
something a little more I'm gonna use

330
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:39,818
the word perspicacious but that's not

331
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:43,208
the probably correct word but I wanted

332
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:44,889
to use that word and I figured that

333
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:47,318
since you're gonna see what I'm gonna do

334
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,698
anyway the fact that I used a word that

335
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:51,099
was not the proper word for the

336
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:53,169
circumstance shouldn't actually pose a

337
00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:00,370
significant problem at the end of the

338
00:14:53,169 --> 00:15:01,778
day alright so I pull out here and we go

339
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,139
into something where we're looking kind

340
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:06,429
of at what our interaction code was this

341
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,399
is gonna start to get into some more

342
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:10,870
like serious interaction stuff so I

343
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,028
guess problem you know honestly probably

344
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,460
what I would rather do here for a second

345
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:20,240
is say it just does write handmade can

346
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:23,780
Figg do the compile automatically it

347
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,430
does okay so what I want to do here is I

348
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,429
want to make it so that this will you

349
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:29,719
know maybe I can I can do use that use

350
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,459
kind of the same logic here but I'm

351
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,009
always gonna draw the debug menu instead

352
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,780
of only when the right mouse button does

353
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,279
its thing and then instead of the

354
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,079
previous checks I was doing I'm gonna

355
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,569
use like if the left mouse button was

356
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,830
clicked for right now and then I'm gonna

357
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,330
sort of talk a little bit more about

358
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,639
this in a second so this is a sort of a

359
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,170
stopgap thing just so we can test our

360
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,909
code but we're gonna probably do a

361
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:51,909
little bit different stuff in a second

362
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:57,560
okay so if the left mouse button was

363
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:00,170
clicked then what I'd like to do is say

364
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,379
this hot menu index thing that we used

365
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:04,610
to be using that's gone okay because not

366
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,320
many way next was just something that we

367
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,210
were using temporarily but now we have

368
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,660
this formal notion of a debug variable

369
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,519
and once I have that I can now say that

370
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:16,879
there is a concept of like a hot

371
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,769
variable right it's the variable that

372
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm actually interacting with at the

373
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,809
time potentially well that's not

374
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,070
actually what it will probably

375
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:22,779
eventually be but for right now that's

376
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,400
all it is

377
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:28,069
so if I come in here I can say all right

378
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:33,289
if the debug state has a hot variable

379
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:39,110
set then what I will do is I will use

380
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:41,959
that thing to do something now remember

381
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,930
a variable can be anything that it wants

382
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,639
to be right it could be whatever so

383
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:48,169
whatever the variable is we probably

384
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,919
want to look for us to see what the type

385
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:54,979
is right so I'd want to say debug state

386
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,209
a hot variable type and I guess you know

387
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,590
what I'll probably pull it out into a

388
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,379
local here so we'd have to keep typing

389
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,149
all that so something like this they'll

390
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:04,459
say okay you know you've got the

391
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,740
variable type it's all good we know

392
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:09,470
we've got two of them at the moment we

393
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,359
might have a boolean yeah we might have

394
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,850
a group either one of those could be

395
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,669
true and then we're gonna have some kind

396
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:20,319
of some kind of a notion of what's gonna

397
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:23,980
happen in the circumstance yeah so

398
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,629
looking at the the variable itself

399
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,490
assuming that it was a boolean we just

400
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,250
want to take that boolean

401
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:34,370
and we want to negate it like we were

402
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,140
doing before but if it was a group then

403
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:40,459
we want to take the group's expanded

404
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:42,020
state and they gave that right because

405
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,700
again a group is not really a brilliant

406
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,660
has more data in it so we just want to

407
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,400
make sure that we're treating those

408
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,990
things separately for now and these will

409
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,540
kind of increase probably in the numbers

410
00:17:47,990 --> 00:18:00,200
and types of operations that we have you

411
00:17:50,539 --> 00:18:01,789
know all right so assuming that we

412
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,130
actually did interact with a variable at

413
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,509
all then we'll rewrite the config but we

414
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,710
don't actually need to we read the

415
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:09,650
config if we didn't interact with a

416
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:13,130
variable to say the least so once you've

417
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:16,490
got that done now we would just have to

418
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:19,460
set that debug hot variable right we

419
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:21,049
have to set that to something and so in

420
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,910
this case I think all we really want to

421
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:26,269
do is just say that at the start the

422
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:29,600
debug state hot variable is going to

423
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:33,740
equal zero and then at the end the debug

424
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:36,199
hot variable will be set any time we

425
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,950
were in the rectangle something like

426
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,870
this so now we know if there is a hot

427
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:48,080
variable like we've hit tested it and we

428
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:52,729
found it and it's and once we've done

429
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:54,980
that we now you know we could even

430
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,329
really indicate here for a group for

431
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,259
example we could even do something like

432
00:18:56,329 --> 00:19:01,879
this where we go var group expanded we

433
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,240
could say like if it's expanded we'll do

434
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,890
a minus and if it's not we'll do a plus

435
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:12,529
right just so we can see so cures are

436
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,170
you know here's our sort of stuff in

437
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:18,410
theory I should be able to do a particle

438
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:22,789
test I should be able to set one oh I'm

439
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:28,220
release that's a that's a mistake that

440
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:29,750
is a missed take when I saw a bug we're

441
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:35,660
gonna have to fix there too it's kind of

442
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:37,369
interesting so yeah so in here I I'm

443
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,480
only checking to see whether the left

444
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:40,459
mouse button went through a transition

445
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,339
so what I really want to do is make sure

446
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,130
it went through a

447
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:45,959
mission and didn't end down so it

448
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,180
actually went it was released it's

449
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,960
probably or well-pressed maybe I don't

450
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:54,630
know don't we have code for this feel

451
00:19:51,960 --> 00:20:01,440
like we have code for this I feel like

452
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:04,170
we have code for this right here so I'm

453
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,900
just going to say that instead of all

454
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:12,960
this cuz that's what I mean there we go

455
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:17,550
so that should be fine oops that should

456
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,279
be an else yeah or maybe not what did I

457
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,569
do now that should that's that's correct

458
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:26,220
just need an extra parenthesis what's

459
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:28,289
the problem okay and so now we're good

460
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,610
except we do have well you know what one

461
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,809
other thing I should do is say we only

462
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,149
need to write the config if we actually

463
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:35,009
changed a variable that we care about

464
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,600
probably well yeah that might not be

465
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:38,609
true we might want to serialize the

466
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,629
group's expansion states as well or

467
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:42,059
things like that so let's leave it that

468
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,740
way for now all right so if I want to

469
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,179
change something like whether or not we

470
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,559
use the debug camera I can set that

471
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,480
right and it toggles like so but we have

472
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,539
a bug here which is that these strings

473
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,519
are are stored in the DLL which means

474
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,250
that when we reload it if they move we

475
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,730
would have a problem and I think yeah

476
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,039
there you go

477
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,440
so you see this up this changed what

478
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,970
strings were in the executable so it

479
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,070
means that all of our string pointers

480
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,700
are totally wrong now does that make

481
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:13,349
sense at least I believe that's what's

482
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,319
happening I guess I don't technically

483
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:19,709
now so I feel like what we want to do

484
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,929
there is we want to make sure that when

485
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,850
we build our debug variable table we

486
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:29,759
actually build the debug variable table

487
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:32,549
to be to copy the the strings out right

488
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,430
so it has a copy of them so when we do

489
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:37,740
let me see if we've got debug variables

490
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,160
you here it is so when we've got our

491
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,599
debug variables in here we want to go

492
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,730
ahead and do when we add the variable

493
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,639
this name should actually get pushed on

494
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,339
to the stack as its own thing so they

495
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,200
it's saved we keep a copy of it not

496
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:56,209
relying on the DLL itself you know

497
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,740
and I feel like the probably the easiest

498
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,460
way to do that would be to do like a

499
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:05,269
push copy sort of a thing because we

500
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:09,038
have a copy right we have this and so if

501
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:13,579
we have that we should be able to do a

502
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:17,589
thing where there is a push copy which

503
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:23,599
takes the arena the size and the source

504
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:32,119
and then does some stuff right probably

505
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:35,928
what it does is it close copy actually

506
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:42,918
this is a little tricky this is a little

507
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:46,399
a little bit tricky how to make sure

508
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:51,340
that the macro returns the right thing

509
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:59,269
and still supports the varargs

510
00:22:51,339 --> 00:23:06,699
the varves that's a little nasty it's a

511
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:10,639
little bit nasty I suppose you would do

512
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:15,909
something like this to make your life a

513
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:23,028
little easier because you are just that

514
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:24,950
kind of a person that because what I

515
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:27,500
want to do here right is I want to push

516
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:30,980
a copy so that this thing can return at

517
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,589
the copy but that means that the thing

518
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,240
inside the copy wouldn't have gotten

519
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:36,678
returned out to the top of the macro

520
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,679
right it has to kind of it have to

521
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,090
evaluate to that so I'm just going ahead

522
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,710
and saying well let's make copy return

523
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:44,480
its destination and then we'd be home

524
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,500
free right cuz then we can just do this

525
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,940
and everyone wins or something

526
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,909
right that that would then do what I

527
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:58,880
want so now we can just say push copy

528
00:23:52,909 --> 00:24:01,200
you know string-length name name or

529
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,410
something like this

530
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,580
and now we should be good to go

531
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:10,350
of course I don't know if I actually

532
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:11,669
have a string-length thought we did I've

533
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:15,029
really thought we had some kind of a

534
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:17,820
string like thing is that not true is

535
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:25,289
that something that like we only did in

536
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:30,059
test asset builder where where is it

537
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:32,789
I swore we wrote this it's right there

538
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,230
oh wait no that's the one I wanted never

539
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:39,569
mind I'm like it's right there it's like

540
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:43,470
no it's not there it is hello come on

541
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:45,720
out come on out to play

542
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,980
so yes unfortunately this would have to

543
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,740
be in platform because it's actually

544
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,150
used by the platform layer as well but

545
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,589
that's not the end of the world we could

546
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,040
have a little utility section here that

547
00:24:52,589 --> 00:25:03,109
we start to work on right this is just

548
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:03,109
like shared utils or something like that

549
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:17,069
something like this I don't know seems

550
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:20,960
plausible to me it's probably you right

551
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:24,569
because it can't be negative all right

552
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,390
so this should in theory now do our push

553
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:28,589
copy for us so I think that at least our

554
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,490
string should be preserved let's see

555
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:31,490
about that

556
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,990
I'm not sure why we're getting

557
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,670
that's a little weird

558
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:49,690
so we're preserving our strings properly

559
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:54,559
but there's a bit of a hit test bug here

560
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:58,730
I'm not sure so we've got we've got ones

561
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,589
we got some other bug happening that

562
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:04,279
doesn't look like it has anything to do

563
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:09,740
with that particular part of the

564
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:17,680
situation so what is going on I set my

565
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:22,549
hot variable and I set it if we are in

566
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:27,710
if the mouse is in the rectangle of the

567
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:30,849
text which I would think should have

568
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:36,650
been correct but even before we reload

569
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:39,199
you can see that it's wrong right like

570
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:43,910
it thinks that it thinks that that is

571
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:47,269
somehow inside that that's actually like

572
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:50,330
that that's the mouse is hovering over

573
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:54,829
both of these at once how is that

574
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:57,769
possible how I asked you it seems a

575
00:26:54,829 --> 00:27:00,799
little nonsensical to me but there must

576
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:02,930
be a bug because it's not working if it

577
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,279
was working we might be able to make the

578
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,630
argument there wasn't a bug but because

579
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,500
it's not working it would be pretty hard

580
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,670
to make that argument so we set the item

581
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,539
color every time as well

582
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:19,070
we print out the stuff that's all well

583
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:23,480
and good I should probably also put in a

584
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:26,779
legal default case here so we know that

585
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,549
we have not processed that thing in the

586
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,549
case of some other weird variable flow

587
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:35,979
oh and of course yeah when we rewrote

588
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:41,199
them we had some garbage strings in

589
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:43,028
there as well I'm assuming that that was

590
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,359
just because we had that screw up with

591
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:48,308
the strings the first time but I'm

592
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:50,468
actually now so we should like verify

593
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:53,908
that that's not a bug that's still in

594
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,909
there after we fixed the string problem

595
00:27:54,989 --> 00:28:04,509
so that would have rewritten it all

596
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:07,898
right so we have another bug oh oh man

597
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:10,149
it's it's amateur day today I can tell

598
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:12,038
exactly what that is that's just I when

599
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:14,048
I did my push size thing I should have I

600
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:16,658
needed to copy the null Terminator onto

601
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:20,558
the end of the string never use ask easy

602
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:21,460
strings kids this is why I really don't

603
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,469
like them very much

604
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,389
you don't have much of a choice when you

605
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,798
work when you at least are working

606
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:29,468
partially with the C runtime library

607
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,298
because it always uses them and a lot of

608
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:33,038
times even like windows forces you to

609
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:35,588
use ASCII strings you just don't have a

610
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,690
choice you can see here I'm push copy

611
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:39,848
string length will only return the

612
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,919
length of the string which is usually

613
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:43,658
what I actually want 99% of time when

614
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,169
I'm programming but anytime you're going

615
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:49,749
to call any time any time you've set up

616
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:51,759
your stuff to work with sort of the the

617
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:54,669
standard windows or C things they always

618
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:59,139
use a null terminator so you have to do

619
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:01,089
that route as well right and so all of

620
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:03,728
our stuff in hand made hero still does

621
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:06,338
know terminators which is not really

622
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:08,048
what you would do we don't really use

623
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:09,848
that may string so it's not the end of

624
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:14,588
the world but you just it's kind of

625
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:17,710
janky point being so I think we're in

626
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:20,638
good good shape here now it looks like

627
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,639
everything is working nicely

628
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:32,220
yeah pretty good I'm happy with that

629
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:38,889
yeah so now the only thing we have left

630
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:42,429
to do before we finish like our basic

631
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:44,830
stated goal is you know when I when I

632
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:48,009
click on these things here they don't

633
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:52,058
actually change right so you can see the

634
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:54,400
little plus is changing to a minus so we

635
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:55,750
are able to expand and collapse them in

636
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,390
the sense that they're variable changes

637
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,788
but since we don't use that variable the

638
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,070
actual tree view itself the

639
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:05,048
implementation is not yet correct right

640
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:07,569
because it doesn't actually obey it in

641
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:09,879
any way so we want to do to obey it is

642
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:12,879
just prevent we don't want to go down

643
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,650
any further into the tree in the case

644
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,450
that the group was not actually expanded

645
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:20,919
right so what we would do here is we'd

646
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:23,769
say this is the case right where we

647
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:29,320
descend we would just say we're not

648
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:31,808
gonna do that unless it's also we're not

649
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:35,710
going to entertain that unless it's also

650
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:38,349
expanded like so right fact I guess I

651
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,509
could just read about that so don't

652
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:46,949
bother descending to children in the

653
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:50,529
case where something is not expanded and

654
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,380
notice this is the wrong routine so you

655
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:56,288
know you could also just do that totally

656
00:30:53,380 --> 00:31:01,090
wrong if you want to steps fine it's

657
00:30:56,288 --> 00:31:03,849
totally fine let's we save that there

658
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:05,439
don't actually want to change it so yeah

659
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:07,269
so now that we've got that I just need

660
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,950
to come down here and do that in the

661
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:16,808
actual place that I actually was

662
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:20,169
supposed to do it like so and and there

663
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:23,319
we go so now we won't descend unless the

664
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:24,788
thing is actually expanded and you can

665
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,200
see already that it's you know doing

666
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:28,200
something differently right now we've

667
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,769
just got these compressed guys up here

668
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:35,950
and I can you know expand them and so on

669
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:36,129
and the nested stuff works as well and

670
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,840
it

671
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:41,380
remember you know wherever it was or

672
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:43,629
blah blah blah right so that's all good

673
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,000
and I think that pretty much gives us

674
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:53,260
what we wanted what would be nice to do

675
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:57,970
now I guess time is it got like 30

676
00:31:53,259 --> 00:32:01,119
minutes left 30 minutes left

677
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:03,130
so we got quite a bit of time so

678
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:05,739
probably what we would want to do here

679
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:08,940
is add other sorts of stuff to this and

680
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:11,799
maybe try to get enough things in there

681
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:16,720
that we would have to allow it to scroll

682
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:18,879
I mean that seems like the next most

683
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,400
logical thing to do so that we could

684
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,570
have you know this this would get big

685
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,340
enough I don't know where we're gonna

686
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:27,189
get all the things we just insert dummy

687
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:31,599
things at this point I guess maybe I

688
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:34,930
don't know who knows so if I want to do

689
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:37,629
that if I want to add other sorts of

690
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,890
variables to the mix then I can

691
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,810
literally just come in through here and

692
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:43,210
kind of set what those things are gonna

693
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:45,639
be right so really I probably wanted to

694
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,090
call that bool 32 right and this can be

695
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:51,460
in 32 and this could be unit 32 right

696
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:55,599
and I can just sort of say that we've

697
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:57,789
got some stuff and why not we might as

698
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:04,539
well throw in for good measure v 3s or

699
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:06,460
b2 and b3 s V fours you know that seems

700
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:09,309
that seems reasonable so now I can print

701
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,480
out whatever you know we get throw

702
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:12,339
rectangles in there as well but just

703
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,860
like you know whatever our base whatever

704
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:17,009
our base types are we can throw them in

705
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,009
there

706
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:28,158
right so if we did that then we would

707
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:30,528
just all we'd have to do is just

708
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,460
implement the switches where we actually

709
00:33:30,528 --> 00:33:35,929
care about this in the config again it's

710
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,538
just you know gonna be pretty much the

711
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:41,480
exact same thing this is gonna become a

712
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:43,220
pool 32 and this is going to come in 32

713
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,278
or something like this and it's going to

714
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,639
print out just the exact same stuff but

715
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:50,839
it's going to print out as an in 32

716
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:56,748
again we don't really need to do that

717
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:58,638
one for the most part to be honest we

718
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:02,269
really don't have to do those but I'm

719
00:33:58,638 --> 00:34:05,928
doing them anyway and I mean you could

720
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:09,619
actually say that honestly you just do

721
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:11,148
this because these are pretty

722
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:14,210
straightforward right those are both

723
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:16,250
going to do that same same exact path so

724
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:21,500
the UN path is a little different but

725
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:23,030
only a little what's gonna happen there

726
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,858
and again we know these are in the same

727
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,109
place so it's all good

728
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:29,210
what's gonna happen there is we're just

729
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:32,449
gonna print it out as an unsigned but

730
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,789
everything else stays the same same is

731
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:37,128
true for the real 32 real thirty twos

732
00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:39,398
are just gonna be printed out as floats

733
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:42,739
but otherwise everything is the same and

734
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:44,509
that's pretty much it

735
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:46,068
but what you can sort of see here you

736
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,210
know if you start to look at this you

737
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:49,699
can start to see that we're gonna have a

738
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,230
problem so let's take a look at the

739
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,779
compression or inside of this like I was

740
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,969
sort of saying before if we take a look

741
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,710
at what's going on here you can see that

742
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:03,348
I'm pretty soon gonna write exactly the

743
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:05,409
same code here right more or less so I'm

744
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:08,930
gonna have to do this sort of thing

745
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:13,190
where I you know we had this one but

746
00:35:08,929 --> 00:35:17,469
then we would also have exact same thing

747
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:20,829
that I did over here happen

748
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:23,379
where the UN 32 case is only different

749
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:26,159
because it's got this I guess I can't do

750
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,160
that cuz that's true or false

751
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:40,840
yeah and this guy getting exact same

752
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:46,930
code but he's printing out to you

753
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:50,500
instead and then finally the r32 is just

754
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:51,759
float but again it's really kind of

755
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,289
wrote you can see that there's a lot of

756
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,390
a lot of similar to there a lot of

757
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:57,309
duplication that sort of thing but

758
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:58,929
that's what it would be so let's start

759
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:00,219
with that and then let's see what we

760
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:02,379
could do about compressing that down to

761
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:03,459
something a little more manageable in

762
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,200
the meantime I'm gonna have to actually

763
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,480
add some of these because we can't

764
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,000
really very much test with them unless I

765
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,960
have you know something to actually test

766
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,150
and so I'm gonna go ahead and make a way

767
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:21,010
to add things that are not boolean I

768
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:24,269
wanted to for example I can add other

769
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:29,920
types of variables here like like the

770
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:35,829
maybe in our 32 what's a real 32 and

771
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:38,139
that will set its value except

772
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:40,480
so now if I wanted to add some real 30

773
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:42,159
twos in here I could the only kind of

774
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,260
confusing thing is we don't actually

775
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,599
have any of those sorts of variables but

776
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,870
I could certainly make one so one way I

777
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:51,159
would make one is in the in where we're

778
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:53,079
actually doing a configure whatever I

779
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:56,980
could just say like maybe there's gonna

780
00:36:53,079 --> 00:37:01,809
be you know something in here that's a

781
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:07,300
debug UI debug camera I think I even

782
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:10,269
said this one debug camera distance and

783
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,920
I don't know you know what I should also

784
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:18,340
do now I think about it I just typed

785
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,269
that F in there is I should also when I

786
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:24,579
print it out

787
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:26,259
print out the F yeah in that top line so

788
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:28,480
you know I look at that and I'm like

789
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,160
okay Divac camera distance we could make

790
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,769
that a thing because we said that was

791
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,629
going to be a thing and I think I even

792
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:37,989
mentioned it in here right at distance

793
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:41,260
for debug camera so if I wanted to I

794
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:48,579
could go into the render group and when

795
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:49,810
it does the debug debug camera I guess I

796
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:52,750
don't even move what's called a bug

797
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:55,269
camera instead of just adding 50 it

798
00:37:52,750 --> 00:38:00,760
would add like whatever we actually did

799
00:37:55,269 --> 00:38:04,360
here right so that's one thing we could

800
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,710
do and if I do that then I can add in a

801
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,300
float variable here which is what I

802
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:12,369
wanted so I can say here that we've got

803
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:16,000
oh we've got a debug UI debug camera

804
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:18,429
distance like so so that seems pretty

805
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,809
reasonable and now we've got a we've got

806
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:22,509
at least one floating-point value in

807
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:24,219
there and so if I open it up now let's

808
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,230
take a look at what it actually shows

809
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:29,980
there's that 50 which is what we set it

810
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,420
to and if we turn on debug camera it's

811
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,650
using it but we don't really have any

812
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,240
way to interact with it yet in fact we

813
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:37,059
interact with it we will go ahead and

814
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,409
hit our assertion which just says like

815
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:39,880
hey you asked me to interact with the

816
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:42,699
variables I don't know how to interact

817
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,680
with and so what we'd like to do there

818
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:46,029
right is we'd like to potentially make a

819
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:48,069
way to like tweak that variable

820
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,060
potentially because again we've sort of

821
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,710
done all the work that's

822
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:52,869
sorry to do whatever in here so we might

823
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:57,519
as well do something that lets you tweak

824
00:38:52,869 --> 00:39:05,190
it so if we want to do that and I guess

825
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:07,269
that's so you only have 20 minutes left

826
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,530
maybe that's what I'll focus on doing

827
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:10,659
instead of going down there's two other

828
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,830
paths we could go down right this is a

829
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:14,319
bunch of things that kind of opens up

830
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:15,789
for us now but let me just go ahead and

831
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,920
start talking about the UI side of

832
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:25,090
things because the UI side of things is

833
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:27,909
really well you know what no let's start

834
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:30,370
tomorrow by talking about the UI side of

835
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:32,589
things so I'll let that 50 just just

836
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:34,659
ride the 50 is just gonna ride let's do

837
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,030
the compression side of stuff first and

838
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:39,219
clean that up a little bit and just see

839
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:42,850
what happens there because I'd rather

840
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:44,169
start tomorrow fresh talking about the

841
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:45,699
UI side of things cuz it's actually

842
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:48,269
relatively broad topic and I think

843
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:56,859
that'd be a little more interesting

844
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:59,980
okay so in this case right I feel like

845
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:02,200
for the most part you can see what's you

846
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:06,010
can I can kind of see what's what's

847
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:08,649
happening here where I've definitely got

848
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:10,360
a in terms of how things are getting

849
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,070
print it out I've definitely got

850
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,420
something that I could tease out of that

851
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:18,280
I could use the true and the false that

852
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:23,470
that could be symmetric in both cases

853
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:26,140
and if I look it's really this part

854
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:29,169
right here the percent s with the value

855
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:32,199
after it that's actually the part that's

856
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:35,710
changing the percent desk :

857
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:36,189
this part is exactly the same in both

858
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:39,190
cases

859
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:41,050
and so this it's also true over here you

860
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,510
can see that I've kind of got you know a

861
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,430
preamble but then I do exactly the same

862
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:47,470
stuff I would have done here so it's

863
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:51,699
like preamble post amble and then the

864
00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:54,099
value is like in the middle now there is

865
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:58,649
one of them that is not the same and

866
00:40:54,099 --> 00:41:02,190
that is this part right here so that F

867
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,190
is actually different

868
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:13,179
so you know it's like I'm trying to

869
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:20,079
think of what the best way to pull that

870
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:25,329
one piece out is and I suspect you know

871
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:28,390
I I suspect that probably the right

872
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:32,289
thing to do is to just make it so that

873
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:35,818
you can kind of sort of pull these pull

874
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:39,009
those things out having been printed in

875
00:41:35,818 --> 00:41:41,108
some kind of a in some kind of a

876
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:45,188
parametric ways so we basically pass in

877
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:47,078
a flag that told us how we want it

878
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:49,478
formatted which would stick F on the end

879
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,369
if it was you know being printed in one

880
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:54,698
way and not in another or something like

881
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:55,778
this right and in fact I guess you know

882
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:57,249
now that I think about it we could

883
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:58,989
actually make it so that it all kind of

884
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,518
flows through one path let's see what

885
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:01,568
that looks like because that maybe is

886
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,808
kind of interesting I don't actually

887
00:42:01,568 --> 00:42:06,849
know but I'm gonna I'm gonna see so if

888
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:11,589
we were to do something where we just

889
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:13,959
did like variable two texts right

890
00:42:11,588 --> 00:42:15,759
something like this and we just made it

891
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:18,009
kind of do all the things that we needed

892
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:20,769
to do so it's gonna do something like

893
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:24,130
this where we have like the buffer size

894
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:27,248
and the buffer we have the debug

895
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:31,689
variable and then we have like some

896
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:32,708
flags or something like this then we

897
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:33,998
would just have something where we've

898
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:36,068
got okay we've got the buffer size

899
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:40,389
passed twice I've got the buffer of past

900
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:41,469
ones we don't really have to worry too

901
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:43,658
much about this but we could actually

902
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:47,409
have that be pass through and so this is

903
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:49,088
like character is used or something so

904
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:51,669
that if someone does want to jay-z chain

905
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:54,818
these together they totes could that's

906
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:56,978
kiss do they say so if I do something

907
00:42:54,818 --> 00:42:58,389
like this and I guess you know now I

908
00:42:56,978 --> 00:42:59,798
think about it we do kind of care about

909
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:02,348
that a little bit because we're gonna

910
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:03,989
probably use that here in a second right

911
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:07,650
I

912
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:10,259
thing yeah yeah we could actually use

913
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:13,260
that so what we do is we set up our at

914
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,510
here to be the buffer and then we'd

915
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,940
actually do we do exactly what we are

916
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:24,750
doing here in fact I take it back we do

917
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:27,360
exactly this and so I just need the

918
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:29,550
buffer pointer and probably the end

919
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,680
pointer like we were doing before app

920
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,630
becomes the buffer pointer it does

921
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,099
exactly what it was doing before with

922
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,690
the advancement so that we can do the

923
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:39,868
change things together and then at the

924
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,230
end we just return and minus at so that

925
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:45,650
we can I'm not in minus at at my buffer

926
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:49,920
so that it knows how many there were

927
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:57,000
right so do somebody it used so if I do

928
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:58,950
that then I should be able to well you

929
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,050
know what since that's exactly the same

930
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:12,889
I'm just gonna go ahead and copy that

931
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:17,390
out here we go okay oops missed the same

932
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:17,389
okay that's what I actually wanted

933
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:31,990
so now that I've got this my job is to

934
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:34,809
take this block of code and this block

935
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:36,639
of code oops here and harmonize these

936
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:39,130
two so the first things first we've got

937
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,629
to handle this part right so we've got

938
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,400
to have something that basically says

939
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,440
you know if you want to prefix it with

940
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,920
this we actually will prefix it with

941
00:44:44,440 --> 00:45:00,088
that you know this has to be a bat

942
00:44:47,920 --> 00:45:00,088
format as well there we go there we go

943
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:10,420
okay so if I grab one of these guys and

944
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:12,460
I'm going to print this out then what I

945
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,950
would do say okay I got to print out the

946
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,108
the debug define bit so we did show that

947
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:23,949
on there we print out the name off we go

948
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:27,460
right otherwise we might also have a

949
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:29,858
flag which does the exact same thing but

950
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,858
it only prints that just just the name

951
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:34,509
part we could even have that be like

952
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:36,219
this is a prefix and then we don't even

953
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,710
print out the name so you pass them both

954
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:42,129
or something like that I don't know just

955
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:44,139
just making stuff up here and so we

956
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:50,200
could do something like flags if the

957
00:45:44,139 --> 00:45:56,980
flags and you but you know debug bar to

958
00:45:50,199 --> 00:46:00,059
text underscore or add debug UI and we

959
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,730
could also do one that's like add name

960
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:06,130
something like that then in here all we

961
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:10,318
would actually print out is just the

962
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,318
value like so

963
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:23,250
something like this and that I think

964
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:25,318
gives us the basis of routine we want

965
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:27,630
there's still a couple other things in

966
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:30,239
here that we would want to do but that's

967
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,369
basically it right so then we have one

968
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,328
more down for just a float which is like

969
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:36,930
do we want to post pad that float

970
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:39,359
something like this

971
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:43,169
or I guess it's just star at plus plus

972
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:47,940
equals F all right and that's like float

973
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:49,559
suffix so now we've kind of got a

974
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,579
parametric way of like dumping these

975
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:55,109
things out you know and we could also

976
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:57,119
say whether we wanted to cure it to turn

977
00:46:55,108 --> 00:47:02,909
on the end and that could apply to

978
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:13,710
everybody so something like this turn

979
00:47:02,909 --> 00:47:18,088
and or line feed and like this and I put

980
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:23,028
that in here then we've just got you

981
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:25,889
know debug variable detects flag and

982
00:47:23,028 --> 00:47:31,818
then all these guys just get some kind

983
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:31,818
of flag value okay

984
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:43,409
where's my last guy there it is okay so

985
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,329
now we have one routine that does all of

986
00:47:43,409 --> 00:47:48,269
that printing so now I should be able to

987
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:49,829
just use that routine right so instead

988
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:52,409
of doing a switch on the variable type

989
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:55,348
here I can just use this debug variable

990
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:58,259
to text I can just use it here so I can

991
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:59,940
say okay I'm going to increment at by

992
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,580
whatever it takes to do this thing I

993
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,260
already can use the exact same thing

994
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:07,559
that I normally use here where I just do

995
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:09,869
like okay here is that here's end and I

996
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,588
know what the variable is and then for

997
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:14,910
the flags which ones I want I don't want

998
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:16,650
the debug UI I do

999
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:21,358
oh sorry I do want the debug UI I do

1000
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:23,789
want the name yeah I don't want the

1001
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:28,259
foot's of suffix I do want the line feed

1002
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:31,289
end I think it's roughly the set of

1003
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:33,839
fram's parameters I want for that then

1004
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:35,849
all this just goes away right so now we

1005
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,650
don't have that anymore this is the

1006
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:41,940
entirety of the routine which is now

1007
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:44,579
looking much nicer and then up here we

1008
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:47,159
can do exactly the same thing so instead

1009
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:49,559
of doing all of this again we would just

1010
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:54,420
do the same thing we did here where we

1011
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:56,789
just do okay please you know we don't

1012
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:59,130
actually care about that please o null

1013
00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:01,529
terminator let's not make the same

1014
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:04,730
mistake twice we also want to make sure

1015
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:04,730
your spittle null terminator in there

1016
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:14,670
yeah

1017
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:22,449
that way the for people who are one want

1018
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,940
it and they'll terminated aren't grading

1019
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:26,009
alternates themselves yeah that'll do

1020
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:30,820
that as well

1021
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:33,910
okay so yeah this guy now we've got sort

1022
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:37,690
of this this name prefix here it doesn't

1023
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:39,399
have a colon in front of it though so

1024
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,559
that's a little wonky but it will have a

1025
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,210
space in front of it so we could do

1026
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:47,590
something like this where we say alright

1027
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:51,010
if the flag say with a colon then we put

1028
00:49:47,590 --> 00:50:11,140
one otherwise we don't something like

1029
00:49:51,010 --> 00:50:15,460
that okay wow that was yeah okay so if

1030
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:17,429
we do that now I can also just print out

1031
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:22,869
this thing in one fell swoop as well

1032
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:23,919
which is also kind of cool and that

1033
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:26,829
would take the form

1034
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,769
I don't want debug UI I do want the name

1035
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:36,460
I don't know why Flags got added in

1036
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:42,039
there that's just a mistake okay I don't

1037
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:46,269
want a debug UI I do want the name I do

1038
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:51,130
want the float suffix I do want the null

1039
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:54,820
Terminator and the colon and that is how

1040
00:50:51,130 --> 00:51:00,338
I want that prepared past the text of

1041
00:50:54,820 --> 00:51:07,289
that and I think that's it oops and end

1042
00:51:00,338 --> 00:51:07,289
is just going to be however big text is

1043
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:20,789
so this is actually gonna return a size

1044
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:25,979
T basically right here we go and I'm not

1045
00:51:20,789 --> 00:51:27,959
sure missing semicolon what is the

1046
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:29,518
problem before debug vertex it's not a

1047
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:32,969
memory you int that's not what we called

1048
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:38,728
it that member you it was what we called

1049
00:51:32,969 --> 00:51:47,338
it what is it complaining about what are

1050
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:52,438
you unhappy about my friend reindex okay

1051
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:59,788
so I think that's all good

1052
00:51:52,438 --> 00:52:03,389
debug very able to text that wants to

1053
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:07,319
take the buffer the end the variable and

1054
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:10,318
the flags that looks like the right

1055
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:11,538
number of parameters to me what am I

1056
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:17,759
missing

1057
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:22,130
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 does not take 3

1058
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:26,248
arguments you're correct it doesn't oh

1059
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:30,769
yeah as a weird order to print those

1060
00:52:26,248 --> 00:52:33,598
arrows out in so now in theory

1061
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:35,098
everything should now be working but

1062
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,369
everything is kind of a little bit more

1063
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:40,349
compressed there so let's take a look to

1064
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:48,419
see if that that was also working let's

1065
00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:53,548
see if it wrote out properly oh it's not

1066
00:52:48,418 --> 00:53:02,548
not as good not good is not good that is

1067
00:52:53,548 --> 00:53:05,688
ugly print out so my carriage return is

1068
00:53:02,548 --> 00:53:07,798
not happening we can kind of see why

1069
00:53:05,688 --> 00:53:10,889
it's because I decided to put an s on

1070
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:14,429
the end of it said I like copied this

1071
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:15,838
and didn't actually change it and well

1072
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:20,369
that looks like that might actually be

1073
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:25,199
it to be honest so I think

1074
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:32,849
although the value why am I not seeing

1075
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:34,528
the value right so in there is one thing

1076
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:37,410
we want to do here which is we don't

1077
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:40,139
want to print out groups and right now

1078
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:44,308
we are still printing out groups right

1079
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:46,618
so in this one we that's okay we also

1080
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:52,950
probably should get rid of get rid of

1081
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:54,930
this stuff here in this one we don't

1082
00:53:52,949 --> 00:54:00,058
want to print out groups so we want to

1083
00:53:54,929 --> 00:54:04,230
say - you know it in the case where the

1084
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:06,539
thing was a group we don't print it out

1085
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:09,088
and in fact I guess we already start by

1086
00:54:06,539 --> 00:54:11,329
checking that so we just only do it in

1087
00:54:09,088 --> 00:54:15,389
here so assuming the thing isn't a group

1088
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:17,190
then we would actually do this right and

1089
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:18,538
of course now we have that nasty problem

1090
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,499
this is kind of a nasty thing I think

1091
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:24,690
it's probably saying we probably would

1092
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:27,238
have to fix is our R if we have a bug in

1093
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:30,059
our debug code our printout is kind of

1094
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,710
toasted right you know what I mean and

1095
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,960
you can imagine this being being pretty

1096
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:36,179
bad if we had like a huge number of

1097
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,170
these you can mitigate it by because you

1098
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:39,210
have source code control you could

1099
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:41,389
always restore it or whatever but it's

1100
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:43,619
still just a bad that's not a good

1101
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:46,288
that's not a good situation you don't

1102
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:48,329
want to you don't want that to be the

1103
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:50,700
case we can avoid it so that probably

1104
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:53,160
means that yeah like we want a way of

1105
00:54:50,699 --> 00:54:55,798
rewriting this or of making sure that

1106
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:58,649
that sort of thing doesn't actually

1107
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:59,940
become a problem like maybe by saving a

1108
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,230
backup of the file and gets mean to

1109
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:06,980
restore or by changing the way we're

1110
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:06,980
doing it slightly yeah so anyway

1111
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:15,430
show lighting samples what the Schiller

1112
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:20,380
example say invalid

1113
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:22,449
integer constant expression so it looks

1114
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,220
like these is after my correct in

1115
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:28,539
thinking that that's that they cannot be

1116
00:55:24,219 --> 00:55:30,939
true and false because it actually not

1117
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:33,099
legal to do that I would have thought

1118
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:36,329
but it could be the macro preprocessor

1119
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:42,789
doesn't allow true and false for testing

1120
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:44,500
let's see it does look that way do you

1121
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:48,670
back camera distance has the F on the

1122
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,630
end okay so the other thing that I want

1123
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,490
to do there though

1124
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,340
again I'm just about a lot of time but I

1125
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:55,449
just want to clean up one more thing so

1126
00:55:54,340 --> 00:56:02,350
the other thing that I want to do there

1127
00:55:55,449 --> 00:56:04,179
though is when I am printing out those

1128
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:07,500
trues and falses then that means I

1129
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:09,909
should also only do only do that

1130
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,059
assuming that a particular variable is

1131
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:14,500
set right so what I would want to do is

1132
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:19,469
have two different versions of this I'd

1133
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:19,469
want to have flags and debug var to text

1134
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:30,100
pretty true or pretty bools something

1135
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:34,080
like that and so if we do pretty fools

1136
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:39,699
will do that if we vote we just do this

1137
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:45,460
so and print out the actual value and so

1138
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:46,719
then we've got that out of control we

1139
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,849
know that we don't want pretty Bulls

1140
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,849
here we do want pretty Bulls here

1141
00:56:52,869 --> 00:57:00,789
all right so if I run that I see here

1142
00:56:58,048 --> 00:57:02,230
getting a little closer getting some

1143
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,039
cool I don't know why there's a coal in

1144
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:10,449
the beginning I should double-check

1145
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:11,970
what's going on there all right so now

1146
00:57:10,449 --> 00:57:16,439
that seems to be working properly again

1147
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:16,439
and let's see how the right out goes

1148
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:24,009
there's a config file okay and that's

1149
00:57:20,588 --> 00:57:30,578
back to like being reasonable again so

1150
00:57:24,009 --> 00:57:34,088
that's all good and I guess we when we

1151
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:40,509
were doing this guy here - we may have

1152
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:42,009
wanted to fix because we have this colon

1153
00:57:40,509 --> 00:57:42,608
thing right where we're printing out the

1154
00:57:42,009 --> 00:57:45,630
colon

1155
00:57:42,608 --> 00:57:49,139
Oh awesome we're printing out the colon

1156
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:53,640
before the name that's just a typo

1157
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:56,108
supposed to look like that right so

1158
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:57,969
that's better okay

1159
00:57:56,108 --> 00:58:00,009
TiVo camera distance and that looks like

1160
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:05,348
I'm still not that means I have still

1161
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:12,068
not printing out that F on the end of it

1162
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:14,380
float suffix so does that mean yeah I

1163
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:17,349
just wasn't passing that flag so we want

1164
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:19,568
the float suffix on there and I actually

1165
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:25,420
don't want the float suffix on here I

1166
00:58:19,568 --> 00:58:27,909
don't know why I was doing that okay so

1167
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:32,950
we're getting a little closer a little

1168
00:58:27,909 --> 00:58:35,440
bit a little beat let's see here so we

1169
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:35,818
can open these guys up that all works

1170
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,249
fine

1171
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:42,730
we could change these guys now and

1172
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:44,558
that's good too but now we need to do a

1173
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,568
few more things just to get us back to

1174
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,109
parity and have all this stuff bundled

1175
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:49,108
in one routine

1176
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:55,650
okay so this all looks fine

1177
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:57,420
but what we would want to do here is we

1178
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:59,068
probably want to do some drawing for

1179
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,709
when these things or groups to do like

1180
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:03,509
sort of like something reasonable with

1181
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:05,429
sort of group connectors or I'm not sure

1182
00:59:03,509 --> 00:59:06,748
what and then the other thing that we

1183
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:08,399
want to probably do here is we wanted to

1184
00:59:06,748 --> 00:59:11,098
add in we had those little things where

1185
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,900
we would put in a comment field and in

1186
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:14,459
the case of the group so I actually

1187
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,680
don't want to make it so that you don't

1188
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:18,989
see them at all I probably do want to

1189
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:29,298
actually make it so that you can see

1190
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:29,298
groups and yeah so so it seems like

1191
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,309
since it's already gonna put out the

1192
00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:37,109
group name this shouldn't be here right

1193
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:40,499
groups don't print anything at the

1194
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:43,199
moment and the only thing I would need

1195
00:59:40,498 --> 00:59:45,748
to do to fix the the other part where I

1196
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,268
print out commas is instead of making it

1197
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:51,808
so that I don't protect anything in this

1198
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:53,968
case I would always print something out

1199
00:59:51,809 --> 00:59:57,798
and I would just print out a comma

1200
00:59:53,969 --> 01:00:00,420
before it right so I'd do something

1201
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:02,400
where I do like this printf I would just

1202
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:05,838
go ahead and put something in there you

1203
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:09,139
know that looked like this write

1204
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:09,139
something like that

1205
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:21,399
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that in the

1206
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:23,349
case where it is a group and then we

1207
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,730
will always print it out I think that

1208
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:32,260
should be that should be just about it

1209
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:35,139
let me see see where we're at so that

1210
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:42,180
all looks pretty good let's take a look

1211
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:47,769
at what the big biopsy looks like yeah

1212
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:49,509
all right all right so that's pretty

1213
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,980
good now we've kind of got it down to a

1214
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:53,619
thing where we just have our sort of

1215
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,969
like configuration in line and the only

1216
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:57,130
reason I want to do it that way is

1217
01:00:54,969 --> 01:00:59,739
because now when I add these in here

1218
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:01,960
it's a lot faster so for example if I

1219
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:03,339
wanted to add a vector type I just think

1220
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,380
that now that I've kind of condensed it

1221
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,970
in that way it makes it a lot easier so

1222
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:09,190
if I want to add these guys in here I

1223
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:12,429
don't have to do very much right I can

1224
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:17,079
just kind of do the most minimal thing

1225
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:21,299
and it works so for example if I am to

1226
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:28,150
take one of those it would just be like

1227
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:30,460
this right and and whatever that

1228
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:32,108
actually is let's see here so that would

1229
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:36,539
be like could we actually put money in

1230
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:36,539
we could not so it'd be like v2

1231
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:46,269
something like that and we could

1232
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:49,719
actually have those in here now there's

1233
01:01:46,268 --> 01:01:53,139
a little bit of a caveat there which is

1234
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:57,068
that we do have a problem still even so

1235
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:59,798
we're printing out the brackets is is

1236
01:01:57,068 --> 01:02:01,358
kind of going to be annoying because it

1237
01:01:59,798 --> 01:02:04,119
probably normally needs to look like

1238
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:05,998
that right I guess we could just leave

1239
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:08,289
it like that

1240
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:15,988
and if we do that then we can actually

1241
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:15,989
just create everything for all of them

1242
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:22,170
like so okay

1243
01:02:28,028 --> 01:02:33,608
that's about it I think but now you know

1244
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,559
like I said it just makes it a little

1245
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:37,208
bit easier on me if I want to add types

1246
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:37,900
I don't have to worry about adding them

1247
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:41,919
all over the place

1248
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:43,059
all the time I do have some things that

1249
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,068
I probably want to do take it a little

1250
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,959
bit further just in terms of being able

1251
01:02:45,068 --> 01:02:49,929
to edit like be for us and be threes and

1252
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:51,429
stuff like that but now we again have

1253
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:52,958
the ability to have like extra types in

1254
01:02:51,429 --> 01:02:54,338
there and that's kind of nice and I

1255
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:57,669
could add one if I wanted to I don't

1256
01:02:54,338 --> 01:03:01,199
really know where I would add one but I

1257
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:04,199
could add a v2 in here somehow somewhere

1258
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:09,599
I'd I guess I would literally just do

1259
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:13,059
make up a fanciful one debug UI o v4 and

1260
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:19,568
that would just be you know something

1261
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:25,059
like this maybe and then in here we just

1262
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:29,650
say like oh yeah we've got so before as

1263
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:33,489
a variable or something and so yeah so

1264
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:34,838
that's about it I think and we just need

1265
01:03:33,489 --> 01:03:37,150
some way of actually adding one of those

1266
01:03:34,838 --> 01:03:40,259
which is you know again really really

1267
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:40,259
really trivial oops

1268
01:03:40,989 --> 01:03:45,899
yeah I think that's all there is

1269
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,160
am I still doing debug camera distance

1270
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:58,210
right no that's that's correct

1271
01:03:54,159 --> 01:04:00,190
oh so it's the it's the v4 that makes it

1272
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:03,159
do that it's not sure which one of those

1273
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:06,519
is arguing conversion from float to be

1274
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:09,129
32 possible loss of data oh I

1275
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:10,380
accidentally vaporized the one that I

1276
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:14,970
wanted

1277
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,970
keep sorry guys

1278
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:20,980
but yeah so I think that gives us the

1279
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:24,339
other types now too so like there's our

1280
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:28,179
there's our v4 as well so that sets us

1281
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:29,889
up pretty nicely to you know have you

1282
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:33,429
know what we want for debug UI for the

1283
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:34,598
most part but there's a couple janky

1284
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:35,980
things so I think we probably want to

1285
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:38,200
like tweak a little bit about how we're

1286
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:40,630
doing that but I might focus on the UI

1287
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:42,879
part of it tomorrow because again like

1288
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:47,470
really the Genki part there is just that

1289
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,940
I don't the the the trying doing the

1290
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:51,489
thing where you like automatically

1291
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:52,838
recompile is pretty cool but like we

1292
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:54,098
sort of did that test and it doesn't

1293
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:56,769
seem like we really get that much from

1294
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:59,019
it and because we recompile on every

1295
01:04:56,769 --> 01:05:03,039
time it means that the your ability to

1296
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:04,630
modify things it's too slow you know

1297
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,150
would be nice it was it was faster it

1298
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:09,369
should be faster because there's but you

1299
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:12,820
know just the nature of MS PC is it's

1300
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:15,640
very slow to compile things and so you

1301
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:17,710
know we'll probably want to want to

1302
01:05:15,639 --> 01:05:19,088
address that part of this because we

1303
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:20,858
probably realistically will want

1304
01:05:19,088 --> 01:05:22,659
something that's gonna be faster like

1305
01:05:20,858 --> 01:05:25,150
that should be instantaneous but it's

1306
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:28,029
too slow right now and there's nothing

1307
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:29,858
you know that we can do about that right

1308
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,450
there's nothing we're not gonna be able

1309
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:36,500
to speed that up that's Visual Studio

1310
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:39,919
right we can't we can't fix it right

1311
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:42,980
so with that in mind let's go ahead and

1312
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,019
go to the Q&amp;A if you have questions

1313
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,829
about we did into this dream please put

1314
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:49,690
a Q :

1315
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:49,690
and then asked

1316
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,369
and a Z that was pretty Bulls man yes

1317
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:11,399
pretty fools fools shocked 93 in case we

1318
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:14,079
heard cutlery maybe skip Q&amp;A and eat

1319
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:19,090
well I don't know if it's dinner's ready

1320
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:22,389
yet normally I put in dinner before I

1321
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:24,280
start the stream but I didn't get home

1322
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:25,629
in time today to do it so I don't know

1323
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:30,490
what is happening for dinner to be

1324
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:32,289
honest why aren't the plus and minus

1325
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:34,839
signs sharing the great labels because

1326
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:37,840
we didn't put those in into the little

1327
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:40,210
print out thing yet we can you know we

1328
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,860
can put them back in if you just want to

1329
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,990
throw them back in at the moment right

1330
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:46,150
because we got our sort of weird printer

1331
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:49,679
outer thing and basically that would

1332
01:06:46,150 --> 01:06:52,420
just be like okay you know expansion

1333
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:55,509
tags or something and you'd put it in

1334
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:57,460
here but I want to I don't want to use a

1335
01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:00,280
character for it I what I want to do is

1336
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:03,280
actually make that be a thing that

1337
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,769
happens in here in a more graphical way

1338
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,890
that maybe draws a line like you'd see

1339
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:10,449
in a real tree of you so I may do

1340
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:11,859
something a little fancier there or I

1341
01:07:10,449 --> 01:07:13,929
might not do it at all I don't know it's

1342
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:18,630
not super important but that's yeah

1343
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:18,629
that's why I'm out there

1344
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:25,019
instead of Manitoba values the power to

1345
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:26,879
for our debug text items can't we just

1346
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:28,739
use one shift of one one shift of two

1347
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,539
etc yes you can

1348
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:35,269
although start with one shifted up zero

1349
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:35,269
and that one shifted up one obviously

1350
01:07:39,079 --> 01:07:47,819
cuber Caleb so is this what you mean by

1351
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:49,799
I am GUI mm no I mean this this would

1352
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:52,830
qualify us and I am GUI because it is

1353
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:54,900
immediate mode at the moment but I am

1354
01:07:52,829 --> 01:07:57,029
GUI is really more about the interface

1355
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:59,700
so there's a this is one of eight this

1356
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:02,570
this is one of a family of things that I

1357
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:02,569
would consider I am GUI

1358
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:13,019
besides that colored text option for v4

1359
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:16,500
is representing colors yeah you totally

1360
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:17,970
could among other things insofar as we

1361
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,260
may extreme type debug variables maybe

1362
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:22,740
for things like save for location keep

1363
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:24,088
buying et cetera no I don't think so

1364
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:24,989
because we won't really have I don't

1365
01:08:24,088 --> 01:08:27,750
think we'll have much in the way of

1366
01:08:24,989 --> 01:08:29,579
string parameters the save folder

1367
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:35,850
location is mandated by Windows as far

1368
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:38,189
as I know so you can't change it Elvan

1369
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,660
why can't we use LLVM in Windows that

1370
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:43,309
way we use the same compiler for our

1371
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:43,309
major platforms you

1372
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:50,250
you can't output debug information for

1373
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:57,960
visual studio from LLVM yet as far as I

1374
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:59,909
know so that's the primary reason but

1375
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,109
you know the I I my understanding has

1376
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:02,639
they've been working on that and I don't

1377
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:05,130
know where they're at in terms of

1378
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:08,548
getting it working but once they got

1379
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:10,670
that working we we totally could for

1380
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:10,670
sure

1381
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:16,830
Prine difficult road library we must

1382
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,570
implement string formatting to the

1383
01:09:16,829 --> 01:09:21,149
stream isn't based on a lie well

1384
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:22,500
actually so right we even said at the

1385
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:25,649
outset though we won't remove the C

1386
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:27,720
runtime library till the end because

1387
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:30,420
that's not the only thing that calls

1388
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:34,680
into the way C works like we don't even

1389
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:37,890
have control over the things that the

1390
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:39,600
that are being called from the C runtime

1391
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:41,430
library without doing a bunch of extra

1392
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,460
work which I didn't really want to show

1393
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:47,460
people quite at the outset so if we were

1394
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:51,319
to turn on no default Lib so like maybe

1395
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:54,329
in here or something like this if I did

1396
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:58,579
no default Lib or whatever it is I'm not

1397
01:09:54,329 --> 01:10:01,069
sure what the don't remember what the

1398
01:09:58,579 --> 01:10:04,229
what the thing is for it I think it's

1399
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:07,469
after the link line there it is I think

1400
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:09,619
it might just be no default Lib so if

1401
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:12,210
you take a look at what happens here

1402
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:14,939
some of them are the ones that you know

1403
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:16,579
you are the ones we actually call which

1404
01:10:14,939 --> 01:10:18,839
are not very many

1405
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:21,420
it's these right here but then we've got

1406
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,659
these that we don't we don't call like

1407
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:27,899
float used security cookie gs handler

1408
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:30,149
check right and I didn't really want to

1409
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:31,829
quite get into that yet so we need to

1410
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:35,909
remove the C runtime runtime library

1411
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:37,739
eventually or we don't need to I would

1412
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:40,019
like to remove the C runtime eventually

1413
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:43,889
but technically I don't actually

1414
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:47,400
consider that a priority because the

1415
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:49,350
compiler expects it to be there so it's

1416
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:50,909
not really like a library that you

1417
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,350
choose to bring into your project it's a

1418
01:10:50,909 --> 01:10:55,739
library that tab has to be in your

1419
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:57,750
project and as you'll see when we go to

1420
01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:00,630
remove it you actually have to do a fair

1421
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:02,699
number of ridiculous weird gyrations to

1422
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:05,730
get it out of there even if you don't

1423
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:08,279
call it so not calling these you know

1424
01:11:05,729 --> 01:11:12,149
for functions or whatever isn't going to

1425
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:16,199
help us we will have to replace those

1426
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:19,409
and then have to do a bunch of crazy

1427
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:22,229
stuff to make the compiler stop relying

1428
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:24,779
on its library because the compiler is

1429
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:26,879
not made it they basically assume

1430
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:28,800
than anyone building with their compiler

1431
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,170
builds with their runtime library it's

1432
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,760
an assumption unlike all the other

1433
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,050
things that like when I say we don't use

1434
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,780
libraries I mean we don't pull any

1435
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:38,850
libraries in so we don't choose to use

1436
01:11:36,779 --> 01:11:40,649
any libraries but the compiler voice

1437
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:44,220
that went on us we will be able to get

1438
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:46,139
rid of it it's possible it's just it's

1439
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:53,100
not as simple as not calling anything

1440
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:54,300
from it insofar as if you had to do an

1441
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,260
encryption system would you use a

1442
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,079
library or write it from scratch

1443
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:00,090
yourself actually I do have an

1444
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:00,750
encryption system at work and I did read

1445
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:03,449
it myself

1446
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:06,420
cruza how long after getting gives her a

1447
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:09,420
number should you call text them I don't

1448
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:11,850
know I never picked someone up at a bar

1449
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:16,529
so I sauce the kid are you planning on

1450
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:17,640
doing user text input no Elven you

1451
01:12:16,529 --> 01:12:19,529
missed my question twice in the pre

1452
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,730
stream looks like it's not appearing is

1453
01:12:19,529 --> 01:12:25,259
there a math question like that you

1454
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:29,099
filter out well heck's chat might have

1455
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:30,960
one I don't but hex chat might you can

1456
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:37,860
debug LVM things using the visual studio

1457
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:43,050
in UI what is that link you're pointing

1458
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:45,389
to Microsoft mi engine I'm not sure what

1459
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,470
that is I also look at that later wooden

1460
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:47,820
vessel to compile all possible

1461
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:49,650
combinations debug virus the separate

1462
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:51,179
binaries but then only use the one that

1463
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:53,039
matches the chosen debug virus for

1464
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:55,350
faster switching is this a stupid

1465
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:58,079
question it is not a stupid question but

1466
01:12:55,350 --> 01:13:01,500
I would divide you to consider how many

1467
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:06,300
binaries that would be so I'll give you

1468
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:08,670
a simple example how many binaries would

1469
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:12,680
it take to just do the rudimentary ones

1470
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:15,090
we have put in here for testing right

1471
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:18,630
what has happened here why isn't my game

1472
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:21,739
frozen something bad has happened

1473
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,739
oops that's not what I wanted

1474
01:13:26,488 --> 01:13:38,129
ok so we have some kind of a hang here

1475
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:38,130
hold on a second where what is happening

1476
01:13:41,908 --> 01:13:48,569
tell me where my thread is it's in GD I

1477
01:13:50,010 --> 01:14:00,010
what what what did we do wrong here

1478
01:13:56,288 --> 01:14:02,259
we're hanging but we're hanging in oh is

1479
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:05,800
it just because I was doing this I don't

1480
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:10,269
think so why would that be the case why

1481
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:13,110
are we hanging in GD I I don't know

1482
01:14:10,269 --> 01:14:17,260
what's going on that was really weird

1483
01:14:13,109 --> 01:14:24,639
well anyway just take the values we have

1484
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:25,860
here boolean values 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

1485
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,719
11

1486
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:30,279
how many executables would it take to

1487
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:34,179
have all the combinations of those 11

1488
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:35,559
variables and if you watch a mate here

1489
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:39,458
regularly you should know the answer to

1490
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:42,610
this because just imagine each of those

1491
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:47,198
were a flag we often make our flag

1492
01:14:42,609 --> 01:14:49,779
fields right so each bit imagine of a

1493
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:51,669
number each bit can either be on or off

1494
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:53,679
ground chunk outlines that's bit 0

1495
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:55,208
ground chunk checkerboards that's bit 1

1496
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,998
recompute ground chunks on exchange

1497
01:14:55,208 --> 01:15:01,269
that's pit 3 I'm sorry with 2 3 4 or 5

1498
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:05,078
right so we would have 2 to the 11

1499
01:15:01,269 --> 01:15:06,699
different combinations right however

1500
01:15:05,078 --> 01:15:08,319
many we have there that would be how

1501
01:15:06,698 --> 01:15:12,478
many bits are in the number that says

1502
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:14,319
how how many executables we have right

1503
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:19,749
because you can kind of think of it as

1504
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:22,708
like these are the flags that we have

1505
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,708
we've got 11 of them

1506
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:29,979
or something right that all can be set

1507
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:32,769
right and any one of them could be set

1508
01:15:29,979 --> 01:15:36,369
you know this one could be set to you

1509
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:38,410
know on or off on off on off and this

1510
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:41,109
one would be like okay off off on on

1511
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:45,489
right off off this one would be like off

1512
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:48,909
off off off on on right it becomes

1513
01:15:45,489 --> 01:15:51,250
essentially a it's exactly like a number

1514
01:15:48,909 --> 01:15:52,840
each bit can be set to one or zero and

1515
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:56,020
you have every combination of all the

1516
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:58,360
bits so if you have eleven bits you will

1517
01:15:56,020 --> 01:16:02,260
have two to the eleven possible binary

1518
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:04,769
x' right now you all know what two to

1519
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:08,949
the eighth is probably right it's 256

1520
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:12,250
yeah so two to the ninth is 512 to the

1521
01:16:08,949 --> 01:16:13,659
tenth 1024 right which means that the

1522
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,539
number of binary is you would have to

1523
01:16:13,659 --> 01:16:19,989
compile just to do the basic debug

1524
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:21,760
switches we have right now is 2048 it's

1525
01:16:19,989 --> 01:16:25,500
not probably the number of binaries you

1526
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:28,090
want to recompile every time makes sense

1527
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:30,010
so that's why that's not practical it's

1528
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:35,850
because it's a combinatorial complexity

1529
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:35,850
problem and scales you know very poorly

1530
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:46,800
what is the end goal for the DWI like at

1531
01:16:44,979 --> 01:16:49,539
what point will we say this is done I

1532
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,489
have no idea probably what I'm just

1533
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:52,569
satisfied that you know we can look at

1534
01:16:51,489 --> 01:16:56,189
our performance and we can look at

1535
01:16:52,569 --> 01:17:00,479
values and some diagrams relatively well

1536
01:16:56,189 --> 01:17:00,479
you know he's add stuff to it later in

1537
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:05,710
case the debug variables header is

1538
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:07,150
messed up can we check easily if the

1539
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:09,550
debug variable is not defined it set

1540
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:10,839
some default value we could I'm thinking

1541
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,949
I probably need to do something else

1542
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,449
there though because it's just kind of

1543
01:17:11,949 --> 01:17:21,519
janky I'm not sure what I'm gonna do but

1544
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:23,019
we'll figure something out how would you

1545
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,460
implement your own string without having

1546
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:26,500
them be null terminated bundle the care

1547
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:28,869
start with a count variable yeah usually

1548
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:32,699
what I do is I do int count and care

1549
01:17:28,869 --> 01:17:32,699
star pointer that's what I usually do

1550
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:49,049
all right let's see somebody said here

1551
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:50,399
is the priest in question question I was

1552
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,329
thinking more about the handmade sort of

1553
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,710
case and subject that was brought up

1554
01:17:51,329 --> 01:17:54,000
yesterday and I think it would be pretty

1555
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,199
cool for it to happen because the

1556
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,369
knowledge gained by somebody who

1557
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,659
followed study and understood the

1558
01:17:56,369 --> 01:17:59,250
strangers were valuable in my opinion

1559
01:17:57,659 --> 01:18:01,229
the neighboring class a hammie degree

1560
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:02,430
could mean more than a college degree

1561
01:18:01,229 --> 01:18:03,539
you would also draw our people to the

1562
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:05,340
show the tricky part is that it

1563
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:08,039
organized it make it happen a couple of

1564
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:10,949
things occurred to me zero it's not

1565
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:13,109
feasible to everybody but a paper exam

1566
01:18:10,949 --> 01:18:15,449
somewhere near Seattle or one online

1567
01:18:13,109 --> 01:18:17,189
oral test via Skype calls tests could

1568
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:18,510
take an hour at first case who does it

1569
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:21,659
ask you question many areas conversation

1570
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:23,550
gets credit uh yeah I mean like I said

1571
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:25,859
it just doesn't interest me very much

1572
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:27,539
like I don't want really wanna be in

1573
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:29,759
some kind of position of like certifying

1574
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:31,769
people as like knowing or not knowing

1575
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,650
something my goal is just to put this

1576
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:36,810
information out there and then you know

1577
01:18:34,649 --> 01:18:38,849
I'm putting out like some information on

1578
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:40,260
a way to program that's effective and it

1579
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:41,490
does some things that are useful and to

1580
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,930
demonstrate this effective because I

1581
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:44,039
like I'm able to get things done in the

1582
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:48,119
short amount of time on stream or

1583
01:18:44,039 --> 01:18:49,289
whatever right but I don't really want

1584
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:53,909
to be in some kind of a policing

1585
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:54,960
capacity or in some kind of a like III I

1586
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:56,309
don't think it need to be any more

1587
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,270
formal than that like if people want to

1588
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:59,039
learn from it and they learn something

1589
01:18:57,270 --> 01:19:02,010
good from it then that's great but I

1590
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:05,069
don't think it needs to be you know done

1591
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:06,810
this or that I don't think it's

1592
01:19:05,069 --> 01:19:09,599
something that should be like rigorous

1593
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:12,180
sized nor do I necessarily know how you

1594
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,260
would do that even if you went through

1595
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,310
the links that you're talking about I

1596
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:23,520
think it would be still pretty tough

1597
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:24,810
difficult to do but yeah anyway oh maybe

1598
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,400
that's all that was happening maybe I

1599
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:27,810
was just clicking on something and then

1600
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:29,609
so it was just it was just getting

1601
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:30,570
