1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
so anyway start recording hello everyone

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,048
and welcome to handmade here are the

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,300
show Rico to complete game live on

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,330
Twitch no engine new libraries

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,370
everything is custom built from scratch

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,109
so we can see exactly how every single

7
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,839
part of a game works from start to

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,900
finish no mysteries we don't leave

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,129
anything up to anyone else we we go in

10
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,278
there and we do every last little bit

11
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:29,160
ourselves we basically are at a point

12
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,599
today where we were just about to debug

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,679
some stuff from that we did yesterday

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,439
and it has to do with how we're keeping

15
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:39,780
track of where players are where enemies

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,250
are in the world height-wise again we

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,399
wanted to kind of flesh out how our

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,689
system was handling Heights because even

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,549
though we're a 2-d game we want to be

20
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,199
able to stuff like multi storey rooms

21
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:51,509
that you can walk up and down in and

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,910
other sorts of things that have to do

23
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,948
with three-dimensional positioning even

24
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,898
though we're in a 2-d game and so we

25
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:00,539
were just about to debug the code that

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,770
we wrote yesterday to sort of treat

27
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,079
things a little bit differently in terms

28
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,219
of their 3d Ness and so that's what

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,640
we're gonna go ahead and continue with

30
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,170
doing today but before we do that I just

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,700
want to remind everyone that if you have

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,439
pre-ordered the game on handmade hero

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,820
org you should have gotten a link in

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,099
your email which allows you to download

35
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:20,579
the source code and if you want to

36
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:23,938
follow along with today's video what you

37
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:26,158
want to do is unzip day 76 is source

38
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,978
code out of the source code zip we're on

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,380
day 77 so we're using what was done on

40
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,640
day 76 as the starting point so if you

41
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,519
go ahead and unzip that into directory

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,400
you will be exactly where I am right now

43
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,929
and let's go see where I am right now no

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,329
during the pre stream somebody guessed

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,649
what they think probably the bug was

46
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,559
from yesterday and it did sound like a

47
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,719
pretty good guess so they could go ahead

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,868
and look there first but let's before we

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,200
go do that let's quickly just recap

50
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:57,090
we're you know what sort of the bug even

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,009
was like what was the actual problem

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,100
that we were seeing and what do we need

53
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,259
to fix and anyway what I started to do

54
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:08,699
yesterday was I started to make it so

55
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:13,340
that the entities would be tracked in

56
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,339
their Z so that they were essentially

57
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,989
they essentially had full-height

58
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:22,159
information in them and they were

59
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:25,080
supposed to be starting on the ground at

60
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,489
at the ground was supposed to be where

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,190
their position was and their height

62
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,019
extends up above the position now what

63
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,969
we would have expected to have happen if

64
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,560
we did that was first of all we're

65
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,800
seeing like the it does appear that the

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,360
guy is lower than he should be right he

67
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,890
should be stopping like he's kind of

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,420
sunken down you can see he's supposed to

69
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:44,429
hit this tree we're on the bottom level

70
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,568
here he shouldn't be able to go that far

71
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,670
into the tree so it looks like he's a

72
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:48,869
little bit lower down there same thing

73
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,639
was stopping here it looks like he's

74
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,670
stopping too early which means again

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,609
he's probably sunk down to the ground

76
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:57,509
since we don't have really a lot of 3d

77
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,709
rotation or anything that we can do here

78
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,759
it's hard to see that that's one of

79
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,739
things that we put on our to-do list

80
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,840
with to add some debugging visualization

81
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,219
stuff so we can debug this more easily

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,950
when we're actually developing the full

83
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,299
game so there's that and the other thing

84
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:12,659
is we're still colliding with the

85
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:15,090
stairwell properly in in all ways which

86
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,699
means that you know the guy is not

87
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,950
really where we think he is probably so

88
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,959
what I want to do is go ahead and look

89
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,789
for that bug and what the person

90
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,459
suggests on the pre stream and I think

91
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:28,949
is a very good suggestion was that the

92
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,250
problem is we haven't actually gone and

93
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:33,899
fixed are standing on the ground code to

94
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,568
take into account the fact that entities

95
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,250
have a height and so we are actually

96
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:39,599
putting their position down on the

97
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,329
ground but their position has to float

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,689
above the ground because their height is

99
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:48,480
sort of determined as a rectangle

100
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,250
centered about their position and so to

101
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,849
draw this out for you just to give you a

102
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,219
little bit of an idea what's going on

103
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:02,759
here let me go ahead and and move down

104
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:04,409
here to day 77 well the pressure is just

105
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,840
on the pre stream and what I think again

106
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:09,209
is a pretty good guess is that if our

107
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,639
entities look like this this is a side

108
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,259
view here right if our entities look

109
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,780
like this and they've got you know a

110
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:18,779
dimension the that's that's their height

111
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,100
here right this is their Z dimension in

112
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,358
fact I'll to stop saying width and

113
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,550
height because it's kind of confusing

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,529
what if I just said this is their their

115
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,780
Z dimension right that's how high they

116
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:29,929
are in Z

117
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:32,449
this distance here is going to be 1/2 of

118
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,780
that Z dimension right it's gonna be 1/2

119
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,849
of this and if that's the case then when

120
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:41,388
we say we want pretty people to rest on

121
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:47,330
the ground we really want their position

122
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:49,610
right minus 1/2 their Z dimension to be

123
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:52,579
resting on the ground so the effective

124
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,000
ground type for anyone is actually you

125
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:57,800
know the ground plus one half of their Z

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,589
you know what I'm saying that's where

127
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,300
the ground actually is the ground you

128
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:04,369
know is is down here but if we were

129
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,189
talking about what the ground was for

130
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,350
the center position it actually you know

131
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,459
if the the center would actually up to

132
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,400
be up here in the ground would be here

133
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:16,370
right you'd have to add that in so

134
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,560
anyway mm-hmm another way of looking at

135
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,540
that I guess would be effectively you

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,540
know we want to think of the ground as

137
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,550
being effectively up here right so

138
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,430
anyway that's a good suggestion for the

139
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,400
bug I think that's probably if not the

140
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,490
bug it is at least a bug and we can sort

141
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,978
of take a look and see we can fix that

142
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,840
probably pretty pretty easily if we go

143
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:41,209
down to where we're doing our ground

144
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:49,909
code here you can see that we've kind of

145
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:51,769
got the ground being specified as not

146
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,240
having taking into account and that we

147
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,219
have to do here for ground handling but

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,019
that was for other stuff or to do was

149
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,520
basically well it doesn't even look like

150
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:01,038
we did have it to do here this is just

151
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,859
something that was on our our our main

152
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,959
to-do list right which is which is how

153
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,050
do we do ground levels right so this to

154
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:11,180
do right here so ignoring even that part

155
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,740
even if this was the real ground level

156
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,650
you can see that we don't take into

157
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,240
account this entity rect at all when

158
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:20,179
we're actually dealing with the ground

159
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,750
level and so when we do our handle

160
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,720
overlap right that's not taking that

161
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,879
into account and when we do our our

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,919
stuff here where we actually do our Z

163
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,180
supported that stuff that's not taking

164
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,819
into account it either so basically

165
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,158
nothing is taking that into account and

166
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,899
so what I think we want to do is we want

167
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:40,339
to change this ground level into sort of

168
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,168
a synthetic ground

169
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,959
I just want to take a look at what the

170
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,279
handle overlap code actually does what

171
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,839
it does to the ground level yeah it

172
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,359
looks like what it does to the ground

173
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,978
level is it does this lerp here and so

174
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,410
what I'm gonna have to do is basically

175
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:57,379
adjust the ground level after we do our

176
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,240
overlap testing because the overlap

177
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:01,269
testing produces what the actual ground

178
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,699
level is and then we want to adjust it

179
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:07,159
based on the entities dimensions after

180
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,340
that fact right so what we want to do

181
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,600
here is basically say the ground level

182
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:14,929
equals wherever the ground level would

183
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,629
normally be plus we want to move it up

184
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:22,069
now right we want to move it up by

185
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:24,889
however big the entity is kinsey half

186
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,560
that distance right something like this

187
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,910
that's what we would want to do and

188
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,350
again that's just doing exactly what I

189
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:35,360
said in the diagram there nothing

190
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:38,870
particularly odd and so that yeah that

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,509
looks like that actually did put our put

192
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,168
our stuff back to back to reasonable

193
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:48,949
potentially although it does look like

194
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:50,449
now well that's still not quite right it

195
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:53,899
looks like now we're actually colliding

196
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:55,699
with the higher up entities so it's like

197
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,779
we have lifted off the ground oh well

198
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,019
you know what I wonder if we're actually

199
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:01,519
on the top floor that could actually be

200
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,409
yeah I think we are on the top floor so

201
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,079
it's hard to say I don't know that's

202
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,220
still not quite right I don't think I'm

203
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,199
gonna go ahead and step into that code

204
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,139
it's a little weird how we're colliding

205
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,180
here it's it's kind of a little

206
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,590
nonsensical I wonder if we will have to

207
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,180
add some debug code just to see this

208
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,098
because I'd like to see it a little bit

209
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,569
better than we're seeing it now let me

210
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,909
see if we're on the top level or not

211
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:27,560
yeah so we are actually on the top level

212
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:29,300
at this point and our colliding an up

213
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,728
and down is a little bit it's a little

214
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,610
bit odd you know I'm saying definitely

215
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:35,778
little bit odd but again we have one

216
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,788
other thing we need to debug which is

217
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:39,769
how we're drawing stuff so maybe I'll go

218
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:42,588
and debug the drawing stuff first too

219
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,629
and then we'll come back here and and

220
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,250
we'll make sure that things are kosher

221
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:49,009
but first before I do anything else I'm

222
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,419
gonna step into that code and see what

223
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:52,610
the ground computation is actually doing

224
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,319
just to make sure that it's somewhat

225
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,720
reasonable so let's go ahead and

226
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,149
and take a look at that so if we come in

227
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,769
here let me see what empty we're

228
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,440
actually moving I don't want to look at

229
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,820
the Monstar I want look at the hero so

230
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,380
when we come in here we've got the

231
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,839
ground level specified at zero which is

232
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:14,689
what we expect we have the entity's size

233
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:16,759
and that entity size is 0.62 so what we

234
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,720
want what we want to see basically is we

235
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:24,680
expect the guy if you know if if point

236
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,120
six 3/2 if that is sort of the height

237
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:28,219
off the ground that we expect the

238
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,620
position to be hovering what we want to

239
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,230
see is that ground level come up to that

240
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,610
and that is exactly what it does so

241
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,740
we're gonna go ahead and see that get

242
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,329
set properly so it looks like he is in

243
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,190
fact resting on the ground as we would

244
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,508
have expected so we at least fixed the

245
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,120
bug that the person the pre stream

246
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,850
suggested so let's go ahead and keep

247
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,509
going with that that may have been the

248
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,860
only bug and in that in the actual

249
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:54,019
collision side of stuff and it may just

250
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,419
be the fact that we haven't really done

251
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:57,948
due diligence with the drawing side of

252
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:00,409
things and if I go fix the drawing code

253
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:01,879
that will fix things but it's hard to

254
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:03,919
say so let's go fix the drawing code

255
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,318
since we know that needs to get fixed as

256
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,419
well now the drawing code is totally

257
00:10:06,318 --> 00:10:10,159
placeholder at this point which

258
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,990
unfortunately does make it a little bit

259
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,980
harder to debug because it's kind of

260
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,919
helter skelter but you know again you

261
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,028
can't you got to sort of take some of

262
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,198
the good with the bad when you're just

263
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,850
kind of working out how things are

264
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:25,458
supposed to go you don't want to spend a

265
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,870
lot of time cleaning them up all the

266
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,359
time so you kind of have to deal with

267
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,639
the fact that it's a little bit grumpier

268
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,500
to go in and debug it but hopefully it

269
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,089
won't take us too much time so the way

270
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,789
that we're doing things currently when

271
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,709
we do our drawing we do push bitmap

272
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:41,688
calls in the push bitmap calls basically

273
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,679
say we want to draw a certain bitmap and

274
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:44,149
we want to draw it at a particular

275
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:52,008
offset from wherever the entities

276
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:53,870
position is so what we actually do when

277
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:58,259
we go to draw the bitmap let me go ahead

278
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:00,899
and load that up here

279
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,329
there we go when we actually draw the

280
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,208
bitmap what we actually do it looks like

281
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:12,238
is we use sort of the upper left corner

282
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:13,888
to draw to draw the bitmap right so if

283
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:17,339
you take a look at what's going on here

284
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:20,909
we pass in an X and a Y and we go ahead

285
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:22,649
and we take that X&amp;Y and we expand it

286
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:24,629
out by the bitmaps width and height and

287
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,058
that is how we determine the bounds for

288
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:31,470
drawing so that what we're passing in is

289
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:33,808
the min the minimum corner right so when

290
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:37,259
we're doing this here when we say draw

291
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:38,938
bitmap and we say Center X center Y it's

292
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,589
kind of a little bit I wonder if that's

293
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:43,078
just a straight up bug that we never

294
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:45,779
noticed just in general if you look at

295
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,088
how this is drawing it's not it's not

296
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:49,798
the center that draw a bitmap that the

297
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,999
drub bitmap code takes because this is

298
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:53,458
the call that we're calling here and

299
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:55,979
it's taking the minimum corner so really

300
00:11:53,458 --> 00:12:03,948
what we would want to do here is we

301
00:11:55,979 --> 00:12:06,269
would want to offset that now maybe yeah

302
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:10,048
because if you look here what we're

303
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:11,609
doing is we're offsetting by our our

304
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:13,708
center point like the thing that we

305
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:17,759
picked as the bitmap centering point for

306
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:20,368
whatever this for this piece was but we

307
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:24,418
really just we never account for how big

308
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:25,859
the bitmap actually was so yet this is

309
00:12:24,418 --> 00:12:28,019
in no way the center point so I think

310
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:29,819
that's that's wrong just to start with

311
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,859
even just our basic stuff that we were

312
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:34,259
doing here for drawing was not entirely

313
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:37,439
correct so let's go ahead and think this

314
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:40,619
through a little bit more this code the

315
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:41,849
draw rectangle code looks like it's

316
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:44,069
actually working correctly so I'm

317
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,939
wondering now why did these things ever

318
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:51,538
line up at all did we bake in maybe we

319
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:54,058
baked in the offset for the bitmap to

320
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:57,088
get to the minimum corner into here

321
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:58,678
which doesn't seem maybe that's what we

322
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,119
did let's assume that's what we did

323
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,738
because otherwise we've got a bug there

324
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:05,038
so let's just take a look at what

325
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:06,629
happens when we do a push piece call so

326
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:10,610
when we push when we do a push piece

327
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:13,909
call it looks like we Tay

328
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:20,539
let's see your fix a little offset X

329
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:23,600
offset Y minus a line so yeah it it I

330
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:26,719
guess I guess this is our saving grace

331
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,399
here we're actually baking in that

332
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,819
alignment offset right in here so really

333
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,860
this is not the center X Center why this

334
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:40,128
thing this part of it right here

335
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:44,778
basically baked in that offset that we

336
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:47,930
needed to do yeah for for the bitmap so

337
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:48,889
that's that's pretty janky look I don't

338
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:51,138
like that at all

339
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:53,509
because that means that the rectangle is

340
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,129
drawing things from the center and the

341
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:57,079
bitmap code is drawing things from the

342
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,749
minimum corner even though they're both

343
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:06,308
called center and computed in the same

344
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:12,499
place that's pretty suspicious oh I'm

345
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:15,438
torn as to what to do here do I just fix

346
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:17,659
the bug do I just go find and fix just

347
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,730
the Z positioning bug or do I actually

348
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:25,068
pull this code out and start to make a

349
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:29,000
little bit of render stuff you know to

350
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:32,000
kind of clean this up a little bit it's

351
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,948
a tough decision it's a tough decision

352
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,230
I'm not sure what which one I should do

353
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:38,899
which means I probably shouldn't do that

354
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,720
good if it's a tough decision err on the

355
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,039
side of not changing things alright so

356
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,778
if that's the case then basically we're

357
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:50,629
baking into the piece offset there what

358
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:54,708
the actual offset is and so I guess that

359
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:56,990
should in theory mean that

360
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,308
yeah the entity's position since we're

361
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,278
treating the entity's vision as the base

362
00:14:58,308 --> 00:15:02,629
point where the guy was standing because

363
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,370
that's what we set the alignment to

364
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:06,079
since we're treating the enemy's

365
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,490
position as the base point it does mean

366
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,359
that we would need to displace that

367
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:14,629
position downward by his height in order

368
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,459
to get the actual ground point right so

369
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:20,178
what I think we want to do here is our

370
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:22,669
entity P we really want that to just be

371
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:24,019
a different point altogether than the

372
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:27,169
point that it is we

373
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:29,659
want to do are like like entity base P

374
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:31,849
or something and we want that again to

375
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:36,169
be whatever that entity position was

376
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,759
plus half of the entities dimension in Z

377
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:41,269
that same thing that we were aligning

378
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:45,139
I'm sorry - that we were aligning the

379
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,850
ground with we want to align the drawing

380
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,159
with as well because that's what we had

381
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,949
treated all of the rest of the of the

382
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:53,509
drawing as being based around right now

383
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:55,039
it's unclear that everyone would want to

384
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:56,568
do that but I think pretty much everyone

385
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,980
would want to basically hit be about

386
00:15:56,568 --> 00:16:01,610
ground points except for maybe flying

387
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:04,100
things so I don't know we could

388
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,639
introduce something later on which

389
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,749
actually does I don't know some kind of

390
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,610
does some kind of mumbo-jumbo that

391
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:13,100
allows you to specify where you want the

392
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,318
the drawing point to be based around or

393
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,028
something like this but it seems like

394
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:20,389
that's a probably a reasonable thing to

395
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:22,278
do at the start so let's go ahead and do

396
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:25,188
that for now let's take a look at the

397
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,899
empty key oops entity P and make sure

398
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:29,719
that's not actually being used anywhere

399
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:33,198
else it's not so let's take a look we

400
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,470
should maybe this guy should probably

401
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,909
use it as well for the shadow alpha even

402
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,819
though the shadow alpha is not

403
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:42,889
particularly interesting it's just kind

404
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:45,198
of a placeholder thing but if we want to

405
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:49,669
get the shadow alpha right we also want

406
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:55,719
this to be done in the exact same manner

407
00:16:49,669 --> 00:17:00,449
so that's n TP Dib dot Z right

408
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:04,230
initializing what is the problem

409
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:09,660
entity base P o because we actually want

410
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:14,940
that to be this we only want to subtract

411
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,920
out of the Z all right so let's see now

412
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,990
that we're drawing things properly well

413
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,519
that does appear to be have been the

414
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,029
problem now that we're drawing things

415
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,588
properly we do seem to be correctly

416
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:28,200
stopping at the location where we would

417
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:30,899
have expected to stop we do seem to be

418
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,340
able to walk through things the way that

419
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,530
we would expect to be able to walk

420
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:40,699
through them so that is looking pretty

421
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:48,029
good yeah that seems pretty good yeah

422
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:51,470
yeah and so I think the only thing on

423
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:54,089
that I would say is we are now back

424
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,890
assuming that that actually is the last

425
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,689
of the bugs that we had there we now

426
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,160
have to deal with our problem that I was

427
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,350
talking about before with the stairwell

428
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,019
where the stairwells will never actually

429
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:07,079
collide with because they only go up to

430
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:14,970
the exact height of the ground above

431
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:16,829
them so yeah let's yeah yeah let's go

432
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,000
ahead and do that so one thing that I

433
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:22,710
would like to do is take those

434
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,670
stairwells though and I'd like to add

435
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,079
two rectangles to them so that when I'm

436
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,910
drawing them I draw one rectangle at the

437
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,929
bottom and one rectangle at the top of

438
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:38,790
the stairwell in order to do that I will

439
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:41,610
need some way of offsetting these which

440
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:43,109
I think we already did so I believe that

441
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:47,819
what we did with our push rect is

442
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:49,529
usually that there's a offset here so ZC

443
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,809
I forget how this stuff works as I

444
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:55,889
remember it was all super hacky stuff

445
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:57,690
that we did entity offset Z miracles

446
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,610
time offices Z so basically what's

447
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,490
happening in the push rect is we don't

448
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:04,409
allow an offset see in the oh no we do

449
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,910
there it is it's right there we do allow

450
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,370
the offset see in the pushback so what

451
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,980
I'm going to do is I'm going to take the

452
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:13,709
entities dimension in Z and I'm going to

453
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,309
offset a second rectangle by whatever

454
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,809
that is

455
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:18,119
and I'm gonna go ahead and make the

456
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,700
bottom one be colored slightly

457
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,019
differently from the top one and that'll

458
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,690
just let me I don't actually know why I

459
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:28,920
stopped the game that'll let me figure

460
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:32,009
out those should be moving that's that's

461
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:39,600
a little busted that's that's not right

462
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:42,000
what's going on there why why has that

463
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,789
happened so we're drawing this one where

464
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,779
the Z offset for push rect but it

465
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,029
doesn't look like that's actually

466
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:52,730
getting used because we should have seen

467
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:57,809
those moving in differently basically

468
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:59,900
that is because so that is because we

469
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:03,179
don't actually mm-hm

470
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,519
yeah you'll notice our Z fudge here so

471
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,220
the Z fudge is only used to compute that

472
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:12,990
ground point but we don't actually use

473
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,850
that offset Z to actually yeah to

474
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,819
actually do anything with the X&amp;Y

475
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:27,299
otherwise right that strictly lifts

476
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:29,490
things up off the ground I say well I'm

477
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,200
not sure what we really want to do about

478
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,799
that then what I really want to do is

479
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,900
make two pieces basically push two

480
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,240
different pieces for the stairwell I'd

481
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,220
like to push a separate piece that's at

482
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,569
a separate location but unfortunately

483
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,569
that's not something that looks like is

484
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:47,789
really super possible for me to do again

485
00:20:45,569 --> 00:20:50,519
because this code is pretty pretty darn

486
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:52,409
janky and I'd like to leave it janky but

487
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:54,629
I just wanted to be able to get a little

488
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,220
more mileage out of it because I don't

489
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,350
really want to go digging around in here

490
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,750
I don't think it's super productive for

491
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:02,250
us to do that so let's take a look and

492
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,160
see if there's any way that I could do

493
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:09,990
something simpler that would allow us to

494
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:11,550
you know you know set things up a little

495
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,359
bit differently so the way that this

496
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:17,940
actually works I guess is when it does

497
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,619
that the set of pieces when it unpacks

498
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,740
them

499
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:25,529
it looks like it's sort of always does

500
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,000
the ground at ndu it could if we wanted

501
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:33,990
to we actually could

502
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,160
roll this in here like we could actually

503
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:42,380
put this in here right and we could

504
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:47,460
actually optionally use the Z offset

505
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:50,400
directly above so maybe we'll go ahead

506
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,440
and do that for now let's just see what

507
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,330
would happen if we were to do that so

508
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,870
let's assume that I took this out of

509
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:58,559
here

510
00:21:54,869 --> 00:22:03,779
right and when we actually do the entity

511
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:07,710
base PZ for that Z fudge right I'm

512
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:12,059
actually going to go ahead and I guess

513
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,829
would leave this in here when we do this

514
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,599
Z fudge I'm actually just going to go

515
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:17,279
ahead and add that in here so that's the

516
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:20,009
effect of Z of the thing whatever the

517
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:26,399
offset C is it'll actually it'll

518
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:27,720
actually get used now again this this

519
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,250
causes some problem so I'm not really

520
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,500
sure that I want to always have that

521
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:39,390
work that way yeah so that's that's one

522
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:45,900
problem right that's hilarious

523
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:48,390
that's pretty funny so I still don't see

524
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,519
where did that yellow guy went I don't

525
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,980
know that's that's pretty funny there I

526
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:57,569
don't think that was not that was not

527
00:22:52,980 --> 00:23:00,720
what I had intended to have happen that

528
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:04,379
was pretty funny so I'm trying to figure

529
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,380
out exactly why that is okay

530
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:11,130
is that that's actually because that's

531
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,900
in meters to pixels right I think based

532
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,420
on what's happening right now just how

533
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,650
much cruft there isn't here I feel like

534
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,110
this is probably a good sign that I

535
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,090
really if I probably am going to have to

536
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:23,429
go ahead and pull this out and actually

537
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,990
do some real rendering code because this

538
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:28,799
is kind of just piling hacks on top of

539
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,710
hacks at this point and you know it's

540
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,319
going to create more problems I suspect

541
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,269
for us then then it saves Russ Tanaka

542
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,740
dive in there but I believe what's

543
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:40,529
happening there right is meters to

544
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,420
pixels gets pretty x offset Z and we

545
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:45,259
want it

546
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:49,070
to not be right we want offset Z to

547
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:51,200
actually get x meters to pixels later so

548
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:53,839
that we can do the that multiplication

549
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,500
separately right so we would want meters

550
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:01,459
to pixels to just happen here oops like

551
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,890
so because me it's already that would

552
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,180
cause it to be multiplied twice like the

553
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,710
offset Z was getting multiplied by

554
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,840
meters to pixels but then it's getting

555
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,990
multiplied by miracles again when we

556
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:14,329
multiply that Z fudge in here to to do

557
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,370
sort of that that pseudo parallaxing

558
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:20,569
effect that we're using to see where

559
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:24,919
stuff is so there we have what things

560
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:29,269
are you know looking like I guess not

561
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:31,759
super sure how accurate it is there I

562
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:34,879
have to think about this a little bit

563
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:37,670
more carefully but basically yeah you

564
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,700
can kind of see what's going on here and

565
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,430
and if I were to go up the stairwell

566
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,960
which I guess I can't do at the moment

567
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,330
for whatever reason I'll have to go in

568
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,240
to bug the stairwell code Oh of course

569
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:54,199
the stairwell code is also going to have

570
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,329
to use that ground point as well so yeah

571
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,120
basically we'll have to debug that but

572
00:24:56,329 --> 00:25:00,589
I'm not sure it feels like I don't know

573
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,019
about you guys but it feels like this

574
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:04,909
guy is still in the wrong place right it

575
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:08,019
should be hovering above that guy when

576
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,019
it's roughly in the center of the screen

577
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:15,679
so I do wonder a little bit I wonder

578
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:18,109
about yeah I wonder about how we're

579
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,330
gonna do this sort of drawing long term

580
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:22,309
look what happens if I just kill this

581
00:25:20,329 --> 00:25:25,759
right now right and so that it's always

582
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:31,009
just using that Z fudge it's a little

583
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:33,650
bit weird because in theory that makes

584
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:35,119
it a little bit harder to do some things

585
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,160
but if I look at it yeah you know what

586
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,559
that looks that looks much more correct

587
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:44,390
so basically if we don't have the offset

588
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:46,369
in there if we don't have the offset

589
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,310
offsetting the Y anymore and we just use

590
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:50,839
it as a straight Z offset then it seems

591
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,429
to work relatively well but I just don't

592
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,829
know if that's gonna hold up because

593
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,390
it's all the art is isometric I mean

594
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:59,960
basically what that Z fudge is doing

595
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:02,149
right if you think about what's going on

596
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,460
we've we've sort of got a little

597
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:05,449
coordinate system happening here where

598
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,970
we're saying you know we've got

599
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,069
something and it's position relative to

600
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,259
the to the camera center is in a certain

601
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:14,240
location and what the Z fudge is doing

602
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:19,548
is that saying well the higher up in Z

603
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:22,038
the thing is multiply that vector by

604
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:24,168
some coefficient of based on that Z

605
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,138
height so as things get higher they

606
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:30,380
exaggerate their distance from that

607
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:32,028
center point right which is essentially

608
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,789
just a scaling effect so it's just

609
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:36,740
scaling making things more distant but

610
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:40,849
it's scaling them up when they would be

611
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:43,220
closer to the camera right and because Z

612
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:45,829
comes at you but there's kind of two

613
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,110
competing things here one is that but

614
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:52,668
the other is when we've got you know a

615
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:55,939
dude or something he is drawn up right

616
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:58,190
in Y right he's not really drawn in Z

617
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,110
meaning if he was right if if this is

618
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,028
the screen and he's standing right in

619
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:04,339
the middle of the screen you don't see

620
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:05,898
his head and his body directly under it

621
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:09,379
like hotline Miami or something like

622
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:11,750
that our art style is is this way which

623
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,880
is like sort of isometric right it's

624
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,769
it's rotated in this sort of false

625
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,419
perspective way because it lets you get

626
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:19,190
a better look at the character and its

627
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:20,120
face and so on and that's why you know

628
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,490
you do that instead of drawing

629
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:24,768
everything top-down so we do have a kind

630
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,298
of fundamental mismatch there but that's

631
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:28,250
just as something that 2d games have

632
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:29,599
always had to fight there's really no

633
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,339
wrong or right solution to it it's just

634
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,599
a problem that you kind of have to deal

635
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:37,519
with if you want to do the art style

636
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:40,490
that way so yeah so I think now I guess

637
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:43,849
I mean I think that is roughly correct I

638
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,500
mean and I can I can still hop up to the

639
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:48,949
next Z level just like we used to be

640
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,710
able to do there's no ceiling you can

641
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,240
just hop hop hop up there so things do

642
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:54,558
seem to be working relatively well so

643
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:59,359
maybe what we should do is just go ahead

644
00:27:54,558 --> 00:28:01,428
and and finish our stairwell there get

645
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,019
it collision protecting properly and

646
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,639
deal with the fact that it needs to kind

647
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:07,668
of extend up above the ceiling a little

648
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:08,750
bit so that we can walk back down it so

649
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:10,310
let's go ahead and do that

650
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,740
that seems like a pretty achievable

651
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:15,740
pretty simple thing so if I go ahead and

652
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,079
cure two handmade sim region again what

653
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:22,220
I think we have to do is when we're

654
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:23,899
doing our hour calls here for a candle

655
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,059
overlap and speculative collides and

656
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,140
stuff

657
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:29,539
speculative collide if you remember was

658
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,970
there to let us go onto the stairwell

659
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,500
only in circumstances where we would be

660
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,630
entering from the bottom or the top of

661
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,980
the stairwell and not so that we

662
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,930
couldn't just walk right onto the side

663
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,370
of a stairwell and pop up to wherever we

664
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:45,380
should be or down to wherever it was and

665
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:48,439
so if you take a look at what's

666
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:51,530
happening here that's basically using

667
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,230
that ground tight again versus the the

668
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:57,379
movers peasy so I think basically what

669
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,870
we want here again is probably to just

670
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,640
go ahead and introduce for our sim

671
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:05,209
region since we're using it everywhere I

672
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,920
think what we probably want to do is did

673
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,890
you just a call like get entity ground

674
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,380
point right because since everyone is

675
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,750
using this and I don't want to keep

676
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,780
computing it in everywhere because then

677
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,819
if I want to change it how its computed

678
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:21,799
it'll be hard for me to do that later

679
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:23,179
and to really it's not even so much

680
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,379
gonna be hard for me to change it in a

681
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,880
lot of places because that's not the

682
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,540
problem if to know where those places

683
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,430
are so what I'd like to do is I'd like

684
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:34,730
to go ahead and do a get MD ground point

685
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:37,279
call so that I have you know an entity

686
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,870
and that's just going to return for now

687
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,849
that thing that we were computing in

688
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:44,869
other places right so that's going to

689
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:48,349
return the entity's position and then

690
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:52,099
it's going to offset that position by a

691
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:54,709
vector that just moves it it it down by

692
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:57,379
whatever the entities dimension was in Z

693
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:00,890
again multiplied by that half to just go

694
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:03,440
half way the distance down and so that

695
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,180
way I'll just call that a call get enemy

696
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,950
ground point everywhere that we would

697
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,289
have been doing that so like any time

698
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,170
that we have that that dot Z in here

699
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:14,690
like here we'll just we'll go ahead and

700
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:17,060
say that that get entity ground point

701
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:20,120
call gets us gets us back the ground

702
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,980
point right and so let's take a look at

703
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:28,489
where we were doing that entity

704
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:30,200
z sorts of things so in here I guess

705
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:32,000
it's a little harder for us to use this

706
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,850
this is actually something that really

707
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,279
we can we can use primarily here get

708
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:49,099
entity round point so and that'll be our

709
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:52,548
entity that is the entity is it not yes

710
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:53,990
that entity there so really what we have

711
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:56,720
to do here if we wanted to compute the

712
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,640
offset using get entity ground point is

713
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,460
we'd have to say get entity ground point

714
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,210
for the entity and we'd have to use the

715
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:08,269
entities position and say alright we

716
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:12,019
want to move the ground to where the

717
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:16,759
entity is right so we want to basically

718
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:18,558
move to to that location so what we

719
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:24,589
would do is just take the two Z's and

720
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:26,329
subtract them there right and that would

721
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:30,819
let us oh well actually I guess it's the

722
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:33,710
other way around so let me draw that out

723
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:35,599
so I wanted to rewrite this expression

724
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,220
in terms of getting the grant to be

725
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,839
ground point the reason I want to do

726
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,490
that was so that I wouldn't have

727
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,869
multiple places computing it in

728
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,750
different ways so that way if I change

729
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:46,159
this I know it'll work right and so the

730
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,539
way that I was going to compute that was

731
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,640
I was just saying alright well I

732
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:52,279
essentially have an entity position here

733
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:56,570
right and I have an entity ground point

734
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:59,599
which is here right and so what I want

735
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:01,609
to do is I want to solve for I want to

736
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,469
basically take wherever the ground was

737
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:05,959
right so here's where the ground is

738
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,960
currently and I want to add something to

739
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:12,200
it that moves it up to where it should

740
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,850
be for it for the enemy's position so

741
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,960
what I want to do there is I want to

742
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:19,879
take the position minus the ground right

743
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,769
I want the thing that goes from the

744
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,679
ground to the position and that's you

745
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:26,509
know that's vector subtraction right so

746
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:27,798
I want it to be in that order and that

747
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:31,220
will give me that ground displacement

748
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:33,349
that I actually wanted whoops that's not

749
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,110
entity that's mover

750
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:39,199
there we go what are you complaining

751
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:44,029
about sir oh right we need to know the Z

752
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,370
of the ground point so yeah that should

753
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:49,399
hopefully restore are going up stairwell

754
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:51,619
code and it does but going down should

755
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,759
presumably still not work because now

756
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:55,308
our collision section is actually

757
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:57,019
working properly or at least we've

758
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:59,480
debugged as many of the bugs in it that

759
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:02,660
we could find so far and so what that

760
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,569
means is that we will no longer collide

761
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,890
with things whose max is right at the

762
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,240
ground level because that is something

763
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,580
that's technically on the floor below us

764
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,400
so what I think we want to do and I get

765
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:14,538
I don't really know but it's the first

766
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,890
thing that comes to mind but I think we

767
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:18,500
want to do is we want stairwells to

768
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,120
extend up above the ground a little so

769
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,619
that it's clear that that's something

770
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:23,808
that you collide with when you're moving

771
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,788
along background and so when we add the

772
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:28,490
stairwell I'm thinking that basically

773
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:32,298
you know we just say all right you know

774
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:35,120
whatever that you know whatever that

775
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:37,190
dimension was maybe it's just it's a

776
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:40,668
little bit more so it extends up just a

777
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:43,370
little bit above how big a floor is and

778
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:46,009
and you know see if that if that helps

779
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:47,389
us out and so again it looks like our

780
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:49,369
stairwell is working properly now we

781
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,380
can't get at it unless we come at it

782
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:55,819
from the bottom and then when we're up

783
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:58,640
on the top of it well close but no cigar

784
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:59,990
it's now colliding with it properly and

785
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,970
against its that yellow one now right

786
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,370
it's the top of the stairwell it's

787
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,798
colliding with it properly but it wasn't

788
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:08,960
really letting me get on to it it was

789
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,300
too high up I wonder if that's because

790
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,059
it actually is too high up

791
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,760
what was our tolerance level there so I

792
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:20,750
think what we what we need to do and

793
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,129
this is something that I wanted to do

794
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:26,570
before I think I even mentioned it on a

795
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:28,668
previous stream is I would like because

796
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,169
you know we're sort of this step height

797
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:31,819
and in fact I did exactly the step

798
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:35,269
height so you can see what's happening

799
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,750
that's pretty funny yeah you win some

800
00:34:35,269 --> 00:34:39,940
you lose some

801
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,940
so the way that we had our code written

802
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:46,730
was basically to say okay when somebody

803
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,219
is coming along and you know let's say

804
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,648
that

805
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,519
maybe I'll draw this diagram a little

806
00:34:49,648 --> 00:35:01,348
bit isometrically

807
00:34:50,519 --> 00:35:03,539
right like so so here is our stairwell

808
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:04,800
right when somebody is coming along this

809
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:08,068
way what we basically said is well

810
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,960
what's the distance here right what's

811
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:12,389
the step that they would have to take

812
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,740
from where they're standing to where the

813
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:15,239
stairwell thinks the height should be

814
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,919
and really I'm drawing these as stairs

815
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,269
but really they're ramps that's what

816
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,800
we've implemented we don't we don't

817
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:22,409
stair step down right now we've lied

818
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,000
down so really they're ramps but either

819
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:25,289
way it doesn't matter so it's a ramp at

820
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,300
the stairwell doesn't really matter and

821
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,400
what we were saying is well we're not

822
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,740
gonna let it if it's any more than then

823
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,240
a tenth of a meter you can't do it so

824
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:34,979
you've got to kind of come up here and

825
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:37,679
go where the stairwell is you can't just

826
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,940
hop down onto it right and I guess it's

827
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:40,889
arbitrary maybe we'll change that in

828
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:46,200
future but that's what we implemented so

829
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:48,838
I made the stairwell go 11.1 meters up

830
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,309
over the ground which meant that if you

831
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,358
tried to board it at the place where

832
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:53,608
you're supposed to you would be able to

833
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,559
it on but it does mean in theory that if

834
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:57,420
I left it that way you should be able to

835
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,519
get on it right at the sort of a little

836
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,130
bit further down it oh well I guess I

837
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,949
got to go up the stairwell first so kind

838
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,349
of right here on the side yeah and any

839
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:09,659
exactly what you can do yeah

840
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:11,280
so that's kind of busted and you get a

841
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:13,409
little popping there too when it kind of

842
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,970
goes up and down it so we want to fix

843
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,559
that and I think the way that I would

844
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:20,279
like to fix that something I mentioned

845
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:22,108
before I would like the ramping so the

846
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,630
thing that computes the position that

847
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:26,818
you're going to do I would like that to

848
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,920
be independent of the collision

849
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:30,750
rectangle so I'd like the stairwell

850
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,099
collision rectangle to be something that

851
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:39,000
can be conservatively large but then

852
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:41,309
that sort of you know so it so it to two

853
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,800
stories almost right but then when it

854
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:47,250
computes the ground it doesn't use that

855
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,740
it doesn't use the the position way up

856
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,900
at the top it just uses what it knows is

857
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:53,338
one story or some other value that we

858
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,720
could specify later like we could put it

859
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:58,318
in the entity if we wanted stairwells to

860
00:36:54,719 --> 00:37:00,629
be varying distances right so what I

861
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,460
really want here is instead of minzhi

862
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:06,119
see I really want it to be something

863
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:09,139
more like Minzy and Minzy plus the the

864
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:11,369
tile height or something like this right

865
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:12,900
but for now since I mean there's really

866
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,099
no reason not to and this will be good

867
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,510
because when we're doing our ante

868
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:21,960
systems it's just another thing that we

869
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:25,590
can look at we could just say only four

870
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:30,929
stairwells only four stairwells and we

871
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:33,059
could just say you know a total like

872
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:36,539
like walkable height or whatever

873
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:39,389
something like that right and then

874
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:43,289
walkable height it's just this right

875
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:45,179
we're taking the region's minimum Z and

876
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:46,320
we're going ahead and doing that so and

877
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,940
in fact we could even write this we

878
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,769
don't really even need a loop here at

879
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,200
that point if we've got the very

880
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:54,659
eccentric Y we can just use this

881
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,949
expression to say we basically are going

882
00:37:54,659 --> 00:38:03,179
to be however much up we go on the walk

883
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:06,029
we'll height right and so now when we

884
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:09,259
add a stairwell we can specify how far

885
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:13,380
up we want it to go and so we can say

886
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:18,930
that that just the best way to do this

887
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:23,030
entity sim dot walkable height that's

888
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:26,730
going to be equal to the gamestate world

889
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:28,440
tile depth in meters right so now it's

890
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,380
collision rectangle it's kind of

891
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,000
separated in terms of its height from

892
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,260
that from that walkable height oops and

893
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,019
that's got to be the region's light and

894
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,360
so I think that should should solve our

895
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,550
problem there I think let's find out so

896
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,160
we can still we're still blocked on all

897
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,980
sides of the bottom stairwell we walk up

898
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,779
it there we go

899
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,099
try to walk down it that's still a

900
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,340
little janky why is that

901
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:58,079
you can still see there's a lip what's

902
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,320
what's going on there that's crazy

903
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,059
check that out is that freaky or what so

904
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,740
something is a little busted there with

905
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:07,259
just just at the very end we've got a

906
00:39:04,739 --> 00:39:09,689
bug I'm not sure what the bug is but

907
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,940
we've definitely got one so let's go

908
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,590
ahead that's funny

909
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,220
let's go ahead and see what's going on

910
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:26,460
there

911
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:28,709
oh wait is there any kind of so yeah so

912
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,260
we've got two different computations for

913
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:35,970
the ground type that looks like what's

914
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:42,140
really going on here yeah so we need a

915
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:46,829
function which is gets their ground

916
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:49,079
something like this right and again this

917
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:51,299
is really good I really like where this

918
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,179
is going because again we're gonna have

919
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,740
to do our entity system at some point

920
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:57,269
and you can kind of see that we don't we

921
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:58,979
don't really have much built up we've

922
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,840
got some stuff but like the soars the

923
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,990
hit points that stuff the more stuff we

924
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:06,869
can pile in here the fattier we can make

925
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:09,059
this the better it will be when we go to

926
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:10,170
do it like we want as much stuff

927
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:12,170
happening with these entities as

928
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,309
possible

929
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,858
because that is what's going to allow us

930
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:18,809
to make a good entity system right if we

931
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:20,819
try to design the entity system before

932
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:23,070
having enough stuff in here we'll

933
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,080
probably make mistakes and have to

934
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,260
constantly keep redoing how we're doing

935
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:32,759
stuff and so you know essentially that's

936
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:35,760
that's really the whole thing about how

937
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,609
about how handmade entity dot h should

938
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,930
continue to grow just we want to start

939
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:41,250
having you know stuff that's very

940
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:43,049
specific to all different kinds entity

941
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,849
types so that we can see later when we

942
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:48,930
want to break it apart and make it more

943
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:53,580
usable and maintainable right so let's

944
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:55,829
see here so the region rect looks like

945
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:59,940
do we always have that it looks like in

946
00:40:55,829 --> 00:41:01,348
both cases we do have that although it

947
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,200
looks like this is essentially doing all

948
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:08,550
the same computations right these are

949
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:10,139
all exactly the same so I think we

950
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:14,820
really just want to make this whole

951
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:15,960
thing right am I right about that it

952
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,390
looks like we really just want this

953
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,000
whole thing to happen in here right so

954
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:21,659
we want the the entity to generate its

955
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,969
region rect

956
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:26,769
we want it to compute its very eccentric

957
00:41:23,969 --> 00:41:30,250
coordinates we want it to

958
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:31,809
can you know compute that ground height

959
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,510
but I want this is the one I actually

960
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:42,429
want right I want to compute that ground

961
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:44,620
height let's see and yeah and I've got a

962
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:49,629
pass in here as well

963
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:51,609
whatever the sort of the the standing P

964
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:57,309
whatever the place is that the Erlich

965
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:59,710
entity ground point right oh and that's

966
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:03,070
a bug as well so we have yet another

967
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:06,090
problem right this mover P should also

968
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:09,090
use that in both cases and it's not

969
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:09,090
right

970
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:16,539
because the theory we would want it to

971
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:18,250
always use that ground point again yeah

972
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:19,809
so this is good this will get rid of a

973
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:21,460
lot of bugs for us because this was just

974
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,960
not very good code at all because it was

975
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,369
written in a different it was written

976
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,650
with a different set of assumptions and

977
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:29,079
we want to kind of solidify that quite a

978
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:34,119
bit also I suppose this should really be

979
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:35,769
in here as well right okay that's

980
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,779
actually the 15-minute warning since we

981
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:39,789
started 10 minutes late so we've got a

982
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:44,590
fair bit of time to play with still okay

983
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:47,019
so this is good get any ground point we

984
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:48,579
know it is pretty much correct gets

985
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:50,530
their ground let's walk through this a

986
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:53,079
little bit more carefully we need to get

987
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,180
whatever the stairways region is we then

988
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,090
need to get the barycentric coordinates

989
00:42:55,179 --> 00:43:01,119
for whoever it actually is so entity

990
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:03,579
ground point will be done there we then

991
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,880
have to compute what we actually think

992
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:11,710
the ground is and then we have to return

993
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:15,700
it and that looks let's see let's call

994
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:21,159
this at ground point right like so on

995
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:23,469
yeah now I guess technically now that I

996
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:26,259
think about it that wasn't really a bug

997
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:28,449
I mean it sort of was but because we

998
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:31,420
were only using the Bary centric why it

999
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:34,329
didn't matter whether we were passing

1000
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:36,019
the ground point or not right so it

1001
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:37,759
wasn't really a bug

1002
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:39,559
it was a little hasty there that wasn't

1003
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,890
a bug that was just sort of a little

1004
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,889
sketch but you don't really need to pass

1005
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:48,319
that ground point I guess so really this

1006
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:53,420
could even be a v2 right you don't

1007
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:53,960
really care what it is and so yeah what

1008
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,579
can I say

1009
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:03,889
anyway so let's keep going

1010
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:05,630
so let's convert these two routines so

1011
00:44:03,889 --> 00:44:10,009
handle overlap this is basically just

1012
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:12,320
going to call get stair ground and for

1013
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,720
completeness I'm still gonna just call

1014
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,030
get entity ground point in case it would

1015
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,759
displace it in X&amp;Y some day you know I

1016
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:24,140
mean it could happen probably won't

1017
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,850
happen but you never know so I'm gonna

1018
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:28,400
I'm gonna go ahead and call call that

1019
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:31,009
anyway so past the region will get that

1020
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,730
ground point back this stuff can just

1021
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,620
basically go away entirely we are in the

1022
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:40,760
stairwell code again here don't need

1023
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:42,469
this don't need that and we can go ahead

1024
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,240
and I probably leave that needs work

1025
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:47,689
comment in because it probably doesn t

1026
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:58,729
work but anyway so what we want to do

1027
00:44:47,690 --> 00:45:02,349
here is is wonder why this why are we

1028
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,349
testing both of these things

1029
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:19,219
does anyone know why we're testing both

1030
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,659
of these things was that just because we

1031
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:24,829
hadn't worked out all the code before

1032
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:28,279
and so we were just choosing it because

1033
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:29,779
it feels like the only criteria for

1034
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,710
stepping on tor off of the stairwell

1035
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:41,510
would be how high you have to step right

1036
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:45,889
I don't feel like that code needs to be

1037
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:48,260
there I I don't get it so I'm gonna go

1038
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:50,809
ahead and and if that out temporarily I

1039
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:55,970
feel like that's the entirety of the

1040
00:45:50,809 --> 00:46:00,170
code right like it should just be that

1041
00:45:55,969 --> 00:46:03,709
it should just be that you've got to be

1042
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:08,210
within the step light yeah I don't know

1043
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:11,750
that that's that's all I got so let's

1044
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:15,190
try that first so let's do mover ground

1045
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:19,880
point people's get empty ground point

1046
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:25,690
mover we will then say mover ground

1047
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:30,769
point Z will compute the ground here

1048
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:34,519
gets their ground and we will go ahead

1049
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:36,590
and do move the ground point and pass

1050
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,340
the stairwell we should also probably

1051
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:41,510
assert here just for fun that the entity

1052
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,760
that we're trying to get the stairwell

1053
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:48,410
level for actually is a stairwell

1054
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,500
because you know someone could get into

1055
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:53,779
a weird situation where they try to call

1056
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:57,619
out in some other case and we don't

1057
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:00,890
really want that so yeah so that fixed

1058
00:46:57,619 --> 00:47:02,569
our problem that's a good thing and it

1059
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:07,579
does appear to be working kind of nicely

1060
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:09,380
now yeah that's really good actually we

1061
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:14,929
have tons of stuff that we are still

1062
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:17,030
doing kind of janky like I guess really

1063
00:47:14,929 --> 00:47:19,519
the ground height is the number one but

1064
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,620
yeah that's kind of nice what happened

1065
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:22,509
there that didn't look quite right

1066
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:26,579
let's take a look at what happened there

1067
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:39,670
I think that was a bug so we went down

1068
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:44,019
looks like ah aha so now now we see what

1069
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:47,950
the barycentric y was therefore it was

1070
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:51,009
because this is why taking a week off is

1071
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:52,029
rough I tell you it's hard programming

1072
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:56,170
all day and then coming home and

1073
00:47:52,030 --> 00:48:03,970
programming it really taxes your mental

1074
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:06,099
state but now I remember the reason for

1075
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:09,219
that is because we haven't actually done

1076
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:14,949
the work yet for speculative collision

1077
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:17,169
to handle exits properly right so what

1078
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:20,409
we want to do is know what the ground

1079
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:23,170
level we want speculative collide to

1080
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:29,679
know whether you're going onto or off of

1081
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:32,860
the stairwell right because basically if

1082
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:35,230
you're going off the stairwell then we

1083
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,780
need to know what the ground type would

1084
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:40,710
be on the outside of the stairwell to

1085
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:47,800
know whether or not you could cross it

1086
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:50,650
so you know do we want to fix that do we

1087
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,660
not want to fix that and I'm not really

1088
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:54,070
sure I guess I would say that's the kind

1089
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:55,809
of problem that does seem a little

1090
00:48:54,070 --> 00:49:00,660
tricky to solve so maybe we should solve

1091
00:48:55,809 --> 00:49:00,659
it let's go ahead and say that tomorrow

1092
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,780
looks like we did this today at least to

1093
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:09,519
the extent that we knew about it it

1094
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:13,269
looks like probably what we want to do

1095
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:16,509
here is say and maybe we can we can do

1096
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:17,980
these two things sort of together we can

1097
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,300
say need to make a sod constant of

1098
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,769
ground level so the camera can be freely

1099
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,210
placed in xena multiple ground level in

1100
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:24,070
some region that's the next thing we

1101
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:28,510
want to do anyway what we also will say

1102
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:32,670
now is concept of ground in the

1103
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:38,028
collision loop so it can handle

1104
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:42,480
collisions coming onto and off of

1105
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:43,440
stairwells for example because I think

1106
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,210
that's probably something we should

1107
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,190
probably get right it suggests that we

1108
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:49,289
want to move this into a little more of

1109
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,548
a primal spot in the way we handle

1110
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:53,160
collisions where we're thinking about

1111
00:49:50,548 --> 00:49:55,858
where things will go height wise and

1112
00:49:53,159 --> 00:50:01,739
disallowing movements that would be too

1113
00:49:55,858 --> 00:50:03,328
far height wise in transition so I feel

1114
00:50:01,739 --> 00:50:05,298
like that's probably the right thing to

1115
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:07,559
do so maybe we'll look at that tomorrow

1116
00:50:05,298 --> 00:50:08,849
but I think we're pretty much done for

1117
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:11,700
the day we did the thing that I wanted

1118
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:14,250
to do today they did actually both

1119
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:16,439
things I wanted to do today so we're in

1120
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,880
pretty good shape here I just I want to

1121
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,170
spend a little bit more time getting

1122
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:24,180
that stuff right before we move on to to

1123
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:26,519
anything else I definitely want to go

1124
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:28,469
ahead and and make a solid concept of

1125
00:50:26,518 --> 00:50:31,528
the ground-level stuff and we could do

1126
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:32,669
that you know we can we can make sure

1127
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,130
that flying things to go over walls

1128
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,650
there as well maybe we'll make ourselves

1129
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:40,079
be able to fly and so that we can see

1130
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:41,670
whether we can fly over stuff or not so

1131
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,019
yeah I think that's pretty good

1132
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,920
I think we should go ahead and go to the

1133
00:50:43,018 --> 00:50:48,719
QA let's take a look here I think we

1134
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,009
should go ahead and go to the QA might

1135
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,250
as well start it on time since there's

1136
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:56,250
no point in starting something new let's

1137
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:57,599
go ahead and do QA please fix prefix

1138
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:00,000
your questions with Q :

1139
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,380
so I will see them and please keep them

1140
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,750
the stuff that we did on today's stream

1141
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,240
programming stuff or on previous streams

1142
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,980
if you want to talk about crazy stuff

1143
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,739
like what's the best computer science

1144
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,179
NASA take or what do you think about the

1145
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:13,588
MacBook Pro those are the kind of things

1146
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:15,028
we do talk about on the pre stream so

1147
00:51:13,588 --> 00:51:17,429
come 15 minutes before our scheduled

1148
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:19,518
start time and ask those questions will

1149
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:23,098
we'll cover them then but for right now

1150
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:24,929
just programming questions please on the

1151
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,470
stuff that we're working on or that we

1152
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:27,469
have worked on

1153
00:51:48,778 --> 00:52:02,130
let's see not seeing much in the way of

1154
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,130
questions about what we are working on

1155
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:09,038
well I guess I will answer off-topic

1156
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:12,278
questions since we don't have any on

1157
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,359
topic questions but if we get any on

1158
00:52:12,278 --> 00:52:17,018
type of questions I will switch to

1159
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:22,869
answering those do you use clang on

1160
00:52:17,018 --> 00:52:26,889
Linux yes I do on Windows I use visual

1161
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:28,900
studios compiler around on on political

1162
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:30,248
aids clang I suppose I would also use

1163
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,108
clearing on the Mac but I haven't been

1164
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:34,718
shipping anything on the Mac in a while

1165
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:37,199
so I don't really I'm not super familiar

1166
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,199
with it

1167
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:56,820
what is the best way to learn C++ from

1168
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:58,740
absolute scratch on my own uh hmm I

1169
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:01,019
don't know I mean just spending a lot of

1170
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:04,019
time programming in C++ is really the

1171
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:06,389
answer you know you kind of got to start

1172
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:07,980
with some basic training so maybe the KN

1173
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:12,779
are the original C programming language

1174
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:14,039
book from knr and you know watching this

1175
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,780
stream and seeing the sort of stuff that

1176
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:18,719
I do and trying to figure out how to do

1177
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:22,380
stuff like that I don't I don't know of

1178
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:25,049
a good introductory series because you

1179
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:26,579
know was many many years ago when I

1180
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:29,340
learned and I don't even remember what I

1181
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,630
did to learn really like what my first

1182
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:35,039
reading materials were I don't even

1183
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:38,090
remember and I don't know what other new

1184
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,090
stuff has come out since then

1185
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:05,730
do you know anything about Vox pel

1186
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:09,960
programming no I don't think I know what

1187
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:11,219
a Vox pel is I assume that it is related

1188
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:17,369
in some way to a Vox

1189
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:23,189
all but I would I would not say that I

1190
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:26,940
have ever even heard that term I do know

1191
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:30,950
how to program a voxel engine but I do

1192
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,950
not know how to program a Vox pel engine

1193
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:39,569
what versioning and revision control

1194
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:44,519
system do you use I use the one a custom

1195
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:46,710
one that I wrote myself are you planning

1196
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:51,840
on replacing the stairs in your house

1197
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:57,630
with ramps so the interesting thing

1198
00:54:51,840 --> 00:55:02,970
about this ramp is it feels awesome to

1199
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:05,670
go up and down it it's so nice I think

1200
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:08,069
once we actually do some real rendering

1201
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,780
here it's gonna be kinda awesome just

1202
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,450
going up and down stairs it feels so

1203
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,970
much better than any stairs I've ever

1204
00:55:12,449 --> 00:55:17,309
gone up in a game before I don't know

1205
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:18,750
why that is but just something about the

1206
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:21,239
fact that you just goes up it and

1207
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:23,010
there's no it's just a nice slide it

1208
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,289
just feels really good you're like oh

1209
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,970
I'm gonna go down the stairs we I don't

1210
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:28,529
know it's like things and games when you

1211
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:31,139
do sometimes you hit upon something that

1212
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:34,290
feels good so I wasn't planning on

1213
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:36,599
having a ramps in the game I guess

1214
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:39,300
that's just first time implemented but

1215
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:42,000
it feels so good in the fact like a lot

1216
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,980
of 2d games lock you into Z motion so

1217
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,079
you you hit a stairwell and your guy

1218
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,789
like does some canned animation and up

1219
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:50,309
he goes and then it switches screens or

1220
00:55:47,789 --> 00:55:53,489
whatever this feels so good that I think

1221
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:55,590
we got to leave it in so we'll we'll

1222
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:58,109
definitely figure that out

1223
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,579
because that's that's definitely it just

1224
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:02,579
feels really good I want to be able to

1225
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:03,750
go up and down floors like that I don't

1226
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:06,139
think we'll be putting them in my house

1227
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,139
but

1228
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:20,710
how did you get the right side of your

1229
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:25,420
visual studio debugger you to be split

1230
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:28,240
vertically it's really easy basically

1231
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:30,309
when you drag windows around so like if

1232
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,528
you drag the modules window right if you

1233
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:35,680
grab this tab and you start dragging it

1234
00:56:32,528 --> 00:56:40,150
around you get an actual window right

1235
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:43,778
and when you hover over another window

1236
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:46,059
it it shows you like this compass rose

1237
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:48,130
thing and if you if you put it in the

1238
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:50,470
middle it'll dock into that window but

1239
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:53,950
if you if you do one of these other ones

1240
00:56:50,469 --> 00:56:56,348
it will split the window and so you can

1241
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:57,939
just split you can split things in any

1242
00:56:56,349 --> 00:57:00,369
way you want you can you could have as

1243
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,369
many different slits as you want you

1244
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:04,960
could have like four panes or two on top

1245
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:09,329
and one on the bottom or anything that

1246
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:12,548
so it's really easy to do of course

1247
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:14,769
there is a catastrophic bug in the

1248
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:16,989
previous version of Visual Studio well

1249
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:20,828
not for you sir in Visual Studio 2008

1250
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:23,469
where on many machines trying to dock a

1251
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:24,940
window crashes it and it's awesome

1252
00:57:23,469 --> 00:57:28,268
because in the Microsoft knowledgebase

1253
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:30,700
they're like yes it crashes we are not

1254
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:34,838
going to fix it don't do that and you're

1255
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:37,268
like awesome but so but assuming that

1256
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:40,750
you're using Visual Studio 2013 that

1257
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:43,139
does not have that particular bug so off

1258
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,139
you go

1259
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,680
why do you so many magic numbers in your

1260
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,170
code

1261
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,819
what kind of magic numbers are we

1262
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:01,180
talking about if you could could you

1263
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:04,769
give an example of magic number and then

1264
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:08,739
I could explain why I used it

1265
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:10,869
that was d25 inferno who asked that what

1266
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:14,259
do you think about friend classes I

1267
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:16,329
think that it's a waste of typing I

1268
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,540
don't ever use private so I don't need

1269
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:31,029
friend

1270
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:33,909
so yeah let's see is this turning into

1271
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:37,470
reverse doom almost complete 3d rendered

1272
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:37,469
in 2d instead of 2d rendered in 3d

1273
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:49,809
no doom doom is basically doomed doomed

1274
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:51,910
as a lot of sort of I mean do basically

1275
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:53,529
did sort of 3d rendering of wall

1276
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:55,509
segments right I mean it was like two

1277
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:58,300
and a half D so it kind of did this sort

1278
00:58:55,510 --> 00:59:00,730
of 3d view of the world and it was

1279
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,410
trying to approximate how the walls

1280
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:04,030
would be work to fit on it we're just

1281
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:07,529
splitting sprites so the sprites

1282
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:07,530
themselves are never going to be angled

1283
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:15,009
but you know otherwise we're using 3d

1284
00:59:10,989 --> 00:59:18,969
positioning so I think I would say we

1285
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:20,710
are 2d rendered in 3d and maybe they are

1286
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:22,869
3d rendered in 2d so I would have I

1287
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:24,820
would flipped your statement whether

1288
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:27,279
that makes it reverse doom or not I

1289
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:29,350
don't know that's one way I guess you

1290
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,000
could put it but I feel like it's a good

1291
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:34,059
idea to get all the 3d fundamentals

1292
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,619
solid because at the end of the day it

1293
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:38,199
doesn't take that long for us to do you

1294
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:41,019
know it's 10 hours 20 hours or something

1295
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:42,849
of programming to do it and then we know

1296
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:44,889
that we won't have any surprises when

1297
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:46,150
we're actually you know implementing

1298
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:48,339
stuff where we constantly will have to

1299
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:52,510
hack things if we can kind of get some

1300
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:54,160
semblance of stuff solid at the outset I

1301
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:55,360
think it'll help us now maybe not it may

1302
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:57,069
still turn out that because you know

1303
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,320
when you're in 2d it just it's always

1304
00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:00,460
hacky and that may be true but I feel

1305
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,930
like we should at least try because it's

1306
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:03,929
not too expensive to try

1307
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:32,309
let me see if there are any on topic

1308
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:34,110
questions here he's the top layer going

1309
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:37,469
to fade in if you go up the stairs into

1310
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:40,110
a closed room so I don't know we've got

1311
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:41,819
to do there for that you can see we've

1312
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:46,050
got how is this rendered kind of sitting

1313
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:48,750
there I don't know probably it will have

1314
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:50,190
to fade in that's a pretty good guess

1315
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:55,110
because I'm not sure what else we could

1316
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:57,240
do so I don't know that's probably what

1317
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,860
we'll do but you know we'll have to play

1318
01:00:57,239 --> 01:01:02,069
around with it so it's a little early to

1319
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:04,769
say definitively when do you plan on

1320
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:07,620
doing Z sorting with the sprites when we

1321
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:10,259
do the renderer so probably not for a

1322
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:18,389
long time probably not for several more

1323
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:20,250
weeks d25 or no why do you use so many

1324
01:01:18,389 --> 01:01:22,859
magic numbers in your code why not pound

1325
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:24,539
defines what's an example you've got to

1326
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:29,340
give me an example of a magic number

1327
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:30,570
first are you talking about this if

1328
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,820
you're talking about a magic number like

1329
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:34,680
this it's because it's not used anywhere

1330
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,180
else and if something's not used

1331
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:37,739
anywhere else then there's really no

1332
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:39,109
point in putting it in a pound to fine

1333
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:41,339
because then all you're doing is

1334
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,900
polluting the global namespace with

1335
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:45,450
something that should only have been

1336
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:48,260
defined locally if there is a number

1337
01:01:45,449 --> 01:01:51,179
that I'm using in lots of places that's

1338
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:53,220
probably something I shouldn't be doing

1339
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:54,929
so you should point it out and I can

1340
01:01:53,219 --> 01:01:56,189
tell you whether it's just an oversight

1341
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:58,669
on my part or whether there's a good

1342
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:58,670
reason for it

1343
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:16,219
let's see here are you planning to use

1344
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:19,249
advanced shader techniques if so which

1345
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:20,778
ones yes we will be using some but it's

1346
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:22,939
a little too early to get into that now

1347
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:25,838
it'll be you know a ways down the road

1348
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,838
when we're writing the renderer

1349
01:02:40,269 --> 01:02:44,269
looks like I skipped an episode in which

1350
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,009
you made a lower level visible from a

1351
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:47,960
higher one do you remember when did it

1352
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:52,310
happen is the floor going to remain

1353
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:55,610
transparent in the future so no the

1354
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:57,349
floor will not remain transparent it's

1355
01:02:55,610 --> 01:03:00,309
kind of handy to have a transparent at

1356
01:02:57,349 --> 01:03:04,699
the moment but we will put in a ground

1357
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:06,170
possibly very soon actually I don't know

1358
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:08,059
exactly how we want to do that but we'll

1359
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:11,329
put in the ground pretty soon at least a

1360
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:12,559
placeholder ground so it won't be

1361
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:15,670
transparent but we will have to do

1362
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,809
something like fading out the top level

1363
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,309
when you go down to the bottom level and

1364
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:20,960
stuff like that we've got to work that

1365
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:22,309
out and that's you know a pretty big

1366
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,559
to-do item that's that's sitting right

1367
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:26,360
here and so when we start to work on

1368
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,309
that will probably work on the we'll

1369
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:34,550
probably add some ground in there at

1370
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:35,989
that time but I don't remember when that

1371
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:39,610
happened to answer your question I don't

1372
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:39,609
remember when we did that exactly

1373
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:48,800
let's see Dee Johnstone 5 my previous

1374
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:55,730
question was on topic missed it maybe

1375
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:58,610
let's see where is Dee Johnstone yes I

1376
01:03:55,730 --> 01:04:00,579
did miss it it's there's a bit of a

1377
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:02,690
flood of questions to say the least

1378
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:03,980
correct me if I'm wrong but it seems

1379
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:05,389
early on we started with the bottom

1380
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:06,559
center position for collision detection

1381
01:04:05,389 --> 01:04:07,940
in our hero we moved to a center

1382
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,590
position which offset in both x and y

1383
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,880
now it seems we use the center x and y

1384
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,170
owner continues to competing the bottom

1385
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,079
center position do you feel this needs

1386
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:17,450
to be consolidated in any way so no I

1387
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:19,009
feel like if you remember there was a

1388
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:21,319
decision point I think was actually

1389
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:25,820
yesterday when we thought about which

1390
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:29,930
one we wanted to do and basically the

1391
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:33,530
decision was it's just gonna be a little

1392
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:35,239
weird if we constantly have to think

1393
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:37,910
about all of our collision routines in

1394
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:42,289
terms of x and y being handled

1395
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:44,539
differently from Z right so we wanted to

1396
01:04:42,289 --> 01:04:47,340
do is handle all everything uniformly

1397
01:04:44,539 --> 01:04:49,759
and then only handle the the one

1398
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,740
things especially that actually cares

1399
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:58,320
about that Z offset which is the ground

1400
01:04:52,739 --> 01:04:59,849
placement right and so that just seemed

1401
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,830
like a more sensible thing to do because

1402
01:04:59,849 --> 01:05:04,319
otherwise like when we did Minkowski

1403
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:06,150
sums for example you would do Minkowski

1404
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,190
sums on the X and y differently than you

1405
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:10,110
did them on the Z and when we dude like

1406
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,550
interference testing we'd have to do

1407
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,660
them differently on the Z like we

1408
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:15,000
constantly do everything differently on

1409
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:17,759
the Z and I feel like that math is way

1410
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,059
more complicated and we don't want to be

1411
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:23,310
in a position to force that difference

1412
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:25,079
on to the more complicated math of the

1413
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:27,900
collision detector what we'd rather do

1414
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:30,090
is have everything just be uniform in XY

1415
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:33,630
and Z and then handle just the ground

1416
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:35,340
point stuff especially so I think that's

1417
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,420
probably the right decision but it you

1418
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,670
know you never really know with

1419
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,930
something like that it may be that we

1420
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:42,690
look back on it later and go and that

1421
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:52,199
was probably dumb right and so it's hard

1422
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:54,329
to say what's with the floating head in

1423
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:55,919
the middle of the forest well that's our

1424
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:58,159
familiar it's a floating head it follows

1425
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,159
us around

1426
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:18,820
can you explain the line controlled

1427
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:20,500
hero's a raid count game input star

1428
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:22,330
controllers and hamate age because it

1429
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:29,769
looks like you're casting a null pointer

1430
01:06:22,329 --> 01:06:31,090
and referencing yeah okay so you are let

1431
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:41,230
me find the line you're talking about

1432
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:49,150
first array count so this is just pure

1433
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:51,369
annoyance it this really isn't something

1434
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:52,539
that should have to happen to say the

1435
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:54,789
least

1436
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:56,320
it's just unfortunate so what you would

1437
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:58,210
like to write let me let me show you

1438
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,070
what you would like to write here's what

1439
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:02,199
what was in there before right

1440
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:09,640
what you'd like to be able to write is

1441
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:15,299
this right that's what I want to say I

1442
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:18,639
want to say oops sorry array count

1443
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:21,789
that's what I want to say right I want

1444
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:24,549
to be able to say whatever the size of

1445
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:26,320
this thing is right which I'm not

1446
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:29,220
allowed to do and see whatever the size

1447
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:32,950
of that member is divided by the first

1448
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:37,629
one of it right but I can't do that

1449
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:41,199
because you're not allowed to take the

1450
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:44,230
size of just a type you have of just a

1451
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:48,579
member thing you have to have an actual

1452
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:55,240
type or an actual variable like an

1453
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:59,409
actual value so this is nothing more

1454
01:07:55,239 --> 01:08:02,799
than stick tactic nonsense to say hey

1455
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:04,869
mister compiler pretend that the null

1456
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,480
pointer is a pointer to a game input

1457
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:09,609
structure and pretend that you were

1458
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,760
going to dereference it it's controllers

1459
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:15,010
array then do the array count which is

1460
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,489
size of the thing divided by size of its

1461
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:20,079
first element what would that size be

1462
01:08:17,489 --> 01:08:22,149
because since the compiler isn't doesn't

1463
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:23,649
actually generate any code for a size of

1464
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:25,778
it just looks at what the size would be

1465
01:08:23,649 --> 01:08:27,759
and then returns it the pointer doesn't

1466
01:08:25,779 --> 01:08:29,680
actually have to be valid the

1467
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:32,710
can be completely bogus it just needs to

1468
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:34,900
be the right type and so that's this is

1469
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:38,560
just getting how to do a size of

1470
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:40,779
something that you don't actually have

1471
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,610
the value of I would like to be able to

1472
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:44,139
just state it directly but see doesn't

1473
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:51,279
provide a community to do that that I

1474
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:52,930
know of anyway to work around the

1475
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,819
mischief zoom issue how about you find

1476
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:56,110
the zoom level you want then draw four

1477
01:08:54,819 --> 01:08:57,849
dots one in each corner then when you

1478
01:08:56,109 --> 01:09:00,429
come back you can align those dots back

1479
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:01,810
to the corners yeah the reason I'm not

1480
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:03,400
doing that so then we'd have to go find

1481
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:07,720
the four dots all the time I want a

1482
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:09,899
thing that just like sets the zoom so I

1483
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:13,060
don't know

1484
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:15,429
yeah and pseudo named 73 pointed points

1485
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:20,080
out that if I wanted to I could use C++

1486
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:23,110
here because you can use deco type or

1487
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:24,489
type of I try to stay away from those

1488
01:09:23,109 --> 01:09:25,689
because they traditionally weren't very

1489
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:29,319
well supported they're probably more

1490
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:31,089
supported now but I still use a very I

1491
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:34,899
still use only the subset of C that work

1492
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:40,060
didn't like you know 1990 for the most

1493
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:41,589
part and yes I know you meant I know you

1494
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:43,270
meant deco type type of probably

1495
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:48,550
wouldn't help you there but but deco

1496
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:50,230
type although I don't even know if deco

1497
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:52,810
type helps you that much they're like

1498
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:56,739
how would you actually type it because

1499
01:09:52,810 --> 01:10:01,480
deco type yeah does deco type actually

1500
01:09:56,739 --> 01:10:09,479
help I don't know if it does I guess you

1501
01:10:01,479 --> 01:10:14,219
could do deckle type of game input

1502
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:14,219
controllers something like that

1503
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:27,179
does that work oops

1504
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:29,409
does that work sighs Oh oops do that

1505
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:38,550
okay so that's the way you could do it

1506
01:10:29,408 --> 01:10:44,319
you could do that end and and that oh so

1507
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:45,520
how would you actually so I don't know

1508
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:46,689
can you actually write it with that go

1509
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,190
play I don't know if you can cuz you

1510
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:50,379
need to be able to get the size of the

1511
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:52,529
lower one as well I don't know I'll

1512
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:56,170
leave that as an exercise for the reader

1513
01:10:52,529 --> 01:10:58,210
if then I'm sure there is some new C++

1514
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:02,500
way that you could do it but that's just

1515
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:04,710
fine for me for now so we'll leave it

1516
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,710
that way

1517
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:18,960
in C++ I don't think that works memo

1518
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:25,860
Zico is saying that could you do it

1519
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:26,789
array count game input controllers but

1520
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:29,569
I'm pretty sure that doesn't actually

1521
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:36,119
work does it yeah that doesn't that work

1522
01:11:29,569 --> 01:11:41,519
so that's not an actual that's not an

1523
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:46,680
actual option unfortunately deckle val

1524
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:49,740
is what you want so yeah so people were

1525
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:51,119
close with deco type if deco valid

1526
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:54,599
actually would work I don't know

1527
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:56,460
again it's sexual NFS doesn't matter

1528
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,380
this works and it will work even on a C

1529
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:02,310
compiler so it's kind of dumb to use the

1530
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:03,960
C++ feature anyway like it's like at

1531
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:05,789
that point we could just a pound to find

1532
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,039
a thing if we wanted to right we could

1533
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:15,300
pound to find a thing that was like you

1534
01:12:08,039 --> 01:12:20,119
know type and you pass it the type and

1535
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:20,119
you just pass it just does this right

1536
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:28,169
right and then you could in here say

1537
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:32,939
something like I want to reference the

1538
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:36,630
type game input and it's controllers

1539
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:39,750
member right and then you can do things

1540
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:43,829
like array account of that thing and it

1541
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:46,319
would work right so if we wanted to we

1542
01:12:43,829 --> 01:12:48,090
could do that pretty easily without

1543
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,479
having to resort to anything in C++ that

1544
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:53,640
may or may not be confusing as well so

1545
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:55,739
it's not that big of a deal it's

1546
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,440
probably just not worth even trying to

1547
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:59,670
crack open the ginormous C++ back to try

1548
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:04,049
and find the thing that maybe sort of

1549
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:06,230
works some of the time or whatever so

1550
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,230
yeah

1551
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:12,859
all right so have we come to the end of

1552
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:14,599
the questions where are we we got five

1553
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:18,589
minutes left there were a bunch of

1554
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:21,550
off-topic questions before I know if any

1555
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:21,550
of them need answering

1556
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,539
why do you plan on using OpenGL or

1557
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:31,070
DirectX for hardware acceleration is

1558
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:32,689
that something that you have to have

1559
01:13:31,069 --> 01:13:36,199
knowledge of actual GPU Archer to be

1560
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:40,069
able to implement I'm not sure I totally

1561
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:41,359
understand the question the reason if

1562
01:13:40,069 --> 01:13:43,909
you're just saying why do we plan on

1563
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,899
using OpenGL or DirectX the reason we

1564
01:13:43,909 --> 01:13:46,779
are using them is because they're the

1565
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:48,769
only way to access the 3d hardware I

1566
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:50,719
mean you're gonna have to use OpenGL

1567
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:52,490
DirectX or mantle basically they're the

1568
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,680
only API is that you have available for

1569
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:55,760
the most part and the reason that we're

1570
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,020
going to use them is because we want to

1571
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:01,880
be able to use the 3d Hardware to render

1572
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:06,200
the game so that's about that's about

1573
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,850
all there is to it modern computers

1574
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:09,710
can't really render graphics entirely on

1575
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:13,520
the CPU very effectively the CPU is very

1576
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:15,140
very underpowered for that task and so

1577
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,870
if you want to have a game that looks

1578
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:20,000
competitive and good you pretty much

1579
01:14:17,869 --> 01:14:21,920
have to use the graphics card so we are

1580
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,840
doing our own renderer as an educational

1581
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,460
thing but we will not use it as the way

1582
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,310
that the game typically runs for the end

1583
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:30,020
user because there is no way to make a

1584
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:31,970
cpu renderer that's nearly as fast as a

1585
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:36,250
GPU renderer that's just not something

1586
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:36,250
you can do so yeah

1587
01:14:43,739 --> 01:14:56,800
so what do you think of Cronos vulcan

1588
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:58,539
well I haven't seen it yet I asked if I

1589
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,690
could take a look at the spec but I have

1590
01:14:58,539 --> 01:15:04,750
not received one yet and so if and when

1591
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:06,219
I get a copy of the spec I will be able

1592
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:11,289
to say what I think about it but at the

1593
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:13,840
moment I don't know I would like the

1594
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:15,670
most minimal possible interface to the

1595
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,710
hardware that could possibly be I mean

1596
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,909
in my ideal world you just have ring

1597
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:20,260
buffers that you're right to and the

1598
01:15:18,909 --> 01:15:23,309
hardware reads out of and there'd be no

1599
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:27,130
driver at all that'd be my dream world

1600
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:29,470
so assuming that Vulcan gets

1601
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:32,140
significantly closer to that than modern

1602
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:34,539
OpenGL which wouldn't be hard it would

1603
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,800
be a plus so it's probably just a

1604
01:15:34,539 --> 01:15:37,090
question of how much of a plus would it

1605
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,739
be if it's really well designed it could

1606
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:41,710
be a very big plus if it's not then

1607
01:15:38,739 --> 01:15:50,099
it'll be an annoying but still plus

1608
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:50,100
right so I don't know we'll have to see

1609
01:16:02,429 --> 01:16:06,000
let's see

1610
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:20,079
anything else we got here what is the

1611
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:21,789
best way to build a game when you know

1612
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,059
how to program but you have no art

1613
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:26,739
skills hire an artist to do it for you

1614
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:30,360
that is my Achilles heel but I want to

1615
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:33,039
make a game on my own well if you don't

1616
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:34,210
have an arch to work with or don't know

1617
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,479
how to work with an RS or don't have the

1618
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:40,119
money to work with an artist make a

1619
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:43,289
procedural game there's a lot of people

1620
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:46,689
who have kind of done things that are

1621
01:16:43,289 --> 01:16:50,140
relatively programmer II art stuff and

1622
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:52,779
they were so popular so you might be

1623
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:55,270
able get away with it right so I would

1624
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:57,340
say try to do something in 3d with a lot

1625
01:16:55,270 --> 01:17:02,470
of lighting so that you don't need this

1626
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:07,000
good art and try to make the definition

1627
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:08,860
of what the graphics are much simpler so

1628
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,750
that that you don't have to try and make

1629
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:12,039
you know huge dragons flying around or

1630
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:13,930
something which you know it's gonna be

1631
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:15,340
hard without an artist try to make

1632
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:16,869
something that could be more procedural

1633
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:20,590
something that you could generate from

1634
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:24,760
code you know more directly I mean a

1635
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:26,079
simple example would be you know if you

1636
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,840
can do a game that's mostly with

1637
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:32,109
geometric shapes for example - or you

1638
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:34,630
know you can also steal someone else's

1639
01:17:32,109 --> 01:17:37,449
visual design like mini Metro would be a

1640
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:41,920
good example right like I don't know if

1641
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:44,439
you guys have ever seen this but like

1642
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,079
the visual design for mini Metro is just

1643
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:49,089
a subway map right and so you don't have

1644
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:51,579
to be necessarily a great artist to go

1645
01:17:49,090 --> 01:17:53,860
steal the design of a subway map and

1646
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:56,289
build a game around it that's a good way

1647
01:17:53,859 --> 01:17:57,699
to get around your limitations as of not

1648
01:17:56,289 --> 01:18:01,210
being able to do like high-end

1649
01:17:57,699 --> 01:18:02,889
production art or anything so that would

1650
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:06,399
be my advice to you is that if you if

1651
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:08,740
you can't swing the art see if there's a

1652
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:10,239
way that you can define what the game is

1653
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:13,840
and how it looks so that it will look

1654
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:16,210
good without art such that art is not a

1655
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,550
thing that it hangs on that's really the

1656
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:20,739
only advice I can give you and with that

1657
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:23,829
we have come to the end of another

1658
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:24,880
episode of handmade hero thank you so

1659
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:26,159
much for joining me if it a pleasure

1660
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,569
programming with you as all

1661
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:31,029
let me go ahead and close down things

1662
01:18:28,569 --> 01:18:36,549
here and save our mischief drawing so

1663
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:38,050
it'll be in the in the pack so I think

1664
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:39,250
we're in pretty good shape we've still

1665
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:41,949
got a little bit more work to do before

1666
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:43,329
we can really call our stuff solid and

1667
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:45,039
on the ground side of things they're

1668
01:18:43,329 --> 01:18:46,149
still a bunch of hand waving in there in

1669
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:47,409
terms of where the ground height

1670
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:48,609
actually is and some things like that

1671
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:51,219
but we're making progress we're getting

1672
01:18:48,609 --> 01:18:52,238
closer so I think that's good and then

1673
01:18:51,219 --> 01:18:53,920
we can spare men a little bit with how

1674
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:55,209
we want to draw the things in Z and

1675
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,159
maybe figure out a little bit the stuff

1676
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:58,149
we want to do there we're starting

1677
01:18:57,159 --> 01:18:59,920
starting to look pretty good

1678
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:02,979
I think we're getting we're getting down

1679
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,300
to it and I'm pretty happy where things

1680
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:05,529
are and it'll be fun to kind of move on

1681
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,210
to something new we've been working on

1682
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:10,139
this for a little bit of time it'll be

1683
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:13,000
kind of be fun to move on to something

1684
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:14,289
sort of different and so maybe you know

1685
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,909
by next week we can try to set our

1686
01:19:14,289 --> 01:19:21,488
sights on being on to the next major

1687
01:19:15,909 --> 01:19:23,050
area to tackle as always if you would

1688
01:19:21,488 --> 01:19:24,789
like to follow along at home you can

1689
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,380
pre-order the game on handmade hero org

1690
01:19:24,789 --> 01:19:28,029
and it comes to all the source code you

1691
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:31,060
can download it every night right after

1692
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:32,079
I finish coding in fact I upload it so

1693
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,940
if you want to do that you can do that

1694
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:35,829
here at handmade hero org also on hand

1695
01:19:33,939 --> 01:19:39,879
meteor or gar links to other things that

1696
01:19:35,829 --> 01:19:41,229
are good we have a tweet bot that tweets

1697
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,789
the schedule which is horribly broken

1698
01:19:41,229 --> 01:19:44,589
right now it's still tweeting in Pacific

1699
01:19:42,789 --> 01:19:46,600
Standard Time even though we're on some

1700
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:48,069
daylight time now which I realize is

1701
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,840
very confusing for people because it

1702
01:19:48,069 --> 01:19:52,000
says 8 p.m. Pacific Standard Time but

1703
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,650
really it's a p.m. Daylight Time so I'll

1704
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,079
be fixing that this evening thank you

1705
01:19:53,649 --> 01:19:57,609
for people who reported it so that that

1706
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,819
will normally be treating the schedule

1707
01:19:57,609 --> 01:20:03,369
in the correct time zone even though

1708
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:05,199
it's time right now it's not exactly the

1709
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:07,719
world's best made piece of software I

1710
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:09,219
wrote it in like an hour and you know a

1711
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:12,510
lot of that hour was trying to figure

1712
01:20:09,219 --> 01:20:14,829
out how to get curl to work so let's not

1713
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:16,360
let's not pretend that it's a you know

1714
01:20:14,829 --> 01:20:17,590
it's not going to the moon although

1715
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,670
apparently the software that they tried

1716
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:19,960
to grow the moon with also didn't work

1717
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:22,960
but that's a separate story for a

1718
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,579
different time anyway tweet bot normally

1719
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,569
free to schedule highly recommend

1720
01:20:24,579 --> 01:20:26,920
checking it out if you want to catch the

1721
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:28,179
stream you could follow it or you can

1722
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,529
just go to its page and take a look at

1723
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:30,880
the schedule at any time that's pretty

1724
01:20:29,529 --> 01:20:33,509
much all it does so it's a low volume

1725
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,130
kind of guy we also have a patreon page

1726
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:37,630
that basically if you want to support

1727
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:39,909
the video series you can subscribe to

1728
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:41,319
it's always very much appreciated

1729
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:42,460
we also have a news at forum site which

1730
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:44,019
has a lot of great stuff on it it's got

1731
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:45,069
an annotated episode guide made by

1732
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:47,140
people in the community that's really

1733
01:20:45,069 --> 01:20:48,759
cool you should check it out it's got a

1734
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,650
forums where you can ask questions about

1735
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,239
the series and so on and it also has

1736
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:54,129
ports to Linux and Mac and other stuff

1737
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:55,659
in advance of us actually doing them on

1738
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:57,579
the stream so that if you want to be

1739
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:58,989
working right now on a Linux machine or

1740
01:20:57,579 --> 01:21:00,460
on a Mac machine you don't have to wait

1741
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:02,439
for me to get there you can actually go

1742
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:04,569
and see what other people have done for

1743
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:06,129
the port's and follow along with the

1744
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:07,269
series on those machines right now so

1745
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:09,670
that's pretty handy however mint

1746
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:10,480
recommend checking that out if you're

1747
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,399
someone who's trying to learn from the

1748
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:14,859
stream that's really great resource so

1749
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:16,869
again I'll be back here same time same

1750
01:21:14,859 --> 01:21:19,449
place tomorrow 8 p.m. Pacific cent well

1751
01:21:16,869 --> 01:21:20,019
oh I almost see it's not the bots that's

1752
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:23,319
wrong

1753
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:29,530
it's me often times 8 p.m. Pacific

1754
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:32,529
Daylight Time 8 p.m. Saturday light time

01:21:29,529 --> 01:21:34,119
tomorrow here on the west coast I hope

1756
01:21:32,529 --> 01:21:36,420
to see you all there and maybe I will

1757
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:39,130
finally remember what time zone I'm in

1758
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:40,600
so I won't be as bad as the Bob the

1759
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:43,090
bottle be fixed but I'll still be wrong

1760
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,490
what can you do there's really no

1761
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:47,110
debugger for the human brain yet thanks

1762
01:21:45,489 --> 01:21:49,000
very much for joining me I hope you have

1763
01:21:47,109 --> 01:21:51,329
a wonderful Wednesday and I will see you
