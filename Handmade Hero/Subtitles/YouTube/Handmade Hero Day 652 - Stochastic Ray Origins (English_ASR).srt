00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,359
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,839
hero uh we would like today

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,240
um well you know

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,280
what is our w driver it is already

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,519
um we would like to today fix

6
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,000
we sort of have a bit of an issue

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:23,839
um which is that we would like to fix

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,278
what happens in our code in our lighting

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,160
um

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,960
we'd like to fix what happens when we

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,799
have

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,799
lights that overlap probe locations

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,479
and so we've gotten to the point where

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,839
the lighting is actually working really

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,919
well i i rather like it

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,239
um i think it's really cool

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,480
but the problem that we now have to face

18
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:50,000
is that we've got this sort of bad

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:53,119
scenario uh that occurs right where

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,480
things are in the world uh when lights

21
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,599
overlap

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,078
the

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
the actual probe locations where we're

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,640
taking our light samples

25
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,478
and to show you how the that is kind of

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
bad you can see that as this sort of

27
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,599
moves around as the glove kind of moves

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,439
around you can see that the light like

29
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,759
uh off center

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:18,719
so so for example look at the wall right

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,799
the lighting on the wall responds almost

32
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,798
it's like perfect right it looks like

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,840
it's tracking really well

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,520
um it it looks like it should and the

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
light plays across the wall very

36
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,519
satisfying right

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,118
um and that sort of

38
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,759
is it's really cool right it's complete

39
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,879
global illumination you know we we even

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,359
have this

41
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,118
uh in a more dramatic sense if you want

42
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,280
me to uh

43
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,799
give a more dramatic example of what

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,960
happens here

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,560
in the entity gen if i turn off uh we've

46
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,839
got this thing that that sort of like

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,600
adds lights to rooms

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,040
um it'll probably have a little more

49
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,280
logic to it in the future right now just

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,360
kind of like add some lights to rooms if

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
we don't have any lights and rooms you

52
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,040
can kind of see what i mean more

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,359
dramatically so you can see that the

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
global illumination responds like

55
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,800
basically perfectly i mean it really

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,679
looks great

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
um but the actual light

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,599
directly around like like the

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,120
the

60
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:23,439
immediate location of the light source

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,439
seems to like be very intermittent right

62
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,039
like as it kind of goes around you see

63
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,560
this like sometimes it's really bright

64
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,759
sometimes it's not there at all like

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,680
what's going on like why is it so bad

66
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,959
right around the light well some of it

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,360
probably has to do with the fact that

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,360
it's never going to be exact right

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,599
um

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
oh

71
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,079
sorry

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,039
i forgot about that

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,360
apologies

74
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,519
apologies that was funny i always forget

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
to change it i'm not sure why i even ha

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,439
i can see it like i can literally look

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,680
and see it i just forget

78
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,639
um

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
anyway

80
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,919
uh so yeah point being it looks really

81
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,878
good on everywhere except right where

82
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:13,119
the light is and actually although some

83
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,479
of that may be sampling meaning there's

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
going to be some

85
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,840
uh you know the lighting is never

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
perfect and especially when we're on the

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,120
cpu side we can only cast so many rays

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,800
if we move this other gpu we may be able

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,519
to cast a lot more

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,439
and so it might improve there but if you

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,959
look at how good the the global

92
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,519
illumination is it really looks

93
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,158
fantastic except for

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,640
right over the light itself where you

95
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,318
can see that sometimes it looks good and

96
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,359
sometimes it's almost like it's not even

97
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,039
there right like you can see here

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,840
uh and you might ask what's going on

99
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:49,039
there well the actual problem there we

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,200
have a uh basically a thing we don't

101
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,400
really know how to handle or maybe we

102
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,318
shouldn't say that we don't know how to

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
handle we at least

104
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,839
do not handle

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,080
if we go

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,080
uh to full cast we have this um

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
this part of the the function here you

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
can see

109
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,719
where we uh look to see whether we're

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,920
inside

111
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,840
a

112
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,438
particular light probe

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,319
whether a particular light probe is

114
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:19,680
inside of an actual piece of geometry

115
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,599
and if it is it does not do the casting

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,478
right

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
so what ends up happening here if you

118
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,240
look at

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,880
uh

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,960
debug draw

121
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,759
so i'm not sure

122
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,719
how we can really show this without the

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,800
screen being filled with garbage but i'm

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,840
going to fill the screen with garbage

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,439
anyway and i guess we'll just have to

126
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,399
live with that

127
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,279
um

128
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,679
so

129
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,959
basically like

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
here is

131
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,359
you know what's happening

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,360
so what you can see here is the glove

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
uh like in this case for example and and

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,240
you know what maybe let me uh kind of

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,319
get

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,918
uh at a level where you can sort of see

137
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,120
it a little bit better

138
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,839
um not sure how to do this exactly but

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,560
maybe something like in here

140
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,918
uh so if you look at

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,038
what happens

142
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:22,240
when the glove itself is

143
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:25,038
overlapping right it it

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
the probe gets eclipsed

145
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,079
right

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,280
um what's happening when the probe gets

147
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,758
eclipsed is that we no longer

148
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:37,038
can really take lighting samples that

149
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,800
will uh hit this thing correctly right

150
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:43,199
the light itself doesn't uh

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,280
what we would like is for this probe to

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,439
represent the fact that there's a

153
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,959
light right here that's supposed to be

154
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,199
shining out in all these directions and

155
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,758
and so there really shouldn't be

156
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
uh what you see here which is that the

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,038
sampling from the light

158
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,038
is totally unable to actually gather

159
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,800
and i'm not sure

160
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,560
like let me look a little closer it's

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,160
kind of hard to see

162
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,759
exactly

163
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,199
from that angle but maybe from this

164
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,199
angle you can see it a little bit better

165
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,318
so uh what you can see here right is

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,600
like the light probe itself is

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,560
unfortunately you know inside

168
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,600
so it can't really do much with respect

169
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
to that light and now we are missing the

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
fact that there should be a really

171
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,199
bright light here

172
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,360
now if we just move the glove up so that

173
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,400
or made the light smaller so that it

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,160
wasn't so large uh then it wouldn't

175
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,079
encompass and we would get totally

176
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
different results and that's a huge

177
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,560
problem

178
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,400
because we don't want uh

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,439
like like that's a that's not at all

180
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:54,959
what we want right we don't want to have

181
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,959
suddenly whenever lights

182
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,758
like um encompass sample air points we

183
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,000
don't want them to suddenly get dimmer

184
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,120
and you can see what's happening here

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,720
now all of you know we get a proper like

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
this looks more like what it should look

187
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,599
like there's light in this locus it's

188
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,119
exactly what we would expect why is that

189
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,959
happening well it's happening because

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,439
now you can see

191
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,799
none of these probes

192
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,519
are actually

193
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
inside the light volume all of the

194
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,918
probes

195
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,800
are themselves kind of outside right

196
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,399
of the light volume so they all sample

197
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,319
at least reasonably

198
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,560
well that there is a light there and

199
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,598
they represent it with lighting which is

200
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
exactly

201
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,360
what you would expect

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,959
so you can see why this is important to

203
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,759
fix because

204
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,719
you know we really don't want it looking

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,400
like that splotchy kind of

206
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,280
it's here sometimes and it's gone other

207
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,399
times a kind of effect uh we do not want

208
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,399
this

209
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,399
right

210
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,879
the question is

211
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,520
what do we do

212
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
to fix it

213
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,079
my assumption

214
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,520
is that since we already do a pass to

215
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,959
bucket all of these uh pieces

216
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,038
right like you can even see that it's

217
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,759
happening here if you look

218
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,658
uh when this light

219
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,838
crosses a boundary so

220
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:41,038
[Music]

221
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,279
that's is that going to do it i'm trying

222
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,199
to get i don't see yeah like there's a

223
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,240
boundary right there

224
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
um

225
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,200
you can see that we already split the

226
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
light

227
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,759
right into two pieces because what we're

228
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,838
doing is we're creating a spatial

229
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,039
hierarchy that it's like a grid it's not

230
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,000
really a hierarchy it's just a spatial

231
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,639
grid

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,720
that we can cast through

233
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,039
and we already subdivide lights so that

234
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,120
they fit inside these cells

235
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,599
which means we're already doing a pass

236
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,519
on the you know on all the geometry to

237
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,360
put it into this spatial partition to

238
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,519
begin with

239
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,360
and so the question is

240
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,240
could we potentially just at that point

241
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,480
take these lights and rasterize them

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
into the light probes

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,360
to solve this problem

244
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,200
that's one thing we could do

245
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,879
that's like an analytical approach where

246
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
we basically say okay

247
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,480
let's

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,240
when we're doing our insertions of the

249
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,200
light

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,000
into the spatial partition we could also

251
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,240
do an insertion

252
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,360
of the light into the light probe grid

253
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,560
where we add the light into those probes

254
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,879
that it overlaps

255
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,879
and

256
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,000
the problem with that approach is it's a

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,720
little bit confusing

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,519
how you actually do it

259
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,800
you have to come up with an analytical

260
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,480
uh answer right uh

261
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,399
where we're just gonna basically take

262
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,560
the and well i guess we could sample it

263
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,240
as well i don't know um

264
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,359
it's really hard to say

265
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,360
but uh

266
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,240
we would need some way of basically

267
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,159
saying look uh here is for this light

268
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,240
probe region

269
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,399
here is how much of the box is

270
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,360
overlapping and we need to translate

271
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,360
that into a lighting amount

272
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,399
and the problem is like that light probe

273
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:45,399
can still hit

274
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,399
so

275
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,199
so i'm just not sure and there are other

276
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,759
ways like we could introduce noise in

277
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,480
terms of the sampling location

278
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,399
so

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,560
meaning like the placement inside of a

280
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,278
particular cell that we're going to

281
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,359
sample the lighting from could itself

282
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,720
also be jittered

283
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,919
um there's yet another

284
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:24,200
solution to this problem

285
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:24,199
i don't know if this is a great idea uh

286
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,240
so an alternative solution to this

287
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
problem is to say that we simply don't

288
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,839
allow this case to occur and i know

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,480
that's a weird thing to say but actually

290
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,360
it's not all that difficult

291
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,759
if you imagined taking the light probes

292
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,879
and requiring that the light probes

293
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:55,200
themselves be effectively floored to the

294
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,439
location of the floor and ceiling

295
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,278
and then you clipped light sources so

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,560
that they were never quite that high

297
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:06,958
uh that would be the end of it right so

298
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,879
in other words let's suppose that we

299
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:13,119
forced all light probes temporarily to

300
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:16,399
be like lower right so they're like

301
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,720
you know down uh closer to the floor

302
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,480
and you know these

303
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,839
maybe a little higher uh but they're

304
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
pretty high already like we wouldn't

305
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
really care if that was how high they

306
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,040
were that that's actually fine it's not

307
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,320
an issue

308
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,199
um

309
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,200
so you know

310
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,440
we could do something like that where

311
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,759
the lights have to be

312
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,639
not where the lights are not

313
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,200
allowed to really be in those locations

314
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,600
they're they're effectively carved out

315
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,600
of overlapping

316
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,159
there are some issues with this

317
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,560
like the problem is that

318
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,919
you know you

319
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:58,000
you want probes to be roughly where the

320
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,719
things are that you're lighting

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,799
and so you're gonna have this problem of

322
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
the light will always appear to sort of

323
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,399
be coming

324
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,919
from the wrong place you know what i

325
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,879
mean

326
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,879
um so that's

327
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,759
a little bit meh

328
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,159
hmm

329
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,159
[Music]

330
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,319
i really just don't know um

331
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,839
i wish i had something better to suggest

332
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,198
but to be completely honest i really

333
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,160
just don't

334
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,159
um i

335
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,278
i feel like i should be able to think of

336
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,320
something but nothing really comes to

337
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:23,759
mind that's particularly logical

338
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,160
um randomized sampling locations

339
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,679
does seem somewhat

340
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,519
like a thing

341
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,120
by the way i like the spec lighting by

342
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
the way you can kind of see the specular

343
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
lighting happening there

344
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
um you know it shouldn't be happening on

345
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,240
grass because at some point we need to

346
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,519
send down some material parameters but i

347
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,639
like i really like the specular lighting

348
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,198
as a tool for later um like where in the

349
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,759
future where we could play with that to

350
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:53,120
have shinier or duller surfaces

351
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,360
um so i'm a fan of the specular

352
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
uh the potential for the specular

353
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,800
lighting uh even though right now we're

354
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
not really using it right

355
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,919
like

356
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,360
you know you can see why it might be fun

357
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,120
to have that that kind of a wash right

358
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
you can see like it kind of plays across

359
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
the floor

360
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,920
um

361
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
and you know it's it's not going to be

362
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,399
great because our sampling is is

363
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
not dense enough

364
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,958
it's not going to be as good as like if

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
we did

366
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,439
some kind of screen space stuff right

367
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,199
but i think it does add a little bit of

368
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
character and it's free

369
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:30,799
in our current scheme basically

370
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,559
um it's just one extra texture sample

371
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,879
uh at the time that we're doing the

372
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,919
lighting

373
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,360
to

374
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,879
because we already computed all of the

375
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
coordinates and everything and it's just

376
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,240
like well that's not true we did i guess

377
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,079
you wouldn't need the reflection vector

378
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,839
so it's a little more expensive than

379
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,359
that but it's on the gpu side and it's

380
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,040
pretty cheap

381
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,600
so since we already have the map lying

382
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,198
around i do think like getting that in

383
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,560
there so you can see that right

384
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,879
hopefully

385
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:00,078
um

386
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,078
i feel like that's pretty good

387
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,720
um but yeah like so so i'm i'm pretty

388
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
happy with like everything in the

389
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,590
lighting except this part of it uh

390
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:12,239
because i don't really know

391
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,000
[Music]

392
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,480
i don't really know the right way to

393
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
solve that

394
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
and i don't know that unless we jitter

395
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,198
like

396
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,359
jittering our sampling locations is the

397
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,599
only thing i can think of that would

398
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,560
cleanly solve the problem but it's going

399
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,320
to inject a lot of noise i would think

400
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,679
right

401
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,199
because

402
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,958
if we randomly sample our locations

403
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,039
then we could just make it so that when

404
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,879
you hit a light source

405
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:48,480
from the inside

406
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,559
that counts or something right and then

407
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,159
i think it just kind of works

408
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,239
i mean maybe i'm wrong about that and

409
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:56,319
that doesn't work either but it seems

410
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,639
like that would probably work

411
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,639
um

412
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,720
you know don't quote me on that but i

413
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,720
feel like that probably works

414
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,319
so yeah

415
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,838
hmm

416
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,838
i mean i guess one thing i probably

417
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,678
should do is to try jittering the

418
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,798
sampling locations

419
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,120
because

420
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,759
like if i

421
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,119
if that doesn't add an appreciable

422
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,519
amount of noise

423
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,678
then i suppose that would probably be

424
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,798
the right approach because it also

425
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,559
improves the sampling more generally

426
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,400
uh

427
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,160
so like

428
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,038
you know you probably get softer fall

429
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,640
off you you'd get maybe less of this

430
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,720
sort of thing

431
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,038
happening here

432
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,038
um

433
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,798
god this lighting looks so freaking good

434
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,880
like remember there's only one light in

435
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:02,879
the scene and it's completely dynamic

436
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
and it looks so good

437
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,038
it's just so good

438
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,519
anyway

439
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:22,079
um so maybe we could try jittering the

440
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:23,679
sampling locations inside the cell um

441
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,359
the reason i i

442
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,960
feel like that's maybe a little bit

443
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,678
tough is just because

444
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
i

445
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,798
i don't know how to sample the cell

446
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,798
i guess you just sample now i don't know

447
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,359
let's just try throwing white noise into

448
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,200
the sampling location

449
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,519
and we'll see what happens

450
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,519
um

451
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,279
i think what we're doing right now

452
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
so we we have some problems we'd have to

453
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,239
solve too so like if you look at what

454
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,360
we're doing right now

455
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,880
we basically just if you are inside an

456
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,479
occluder

457
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,000
we don't cast

458
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,160
if we are

459
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,558
so we do allow you to cast from inside

460
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,640
the light source i think you just never

461
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,759
hit that light source which is the

462
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
problem

463
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,798
so i guess another thing we could do is

464
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,720
have it so that you can hit the thing

465
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:30,960
that you are inside of

466
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
um

467
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,279
so we could try that

468
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,720
we could try that

469
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
um

470
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,759
so i believe the problem that we have is

471
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,720
that if you look at how this

472
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:01,038
box

473
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,038
um

474
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,798
this this is a you know intersection

475
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,000
code for the box

476
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,158
and effectively what it's doing is it's

477
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,400
computing the

478
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
the hit

479
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,559
uh

480
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,200
and

481
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:22,399
i believe

482
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,279
yeah like you can see so

483
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,400
so the way this works is it's computing

484
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,639
the minimum and maximum

485
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
hit

486
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,000
on the box

487
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,799
so my assumption is the problem here is

488
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,119
that it will pick them

489
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,119
yeah

490
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,600
yeah okay

491
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,639
so

492
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,960
if you look at how this code works

493
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,960
um

494
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,720
you know i realize it's a little bit

495
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,760
hard to read because again this has been

496
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,839
optimized so it's you know one of the

497
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,919
problems when you really try to turn the

498
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,199
optimization crank on anything

499
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,520
is that it becomes harder to read the

500
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
code it's why we don't

501
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,480
you know that's why i say like there's

502
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,080
optimization and there's like

503
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,319
non-pessimization and you always want to

504
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,119
of you know do the non-pessimization

505
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,960
right

506
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,119
you always want to write code simply

507
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,159
clearly and do the minimum amount of

508
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,000
work

509
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
but actual optimization where you start

510
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,359
turning the crank and like rearranging

511
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,038
things and eliminating terms and all

512
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,879
this other stuff where you're

513
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,038
actually getting more aggressive that

514
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,320
does make it harder to read so this is

515
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,079
you know going to be harder to

516
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:41,960
understand because we've done that on

517
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,960
this code right

518
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,280
so if you look at what's happening here

519
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,240
you can see that it's trying to take uh

520
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,359
the

521
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,720
the t values along the ray

522
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:05,519
so how far you've gone uh along the ray

523
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,880
and it's trying to take whatever the

524
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,960
minimum and maximum of those would be

525
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,400
for the intersections

526
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,400
with each of these boxes

527
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,240
so

528
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:21,439
you can see here how this proceeds it's

529
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,120
doing that on each axis x y and z

530
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,400
and then it's taking and it's figuring

531
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,279
out what the maximum hit would be

532
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,038
on x y or z and the minimum hit would be

533
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,079
on x y or z

534
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:37,919
uh and then this t valid check is saying

535
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:40,798
if the minimum is greater than zero

536
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,759
uh and the and then the min and the max

537
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:46,079
you know uh they have to be spread i

538
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:49,119
believe

539
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:51,439
this term right here is the thing that

540
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,599
would prevent us from

541
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,558
casting from the inside

542
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,119
right

543
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,119
because

544
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,120
this

545
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,359
is saying that the minimum hit

546
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,719
has to be

547
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,719
forward from the origin

548
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,359
yeah uh

549
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,798
meaning the origin of the ray that's

550
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,558
we're casting out

551
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,279
we have to have gone

552
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:19,200
in the direction of the ray we cannot go

553
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,038
backwards along the ray

554
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,120
uh if the minimum hit would have been

555
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,519
then we're inside

556
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,558
now that means we're effectively already

557
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,960
testing for whether we're inside or not

558
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,759
and so what maybe is the correct thing

559
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,200
to do here is to change this to say

560
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,200
let's just remember that we were

561
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,240
and deal with it later

562
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,038
um

563
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,480
you know maybe that's the start to

564
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,480
making this work well

565
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
and again i'm i'm saying maybe right i

566
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,119
don't know

567
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,400
um but maybe that's what we should be

568
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,479
doing

569
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,798
so if that was what we're going to do

570
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,000
then we wouldn't bother with this

571
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:05,679
right so this would simply not occur

572
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,278
so we're not going to do that uh instead

573
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,360
uh we're

574
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,679
we're in in fact i guess we're just

575
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:15,678
going to clip all the way down to here

576
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,120
right so we're always going to cast from

577
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,600
inside of everything

578
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,278
and if we run that code then the first

579
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,839
problem that we're going to get and you

580
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:28,240
can see it already right is that now the

581
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,399
thing that this was designed to prevent

582
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,038
uh which is that in you know the

583
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,440
interior probes like probes in here are

584
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,720
now able to see lighting from the other

585
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,759
side right

586
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,440
now you can't really see it that well

587
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,960
you know and maybe you know looking at

588
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,480
it maybe that's just you could just

589
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,440
leave it that way maybe that's not a

590
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
huge deal i don't know we'd have to put

591
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,000
lights back in the world i'd probably

592
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,038
turn lights back on to make that

593
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,319
decision um but now we're able to hit

594
00:24:53,038 --> 00:25:00,720
those uh when we're casting right

595
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:03,439
but we also now are so they're able to

596
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,120
cast outward but we haven't actually

597
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,278
done anything about the problem of this

598
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,599
light because the light

599
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,558
it's never going to gather

600
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,439
from

601
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:17,200
something that it cast inside of because

602
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,880
this code is going to prevent it

603
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,600
okay

604
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,840
um so now we have this problem of well

605
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,439
we would like to sample

606
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,720
uh

607
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,400
this hit this t-min hit right

608
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,519
we'd like to do that

609
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,840
and the problem is now uh we we just

610
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:39,519
need to track this so the first thing we

611
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:42,399
might say is well okay so the tmin and

612
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,240
tmax have to go in the right order

613
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
all right so maybe we're talking about

614
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
something like this

615
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,759
and this is like

616
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,440
t inside

617
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,200
yeah

618
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,440
you know what i mean

619
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,440
um

620
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,839
and to be honest i don't know uh about

621
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,079
this part here

622
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,079
um

623
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:10,158
but basically i think what we want is

624
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,480
something more like

625
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,480
this

626
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,240
you know what i'm saying

627
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,759
so our our test would be the t-min has

628
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,038
to be less than the t-max because if

629
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,278
it's not then it's not a valid

630
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,359
intersection anyway right

631
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,440
the t-max has to be greater than zero

632
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,038
because otherwise the hit is completely

633
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,360
behind us

634
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:42,640
completely we're not inside it it's just

635
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,959
behind us in the opposite ray direction

636
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,360
uh and we want to make sure that it is

637
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,240
the closer hit so if we already had a

638
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:53,119
hit that was closer than this one right

639
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,000
uh we we wouldn't want to use this one

640
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:59,199
as our hit

641
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,319
and so this now allows us to cast from

642
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,798
inside i would argue this term is not

643
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:07,519
used yet uh and will create problems for

644
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,119
us i would argue

645
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,440
i mean i don't know that but i believe

646
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,439
it will

647
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,519
so now we should be able to cast inside

648
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,399
and the light itself uh

649
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,079
we should be able to hit but we've got

650
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,918
one more problem

651
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,558
which is that the normal will be

652
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,640
pointing in the wrong direction

653
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:33,038
and i don't actually know what happens

654
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,640
now with the light in that regard so

655
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,879
whether or not this is actually testing

656
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,399
what i want to test i'm not sure

657
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,679
um

658
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,759
but

659
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,798
uh

660
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:49,000
i think it would be

661
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:49,000
i'm not i'm not entirely sure

662
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,840
so let's take a look

663
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,440
so you can see like it's it's not doing

664
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,440
what i want like it's it is actually

665
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,038
doing the cast but the cast it's

666
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
treating this as if it was an occluder

667
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:25,599
like do you see how they all went dark

668
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,840
um so something about the way that that

669
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:32,558
is working is broken and i'm

670
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,678
not sure exactly what's going on i

671
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,558
assume this code is working

672
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,960
uh

673
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:42,319
but i guess i don't actually know what i

674
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,319
should probably test first

675
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,319
is

676
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:53,839
well i guess i know it must be working

677
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,278
right because if it wasn't working

678
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,798
and you weren't hitting the light it

679
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,839
wouldn't go dark it would just hit

680
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:59,839
something right

681
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,360
so i believe this code must be working

682
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,439
but the question is why is it black it

683
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,119
should be picking up the emission

684
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,798
i would think

685
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,319
but

686
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,558
it doesn't appear to

687
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,798
so i'm not sure what's going on there

688
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,480
why would that be because this this hit

689
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,158
emission

690
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,679
um it should have picked up leif is

691
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:25,000
emission

692
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,000
um i would have thought

693
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,798
hmm

694
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,880
interesting

695
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:41,200
so let's take a look uh no i i'm not

696
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,399
assuming t i must this is not used at

697
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,399
the moment um

698
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,759
i'm saving that for later

699
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,918
so this what i'm assuming though is if

700
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,200
you hit an emitter i would have assumed

701
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
that it doesn't matter what direction

702
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
the normal is facing i would have

703
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,479
thought that would have provided

704
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
emission to you

705
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,399
because something hit will be true

706
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,038
i

707
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,038
i would think

708
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:25,119
i guess i don't actually know what is

709
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,119
this about

710
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,519
oh i know this is for selecting the

711
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,158
normal

712
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,918
yeah so anyway uh if something was hit

713
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,720
we come down in here

714
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,320
and uh and we use this code we really

715
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,759
should rewrite this code probably to be

716
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,720
just ray bundles now because i think

717
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,119
that would be

718
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,240
the the more efficient way to do it

719
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:49,038
um but you know it is what it is for now

720
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,880
anyway uh so we come down here and we we

721
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,839
try to figure out like where we hit this

722
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,039
thing and blah blah blah we do like you

723
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:59,918
know we we do the occlusion

724
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:02,240
and we do all this stuff but i thought

725
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,278
like this computes the normal

726
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,120
right

727
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,119
um

728
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,299
and all that garbage

729
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,719
we

730
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,519
[Music]

731
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,360
then

732
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,798
when we come down here my assumption was

733
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,798
that we don't use any of that because

734
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,558
it's an emitter so my assumption would

735
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,558
be that it would just use the emission

736
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:20,158
level right like the emission level is

737
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,720
here

738
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,240
we do ray weight times transmission

739
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,579
level

740
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,650
um

741
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:27,649
[Music]

742
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,759
times the hit ref color

743
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:42,079
which yeah i mean is is just it's just

744
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:45,278
the color of the light right

745
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:47,599
so i'm pretty sure this is fine like the

746
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,159
right because the emission level

747
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,439
um is going to override the reflective

748
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,440
light here submission

749
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,599
i

750
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,039
so

751
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:03,038
that should just work i thought

752
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:06,480
but i'm obviously wrong and i'm not sure

753
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,480
why i am wrong

754
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,319
um

755
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,319
although

756
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,558
i i guess i can think of one it's a bit

757
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,720
of a long shot but i can think of one

758
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:26,398
way this could be wrong

759
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,399
uh off the top of my head which is that

760
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,398
this

761
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,240
um

762
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,678
this h-comp

763
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,440
uh this this nonsense here might have

764
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:17,599
something to do with it right

765
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,600
so basically the hcomp

766
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,119
is doing a min pause epu16

767
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,519
the

768
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,798
okay

769
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,319
if something in here were to be negative

770
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,639
right

771
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,720
that would

772
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,320
be the thing that

773
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,200
ruins it for you

774
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,960
right

775
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,440
so in here

776
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,399
i guess what you would have to say

777
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,720
is

778
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,719
like

779
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,119
if we're going to pick we've picked a

780
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,960
mask already at this point so

781
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,959
you would need something like

782
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,398
like that

783
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,398
you would need to say okay the the

784
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,918
minimum t value we're now gonna like

785
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,759
clamp it

786
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,759
uh so that it can't go below zero

787
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,039
um that would allow it to still get

788
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,838
picked right

789
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,838
um

790
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,838
okay

791
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,000
and so i guess at least i'm slightly

792
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:45,039
gratified that hey that does appear to

793
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,358
sort of solve the problem although uh i

794
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,000
mean not it doesn't solve our lighting

795
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,918
problem but it solves the problem of

796
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,760
the light not getting found when it

797
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,039
overlaps the probes like now you can see

798
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,839
that clearly worked right like it's much

799
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:01,440
brighter around the probe now it's also

800
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,920
kind of wrong

801
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,079
because like i said before now what will

802
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,440
have the opposite problem which is that

803
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,920
if the glove is not overlapping anything

804
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,838
it will be much less bright than if it

805
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,960
is because as soon as it overlaps a

806
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,639
probe

807
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,119
everything that comes out of that probe

808
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,639
hits that light

809
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,160
and then as soon as it

810
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,879
comes out of that

811
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,039
it's not right

812
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,880
so this is why i was saying there's no

813
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,400
good solution if i you know if this i

814
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,838
thought was going to work just doing

815
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,599
that i would have said oh that's the

816
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,199
solution so you can see why i think

817
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,838
there's a problem with it and it looks

818
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,199
like that in practice this is why i say

819
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,199
we might have to jitter the sampling

820
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,639
locations but i think it'll add too much

821
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,399
noise if we jitter the sampling

822
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,358
locations then you wouldn't get that

823
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,880
because you would only see sometimes

824
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,000
from inside

825
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,160
the light

826
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,159
right

827
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,519
okay so the question though is also how

828
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,000
much work would we have to do with t

829
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,920
inside to make this thing work okay

830
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,519
surprisingly we're not really getting

831
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,838
any light bleed

832
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,519
which is not what i would have initially

833
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,599
expected

834
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,800
what i would like to do is add lights

835
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,720
back to the system to see to what extent

836
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,560
that's actually true and to what extent

837
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,078
that's the artifact of that there's so

838
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,639
few lights that it's hard to get light

839
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,839
bleed because you don't have

840
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,639
um all that many lights to actually uh

841
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:26,400
see

842
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,838
cause it right

843
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,160
um

844
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:34,159
but you know to to my

845
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,469
surprise like it just looks fine

846
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,639
so i guess

847
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:38,719
[Music]

848
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:42,319
using t inside

849
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,759
doesn't actually prove necessary somehow

850
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,960
which

851
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,640
is super bizarre to me and i i have no

852
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,639
explanation for that um

853
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,719
i guess it's just because since we're

854
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,358
using the actual occlusion normal

855
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,199
test when we sample lighting because the

856
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,039
normal is pointing away from us we

857
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,000
assume it can't reflect light back so it

858
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,679
just works

859
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,639
i don't know man

860
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,078
um

861
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,199
that's not true i don't know why that

862
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,880
was over there

863
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,879
um and so here we're gonna say like

864
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,280
all right

865
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,880
so we stuck a big old comment in there

866
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,119
just trying to say what we're currently

867
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,119
thinking because that's not intuitive to

868
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,039
me and while i can come up an

869
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,320
explanation for it it's a bit surprising

870
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,159
it probably warrants further study

871
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,320
as you can see now

872
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,480
we don't have the problem we had anymore

873
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,240
but we have the opposite problem which

874
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,880
is that the light appears to be

875
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:38,159
extremely bright um but then uh you if

876
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,599
it it

877
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,279
it's overly bright uh because it's when

878
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,160
it eclipses it

879
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,800
100 of the light samples now have that

880
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:52,319
light as soon as it uneclipses it

881
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,839
100 of them don't and by the way um i

882
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,160
find this to be actually quite

883
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,000
educational uh again

884
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,519
just as someone doesn't work with

885
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,679
lighting

886
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,199
very often the most i've ever worked on

887
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,039
lighting is what you're seeing here

888
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,799
right like handmade hero is by far the

889
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,800
most i've ever done with with lighting

890
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,838
um that's why i'm constantly surprised

891
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,519
i'm like wow this looks amazing because

892
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,880
i didn't know that we would get it to

893
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,880
look this good right um

894
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,320
uh and it's still cpu side like we're

895
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,599
not even using the gpu for this lighting

896
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,039
which is insane um so yeah it's pretty

897
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,680
cool anyway

898
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:32,719
um but if you look at what's going on

899
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,319
here uh it's basically very educational

900
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,239
from the sampling standpoint again

901
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,480
because remember

902
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:41,039
what we've seen so far

903
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,280
is that we get square interpolation

904
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,920
artifacts when we have a discontinuity

905
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,440
in the function that is represented at

906
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,800
the sample points

907
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,679
right

908
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,240
i

909
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,679
and anywhere that that's not true it's

910
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,959
very smooth

911
00:39:53,679 --> 00:40:00,480
and this is precisely that discontinuity

912
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,838
so when we are in between probes we have

913
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,880
a smooth function being sampled by those

914
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,599
lights

915
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,920
um those cast rays it's a smooth

916
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,920
everywhere the percentage of rays that

917
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,720
hits that light source is correctly

918
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,200
proportional to the distance

919
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:20,318
from the light source as it should be

920
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:21,759
but as soon as we eclipse one of these

921
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,639
with the light

922
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,920
then just that probe

923
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:30,078
has 100 of its rays accounted for and

924
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,200
all the other probes around it are fall

925
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,680
off based

926
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,480
and lo and behold the sampling that we

927
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,399
see

928
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,039
now shows a very prominent square

929
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,119
artifact is that why

930
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:43,358
again not a lighting expert so i'm not

931
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,519
prepared to say but it's just very

932
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,400
interesting to note that every time we

933
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,280
have

934
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,519
a known discontinuity in our system it

935
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,760
seems like we see it in the

936
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:57,239
interpolation very clearly

937
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,240
you know what i'm saying

938
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,400
uh so anyway looking awesome and this is

939
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,279
actually better than i was expecting so

940
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,960
i guess what i'll say is maybe we start

941
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,880
trying to jitter the sampling locations

942
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,199
and see what that does

943
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,358
um again i think it's a great thing

944
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:27,279
it's a great approach because it just

945
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,318
continues like the monte carlo style

946
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,160
uh

947
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:33,039
lighting integration that we're doing

948
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,759
but it's just like it's noisy

949
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,599
right it's just it's noisy so

950
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
you you know

951
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,000
you would expect to get exactly what i

952
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,240
think we're going to get which is

953
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,679
too much additional noise

954
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:50,159
now because our lights kind of move

955
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:54,078
horizontally mostly there is one thing

956
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:55,358
we could try which is only doing

957
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,318
like

958
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:01,440
like our light samples could jitter in x

959
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:04,000
and y but not really in z

960
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,700
um might help reduce the noise because

961
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,639
there's one less dimension um

962
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:10,318
[Music]

963
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,719
uh you know i i don't necessarily know

964
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,838
that that's a very compelling um

965
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,358
conclusion

966
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,679
but uh you know

967
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,519
now it costs us something to do this uh

968
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,679
the cost is this

969
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,599
right like um the

970
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,039
the sort of

971
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,160
way that we're doing our initial

972
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,039
stepping

973
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,960
um this

974
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,838
stepping initial p

975
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,318
uh

976
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,559
that has to get computed every time

977
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,239
because ray origin single will change

978
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,279
every time

979
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:45,279
so

980
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,960
effectively like ray origin single

981
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,200
uh which is used down here right

982
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,199
so

983
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,358
yeah it's just got to get propagated

984
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:58,719
down and and i don't know how much

985
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:01,199
that's going to cost us uh probably not

986
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:03,279
all that much but it's worth noting it

987
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,039
it's not free

988
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,200
so ray origin single is actually getting

989
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,920
computed outside and if we're sort of

990
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:13,838
saying we're just not probably gonna do

991
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,838
like the handling and full cast anymore

992
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,880
full cast starts to look pretty

993
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,639
pointless right so it's entirely

994
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,200
possible that what we actually want to

995
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,400
do now is just get rid of full cast

996
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,679
entirely

997
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,280
because if you imagine what this is

998
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:30,399
going to look like we don't have do we

999
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,280
do we have a retired directory we don't

1000
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,280
do we yeah we do

1001
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,000
um

1002
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:40,880
so like maybe what we do here is we just

1003
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,838
say

1004
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,480
uh

1005
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,078
like you know what full cast is going in

1006
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,920
the in the bucket

1007
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,920
um and maybe we leave it there

1008
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,760
uh and then we're just gonna weld this

1009
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:58,960
stuff into grid raycast and call it a

1010
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,720
day right so instead of it being what it

1011
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,679
was before we're just gonna say all

1012
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,159
right

1013
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:07,358
it's really just full cast it calls it

1014
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,838
in here and it needs these you know

1015
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,838
things

1016
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:16,239
so let's just make those things happen

1017
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:18,480
uh and and stop with all the

1018
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,279
the fancy foot you know

1019
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,559
just stop fancy footing around

1020
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
uh this

1021
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,838
stop just stop with all the fancy

1022
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,800
footing you know what i'm talking about

1023
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,318
too much fancy footing right

1024
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,920
um

1025
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,318
so let's

1026
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,760
let's just weld these together

1027
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:36,400
uh it's something we wanted to do for a

1028
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,960
while

1029
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:44,559
now is obviously uh our time to shine

1030
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,960
uh it is it is our big day in the sun

1031
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,279
uh everyone knows it but us

1032
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,280
so let's just do it

1033
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,920
and and

1034
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,920
call it a day

1035
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,480
okay uh so this stuff i saved and it's

1036
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,480
just going away we're look we're just

1037
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,800
not gonna do that

1038
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,760
i

1039
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,318
we've got this preamble which we do sort

1040
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,280
of still want to do right like we we

1041
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:18,559
would like to have this

1042
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,380
uh raycast debugging garbage uh occur

1043
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,880
and

1044
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,960
[Music]

1045
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,559
we do kind of need to remember what we

1046
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,280
were actually using as the call

1047
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:32,078
but i think other than that

1048
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,359
we don't have to care very much so light

1049
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,070
probe p

1050
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,639
was getting passed down

1051
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,059
[Music]

1052
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,269
um

1053
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,269
[Music]

1054
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,880
so ray origin here was not doing

1055
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,480
anything so so

1056
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,480
basically like

1057
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,119
ray origin single

1058
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,599
was was just light probe p

1059
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,640
spec at least a few statlists were not a

1060
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,640
thing

1061
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:08,318
tile was tile

1062
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,759
um initial grid index was solved this

1063
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,039
way

1064
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,000
um

1065
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:16,800
and

1066
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,800
yeah like

1067
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,760
i guess that's just it

1068
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,719
um

1069
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,519
so now i my argument is that now uh

1070
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,519
we're calling you know full full cast is

1071
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,079
just its own function and we don't have

1072
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,280
a sub call to grid raycast currently

1073
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,880
right

1074
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,359
um and and off we go uh i don't want the

1075
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,960
debug drawing anymore because i don't

1076
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,559
care about it

1077
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,838
and so

1078
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:08,159
um i'm going to turn that off

1079
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,639
and now i'm going to look

1080
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,440
at jittering the starting locations

1081
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:15,358
which you know is is a little bit more

1082
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,119
uh in-depth right

1083
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,598
uh but it's an attempt to try and

1084
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,240
actually measure how much of the light

1085
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,559
is actually uh overlapping a probe

1086
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,719
instead of just assuming that the entire

1087
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,760
thing overlaps the probe

1088
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,199
and

1089
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,680
you know

1090
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:31,679
um

1091
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,879
we're

1092
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,839
we're not expecting miracles from that i

1093
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,199
i don't imagine it will actually work

1094
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:42,400
particularly well

1095
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,279
but

1096
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,480
uh

1097
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,480
we're going to do the best we can

1098
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,800
i'm also going to make debug pick

1099
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,880
be the thing that happens here

1100
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,119
so that if we're doing this then debug

1101
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,280
pick is a real thing

1102
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,838
and

1103
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,839
otherwise it's not

1104
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:14,558
this can sort of just go directly in

1105
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:17,760
line probably

1106
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:20,480
so this

1107
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,520
can probably just all be done in

1108
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,519
one step

1109
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:32,639
and

1110
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:32,639
[Music]

1111
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,679
i don't

1112
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,679
quite see

1113
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:51,359
how enabled was getting set before did i

1114
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,358
accidentally like delete that i guess

1115
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:06,719
so here this is what makes it enabled

1116
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,079
right if if it's

1117
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:12,519
this is what actually makes it be

1118
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,519
enabled is this r equal to

1119
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,040
so shouldn't this just set it to be that

1120
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,159
right

1121
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,160
i don't know

1122
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,000
i'm not quite clear on what's happening

1123
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,358
there

1124
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,159
um

1125
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,159
i'm not gonna lie

1126
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,200
so i don't know about the debug cast we

1127
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:45,239
should probably go make that um

1128
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:45,239
like retest that

1129
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,759
because i don't actually know

1130
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,358
um that was just some sloppy nonsense

1131
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,040
but i don't care right now because we're

1132
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:05,759
not trying to debug that so what i would

1133
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:11,358
like to do now

1134
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:13,760
um is i would like to now uh take the

1135
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,838
the sampling location and jitter it

1136
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,200
right so i'd like to jitter the sampling

1137
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,519
location

1138
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:23,358
uh to see if that makes it so that this

1139
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:26,679
is less uh absurdly discontinuous you

1140
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:26,679
know what i'm saying

1141
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,800
um

1142
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,119
that's cool

1143
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,760
uh so i'm gonna go ahead and give that a

1144
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,440
shot and so to do the jittering of the

1145
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,800
starting location what we would need to

1146
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,200
do is say ray origin single

1147
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,160
is going to kind of come down and not

1148
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,358
actually be determined until we

1149
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,759
pick

1150
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:05,759
you know

1151
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,920
probably the ray index so so like when

1152
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,838
we pick the ray index like that's when

1153
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,159
we pick reorgan single

1154
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,799
so the things that we're getting done

1155
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,480
like it looks like that for example the

1156
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,000
things that we're getting done based on

1157
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,920
ray origin single have to now like occur

1158
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,039
later and it turns out that was almost

1159
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,400
nothing

1160
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:30,159
so that's fine although some of these

1161
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,240
values may have gotten hoisted out so we

1162
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,358
may lose some optimization being done by

1163
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:34,879
the compiler there because we haven't

1164
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,039
really looked at that we kind of hacked

1165
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,599
this code and haven't really like

1166
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,960
reoptimized it since so you know take

1167
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,280
that with a grain of salt it may not

1168
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,838
really be only one thing that's getting

1169
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,359
optimized there

1170
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:51,920
um but if if we take this at face value

1171
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:54,719
then we can if we would like do

1172
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:59,358
effectively this which is to say

1173
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:00,239
um we take the ray origin single x

1174
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:03,199
and

1175
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:06,318
uh the ray origin single y and we can

1176
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,558
add entropy to those

1177
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:08,558
uh

1178
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,318
probably bilaterally

1179
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,759
right we want to displace in either

1180
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:18,800
direction

1181
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:23,200
and i don't know how far

1182
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:25,519
like probably the whole tile dim

1183
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,519
um

1184
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,040
so not the spatial grenade

1185
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,000
uh but the

1186
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,119
but the atlas grid

1187
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,639
um

1188
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:41,440
we would want to to do that

1189
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,719
now i'm just not even going to do that

1190
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,240
quite yet

1191
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:46,239
oops i don't know why i didn't put an

1192
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,399
equal sign there i'm just going to let

1193
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,919
this run at the moment which is it's

1194
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,920
just going to be garbage but i just

1195
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,240
wanted to make sure that this is sort of

1196
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,480
still doing something right

1197
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:59,279
um yeah okay

1198
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,240
so with because it's one one in either

1199
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,359
direction is gonna be roughly correct uh

1200
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:05,358
it's just not quite right

1201
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,280
so as you can see like

1202
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,240
hey

1203
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:16,000
honestly kinda works uh i don't know if

1204
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:19,039
it's as good as we might want it to be

1205
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,760
um but it's pretty good right we still

1206
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:24,880
get a little bit of of uh of nastiness

1207
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,720
there but it's it's quite close

1208
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,280
and to be honest i'm okay with the

1209
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:32,078
amount of noise that that

1210
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,040
injected like it's not that bad

1211
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:37,440
uh in my opinion right

1212
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,558
okay so if we're only going to sample

1213
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,639
inside the tile i i don't actually

1214
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,480
remember how big these tiles are so i

1215
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:46,799
don't know how close one actually is to

1216
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,039
them but we don't care uh because we

1217
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,680
should have that number with the atlas

1218
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:53,759
grid in the first place so

1219
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:57,078
inside the

1220
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,079
like um

1221
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,960
i don't remember what the heck this is

1222
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,719
called uh

1223
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,720
update lighting is that what it's called

1224
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:10,639
so in update lighting when we

1225
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,440
go through here we set up

1226
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:13,679
this

1227
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,880
uh voxel dim

1228
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,399
right

1229
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,920
uh with our atlas grid so in theory we

1230
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,519
should be able to do like uh you know

1231
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,200
jitter

1232
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:26,639
radius

1233
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:29,279
and that should just be whatever the

1234
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,440
cell dim is of the atlas grid

1235
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,200
uh we want to do like

1236
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,838
0.5 of that

1237
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,039
but we probably don't really want 0.5 of

1238
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,199
that like we probably want to pull it

1239
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:42,159
back a little bit from 0.5 but you know

1240
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:43,919
for now let's just claim

1241
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,558
that that's what we're going to do

1242
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,400
and so we would multiply

1243
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,040
in this case right like we would

1244
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,280
multiply the x and the y

1245
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,679
jitter radius by the random sample that

1246
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,680
we get

1247
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,599
and that would tell us how to displace

1248
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,119
the lighting samples

1249
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,720
right

1250
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,519
and off we go

1251
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,558
now i don't know how correct that's

1252
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,358
gonna be

1253
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,640
uh it looks a little bit wrong

1254
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,440
um

1255
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:13,199
but

1256
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,720
you know it's hard to say because this

1257
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,239
is a very imprecise thing that we're

1258
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:18,159
doing here

1259
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:21,039
um

1260
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:24,000
so i don't know and and you can kind of

1261
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,000
also see like

1262
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,920
you see how we're getting like the

1263
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,759
sampling right because these things can

1264
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,400
can move around in here it's going to be

1265
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,280
a little weird too right so you get some

1266
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,318
weirdness there

1267
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,519
because the lighting can now sample from

1268
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,519
you know from further afield

1269
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:47,159
so uh yeah um

1270
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,039
and then

1271
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,400
i don't really know where to go from

1272
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,400
here uh

1273
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,280
because this turned out more promising

1274
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,400
than i was expecting

1275
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,040
i think is the biggest thing like the

1276
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,000
jitter did not really introduce

1277
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:52,719
at nearly as much

1278
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,838
noise as i was expecting

1279
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:55,519
i wonder if that's because i did

1280
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,759
something wrong

1281
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:00,000
that could also be if we don't let it

1282
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,680
jitter the entire

1283
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,079
uh

1284
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:04,078
volume

1285
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,640
um

1286
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:10,078
i'm curious what that does for our light

1287
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,480
containment

1288
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,400
you know so so some stuff is a little

1289
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,880
weird here right like

1290
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,389
i don't really understand why we're

1291
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,079
getting

1292
00:57:17,389 --> 00:57:21,838
[Music]

1293
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,039
i don't really understand why we're

1294
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,440
getting

1295
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,119
this light bleed so i think

1296
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,440
we may have to investigate this a little

1297
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:33,039
bit more because it doesn't quite look

1298
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:35,440
right so i think the raycast is a little

1299
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:37,039
broken which is fine because we just

1300
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,599
said we wanted to go

1301
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:42,798
make sure that the lighting um

1302
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,318
the the debug cast was working

1303
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:45,440
and and you also see there's a little

1304
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:48,719
bit of a

1305
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,400
there's a weird kind of like

1306
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:53,118
disappearing act

1307
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,480
that the light does there that doesn't

1308
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,920
quite add up

1309
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,760
for me

1310
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,639
like maybe that's plausible

1311
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:05,520
with this scheme but i can't quite say

1312
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,239
for sure why it would be so i just feel

1313
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,400
like

1314
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:11,759
i feel like we're a little

1315
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,680
i don't quite feel like this is quite

1316
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,160
right

1317
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,159
you know what i'm saying

1318
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,480
foreign

1319
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,719
like it it feels a little

1320
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,599
like maybe i screwed something up and i

1321
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:50,558
think we want to maybe draw it

1322
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,920
uh

1323
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,640
just to make sure

1324
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,639
you know what i'm saying too

1325
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,039
um as far as we know we are backface

1326
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,838
culling actually though

1327
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,000
uh

1328
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:17,119
the occlusion this

1329
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
right here

1330
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,960
is actually what that is

1331
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,599
but

1332
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,720
it may not be working properly right

1333
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,880
um

1334
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,639
although it seemed to be before we did

1335
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,358
the jitter location

1336
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,838
so that's even more confusing right

1337
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:33,838
um

1338
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:40,318
so it's tough to say

1339
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,280
um okay so so like

1340
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:46,639
if we were to go

1341
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,050
and draw these maybe

1342
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:49,199
um

1343
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,160
[Music]

1344
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:54,798
you know

1345
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:58,000
that seems good uh so let's enable grid

1346
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:59,759
raycast debugging and

1347
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,920
see what we can see

1348
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,480
like i said we wanted to

1349
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,480
make this

1350
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,838
uh code work and we don't know because

1351
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,920
we kind of just clipped it out it may

1352
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,119
not be working now

1353
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,318
and so

1354
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,318
yeah we would like to

1355
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,838
i think we we would have this is now

1356
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:24,399
getting overbrighted i suspect that's

1357
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:26,000
because we set the light to something

1358
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,960
high

1359
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,880
uh that we probably need to fix um at

1360
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,119
some point anyway

1361
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,119
um

1362
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:41,159
so this appears to be

1363
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,358
to be doing what we would expect

1364
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:06,719
so you can see that the sampling so

1365
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,720
let's let's move this down here

1366
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:11,159
so

1367
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:27,118
you can see that the sampling does

1368
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,719
a appear

1369
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,838
i would say

1370
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:33,838
it does appear to be

1371
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,078
you know roughly

1372
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:38,960
white noise in the

1373
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,839
you know i mean it doesn't look

1374
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,838
obviously wrong

1375
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:59,199
um i do think we're gonna need some way

1376
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,200
of drawing like more concretely

1377
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,119
the the

1378
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:05,679
starting location so

1379
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,480
like we need a debug box that's like

1380
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,000
very specifically

1381
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,079
um

1382
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,500
drawing at the starting point so like

1383
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:18,599
this for example we probably

1384
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,599
[Music]

1385
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:23,199
i um

1386
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:25,440
probably i don't know do we still want

1387
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,759
to draw that i don't know

1388
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,760
um

1389
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:33,038
but when we draw the hit here uh we

1390
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:35,358
probably need to draw like where we cast

1391
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,680
from so

1392
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:37,679
you know

1393
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:46,000
we probably need to do something like

1394
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,519
this

1395
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,159
and the color

1396
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,199
would have to indicate like which one it

1397
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,598
was

1398
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,598
you know

1399
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,838
why i stopped the program for that i

1400
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:01,199
have no idea because i had it all set up

1401
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:02,960
the way i wanted

1402
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,078
but i guess that's just sometimes i

1403
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,318
forget

1404
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,640
that we can live edit the code in this

1405
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:08,639
program

1406
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,440
since you don't always have live code

1407
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:17,038
reloading in engines sometimes it's easy

1408
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,318
to remember that

1409
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,319
it's easy to forget that you do

1410
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:37,039
so i mean that looks correct to me

1411
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:37,038
um

1412
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:47,280
i i don't really see anything

1413
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,599
particularly suspicious

1414
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,599
um

1415
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:57,079
if we look at the interior casting

1416
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,079
um

1417
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:04,399
again looks pretty pretty reasonable

1418
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,880
you don't really have an x-ray mode here

1419
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,440
but

1420
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,920
i mean that is exactly

1421
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,480
what i would expect

1422
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,480
probably

1423
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,318
although i am a little confused about

1424
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,920
the

1425
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:24,960
i guess that

1426
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,280
like we should make this drawing a

1427
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,920
little more space because why the

1428
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,480
normal pointing up is being drawn out of

1429
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,480
here

1430
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:38,159
oh right okay so

1431
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,160
that's because we're not allowing a

1432
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:41,159
negative

1433
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:47,679
on the location where the sample should

1434
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:53,318
have been taken all right so

1435
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:53,318
so that's probably worth fixing because

1436
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:57,038
um

1437
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:58,400
[Music]

1438
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,119
so like

1439
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,838
we're doing that fix in probably the

1440
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,838
wrong place

1441
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:10,960
i don't really know but like

1442
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:13,119
you know it could be that that is not

1443
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:16,079
actually where you want to do it

1444
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:20,480
and what you would rather do is when you

1445
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,480
do the cast ps

1446
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,110
you would do it right before that

1447
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,198
so the t-ray

1448
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:29,199
[Music]

1449
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,079
uh

1450
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:40,798
so like

1451
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,639
right before you do the t-ray dot p

1452
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,838
that's where you would do it so that

1453
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:50,000
nothing else actually used that value

1454
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:52,239
so it's only for the horizontal compare

1455
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,239
um

1456
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:55,038
so it'd be like

1457
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:58,399
t

1458
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:02,079
clamped compare

1459
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,079
like you know what i'm saying to you

1460
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,838
you you know right

1461
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,559
do you know

1462
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
so if i change it so that the comparison

1463
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,319
is clamped

1464
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,318
um

1465
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,318
i'm sorry it's not it's called t-ray

1466
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,400
um

1467
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:26,239
so the comparison values get clamped

1468
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,798
before we use them but we leave the

1469
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,399
negatives in place is that

1470
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:33,679
actually going to be

1471
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,798
more what i wanted why do i keep re

1472
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:36,960
yeah

1473
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,480
i i just cannot get it through my skull

1474
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,679
that we don't have to restart the

1475
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,679
program um

1476
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:48,559
i do not know why i have this problem

1477
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:48,558
okay

1478
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,038
so

1479
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:00,199
let's try and make this a little bit

1480
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,200
more sensible

1481
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,340
so

1482
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:06,340
[Music]

1483
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:15,598
i think that is technically correct now

1484
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:18,798
as odd as that seems right like it's

1485
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,720
basically using the far side so like if

1486
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,159
i was going along this ray would i would

1487
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:23,598
what would i have hit i would have hit

1488
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,440
that one right

1489
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,838
and maybe we don't want that maybe we

1490
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,720
want to try and use

1491
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:32,239
t-max as the raise team min at that

1492
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,038
point so that we hit the side we're

1493
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,038
casting towards

1494
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:41,118
um

1495
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,119
[Music]

1496
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,760
i guess i don't really have a

1497
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:05,240
i guess i don't really have a strong

1498
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,239
opinion about it

1499
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:12,480
um

1500
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:20,158
basically i i just i don't really know

1501
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,158
what we want there i i

1502
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,759
uh yeah i i don't know i mean we could

1503
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,559
do it either way and i just don't know

1504
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,880
that there's a reason to do it

1505
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,880
um

1506
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,000
i really just don't know if there's a if

1507
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:39,000
there's a good reason to do it that way

1508
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
um

1509
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,678
so yeah um

1510
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,838
honestly the jittering looks okay so i

1511
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,000
would say my current problem is just

1512
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:57,838
that it doesn't seem to behave as well

1513
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,439
as i would like

1514
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:00,960
and i don't know

1515
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,119
what that's actually from but you can

1516
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,719
see that you kind of still get

1517
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:06,640
you get that sort of

1518
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,560
you still get a little bit of that as it

1519
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,039
moves in between

1520
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,560
areas you get a little bit of that

1521
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,560
problem

1522
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,560
right

1523
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,158
so

1524
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,039
so am i doing something else wrong or is

1525
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:44,719
that just as good as this scheme's going

1526
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,880
to get us

1527
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,880
you know

1528
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,560
uh and i'm not sure

1529
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,840
what i will say is that all lights

1530
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,560
beside the glove besides the glove do

1531
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:04,000
look great with this scheme so i would

1532
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,430
have no real complaints

1533
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,488
um

1534
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:07,489
[Music]

1535
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:16,239
other than that one

1536
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:17,679
meaning other than this i don't think

1537
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:20,158
i don't think i have

1538
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,039
an issue with what's going on but that's

1539
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,359
not

1540
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:26,479
and it's not so much that because

1541
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:28,960
you know maybe there's ways we address

1542
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:32,000
the you know that that being a little

1543
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,840
too square looking

1544
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,359
maybe that's actually something we

1545
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,319
address a different way

1546
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:39,759
so it's less that and more that do you

1547
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,479
see that like

1548
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,640
that lighting intensity variation that

1549
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:46,799
just looks either like a bug or a

1550
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,039
limitation of the scheme that i don't

1551
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,039
like

1552
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:51,519
right

1553
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,158
it looks like water reflecting

1554
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,920
oh do you mean this

1555
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:08,639
like that

1556
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:11,119
yeah that's uh that's the specular

1557
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,679
so i turned that on because i thought it

1558
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:15,920
was interesting um

1559
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,440
and i wanted to remind us to do

1560
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,560
something with it probably we didn't

1561
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:21,678
have to

1562
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:25,520
but basically in the shader or

1563
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:28,000
we can take samples multiple samples

1564
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,640
and so what i did is i took a specular

1565
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,600
sample so if if we want we can turn it

1566
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,560
off

1567
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,320
right

1568
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,120
if you just want pure diffuse so

1569
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:39,198
basically like uh you know instead of

1570
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:42,880
that you would get this

1571
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:44,879
right and now there's no reflectivity

1572
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,279
at all right so that's that's like a

1573
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,000
purely diffuse material it's it reflects

1574
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:50,960
the

1575
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,119
light the same in like all directions

1576
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,640
um like literally all directions

1577
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:56,158
perfectly

1578
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,159
nothing in the real world would would

1579
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:01,359
really be able to do that but

1580
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:01,359
here in the fake world we can

1581
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,079
uh and then we have

1582
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:06,238
uh

1583
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:07,359
this which is the specular

1584
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,799
component

1585
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:10,158
right

1586
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,840
um

1587
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:17,198
and this is looks like this

1588
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,600
uh this this you can see how shiny right

1589
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,559
everything looks now

1590
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,360
um

1591
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,560
and that shininess

1592
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:26,238
is

1593
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,000
just because we're using the reflection

1594
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,479
vector now and we're and we're not

1595
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,238
blurring the map

1596
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,319
so we get something that actually is

1597
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:36,799
pretty cool like it actually makes the

1598
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,079
floor look a little bit glossy

1599
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,960
right

1600
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:42,960
um and we don't need to use that like if

1601
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,158
it turns out we don't really think the

1602
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,319
effect

1603
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:49,279
plays well enough because you know it's

1604
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,759
sampled too sparsely or whatever

1605
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:54,158
uh then we just don't use it but it was

1606
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,880
compelling enough to me to have like i

1607
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:58,639
liked the look of it and as like we

1608
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,319
should probably do something with this

1609
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,640
right like it's just kind of cool to

1610
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:04,799
imagine hopping up to an area

1611
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,039
and seeing this kind of like

1612
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:10,239
um

1613
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:12,238
that kind of light bleeding out right uh

1614
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:14,319
is just kind of nice

1615
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,559
and so so i think we're probably gonna

1616
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:18,399
leave it in there and so for the moment

1617
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,080
we just you know

1618
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:23,279
we add them together

1619
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,880
uh with no particular

1620
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,960
rhyme or reason

1621
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,000
but in the future what we can do

1622
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,319
is

1623
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,319
have a

1624
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,800
have a parameter

1625
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,239
uh some kind of a vertex parameter or

1626
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:42,079
something

1627
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:45,119
uh that we send down where we just say

1628
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:48,640
oh yeah like uh how

1629
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,399
you know specular versus how diffuse

1630
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,400
is this material and it just gives us

1631
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:54,158
another way to like use the lighting to

1632
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,319
create visual interest which is i mean

1633
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:58,238
that's what lighting is for

1634
01:13:56,319 --> 01:14:01,439
uh in the first place is it makes things

1635
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:03,119
look a lot better

1636
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,519
so

1637
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,800
yeah i don't have a lot to say at this

1638
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,719
point we more or less fix the problem

1639
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,279
that i was talking about

1640
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:16,880
with jittered sampling positions

1641
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:19,119
but it's still not really the quality

1642
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,119
of the result

1643
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,679
although it doesn't have the bug from

1644
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,559
before it does sort of have a separate

1645
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,399
bug

1646
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,360
uh which is that it still doesn't quite

1647
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,399
look

1648
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:30,639
you know i wouldn't consider it

1649
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,960
production quality right

1650
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,960
um

1651
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:36,719
uh maybe for like a made with unity

1652
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:39,759
personal learning edition kind of a

1653
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:42,239
situation that's fine but i feel like

1654
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,960
uh you know we're trying to do something

1655
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:47,439
of a higher quality level here than that

1656
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,520
and the rest of the lighting looks ten

1657
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:51,119
times better than that so

1658
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,480
you know the problem is this is gonna

1659
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:55,679
bring us down right uh we only look as

1660
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,238
good

1661
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:59,520
as our worst lighting effect

1662
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:00,319
right

1663
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,880
so

1664
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:05,119
we kind of want to think about what can

1665
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,920
we do here

1666
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:08,319
to

1667
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,119
fix this problem now one thing we could

1668
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,599
do

1669
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:13,599
is see what happens with different light

1670
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,400
sizes and that one

1671
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,480
so i don't know what happens because if

1672
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:21,759
we enlarge the light source or shrink

1673
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:24,319
the light source we might see things

1674
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,480
changes in the artifacts that help clue

1675
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,639
us into what's going wrong because right

1676
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:30,000
like i don't really know

1677
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,320
yet

1678
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,359
uh what the problem is

1679
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,279
so

1680
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:40,719
you know

1681
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:40,719
thinking through what's going wrong here

1682
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:46,319
we can do some experiments and see like

1683
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:47,678
can we gain some insight into the

1684
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,639
problem

1685
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,719
and i have no idea if we can or not but

1686
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,920
we're going to try

1687
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:58,719
so let's suppose that the light was less

1688
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,359
big so i shrank it

1689
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:04,359
honey i shrank the light

1690
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:04,359
um

1691
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:13,439
that was weird

1692
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,440
why did it like disappear

1693
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,399
that's really bizarre isn't it kind of

1694
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,399
so if it's that small is it like not

1695
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,760
getting picked up by anybody is it like

1696
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:31,759
it's like nobody hitting it although

1697
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:35,640
that's not what's happening because i

1698
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,640
can see it in the spec

1699
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:42,319
i mean obviously it will get dimmer

1700
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:44,960
because we currently don't divide by the

1701
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:47,039
light size so the bigger the light the

1702
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,480
brighter it would be

1703
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:51,279
i believe

1704
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,279
don't quote me on that

1705
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,520
hmm

1706
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:30,158
so i'm going to increase the brightness

1707
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:33,040
of this light source c proportional to

1708
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:34,559
how much i shrunk it of course

1709
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:36,399
it's not really proportional depending

1710
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,880
on whether this is a surface area or

1711
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:38,879
volume

1712
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:48,000
so i think this is giving me fairly good

1713
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,000
information like

1714
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:51,919
right at this point

1715
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,319
the chance of you hitting the light

1716
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:59,319
source appears to i guess just be too

1717
01:17:56,319 --> 01:17:59,319
small

1718
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,199
when the light source is small

1719
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:09,679
and maybe that is

1720
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,679
what's causing this problem

1721
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:13,158
maybe

1722
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,239
and there's a couple ways we could get

1723
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,760
around that like one of the things we

1724
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,279
could do is try to target light sources

1725
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,480
we had talked about doing that before

1726
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:38,639
where we do a basically biased sampling

1727
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,559
right now i wouldn't really call this

1728
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,960
unbiased but it is

1729
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:47,039
in that sense

1730
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:50,039
it is unbiased sampling in in that sense

1731
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,039
um

1732
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,760
so basically what you can see is the

1733
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:05,519
brightness occurs when it it is able to

1734
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,440
eclipse at least one of the samples i

1735
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,120
assume

1736
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:10,559
to be honest yeah i don't know i feel

1737
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:13,119
it's just like kind of confusing what's

1738
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:15,760
going on here something seems up

1739
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:16,559
maybe maybe this is fine

1740
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,880
um

1741
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,360
bug wise but maybe we just got a bug in

1742
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:25,199
here somewhere i'm not sure but it just

1743
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:25,198
seems a little odd like

1744
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,319
it seems like it's still that the

1745
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:33,039
jittered sampling locations

1746
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:36,079
are

1747
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:38,079
not actually

1748
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:41,079
are like not actually jittered or

1749
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:41,079
something

1750
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:05,839
so that's

1751
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:05,839
that's not

1752
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:20,000
that's just not right so something

1753
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:22,238
something is is off here

1754
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,399
uh and i don't really understand what it

1755
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:24,399
is

1756
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:29,439
i mean what if the light source was huge

1757
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,880
right

1758
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,639
so now this thing is is giant and i

1759
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,920
should probably change the power because

1760
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:40,719
it's going to be too it's going to be

1761
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,719
too strong now

1762
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:46,759
um but what happens if it's super large

1763
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,039
i mean like

1764
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,080
it totally works right so it seems like

1765
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:07,519
it's like

1766
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:10,479
at some point

1767
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,840
you dropping below like a sampling size

1768
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:17,119
or something so so let's say it's at

1769
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:19,279
to and we dropped down the brightness

1770
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,840
to try to compensate for that uh we

1771
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:25,559
would be even less to be like 1.25 right

1772
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,560
it'd be like really low

1773
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:34,639
uh probably even lower than that if

1774
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:36,000
we're honest about it that's still a bit

1775
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,600
too hard

1776
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:42,840
um too too bright too

1777
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,840
too much

1778
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:50,000
but it looks like perfect right um like

1779
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:52,238
it looks just right

1780
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,238
so

1781
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:57,238
so yeah like

1782
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:05,759
we definitely have a problem here

1783
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:08,319
of just the level of sampling i guess is

1784
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:11,320
just not

1785
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:11,319
hmm

1786
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:30,238
right i mean that that looks totally

1787
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:33,239
like what you would expect

1788
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,238
um

1789
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,800
oh

1790
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,719
so we really just have a problem of like

1791
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:03,840
if this thing

1792
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:07,119
is smaller than

1793
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:09,199
a certain size

1794
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:11,840
we get this

1795
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,839
unhappy

1796
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:24,679
we get this like unhappy situation

1797
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,679
um

1798
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:48,799
i feel very confused

1799
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,560
i don't have a plausible explanation for

1800
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,960
this at all really

1801
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,960
um

1802
01:23:53,520 --> 01:24:01,440
so at what point at at what like size of

1803
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,840
the light source does this start

1804
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:06,799
happening

1805
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,920
i guess would be my other question

1806
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,800
like

1807
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,480
what is the actual

1808
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:16,159
roughly where

1809
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:18,399
do i get this blinky behavior

1810
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:20,559
uh occurring and

1811
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:23,519
does that tell me anything

1812
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,520
about the problem

1813
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,800
is it like

1814
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:33,519
a nyquist sort of a

1815
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,840
a nyquist limit where it's like okay if

1816
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:39,199
the light source's radius is smaller

1817
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,199
than the like atlas's radius

1818
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:43,439
you get this problem because like now

1819
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:44,638
there's still not a problem it's a bit

1820
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,039
square

1821
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,400
so you know the square fall off stuff

1822
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:50,238
that we talked about before where it's

1823
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:51,599
like okay we maybe we need to fix some

1824
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:52,559
of that stuff

1825
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,320
i mean

1826
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,159
mind you the light source itself is

1827
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:57,519
square so you know there's a little bit

1828
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:59,759
of that but

1829
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:04,000
um

1830
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,000
so the question is like at that point

1831
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:10,600
i don't see the bug

1832
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,800
so but at

1833
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:20,280
five we did

1834
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,279
i want to say

1835
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:36,679
so at five it's like blinky right

1836
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,679
like it looks blinky to me now

1837
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,840
well

1838
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:49,920
i guess not really

1839
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:54,198
it's a little bit blinky

1840
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:05,440
so at point five it's still really not

1841
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:09,839
that blinky let's try point four

1842
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:09,839
it's it's pretty solid actually

1843
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,480
that looks blinky

1844
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,039
yeah i mean right

1845
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,159
and so i guess it's just like at that

1846
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:36,158
point

1847
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:38,238
are you just seeing like that is

1848
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:39,119
stationary

1849
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:42,319
right

1850
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:44,559
so what you're seeing there is like the

1851
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:46,639
random numbers

1852
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,920
period basically like the crappy random

1853
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:49,600
number

1854
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,279
series that we use which is probably

1855
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,800
pretty bad

1856
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:54,800
just like an xor shift or something

1857
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:59,679
what you're seeing there is

1858
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,679
that

1859
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,440
whether it's grabbing inside or outside

1860
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,880
over time i assume

1861
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:06,638
that's my assumption anyway i could just

1862
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,400
be making

1863
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:10,239
that up but

1864
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:13,238
right

1865
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,238
um

1866
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:11,719
so another question i guess i would have

1867
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:11,719
is what if we stratified the sampling

1868
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,760
i don't know

1869
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:45,759
um

1870
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:50,238
i'm curious what happens if we stratify

1871
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:52,000
the sampling so i think that i'm going

1872
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:56,919
to do it not because i think it will

1873
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,920
help but because i want to know now

1874
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,400
so right now we do array count of 16

1875
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:09,920
uh and so what we could do there is just

1876
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:12,639
say well we're going to do a rate count

1877
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:14,880
of 16

1878
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,880
um

1879
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:25,760
in a four by so it's a four by four grid

1880
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:27,279
and only jittered inside the grid

1881
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,320
uh is this because it's so small the

1882
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,759
probability of a sample rate

1883
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,359
intersecting the emissive source starts

1884
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,560
becoming heavily affected by the random

1885
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:35,198
rays distribution and whether they

1886
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,719
actually hit the emissive object

1887
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:38,479
i mean

1888
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,960
yeah that's what

1889
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:42,799
i'm guessing at this point but we have

1890
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,079
not proven that

1891
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,679
right

1892
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:48,880
that's what you would expect to be true

1893
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:53,079
but

1894
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:53,079
it doesn't necessarily mean it is true

1895
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,440
so

1896
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:03,198
i'm gonna see what happens if i stratify

1897
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:05,279
the samples

1898
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:07,839
uh because i can

1899
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:07,840
right

1900
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,319
so

1901
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:14,960
we're looping over some

1902
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:18,920
rate what the heck is sample der

1903
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,920
is that even a thing anymore

1904
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:28,359
i don't know why we have that nobody

1905
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:28,359
uses that

1906
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,800
all right

1907
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:47,119
um we can also get rid of that include

1908
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,119
file

1909
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:50,719
right

1910
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:50,718
um

1911
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:55,678
where is that pound include hh sphere

1912
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:03,840
look we don't need this anymore right

1913
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:26,759
okay

1914
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:26,760
so the lighting octahedral map dim

1915
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:38,559
uh it has to go somewhere

1916
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:45,319
i don't know where it should go

1917
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,800
probably not there

1918
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:58,279
where do we normally define that stuff

1919
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:11,238
huh yeah not true anymore

1920
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:26,880
so the rays protection

1921
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:29,679
we don't really have anymore so i think

1922
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:32,480
that probably has to

1923
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:35,600
get fixed right this

1924
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:38,479
total light sample direction count is

1925
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:40,400
ray count but this is also wrong so the

1926
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:43,039
total initiation let's just get rid of

1927
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:45,759
this we're not even

1928
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,880
doing this right anymore

1929
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,920
um

1930
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:51,359
we should just get rid of

1931
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,119
of these stats because if we were going

1932
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:55,279
to gather stats we'd have to gather

1933
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:56,079
completely different stats

1934
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,920
uh

1935
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,399
right like they're just incorrect at

1936
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,399
this point

1937
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,960
okay

1938
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,199
so

1939
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,440
we would want to

1940
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:21,000
have

1941
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:21,000
have this stratified

1942
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,039
i'm in the wrong file

1943
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:29,679
yeah

1944
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:31,439
uh we would want to stratify this so

1945
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:33,840
that the

1946
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,839
um

1947
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:37,599
the proportion here is computed by

1948
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:40,400
something else now i'm going to do this

1949
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,120
pretty sloppy

1950
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:43,359
uh

1951
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:44,960
to start with because i don't care about

1952
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:48,000
optimizing it until i know whether i

1953
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:50,319
just want to see what it does

1954
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,760
um so what i'm going to do is take the

1955
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:57,279
ray origin single dot x

1956
01:33:53,760 --> 01:34:00,400
uh n dot y and i'm going to take

1957
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:02,158
so let's say that the ray index we know

1958
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:04,638
there's 16 rays

1959
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:06,479
so let's just take and

1960
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:08,560
we'll take seven

1961
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:09,359
from zero to seven

1962
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,400
uh

1963
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:12,399
will be our

1964
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:19,158
our x partition

1965
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,159
uh i'm sorry

1966
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:26,719
there's only 16 so it's four bits so we

1967
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:26,719
only get three right

1968
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:30,638
so what i'm going to do here is i'm just

1969
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:32,399
going to pull out the bits of the array

1970
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:34,400
index and turn them into

1971
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,158
a stratification for the sample so

1972
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:37,920
basically the x will just be the bottom

1973
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:40,000
two bits and the y will be the top two

1974
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,960
bits

1975
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,719
um

1976
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,840
and that'll be that

1977
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,719
so

1978
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,719
this produces a number

1979
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:55,360
uh where we want to take the jitter

1980
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:57,279
radius right and we want to basically

1981
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:59,920
turn this into a bilateral so we want to

1982
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:01,920
do the same thing we were doing before

1983
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,880
um where we turn this into a bilateral

1984
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,880
but

1985
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,679
uh this is going to be like the number

1986
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:09,920
is going to be 0 1 2 3

1987
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,920
right

1988
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,199
um so what we actually want is we want

1989
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,880
it to go like negative one

1990
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:17,589
point uh well

1991
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,729
negative one

1992
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:20,729
[Music]

1993
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:28,638
you know

1994
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:31,439
0.125 or whatever 0.125 or not

1995
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:33,199
negative point three point three

1996
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,039
one

1997
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:36,479
something like this

1998
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:38,000
right

1999
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:38,799
um so

2000
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,600
we

2001
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,840
need to multiply it by some kind of

2002
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,840
inverse

2003
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:47,039
first

2004
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,039
because if you imagine this is a well

2005
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,399
ian actually you know what i can do this

2006
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:56,319
even easier

2007
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:58,879
because since we don't care about the

2008
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:02,079
performance of this i can do

2009
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,079
something more straightforward

2010
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:07,198
so if we just learn between negative of

2011
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,079
the jitter radius

2012
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,198
um

2013
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:13,279
and positive of the jitter radius

2014
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:15,599
so we're just going to like

2015
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:18,639
go in between

2016
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,639
those two extremes

2017
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:26,479
uh then all we have to do is turn these

2018
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,760
numbers into something that goes from

2019
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:30,000
zero to one

2020
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,920
so we know it's zero one two three so we

2021
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,880
would just multiply it by the inverse of

2022
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,000
three

2023
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,600
and

2024
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,479
that gives us

2025
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,400
a t value that goes from zero to one so

2026
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,198
that's an easier way to do it

2027
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:44,158
uh

2028
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:46,638
and i think that's fine

2029
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:50,319
but uh don't quote me on that

2030
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:52,719
so um what i'd like to do is see

2031
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:55,679
what happens there uh

2032
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:58,079
so okay so now

2033
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:00,399
in theory this is regular sampling let's

2034
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:02,399
just verify that that's true but this

2035
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:05,679
should be regular sampling

2036
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:08,719
and so it's very strange that that's

2037
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,719
still pulsating

2038
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:14,560
right so something weird is up

2039
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:15,839
i mean i could have just messed it up so

2040
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:19,719
you know doesn't necessarily mean

2041
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,719
something weird is that but

2042
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:29,039
okay

2043
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:35,920
so there's our sample point

2044
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:39,439
and here's our uh rey index

2045
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,440
one two three

2046
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:54,719
right um

2047
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,719
kind of hard to see why we would get

2048
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,118
so much

2049
01:37:56,679 --> 01:38:01,199
pulsating there is it just because of

2050
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:03,279
the ray directions randomly hitting the

2051
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:05,839
light

2052
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:05,840
i guess

2053
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:10,000
it does seem a bit odd

2054
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:15,359
uh

2055
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:15,359
that that's the case

2056
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:20,800
to be honest um

2057
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,560
not sure i can really

2058
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,239
wrap my head around that if it's not a

2059
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,400
bug

2060
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:28,879
i would vote bug

2061
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:28,879
because

2062
01:38:29,198 --> 01:38:34,919
that just seems

2063
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,920
totally implausible to me

2064
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:55,359
i find this unlikely

2065
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:58,158
so

2066
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:00,880
i'm not buying it i'm going to turn off

2067
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:03,679
uh the jitter uh for

2068
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,279
you know so the random series here is

2069
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:07,359
actually seated

2070
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:09,599
with an offset of the sample entropy i'm

2071
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:12,399
just not going to do that

2072
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:16,400
so i'm going to instead

2073
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:16,399
just seat it with a constant value

2074
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:24,000
this will mean that now there is no

2075
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,000
noise injection at all as far as i know

2076
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,479
which means there should be no way to

2077
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,600
actually produce that pulsation

2078
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:33,359
it should have to be constant

2079
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,239
so yeah so something's

2080
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:38,880
majorly messed up right because now

2081
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:41,279
we're casting the same rays

2082
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,039
every frame

2083
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:44,559
so there is definitely something we

2084
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:47,519
don't understand

2085
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,400
uh right there's some bug that we don't

2086
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,960
get

2087
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,799
which is great because that means that

2088
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:55,279
we just have to find a bug not

2089
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:57,119
understand some new thing

2090
01:39:55,279 --> 01:39:59,519
about the lighting right

2091
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:01,839
but i'm pretty sure that that is what

2092
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,080
that means because i don't see

2093
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,639
there should be no yeah you can even see

2094
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:09,840
like there's no actual noise injection

2095
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:09,840
here at all

2096
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,119
so

2097
01:40:21,198 --> 01:40:24,319
so where is it coming from

2098
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:34,679
i'm interested in why that's blinking

2099
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:34,679
why would that be blinking

2100
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,439
so that's just the hit

2101
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:57,118
it's like the hit and like there's some

2102
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:59,679
kind of like z fighting

2103
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:02,479
with the hit and the cast

2104
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:05,719
are in the same place

2105
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:05,718
i guess

2106
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:25,078
um

2107
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:25,079
[Music]

2108
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:41,279
that

2109
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:41,279
is a complete and total mystery

2110
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:48,638
i have

2111
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:48,639
absolutely no idea

2112
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:56,519
what's happening

2113
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,039
well

2114
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,840
all right

2115
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:19,279
i guess we now know what our project is

2116
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:19,279
it's to find that bug

2117
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:25,359
i do think we need to improve the

2118
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:29,039
rendering of this thing

2119
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:31,198
um because currently it sucks uh meaning

2120
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:33,359
the the debug is

2121
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:35,439
i know what all the things are like so

2122
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:37,599
that's saying look this is a sample for

2123
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:39,759
this light probe it's going out that

2124
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,480
face of the octahedral map

2125
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:44,719
this is the point it picked to cast out

2126
01:42:42,479 --> 01:42:46,959
of that's the actual array that it

2127
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,880
selected here is the place it hit and

2128
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:52,480
there's the normal

2129
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:56,319
um that it's it then you know

2130
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:58,559
selected for that particular hit you

2131
01:42:56,319 --> 01:42:59,439
know also all that's fine

2132
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,800
you know

2133
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:03,039
whatever

2134
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,039
but

2135
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:08,399
it could we should probably make that a

2136
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:09,359
little bit cleaner right

2137
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:11,839
um

2138
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:11,839
that said

2139
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:18,799
it just looks completely solid so

2140
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,440
where the heck is the noise coming from

2141
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,520
it should be computing like more or less

2142
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:34,000
the exact same thing every frame

2143
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:36,080
although to be fair that's not really

2144
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,319
true because it is a feedback system it

2145
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:40,960
does sample from the previous frame's

2146
01:43:38,319 --> 01:43:40,960
information

2147
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:45,359
so there is

2148
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,840
a little bit more to it than that

2149
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:49,759
and i suppose it's possible that this is

2150
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:53,279
setting up some kind of like an

2151
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:54,800
oscillatory regime where like it's

2152
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:56,880
actually just

2153
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:59,199
sampling from itself it gets in this

2154
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:01,118
cycle i don't see how that's possible

2155
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:04,799
like i i can't even

2156
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:06,880
make up an explanation for that though

2157
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:10,400
you know what i'm saying

2158
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:12,880
so s i i have to assume that this is a

2159
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:15,599
bug that there is noise getting injected

2160
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,560
from some look from somehow

2161
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,560
right

2162
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,560
um

2163
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:24,520
but

2164
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:24,520
where

2165
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,479
um

2166
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:44,239
i just have no idea

2167
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:47,118
where would that be coming from is it

2168
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:50,519
like a weird like uninitialized variable

2169
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:50,519
kind of a situation

2170
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,039
the glove doesn't bob

2171
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:18,800
i mean you can see that it doesn't bob

2172
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:23,960
right like it's now settled

2173
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,960
like that's it's not moving now

2174
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:34,319
that's very strange um i can turn off

2175
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,960
the

2176
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:38,000
uh temporal

2177
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,760
like

2178
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:44,560
there is a very small amount of

2179
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:47,280
just sort of catch-up blend basically

2180
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:50,800
like a heinz ketchup blend

2181
01:45:47,279 --> 01:45:54,319
uh and we can turn that off so

2182
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:56,159
it's a 12 it's 12 frames

2183
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:58,719
um

2184
01:45:56,158 --> 01:46:01,039
so if we turned that off and we just

2185
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:04,880
said that the update no it's not 12

2186
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:04,880
frames that's wrong um

2187
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:09,920
it would take so what's that four six

2188
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:11,439
it's like

2189
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,520
five frames

2190
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:17,678
it's five frames

2191
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:19,920
um so if the t update blend is just one

2192
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:22,480
then that means it will update

2193
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:25,960
completely

2194
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:25,959
on every frame

2195
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:33,238
i mean

2196
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:33,238
what

2197
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,920
that's awesome

2198
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:50,000
this is going to be an interesting bug

2199
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:53,320
probably something to do with floating

2200
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,319
point something

2201
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,039
i would just like to remind everyone

2202
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:02,960
that there is no code in the game right

2203
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:05,359
now intentionally to make this light

2204
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,359
blink

2205
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:11,118
it is running through as far as we know

2206
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:12,238
exactly the same code path

2207
01:47:11,118 --> 01:47:14,479
as

2208
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:16,638
literally all of these other light

2209
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:18,799
sources that are stable

2210
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:20,639
and lighting the world normally

2211
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,760
there is no

2212
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:23,600
code

2213
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:26,320
at all

2214
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:27,520
here to do that that's just a straight

2215
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:30,639
up bug

2216
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,639
that somehow

2217
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:37,039
somehow

2218
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:39,760
was able to produce

2219
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:39,760
this effect

2220
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:47,639
and i have literally no idea how it's

2221
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:47,638
doing that

2222
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:00,079
that's pretty wild

2223
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,520
okay

2224
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,960
i

2225
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,920
so we probably yeah we i i like whoever

2226
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:24,158
just said about nan's uh

2227
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:26,639
i assume this is something like that

2228
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:28,799
where we you know we did some sloppy

2229
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:32,079
modifications here

2230
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,400
something is getting

2231
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:34,399
you know

2232
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:41,800
basically getting nerfed by nan just on

2233
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:41,799
the edge of something i guess

2234
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,480
all right

2235
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,479
well

2236
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:29,519
i wasn't expecting that

2237
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:30,399
uh that is not what i was expecting

2238
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,679
so

2239
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:35,519
uh yeah i think we probably are gonna

2240
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:37,810
want

2241
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,040
i i have no idea what to make of that um

2242
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:41,119
[Music]

2243
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:42,719
i do you know what one other thing i

2244
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:44,238
would like to look at because now that

2245
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,399
we're collecting information about this

2246
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:48,638
is kind of crazy

2247
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:50,719
uh i would like to take a quick look and

2248
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:53,279
just ask what does it look like in

2249
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:55,679
completely complete darkness so

2250
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:58,000
does the entire light

2251
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:00,158
strobe or just

2252
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,319
the local

2253
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:05,319
like which is what's actually happening

2254
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:05,319
here

2255
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:18,079
so it's it's really

2256
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:18,079
more or less just

2257
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:24,559
it's more or less just those light

2258
01:50:21,279 --> 01:50:26,559
probes it looks like

2259
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,560
everybody else only gets slightly

2260
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:31,199
brighter or dimmer

2261
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:31,199
you know what i mean

2262
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:39,840
but they otherwise retain their sampling

2263
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,840
fairly sanely

2264
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,159
and in that case

2265
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:49,839
where it's actually embedded so you're

2266
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:51,920
not able to ever sample that light

2267
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,679
source only the ones around it then it

2268
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:56,880
does all blink

2269
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:59,520
so it's only just the ones that the

2270
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,440
light is on top of

2271
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,679
so that suggests that it's our it's our

2272
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:07,039
interior casting thing presumably

2273
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:09,359
causing this problem i would guess

2274
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:09,359
right

2275
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:15,599
uh so my assumption would be that if we

2276
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:18,319
like furthermore for testing

2277
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:19,679
decided to turn that off

2278
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:21,158
that we would no longer have this

2279
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:25,920
problem

2280
01:51:21,158 --> 01:51:26,719
presumably meaning if in here we said

2281
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:30,000
yeah

2282
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:31,198
the like team in less than t ray part of

2283
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,079
things

2284
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:38,158
that's not

2285
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:40,960
like sufficient you have to actually

2286
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:40,960
be outside

2287
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,920
right

2288
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,840
oh still not

2289
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:04,599
okay

2290
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:59,198
i do wonder if i might be just too

2291
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:01,679
out of food right now to tackle

2292
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:02,799
something like this

2293
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:05,039
this is going to be a little

2294
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:07,920
nitty-gritty and i'm kind of hungry

2295
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:10,920
that never goes well

2296
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,920
um

2297
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:11,279
so i don't have any particular idea

2298
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:13,920
about how to approach this to be

2299
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,759
completely honest um

2300
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,520
turning on nan exceptions does seem like

2301
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:19,360
a good idea i would agree with that

2302
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:23,560
approach

2303
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:23,559
but i'm also kind of confused

2304
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:28,769
as to what i just saw

2305
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:31,948
nan's or otherwise that didn't seem

2306
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:31,949
[Music]

2307
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,639
oh

2308
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:39,439
although

2309
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:42,560
um so there is one thing i would say

2310
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:43,839
about that is are those directly on the

2311
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,360
edge

2312
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,520
because if those are directly on the

2313
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:51,158
edge then actually i do have a thought

2314
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,159
so hold on a second

2315
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:02,118
leave that as max for now what is the

2316
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,118
jitter radius

2317
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:09,598
okay damn i'll say if those were

2318
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:12,079
actually on the uh atlas

2319
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:13,520
or the spatial grids

2320
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:15,279
um

2321
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,000
directly on the border i would have said

2322
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:22,158
that would have possibly made some sense

2323
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:24,479
but they're not so it doesn't matter

2324
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:26,399
i assume that this cannot fix it right

2325
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:28,479
meaning like so this value should not

2326
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:31,960
affect it at all it should blink

2327
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:31,959
no matter what

2328
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:57,520
this is fascinating

2329
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:00,800
so it's like only on some frames

2330
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:03,599
does being inside the light

2331
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:06,079
apparently work and on other frames it

2332
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:06,079
doesn't

2333
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,719
that is really weird

2334
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,880
i'm gonna put it to do in here by the

2335
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:16,880
way

2336
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,158
all right

2337
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,880
i got nothing

2338
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,880
um

2339
01:56:31,118 --> 01:56:35,519
so we should probably get snacks and

2340
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:36,800
turn on nands and step through this and

2341
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,119
try to find

2342
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,119
um

2343
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:44,559
what the heck is going on here because i

2344
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:44,560
have no idea what time is it

2345
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:48,399
it's 2 20.

2346
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:50,399
uh yeah i mean let's do snack you can do

2347
01:56:48,399 --> 01:56:52,638
some snacks

2348
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:52,638
uh

2349
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:58,079
oh fnarp no this this is not even

2350
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:00,400
running

2351
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:02,000
uh there's no accumulating is not even

2352
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,479
ever set to anything

2353
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,800
in fact we don't even need this if in

2354
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:09,519
there at all um we could literally get

2355
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:12,079
rid of accumulating as a thing

2356
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,400
entirely

2357
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:15,679
frame odd does look very suspicious

2358
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:18,679
although i don't think we use it anymore

2359
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:18,679
either

2360
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:32,319
um

2361
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:34,000
so all that stuff is is not

2362
01:57:32,319 --> 01:57:35,679
doesn't actually do anything

2363
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,279
um

2364
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:38,399
so

2365
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:41,439
right

2366
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:43,839
uh it's it's just it's doing this for

2367
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:44,719
some numerical or uninitialized variable

2368
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,400
reason

2369
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:47,840
again like i said this code has been

2370
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:50,238
kind of like

2371
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:52,480
uh optimized a little too far just

2372
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:55,519
because it's lighting it has to be very

2373
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:58,238
fast because we do it so many times

2374
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:59,760
uh which makes it pretty easy to have

2375
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:01,919
problems like this

2376
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:03,520
that are going to be like you know

2377
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,719
oh you missed a little something because

2378
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:08,159
you were doing this like aggressive

2379
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,158
optimization very likely

2380
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:14,000
so uh but i think like snacks and then

2381
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:15,439
you know let's let's maybe turn on nands

2382
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,960
or you know

2383
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:18,079
try some of the things to sort of shake

2384
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,960
out and see

2385
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:21,760
if we can see something a little bit you

2386
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,399
know

2387
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:24,400
uh more

2388
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:29,199
something pronounced that will kind of

2389
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:31,039
fall out um i don't know

2390
01:58:29,198 --> 01:58:32,879
again i can't really even guess what it

2391
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:35,599
would be though is the thing

2392
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,118
so it's a bit weird but you know

2393
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,520
we'll just say okay

2394
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:39,519
um

2395
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:42,960
you know something's up so whatever

2396
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,280
whatevs

2397
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:45,279
um

2398
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:49,359
yeah

2399
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:53,960
all right so so snack time i'm gonna

2400
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:53,960
grab a snack and then we'll take a look

all right we're back

02:03:09,439 --> 02:03:14,839
we're back

2417
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:14,840
and we have snacks

2418
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:28,559
really that's all that requires snacks

2419
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:31,559
you can debug anything if you have

2420
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:31,560
snacks

2421
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:47,599
that was not out of the stream that was

2422
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:47,599
in there the whole time

2423
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:53,039
it was previously part of t valid which

2424
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:56,039
was anded in but i just moved it down

2425
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:56,039
right

2426
02:03:56,238 --> 02:03:59,238
right

2427
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,840
if the ray can be negative

2428
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:19,560
the ray is never negative

2429
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,560
the ray is only positive

2430
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:30,399
you can have gone backwards

2431
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:32,800
and the t-min will be negative because

2432
02:04:30,399 --> 02:04:35,439
you start out inside so t-min can be

2433
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:37,760
negative but the ray is always pointing

2434
02:04:35,439 --> 02:04:39,839
forwards for purposes of the analysis

2435
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,840
right

2436
02:04:42,158 --> 02:04:45,118
uh the change from throb to blink was

2437
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,279
because

2438
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:48,639
i took out the temporal smoothing

2439
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:53,000
there's some temporal smoothing in there

2440
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:53,000
to reduce noise uh you can

2441
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:57,119
um

2442
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:59,920
i don't know how well you could see this

2443
02:04:57,118 --> 02:04:59,920
uh actually

2444
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:04,400
let me try and

2445
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:07,439
show you

2446
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:10,199
so uh if you look

2447
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:12,479
probably that's not the best um

2448
02:05:10,199 --> 02:05:15,679
[Music]

2449
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:19,559
so if you look at the worlds with the

2450
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:19,560
lighting turned back on

2451
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:34,359
well

2452
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:42,479
is it just me or is the lighting why is

2453
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:44,560
the lighting so stable

2454
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:48,039
something's we we've done something

2455
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:48,039
really busted

2456
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:55,520
that's the lighting with no smoothing

2457
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:58,639
right now

2458
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:58,639
how is that possible

2459
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:06,000
oh duh um sorry

2460
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:08,719
we turned off the noise

2461
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,719
uh because we were testing so yeah yeah

2462
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:12,239
sorry i can't do this uh

2463
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:14,560
i can't do that demo without turning

2464
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:17,279
back on the noise so

2465
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:18,239
let me turn back on the noise so you can

2466
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:19,198
see

2467
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:20,638
so

2468
02:06:19,198 --> 02:06:22,479
in this

2469
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:26,880
clause right here

2470
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:28,078
um if i let the actual random samples be

2471
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:30,400
random

2472
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:34,319
then you will see the noise that i was

2473
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:34,319
like what's going on it's because yeah

2474
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:38,078
so

2475
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,920
um

2476
02:06:38,078 --> 02:06:42,158
it's it's kind of hard to see

2477
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:45,118
uh probably especially on stream but you

2478
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:49,279
can sort of see hopefully how like you

2479
02:06:45,118 --> 02:06:51,198
get a little bit of of noise right

2480
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:53,599
um and that's just because we're not

2481
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:55,839
taking enough samples

2482
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:58,480
uh to to really capture all of the

2483
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:00,960
lighting so you know as you randomly

2484
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:04,959
perturb them you get a little bit

2485
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,960
right you get a little bit of noise

2486
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:13,198
it's not much

2487
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:15,520
but there is noise

2488
02:07:13,198 --> 02:07:15,519
right

2489
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:19,520
um yes it's the blinking

2490
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:22,400
um well

2491
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:24,000
the flashing right the flashing in here

2492
02:07:22,399 --> 02:07:26,479
the flickering

2493
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,520
not the blinking of this other this we

2494
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:29,279
don't know

2495
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:31,599
what that is that's what we have to

2496
02:07:29,279 --> 02:07:34,639
solve

2497
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:37,360
um so you could leave it like this

2498
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:37,359
if you want to

2499
02:07:37,439 --> 02:07:40,158
but

2500
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:42,158
it just doesn't look very good right

2501
02:07:40,158 --> 02:07:43,359
like it it would be kind of annoying if

2502
02:07:42,158 --> 02:07:44,879
the game just looked like that all the

2503
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:48,880
time that that little flickering and so

2504
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:48,880
you get rid of it one of two ways either

2505
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:55,359
you

2506
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:57,039
do a better sampling scheme

2507
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:59,598
which maybe we should do

2508
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:00,960
right blue noise would have less of a

2509
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:03,440
problem

2510
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:05,118
some kind of stable sampling

2511
02:08:03,439 --> 02:08:07,198
would not have this problem but then you

2512
02:08:05,118 --> 02:08:08,799
get other artifacts like with when

2513
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:11,598
lights move around you would get other

2514
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,119
artifacts right

2515
02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:13,920
um

2516
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:15,198
so

2517
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,480
you know

2518
02:08:15,198 --> 02:08:19,118
you have to figure out what you're

2519
02:08:16,479 --> 02:08:20,479
trying to optimize for but

2520
02:08:19,118 --> 02:08:22,559
anyway you could leave it like that

2521
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:24,718
another thing you can do

2522
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:26,639
is change your sampling and finally yet

2523
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:28,399
another thing to do is smooth it over

2524
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:29,599
time a little bit so you just so that

2525
02:08:28,399 --> 02:08:30,719
noise

2526
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:32,800
effectively what you're doing in that

2527
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:34,239
case is is sort of

2528
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:36,639
averaging over time so that you

2529
02:08:34,238 --> 02:08:37,839
effectively have more samples

2530
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:40,078
right

2531
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:41,520
because if you only take 16

2532
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:43,549
samples

2533
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:44,719
out of every texel per frame

2534
02:08:43,550 --> 02:08:46,639
[Music]

2535
02:08:44,719 --> 02:08:48,319
and that's not enough if you sample

2536
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:50,800
average over 4 frames now you're

2537
02:08:48,319 --> 02:08:53,519
effectively taking 64 samples which

2538
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:56,960
right it gets better

2539
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:58,800
so that's why we have the temporal like

2540
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:00,960
that that's why we like blend over time

2541
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:02,560
there

2542
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:04,399
and

2543
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:06,159
you know it introduces a little bit of

2544
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:08,638
lag in the lighting but otherwise you

2545
02:09:06,158 --> 02:09:10,319
don't really notice and it looks and you

2546
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:12,319
and the flickering goes away right so

2547
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:14,559
that's why we do that

2548
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:16,840
we've turned it off now because

2549
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:19,280
it's much easier to see this blinking

2550
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:21,840
behavior um

2551
02:09:19,279 --> 02:09:24,238
is literally an on off uh with the

2552
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,800
temporal smoothing it looks like a you

2553
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:28,399
know a smooth curve because it's on and

2554
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:31,039
it goes up and it goes down it's like

2555
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:33,839
right it's like pulse code modulation

2556
02:09:31,039 --> 02:09:33,840
um

2557
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:38,639
so we have it turned off right now

2558
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:40,719
and that's

2559
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:43,440
but that's why

2560
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:45,359
that's why when we're not debugging we

2561
02:09:43,439 --> 02:09:47,118
turn it on is because we don't want that

2562
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:49,359
that flickering

2563
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:49,359
right

2564
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:53,678
um

2565
02:09:51,118 --> 02:09:55,920
yeah and exactly yes the temporal

2566
02:09:53,679 --> 02:09:58,000
averaging is what makes the blink turn

2567
02:09:55,920 --> 02:10:00,399
into a throb because it's basically

2568
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:03,359
doing an interpolation between full

2569
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:06,078
bright and zero bright that creates a

2570
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:08,319
curve like a little like you know a wave

2571
02:10:06,078 --> 02:10:08,319
right

2572
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:15,440
it's turning a square wave

2573
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:19,439
into something smoother

2574
02:10:15,439 --> 02:10:19,439
by using linear interpolation right

2575
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:26,319
so it turns into something more like a

2576
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,118
triangle wave

2577
02:10:26,319 --> 02:10:28,960
and

2578
02:10:27,118 --> 02:10:30,880
because it's diffusive it's more it's

2579
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:33,439
it's even less like a triangle wave it's

2580
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:35,760
probably more like a sine wave almost

2581
02:10:33,439 --> 02:10:35,759
you know

2582
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:42,879
so

2583
02:10:41,118 --> 02:10:44,799
but all that works fine none of that is

2584
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:46,319
really implicated here

2585
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:48,880
that's doing that's exactly what it

2586
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:50,960
should have done so that's like great

2587
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:52,560
um so really the only thing we're trying

2588
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:54,078
to figure out is why is it linking in

2589
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:57,039
the first place because we don't really

2590
02:10:54,078 --> 02:10:58,880
understand and so um

2591
02:10:57,039 --> 02:11:01,198
and and furthermore why are none of the

2592
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:04,319
other lights blinking and also why does

2593
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:06,879
it not blink if it's larger it only does

2594
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:09,039
this blinking if it is small right

2595
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:09,039
so

2596
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:12,639
in my recollection anyway

2597
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:16,319
if

2598
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:16,319
we were to change the size of the glove

2599
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:21,039
right so the glove

2600
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:24,480
at the moment

2601
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:25,760
is 0.4

2602
02:11:24,479 --> 02:11:28,399
if we were to change the size of the

2603
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:31,280
glove to like 0.5

2604
02:11:28,399 --> 02:11:33,519
i believe it just doesn't blink anymore

2605
02:11:31,279 --> 02:11:33,519
right

2606
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:37,639
um

2607
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,760
right

2608
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:47,359
so it's like

2609
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:49,919
there's definitely and you can see that

2610
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:52,880
it kind of might blink if it's right at

2611
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:56,158
the right location so something about

2612
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:57,520
it being exactly this size

2613
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:58,960
creates

2614
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:00,960
like whatever the situation is that

2615
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:03,960
we're seeing it creates this like

2616
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,960
problem

2617
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:09,279
uh and we'll see

2618
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:13,239
oh if this is gameplay

2619
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:26,000
um so mts mox was asking

2620
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:29,919
if we slow the time step down

2621
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
does it still blink okay so that means

2622
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:38,719
that

2623
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,198
that means that just the slight

2624
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:44,319
numerical difference

2625
02:12:41,198 --> 02:12:45,198
of the glove

2626
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:48,799
right

2627
02:12:45,198 --> 02:12:50,879
is enough to make this happen

2628
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:53,880
whatever the this is

2629
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:53,880
right

2630
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:05,279
which

2631
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:15,159
i mean it could be plausible that it

2632
02:13:10,078 --> 02:13:15,158
happens to just line up exactly

2633
02:13:16,078 --> 02:13:18,960
um

2634
02:13:17,039 --> 02:13:21,279
and moving the time step back up again

2635
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:23,279
did not like

2636
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:25,039
having the low time step allowed it to

2637
02:13:23,279 --> 02:13:28,599
get into a state where it's now no

2638
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:28,599
longer doing that

2639
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:34,719
which is super weird

2640
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:39,960
you have to admit that's pretty weird

2641
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:39,960
right

2642
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:12,759
so here's a question

2643
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:12,760
is it just z

2644
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:20,158
like is it just because we're not

2645
02:14:17,439 --> 02:14:22,399
jittering in z

2646
02:14:20,158 --> 02:14:22,399
right

2647
02:14:25,118 --> 02:14:28,559
i don't think that's plausible but

2648
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,560
let's find out

2649
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,560
so

2650
02:14:48,158 --> 02:14:52,759
if i draw

2651
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:52,760
everything

2652
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:09,360
like

2653
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:12,000
that is suspiciously

2654
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:12,960
that is suspiciously at

2655
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,800
the

2656
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:17,039
just there

2657
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:17,039
right

2658
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:22,760
right

2659
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:37,840
rather suspicious

2660
02:15:43,279 --> 02:15:45,679
hmm

2661
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:51,840
i say

2662
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:51,840
so

2663
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:05,239
so i don't know

2664
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:16,560
i don't really know what we want to do

2665
02:16:14,158 --> 02:16:16,559
about that

2666
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:19,840
we probably don't want a full

2667
02:16:20,238 --> 02:16:23,919
uh jitter radius in z

2668
02:16:24,319 --> 02:16:26,960
but

2669
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:28,638
i'm gonna go ahead and

2670
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:33,840
and say

2671
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:33,840
all right what if we just took the whole

2672
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:39,120
took the whole situation

2673
02:16:36,799 --> 02:16:41,119
and said we're jittering on all three

2674
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:43,840
axes

2675
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:46,079
so that you can't ever pick out that

2676
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:47,679
that kind of a a compass

2677
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:48,799
right

2678
02:16:47,679 --> 02:16:51,840
um

2679
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:51,840
what happens then

2680
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:57,919
you still get a lot of just like weird

2681
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:58,840
like sort of sampling

2682
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:01,840
i don't

2683
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:03,840
know it seems to be still way too

2684
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:07,359
consistent

2685
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:09,280
and i'm not quite sure why

2686
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:12,639
like it should be very consistently

2687
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:15,840
click uh flickery but it's not

2688
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:15,839
sometimes it's stronger

2689
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:24,399
and i don't know why

2690
02:17:24,718 --> 02:17:28,959
or i don't know z

2691
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:31,280
get it

2692
02:17:28,959 --> 02:17:33,358
it's a joke

2693
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:39,639
math humor

2694
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:39,639
is not very good humor as it turns out

2695
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:59,200
like why like what's the deal with that

2696
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:01,920
i don't get it

2697
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:04,719
i don't understand why it flick why it

2698
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:07,519
goes in and out like that

2699
02:18:04,718 --> 02:18:10,079
if it's purely random something about it

2700
02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:11,439
must not actually be that random because

2701
02:18:10,079 --> 02:18:14,478
if it was

2702
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:17,679
then it shouldn't have such a pronounced

2703
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:17,679
difference there should it

2704
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:23,880
seems weird to me

2705
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:34,239
right like that that part where it just

2706
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,799
kind of

2707
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:39,799
it flickers out is that because of the z

2708
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:39,799
again

2709
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,000
maybe

2710
02:19:10,558 --> 02:19:15,119
but that sure was the problem in general

2711
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,840
though like not

2712
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:20,840
jittering on z was a massive mistake

2713
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,840
right

2714
02:19:24,959 --> 02:19:28,638
i think the lesson we've learned today

2715
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:28,638
is

2716
02:19:28,959 --> 02:19:34,079
don't mess with monte carlo

2717
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:37,439
you know what i'm saying

2718
02:19:34,079 --> 02:19:37,439
don't mess with monte carlo

2719
02:19:38,398 --> 02:19:42,478
monte carlo

2720
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:47,079
needs to sample where it needs to sample

2721
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:47,079
and don't be messing with it

2722
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,239
but

2723
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:55,039
i don't think we're quite out of the

2724
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:56,879
woods yet

2725
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,800
we're not quite there yet

2726
02:19:56,879 --> 02:20:00,959
we're close

2727
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:00,959
but

2728
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,840
not quite there yet

2729
02:20:04,318 --> 02:20:07,840
all right

2730
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
oh and here's some light leaking right

2731
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:10,000
so

2732
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:17,200
here's an example

2733
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:19,600
of of light leaking out

2734
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:21,520
uh which is why i say i do think like

2735
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:22,960
you know we we might have to have that t

2736
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:24,880
inside remember i said like it doesn't

2737
02:20:22,959 --> 02:20:28,839
look like we need it

2738
02:20:24,879 --> 02:20:30,398
but we might we might well need it

2739
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:31,280
right

2740
02:20:30,398 --> 02:20:33,199
uh

2741
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:34,319
and you know whether we do or not

2742
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:36,240
depends we haven't really looked too

2743
02:20:34,318 --> 02:20:37,760
closely at that but you you do get that

2744
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:40,879
sort of light leaking happening there

2745
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:40,880
which shouldn't be happening right

2746
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:44,640
but it's not the end of the world

2747
02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:47,040
you could ship the game like that if you

2748
02:20:44,639 --> 02:20:47,039
needed to

2749
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,600
but

2750
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:53,079
while we're in here we might as well

2751
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:53,079
take a look at it right

2752
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:01,920
all right

2753
02:21:04,478 --> 02:21:09,478
okay

2754
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:09,478
we've had snack time

2755
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,800
the lighting looks really good

2756
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:19,119
um i'm pretty happy with it so i'm not

2757
02:21:16,799 --> 02:21:21,279
you know i'm certainly not complaining

2758
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:23,520
um i just think maybe we could go a

2759
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:25,520
little further with it than we have uh

2760
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:28,479
so i think it's possible that it could

2761
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:30,239
get uh you know

2762
02:21:28,478 --> 02:21:32,879
still a bit better in a way that we

2763
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:34,318
would care about um so we're i don't

2764
02:21:32,879 --> 02:21:37,119
think we're quite at the point of

2765
02:21:34,318 --> 02:21:39,279
diminishing returns we're almost there

2766
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:41,200
uh but not quite i don't think i think

2767
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:44,239
we could still get a little bit of a

2768
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,880
bigger quality increase

2769
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:48,799
um now we could i do think at this point

2770
02:21:46,879 --> 02:21:50,959
what we could do though is say we can

2771
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:52,799
leave it for a while like it's probably

2772
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:55,039
good enough now

2773
02:21:52,799 --> 02:21:57,039
uh that we can make the game this way so

2774
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:59,280
what we might want to do instead is say

2775
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,880
like look this is fine for now

2776
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,319
and we'll revisit it again in a couple

2777
02:22:00,879 --> 02:22:03,839
of months

2778
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:06,159
um

2779
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,159
and

2780
02:22:07,439 --> 02:22:12,720
look at a few other lighting things

2781
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:14,959
that are more important for example an

2782
02:22:12,719 --> 02:22:15,679
exposure curve

2783
02:22:14,959 --> 02:22:17,839
uh

2784
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:19,680
putting in an exposure curve would be

2785
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:20,799
relatively straightforward and help us

2786
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:23,840
out

2787
02:22:20,799 --> 02:22:24,719
so an exposure curve and also a

2788
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:28,318
uh

2789
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:31,279
a notion of like light brightness

2790
02:22:28,318 --> 02:22:33,279
that allows us to do things like bloom

2791
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:34,319
uh and that sort of thing

2792
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:37,200
right

2793
02:22:34,318 --> 02:22:40,079
so so at the moment i would say like

2794
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:42,079
probably improving the light transport i

2795
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:44,318
do think there's another little bit of

2796
02:22:42,079 --> 02:22:47,600
quality to get out of here without uh

2797
02:22:44,318 --> 02:22:48,398
substantially doing much

2798
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,318
so

2799
02:22:48,398 --> 02:22:51,199
you know maybe we should do that i don't

2800
02:22:50,318 --> 02:22:53,439
know

2801
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:55,840
um but i do think we could also make the

2802
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:59,040
decision that this is plenty good enough

2803
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:59,920
for real-time global illumination

2804
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:02,080
uh

2805
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:05,359
maybe up until we want to take a final

2806
02:23:02,079 --> 02:23:07,439
pass at it before shipping

2807
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:10,159
uh because it certainly creates the

2808
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:10,960
character of the game just fine

2809
02:23:10,159 --> 02:23:12,879
uh

2810
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:14,478
but what we don't have is any sort of

2811
02:23:12,879 --> 02:23:17,519
concept of how bright the light should

2812
02:23:14,478 --> 02:23:20,239
be uh or how the exposure curve should

2813
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:21,120
go or or like how bloom should go right

2814
02:23:20,239 --> 02:23:23,280
um

2815
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,280
so

2816
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:27,040
um

2817
02:23:24,719 --> 02:23:29,679
so i don't know

2818
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:32,160
so that part's harder uh to square i

2819
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:34,239
don't know

2820
02:23:32,159 --> 02:23:37,039
what we want to do about that more

2821
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:37,039
specifically

2822
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:41,040
hard to say

2823
02:23:38,959 --> 02:23:41,839
i do think this looks really good now

2824
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:44,080
though

2825
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:44,079
um

2826
02:23:44,239 --> 02:23:47,520
like i'm pretty happy with where this is

2827
02:23:46,478 --> 02:23:50,719
at

2828
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:53,520
uh and that's even a pretty small light

2829
02:23:50,719 --> 02:23:55,279
uh at this point

2830
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:57,359
i don't know how small these lights can

2831
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:58,800
get now but

2832
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:01,520
um

2833
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:04,079
it it's that's pretty good like

2834
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:06,800
i'm kind of surprised honestly

2835
02:24:04,079 --> 02:24:07,049
of how stable that is uh

2836
02:24:06,799 --> 02:24:09,279
so

2837
02:24:07,049 --> 02:24:11,199
[Music]

2838
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:13,920
that's kind of nuts that that works as

2839
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:15,600
well as it does uh with no biasing

2840
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,000
towards the light source uh it's

2841
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:20,559
obviously not perfect and you do get

2842
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,959
if you get it small enough like now

2843
02:24:20,559 --> 02:24:25,279
uh you do still have a fair bit of like

2844
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:27,759
intensity variation that's not great

2845
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:29,040
right like you know you wouldn't

2846
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:32,079
you would like it to be a little bit

2847
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,880
better than that if it could be

2848
02:24:32,079 --> 02:24:35,398
um

2849
02:24:32,879 --> 02:24:38,398
but it's still kind of

2850
02:24:35,398 --> 02:24:39,920
surprisingly good right

2851
02:24:38,398 --> 02:24:42,559
um and

2852
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:47,040
there's also no real reason

2853
02:24:42,559 --> 02:24:48,879
uh we can't use just larger lights

2854
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:51,200
um

2855
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:53,119
in most of these scenarios like the the

2856
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:54,800
the chances that we need the light

2857
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:58,479
specifically

2858
02:24:54,799 --> 02:25:01,119
uh to be like that small or low

2859
02:24:58,478 --> 02:25:02,959
because there's not a lot of situations

2860
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:04,960
where it's going to matter that the you

2861
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:07,199
know what size the light is relative to

2862
02:25:04,959 --> 02:25:11,358
what size the light should be

2863
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:14,640
um i would assume right uh so

2864
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:17,920
yeah if the light oops that's a

2865
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:18,879
like a non-light source

2866
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:21,280
so

2867
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:22,879
uh if the light is i don't know what the

2868
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:25,120
light intensity should be but if the

2869
02:25:22,879 --> 02:25:28,318
light is like a larger light

2870
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:31,439
like the 0.75 version

2871
02:25:28,318 --> 02:25:33,760
uh then it's pretty stable

2872
02:25:31,439 --> 02:25:35,920
uh and we probably just don't have to

2873
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:39,280
worry about it that much right like you

2874
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:41,439
know that would just work um

2875
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:42,800
and be fine

2876
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:45,680
right

2877
02:25:42,799 --> 02:25:48,478
uh and you know the the main thing that

2878
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:50,720
you know maybe

2879
02:25:48,478 --> 02:25:53,599
i don't really want to do this but

2880
02:25:50,719 --> 02:25:56,639
you know if we could have had spherical

2881
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:57,520
lights that would have been nice

2882
02:25:56,639 --> 02:26:00,559
um

2883
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:02,079
because it's a little bit not as good

2884
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:04,398
because the square some of the

2885
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:07,359
squareness of that i think is just from

2886
02:26:04,398 --> 02:26:09,199
the fact that the the thing is square

2887
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:11,040
it is a square light

2888
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:13,760
so a square light should

2889
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:15,760
probably cast a square

2890
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:17,120
light on the ground

2891
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:20,120
you know what i mean

2892
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:20,120
um

2893
02:26:24,478 --> 02:26:27,920
so

2894
02:26:26,318 --> 02:26:29,920
i do think one of the problems we have

2895
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:31,359
is like if we really want to chase the

2896
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:33,040
quality

2897
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:35,040
in addition to like improving that

2898
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:37,040
sampling potentially

2899
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:38,880
uh the other thing i think we're gonna

2900
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:40,880
run into pretty quickly

2901
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:43,839
is just the fact that

2902
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:47,119
we probably need to add spheres

2903
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:49,359
because without spheres

2904
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:51,359
uh we ain't gonna get

2905
02:26:49,359 --> 02:26:53,760
you know

2906
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:55,760
we ain't gonna get a radio looking light

2907
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:57,680
source regardless of what the sampling

2908
02:26:55,760 --> 02:27:00,639
looks like because it ain't

2909
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:00,639
radial to begin with

2910
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:05,000
so um

2911
02:27:18,559 --> 02:27:22,639
uh you know i'd really rather not

2912
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:32,318
it complicates things

2913
02:27:28,799 --> 02:27:34,079
uh computationally not

2914
02:27:32,318 --> 02:27:37,600
it's not the worst thing in the world

2915
02:27:34,079 --> 02:27:37,600
but it's not fantastic

2916
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,559
um

2917
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:45,359
and so you know it slows down that the

2918
02:27:42,559 --> 02:27:48,079
ray casting of course i don't actually

2919
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:49,520
know how much of the cost is the ray

2920
02:27:48,079 --> 02:27:51,840
casting

2921
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:54,239
and how much of the cost is the sampling

2922
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:57,680
i suspect the sampling at this point is

2923
02:27:54,239 --> 02:27:59,600
actually our biggest cost

2924
02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:02,479
uh the ray

2925
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:04,720
actual marching through space

2926
02:28:02,478 --> 02:28:08,000
doing collisions so

2927
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:09,039
it's possible that we could just issue

2928
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,120
the

2929
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:12,960
intersection code for a sphere at the

2930
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:14,800
same time as we do

2931
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:17,279
uh the

2932
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:17,279
the um

2933
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:21,439
axis align bounding box and then we just

2934
02:28:20,079 --> 02:28:24,398
have a parameter that's like is it a

2935
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:27,398
sphere or is it not you know

2936
02:28:24,398 --> 02:28:27,398
um

2937
02:29:02,239 --> 02:29:07,119
yeah i don't know

2938
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:09,760
i mean i suppose maybe the argument here

2939
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,600
is we should test it

2940
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:13,680
because it's not that hard to add it

2941
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:14,720
it's just hard to add it so that it's

2942
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:17,280
fast

2943
02:29:14,719 --> 02:29:19,599
right like the the adding of a sphere

2944
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:21,120
intersection code is not particularly

2945
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:23,040
difficult the

2946
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:25,439
determining whether we can make that run

2947
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:28,080
fast enough

2948
02:29:25,439 --> 02:29:29,440
for it to not be an issue is a different

2949
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:32,838
matter

2950
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:32,838
[Music]

2951
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:38,719
since

2952
02:29:34,719 --> 02:29:42,318
most things are aabs you could probably

2953
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:44,719
also do another thing where you actually

2954
02:29:42,318 --> 02:29:44,719
just

2955
02:29:46,478 --> 02:29:52,159
put the spheres

2956
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:54,560
in some other

2957
02:29:52,159 --> 02:29:56,559
like if you know that the only things in

2958
02:29:54,559 --> 02:29:58,159
the world that are spheres are light

2959
02:29:56,559 --> 02:30:00,559
sources

2960
02:29:58,159 --> 02:30:03,280
you could just do a separate pass over

2961
02:30:00,559 --> 02:30:04,799
those that's not

2962
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:07,520
that you don't

2963
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:08,879
do that for

2964
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:11,880
right

2965
02:30:08,879 --> 02:30:11,879
um

2966
02:30:22,398 --> 02:30:25,840
but then again i suppose it depends on

2967
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:28,239
how many lights you have

2968
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:29,680
you know maybe you've got a lot of these

2969
02:30:28,239 --> 02:30:31,600
in the actual game like there's all

2970
02:30:29,680 --> 02:30:35,880
these projectiles and stuff and then you

2971
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:35,880
don't really want to be doing that

2972
02:31:08,719 --> 02:31:12,478
i wish i had something more constructed

2973
02:31:10,478 --> 02:31:14,398
to say here but i really don't maybe we

2974
02:31:12,478 --> 02:31:16,639
just need to sleep on it

2975
02:31:14,398 --> 02:31:16,639
um

2976
02:31:20,398 --> 02:31:23,760
because i think like it eventually

2977
02:31:22,239 --> 02:31:25,199
you're probably gonna have so many of

2978
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:27,120
these lights flying around like for

2979
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:29,680
projectiles and crap

2980
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:31,439
you're probably going to want them to be

2981
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:33,680
you know

2982
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:33,680
um

2983
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:40,880
you're probably going to want them to be

2984
02:31:40,959 --> 02:31:44,478
bucketed just like everything else that

2985
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:46,318
you're not running through giant lists

2986
02:31:44,478 --> 02:31:48,959
of them

2987
02:31:46,318 --> 02:31:51,439
um all the time so

2988
02:31:48,959 --> 02:31:51,438
you know

2989
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:59,680
you would probably just need them to be

2990
02:31:56,478 --> 02:32:01,599
in the array like everything else

2991
02:31:59,680 --> 02:32:04,000
what happens if we create the worst case

2992
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:07,120
scenario so like super bright super

2993
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:09,359
small that should be like really noisy

2994
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:12,079
um

2995
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:13,280
would be my guess

2996
02:32:12,079 --> 02:32:16,600
but i don't know

2997
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:16,600
find out

2998
02:32:24,239 --> 02:32:28,879
surprisingly it's you know it's really

2999
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,719
not that bad but you can see the noise

3000
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:31,519
right like

3001
02:32:30,719 --> 02:32:33,599
the

3002
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:35,280
reflective noise

3003
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:37,200
sort of on the periphery right you can

3004
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:40,800
see that pretty pretty good and and the

3005
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:42,720
specular would be very noisy right like

3006
02:32:40,799 --> 02:32:46,079
right

3007
02:32:42,719 --> 02:32:48,159
um because it's not getting filtered

3008
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:50,318
like the diffuse is where it's you know

3009
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:53,318
kind of going through another

3010
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:53,318
um

3011
02:32:54,719 --> 02:33:00,039
you know another pass there right

3012
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:00,040
so

3013
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:25,680
i'm torn

3014
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:26,880
i apologize for being indecisive here

3015
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:30,120
but i really just don't know what i

3016
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:30,119
should do

3017
02:33:36,879 --> 02:33:44,159
other than hang out with the puss

3018
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:44,159
because that's always a plus regardless

3019
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:50,680
um

3020
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:50,680
yeah so

3021
02:34:07,520 --> 02:34:10,720
i should also mention something that's

3022
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,120
probably not obvious from what we've

3023
02:34:10,719 --> 02:34:15,279
been doing

3024
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:18,399
that i know but maybe not everyone out

3025
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:22,159
there knows or hasn't thought about

3026
02:34:18,398 --> 02:34:23,439
so if you're wondering um what normally

3027
02:34:22,159 --> 02:34:25,760
happens

3028
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:28,318
uh in engines here so

3029
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:30,398
uh obviously most game engines don't

3030
02:34:28,318 --> 02:34:31,680
actually do real-time global

3031
02:34:30,398 --> 02:34:32,719
illumination

3032
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:35,200
um

3033
02:34:32,719 --> 02:34:36,959
quite on this scale and the reason for

3034
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:39,040
that

3035
02:34:36,959 --> 02:34:41,279
is actually because their geometry is

3036
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:42,800
just a lot more complicated right so

3037
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:45,840
we happen to be dealing with a world

3038
02:34:42,799 --> 02:34:47,679
that's like very simple like it's not

3039
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:51,040
you know um

3040
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:53,840
100 000 polygon models moving around in

3041
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:56,240
like complex worlds it's just these like

3042
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,040
it's this this like block world

3043
02:34:56,239 --> 02:34:59,439
so

3044
02:34:57,040 --> 02:35:01,840
we can do like

3045
02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:04,639
global illumination in real time and

3046
02:35:01,840 --> 02:35:06,799
it's not a huge deal um

3047
02:35:04,639 --> 02:35:08,478
when you want to do that in something

3048
02:35:06,799 --> 02:35:10,000
like

3049
02:35:08,478 --> 02:35:11,840
you know unreal engine or whatever they

3050
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,478
have to use more like sparse point

3051
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:17,040
sampling plus these sort of like

3052
02:35:14,478 --> 02:35:18,719
um transfer functions it's a long story

3053
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,080
but point being

3054
02:35:18,719 --> 02:35:21,599
you know they they couldn't probably be

3055
02:35:20,079 --> 02:35:24,000
as aggressive as we're being here just

3056
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:25,680
it's not uh plausible for them because

3057
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,799
they it their geometry is too

3058
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:28,000
complicated they have to do something

3059
02:35:26,799 --> 02:35:30,000
simpler

3060
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,398
but

3061
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:34,719
they also do something that we're not

3062
02:35:32,398 --> 02:35:37,439
doing and again it makes a difference

3063
02:35:34,719 --> 02:35:39,599
here so one of the things that they do

3064
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:42,079
is they special case well all engines

3065
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:44,800
special case light sources

3066
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:46,079
we don't so in our world there's no

3067
02:35:44,799 --> 02:35:48,000
difference between a light source and

3068
02:35:46,079 --> 02:35:49,760
anything else the only difference is

3069
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,639
that a light source emits light and

3070
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:55,200
other things don't that's it

3071
02:35:52,639 --> 02:35:56,478
but as a result of that it means that we

3072
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:57,359
they

3073
02:35:56,478 --> 02:35:59,279
uh

3074
02:35:57,359 --> 02:36:01,840
know that things are light sources and

3075
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:03,920
so what they then do is they do

3076
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:06,960
things like shadow mapping

3077
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:09,200
or direct ray casting of just the light

3078
02:36:06,959 --> 02:36:10,719
source

3079
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:13,280
to compute

3080
02:36:10,719 --> 02:36:14,318
their lighting equation for the direct

3081
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:17,439
lighting

3082
02:36:14,318 --> 02:36:19,840
what that means is they don't care about

3083
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:21,040
this what we're seeing here

3084
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:23,120
right

3085
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:26,560
because they would never have this they

3086
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:28,319
don't care what the direct illumination

3087
02:36:26,559 --> 02:36:30,239
component is

3088
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:31,680
of the light source from the global

3089
02:36:30,239 --> 02:36:33,680
illumination

3090
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:36,159
what they're actually going to do is use

3091
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:39,600
the global illumination only for a

3092
02:36:36,159 --> 02:36:41,680
secondary lighting value

3093
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:43,120
that is not

3094
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:45,359
the primary lightning value which is

3095
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:47,600
computed directly

3096
02:36:45,359 --> 02:36:49,680
right

3097
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:51,920
so

3098
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:54,479
we are doing something fundamentally

3099
02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:56,398
that is not what you would normally do

3100
02:36:54,478 --> 02:36:59,679
and that is one of the reasons why we're

3101
02:36:56,398 --> 02:37:01,680
having to think about this

3102
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:04,479
because you normally wouldn't think

3103
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:06,800
about this you would normally split and

3104
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:11,119
the system that we've written would only

3105
02:37:06,799 --> 02:37:12,719
be used for your indirect bounce

3106
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:13,760
i hope that makes some sense what i'm

3107
02:37:12,719 --> 02:37:16,559
saying

3108
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:18,159
so your indirect bounce lighting would

3109
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:19,840
be going through a system very similar

3110
02:37:18,159 --> 02:37:21,760
to what i've got

3111
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:23,200
uh just maybe a little less aggressive

3112
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:24,880
because you would need to be using

3113
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:26,399
simplified versions of your geometry or

3114
02:37:24,879 --> 02:37:28,318
whatever arjun just already happens to

3115
02:37:26,398 --> 02:37:30,478
be simpler

3116
02:37:28,318 --> 02:37:32,318
but you would not be using it for the

3117
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:35,519
direct lighting

3118
02:37:32,318 --> 02:37:37,119
um because we currently are using it for

3119
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:38,640
the direct lighting and maybe one could

3120
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:41,359
argue that we should not be doing that

3121
02:37:38,639 --> 02:37:42,478
and we should just special case lights

3122
02:37:41,359 --> 02:37:44,239
maybe

3123
02:37:42,478 --> 02:37:47,039
i don't know how productive that would

3124
02:37:44,239 --> 02:37:48,719
be because we kind of have this problem

3125
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:51,280
of like we don't really have like

3126
02:37:48,719 --> 02:37:52,959
there's no geometry for this guy right

3127
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:54,479
like it's just

3128
02:37:52,959 --> 02:37:55,759
it's just two flat sprites that are

3129
02:37:54,478 --> 02:37:57,840
sitting there in the world that happen

3130
02:37:55,760 --> 02:38:00,000
to line up right so

3131
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:01,600
i don't know how good direct lighting is

3132
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,000
really gonna look when you don't have

3133
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:05,840
real 3d geometry like i'm not even sure

3134
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,840
what you would really do

3135
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,840
um

3136
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:18,159
i mean

3137
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:31,920
i mean it's hard to say like we could

3138
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:33,520
just if we move this to the gpu we could

3139
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:37,120
just actually do it that way you could

3140
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:37,120
do direct casting

3141
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:43,920
uh to the light sources that are nearby

3142
02:38:40,799 --> 02:38:46,639
i don't know it just it seems like a

3143
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:48,639
bridge too far you know

3144
02:38:46,639 --> 02:38:50,879
it seems like a bridge too far and so

3145
02:38:48,639 --> 02:38:52,318
for now the only point i'm trying to get

3146
02:38:50,879 --> 02:38:54,559
across here

3147
02:38:52,318 --> 02:38:57,519
um is that if you look at what's going

3148
02:38:54,559 --> 02:39:00,719
on in the system

3149
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:02,159
uh we are kind of down to the last sort

3150
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:03,840
of

3151
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:06,000
uh issue

3152
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:08,639
which is this how do we deal with the

3153
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:10,239
direct lighting around a moving bright

3154
02:39:08,639 --> 02:39:11,840
light source which is where we're gonna

3155
02:39:10,239 --> 02:39:12,879
have the most

3156
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:13,840
um

3157
02:39:12,879 --> 02:39:17,199
you know

3158
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:19,200
trouble capturing the behavior

3159
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:20,960
uh the reason that we're in that

3160
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:22,240
position is because we're doing things a

3161
02:39:20,959 --> 02:39:23,438
little weird

3162
02:39:22,239 --> 02:39:26,559
right

3163
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:26,559
um if that makes sense

3164
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:33,319
uh mts mocks because they do shadow maps

3165
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:33,318
from the light sources

3166
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:44,719
right so so typically what you would do

3167
02:39:42,239 --> 02:39:46,799
is you enumerate your light sources so

3168
02:39:44,719 --> 02:39:48,478
you say that each like region that

3169
02:39:46,799 --> 02:39:49,759
you're going to render in

3170
02:39:48,478 --> 02:39:51,760
right

3171
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,559
each region you're going to render in

3172
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:54,239
has

3173
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:56,478
some number of maximum number of lights

3174
02:39:54,239 --> 02:39:58,719
that it can have so let's say each one

3175
02:39:56,478 --> 02:39:59,920
can have eight lights 16 lights whatever

3176
02:39:58,719 --> 02:40:04,239
it is

3177
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:07,120
you then render like 16 shadow maps

3178
02:40:04,239 --> 02:40:09,199
from the light source

3179
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:10,399
uh the light sources

3180
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:12,159
and they would probably have to be like

3181
02:40:10,398 --> 02:40:13,840
cube maps right or whatever you have to

3182
02:40:12,159 --> 02:40:15,200
actually like

3183
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:18,079
you render shadow maps for the

3184
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:20,000
directions of the light

3185
02:40:18,079 --> 02:40:21,600
and then you compute the direct lighting

3186
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,600
using that

3187
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:27,279
so the direct shadow is captured by a

3188
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:29,279
shadow map or on newer like rtx cards it

3189
02:40:27,279 --> 02:40:32,239
might just be an actual raycast because

3190
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:33,279
that's more accurate than a shadow map

3191
02:40:32,239 --> 02:40:34,799
so

3192
02:40:33,279 --> 02:40:36,399
you just do that

3193
02:40:34,799 --> 02:40:38,639
and then your indirect lighting

3194
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:40,478
contribution that comes from a system

3195
02:40:38,639 --> 02:40:42,799
like this

3196
02:40:40,478 --> 02:40:43,920
uh i think unreal engine five calls it

3197
02:40:42,799 --> 02:40:46,959
lumen

3198
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:46,960
um or something

3199
02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:50,800
i don't remember what random names they

3200
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:52,479
give to these things but

3201
02:40:50,799 --> 02:40:54,639
basically your indirect lighting comes

3202
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:57,039
from like a thing and usually much like

3203
02:40:54,639 --> 02:40:58,719
ours it's temporally anti-aliased pretty

3204
02:40:57,040 --> 02:41:01,040
heavily whereas your direct lighting

3205
02:40:58,719 --> 02:41:02,559
usually actually isn't like your direct

3206
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:04,479
lighting is usually a shadow map that's

3207
02:41:02,559 --> 02:41:05,920
actually fairly accurate to that frame

3208
02:41:04,478 --> 02:41:07,199
like there's typically not like a huge

3209
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:10,079
amount

3210
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:12,399
of like lag to that uh but there could

3211
02:41:10,079 --> 02:41:15,398
be right

3212
02:41:12,398 --> 02:41:15,398
so

3213
02:41:28,719 --> 02:41:34,159
uh all right fnarp said crazy idea since

3214
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:35,840
all your surfaces are x y x z y z planes

3215
02:41:34,159 --> 02:41:37,920
could you look at a circle around a

3216
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:39,760
projection of the light source onto the

3217
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:42,760
surface rather than spherical

3218
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:42,760
intersection

3219
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:52,520
i don't think i know what you're

3220
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,520
actually suggesting concretely there

3221
02:41:58,079 --> 02:42:03,039
the reason that spherical intersection

3222
02:42:00,239 --> 02:42:04,719
is a problem for us is not because it

3223
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:06,560
would be difficult to do it's just

3224
02:42:04,719 --> 02:42:08,719
because

3225
02:42:06,559 --> 02:42:11,278
when you are trying to cast multiple

3226
02:42:08,719 --> 02:42:13,199
things at once in cmd

3227
02:42:11,279 --> 02:42:15,120
you don't want like an if statement in

3228
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:16,640
there so you would end up running both

3229
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:18,319
intersections at the same time because

3230
02:42:16,639 --> 02:42:21,039
you don't know

3231
02:42:18,318 --> 02:42:22,799
uh what type of thing is the thing

3232
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:25,800
you're intersecting against

3233
02:42:22,799 --> 02:42:25,799
right

3234
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:32,159
um

3235
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:36,319
that's that's the only reason so it just

3236
02:42:34,719 --> 02:42:38,840
slows you down because you have you do a

3237
02:42:36,318 --> 02:42:41,119
few more comp a few more

3238
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:42,880
computations um

3239
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:45,359
that you then blend together

3240
02:42:42,879 --> 02:42:46,318
so you really you would not save any you

3241
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:48,159
would not

3242
02:42:46,318 --> 02:42:50,639
do yourself any favors by all

3243
02:42:48,159 --> 02:42:52,639
introducing another scheme like

3244
02:42:50,639 --> 02:42:55,840
that would just also make things worse

3245
02:42:52,639 --> 02:42:55,840
right so

3246
02:42:55,920 --> 02:43:00,639
hard to say

3247
02:42:57,439 --> 02:43:03,120
um so i don't know

3248
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:03,119
i don't know

3249
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:09,040
you don't have to do either all sphere

3250
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:10,000
lights or all albeits you just have to

3251
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:12,160
accept that you're going to get a

3252
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,398
slowdown if you do spheres

3253
02:43:12,159 --> 02:43:16,799
um just to give you an example right so

3254
02:43:14,398 --> 02:43:18,318
just to be concrete like

3255
02:43:16,799 --> 02:43:19,759
if you look at what happens right we've

3256
02:43:18,318 --> 02:43:20,799
got these

3257
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:22,719
leave

3258
02:43:20,799 --> 02:43:24,318
insertion things

3259
02:43:22,719 --> 02:43:27,679
right

3260
02:43:24,318 --> 02:43:30,079
and you've got an x y and a z

3261
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:30,079
and

3262
02:43:30,398 --> 02:43:34,000
there's like a min and a max

3263
02:43:34,159 --> 02:43:38,318
yeah

3264
02:43:36,959 --> 02:43:41,199
so if you look at what happens in sign

3265
02:43:38,318 --> 02:43:44,239
full cast uh when we loop over those we

3266
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:46,159
just do the intersection against n of

3267
02:43:44,239 --> 02:43:49,600
those boxes at once in this case it's

3268
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:52,239
four wide so it's four boxes

3269
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:52,239
at once

3270
02:43:52,559 --> 02:43:58,159
if you wanted some of those boxes to be

3271
02:43:55,520 --> 02:44:01,040
spheres then what you would do is like

3272
02:43:58,159 --> 02:44:03,119
there is the thing called is emission

3273
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:05,600
you would have another thing that's like

3274
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:08,160
um well actually probably what we do is

3275
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:09,840
is emission would probably just be the

3276
02:44:08,159 --> 02:44:12,398
same so

3277
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:16,079
we would say all lights are spherical

3278
02:44:12,398 --> 02:44:18,799
all occluders are boxes right so this

3279
02:44:16,079 --> 02:44:20,159
would be zero or one depending on

3280
02:44:18,799 --> 02:44:21,278
whether it's a light

3281
02:44:20,159 --> 02:44:24,318
and that would tell you whether it's a

3282
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:26,880
sphere or a cube as well in here

3283
02:44:24,318 --> 02:44:29,359
this is the computation to see whether

3284
02:44:26,879 --> 02:44:30,159
or not this thing

3285
02:44:29,359 --> 02:44:31,359
uh

3286
02:44:30,159 --> 02:44:34,398
has hit

3287
02:44:31,359 --> 02:44:35,760
and what we would need to do is provide

3288
02:44:34,398 --> 02:44:37,840
a

3289
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:39,760
another set of equations here so you

3290
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:41,120
know another 10 instructions or

3291
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:43,520
something

3292
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:46,479
that do the intersection with a sphere

3293
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:48,159
and then we would use the emission value

3294
02:44:46,478 --> 02:44:50,719
to select

3295
02:44:48,159 --> 02:44:54,959
which one of the t values the sphere

3296
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:59,478
computation or the aab computation which

3297
02:44:54,959 --> 02:44:59,478
one we were actually going to use

3298
02:45:00,079 --> 02:45:03,719
if you follow me

3299
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:24,240
so that's how you would have to add

3300
02:45:22,478 --> 02:45:25,760
spheres to the system and so it just

3301
02:45:24,239 --> 02:45:27,520
gets a lot more complicated because

3302
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:29,279
you're you're adding a lot more

3303
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:30,640
instructions to this loop where we're

3304
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:33,200
testing things

3305
02:45:30,639 --> 02:45:35,599
and you would rather not do that

3306
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:36,880
you there are other options that you can

3307
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:40,159
do

3308
02:45:36,879 --> 02:45:42,478
um you can you could also store two

3309
02:45:40,159 --> 02:45:45,119
different

3310
02:45:42,478 --> 02:45:46,559
uh leaf arrays spheres and

3311
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:48,800
cubes

3312
02:45:46,559 --> 02:45:51,119
um but then you have extra overhead

3313
02:45:48,799 --> 02:45:56,278
right like that you're doing there

3314
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:56,279
there's there's all trade-offs right um

3315
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:03,840
uh space naming yeah a small enough box

3316
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:05,680
gives you uh spherical falloff the

3317
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:08,840
problem is you're very unlikely to hit

3318
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:13,439
it so the sampling gets worse

3319
02:46:08,840 --> 02:46:16,079
so uh and that we could change by

3320
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:17,920
targeting light sources more so like i

3321
02:46:16,079 --> 02:46:20,478
said we there are other ways we could

3322
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:20,478
try to

3323
02:46:20,639 --> 02:46:22,879
um

3324
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:27,359
there are other ways we could try to

3325
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:28,880
approach this problem

3326
02:46:27,359 --> 02:46:31,760
um

3327
02:46:28,879 --> 02:46:33,438
but you know

3328
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:35,279
so it's really hard to say it's really

3329
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:38,159
hard to say what we want to do here i

3330
02:46:35,279 --> 02:46:40,159
really don't know um it's at a point

3331
02:46:38,159 --> 02:46:41,760
where it's pretty nice

3332
02:46:40,159 --> 02:46:44,478
uh it produces great looking

3333
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:47,200
environments the only thing that doesn't

3334
02:46:44,478 --> 02:46:49,760
look great is the dynamic lights the

3335
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:51,520
highly dynamic lights

3336
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:53,120
they actually look pretty good with

3337
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:54,479
respect to how they affect the

3338
02:46:53,120 --> 02:46:57,120
environment they just don't look

3339
02:46:54,478 --> 02:46:59,318
particularly good where they actually

3340
02:46:57,120 --> 02:47:03,279
are

3341
02:46:59,318 --> 02:47:04,799
themselves so like the actual location

3342
02:47:03,279 --> 02:47:08,399
right around the light source doesn't

3343
02:47:04,799 --> 02:47:08,398
look fantastic right

3344
02:47:08,959 --> 02:47:14,318
and so it does kind of suggest that you

3345
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:16,479
would want to try and

3346
02:47:14,318 --> 02:47:18,639
figure out how to solve that problem a

3347
02:47:16,478 --> 02:47:21,119
little bit better

3348
02:47:18,639 --> 02:47:24,239
separately from other things

3349
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:24,630
but i don't really know

3350
02:47:24,239 --> 02:47:25,840
um

3351
02:47:24,629 --> 02:47:28,559
[Music]

3352
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:31,559
how you do that

3353
02:47:28,559 --> 02:47:31,559
uh

3354
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:48,159
i i really just don't quite know how you

3355
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:50,079
improve that and and furthermore like i

3356
02:47:48,159 --> 02:47:51,359
am sort of concerned that there are

3357
02:47:50,079 --> 02:47:53,200
still

3358
02:47:51,359 --> 02:47:55,439
bugs

3359
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:56,880
like if you looked

3360
02:47:55,439 --> 02:47:59,279
so

3361
02:47:56,879 --> 02:48:01,278
if you crank the sampling density up to

3362
02:47:59,279 --> 02:48:03,760
something that's like going to be wicked

3363
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:06,000
slow right like that we can't use

3364
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:09,439
because it's way too slow

3365
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:12,159
um like all right so let's take 256

3366
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:14,840
samples per texel right so it's yeah

3367
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:16,559
it's crazy dense

3368
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:20,079
sampling

3369
02:48:16,559 --> 02:48:20,959
just way way way way too dense

3370
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:23,840
um

3371
02:48:20,959 --> 02:48:28,000
at that point you

3372
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:30,000
you look and you go this is best case

3373
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:31,760
this is if there's no right what you're

3374
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:33,359
looking at on the screen now is best

3375
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:34,960
case

3376
02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:38,000
so

3377
02:48:34,959 --> 02:48:40,318
it still just doesn't look that good

3378
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:41,840
around the light source right

3379
02:48:40,318 --> 02:48:44,239
like

3380
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:46,159
that just doesn't look that good it's

3381
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:47,359
not horrible

3382
02:48:46,159 --> 02:48:49,920
but

3383
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:51,600
it's not particularly great now we could

3384
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:52,719
if we wanted to

3385
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:56,159
um

3386
02:48:52,719 --> 02:48:57,840
we could make this

3387
02:48:56,159 --> 02:49:00,719
light source even smaller and see what

3388
02:48:57,840 --> 02:49:02,559
happens there but again right it's just

3389
02:49:00,719 --> 02:49:05,039
it's just a question of like at some

3390
02:49:02,559 --> 02:49:06,398
point there's that falloff and it's it's

3391
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:08,319
not going to be great

3392
02:49:06,398 --> 02:49:10,478
so like let's suppose i did do that i

3393
02:49:08,318 --> 02:49:11,680
made this small enough that like maybe

3394
02:49:10,478 --> 02:49:12,398
now

3395
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:16,559
um

3396
02:49:12,398 --> 02:49:16,559
we can consider it to sort of be

3397
02:49:16,879 --> 02:49:21,438
you know uh small enough that it should

3398
02:49:18,959 --> 02:49:24,559
have a fairly radial fall off

3399
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:26,000
um because it's so tiny

3400
02:49:24,559 --> 02:49:27,920
or maybe it needs to be a little smaller

3401
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:30,398
even than that

3402
02:49:27,920 --> 02:49:32,639
and you know like i said we'll we'll go

3403
02:49:30,398 --> 02:49:34,478
out somewhere uh where we can really see

3404
02:49:32,639 --> 02:49:36,959
the fall off and then we'll

3405
02:49:34,478 --> 02:49:38,799
we'll try

3406
02:49:36,959 --> 02:49:40,159
cranking the sample density but i'm i'm

3407
02:49:38,799 --> 02:49:42,159
pretty sure it still just won't look

3408
02:49:40,159 --> 02:49:43,439
very good right it's like like it's just

3409
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:45,279
not

3410
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:47,439
that part is just not going to get that

3411
02:49:45,279 --> 02:49:50,479
much better so here we are

3412
02:49:47,439 --> 02:49:54,000
um in i'll try cranking the sampling

3413
02:49:50,478 --> 02:49:56,079
density up you know 10 24. it's absurd

3414
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:58,799
right like it's

3415
02:49:56,079 --> 02:50:00,559
um you know maybe a gpu could do this uh

3416
02:49:58,799 --> 02:50:01,599
the cpu definitely

3417
02:50:00,559 --> 02:50:04,799
won't

3418
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:06,079
uh not this maybe a threadripper

3419
02:50:04,799 --> 02:50:10,639
um but

3420
02:50:06,079 --> 02:50:12,719
but that's about it and so now like if

3421
02:50:10,639 --> 02:50:14,959
we look and see what's on the screen

3422
02:50:12,719 --> 02:50:18,119
it's like okay

3423
02:50:14,959 --> 02:50:18,119
i mean

3424
02:50:22,159 --> 02:50:24,799
it's just not

3425
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:29,040
i mean one problem here too is like it's

3426
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:30,559
just not bright enough either and we

3427
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:31,600
know we can't really crank the

3428
02:50:30,559 --> 02:50:33,519
brightness because then you get the

3429
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:35,520
feedback problem so that also suggests

3430
02:50:33,520 --> 02:50:37,439
that we have a problem

3431
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:38,880
with like how we're sampling the lights

3432
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:41,200
separately

3433
02:50:38,879 --> 02:50:41,199
because

3434
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:48,159
a 1.0 light gets dimmer as the size

3435
02:50:46,079 --> 02:50:49,920
goes down so it's like it's

3436
02:50:48,159 --> 02:50:51,920
that was that divisor problem that we

3437
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:53,600
have so like the lights should be like

3438
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:56,000
should have their brightness

3439
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:59,200
sort of like accounted for in a way i

3440
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,200
don't know like in other words

3441
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:03,200
it's like these values have to multiply

3442
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:05,120
out to one or something it's it's not

3443
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:06,159
right like like right it's like a little

3444
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:07,680
weird

3445
02:51:06,159 --> 02:51:09,680
what's going on here

3446
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:11,520
um i'll try cranking this brightness up

3447
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:12,720
but i don't think it's gonna necessarily

3448
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:14,960
help us here

3449
02:51:12,719 --> 02:51:14,959
um

3450
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:21,040
but you see what i'm saying right like

3451
02:51:18,398 --> 02:51:23,519
we we still have issues there's there's

3452
02:51:21,040 --> 02:51:24,720
sort of a

3453
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:27,840
there's a thing

3454
02:51:24,719 --> 02:51:29,920
in there's sort of a thing baked into

3455
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:32,079
our system

3456
02:51:29,920 --> 02:51:33,439
in general that makes this situation not

3457
02:51:32,079 --> 02:51:36,239
look very good

3458
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:39,040
right and it's not

3459
02:51:36,239 --> 02:51:42,159
so much about

3460
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:44,160
the fact that it's not so much about the

3461
02:51:42,159 --> 02:51:46,079
sampling it's like actually just the

3462
02:51:44,159 --> 02:51:47,520
system doesn't quite work right like

3463
02:51:46,079 --> 02:51:49,520
there's

3464
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:52,640
an underlying deficiency or whatever you

3465
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:52,640
want to call it um

3466
02:51:53,359 --> 02:51:55,520
so

3467
02:51:56,318 --> 02:51:59,478
you know

3468
02:52:00,799 --> 02:52:05,119
here's me letting it run for a little

3469
02:52:02,719 --> 02:52:05,119
while

3470
02:52:05,439 --> 02:52:07,760
um

3471
02:52:08,318 --> 02:52:11,600
at 10 24 samples which again like i said

3472
02:52:10,639 --> 02:52:15,840
is like

3473
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:15,840
super ridiculously dense

3474
02:52:41,279 --> 02:52:47,120
and i mean uh

3475
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:48,639
i'll i'll agree that it is very like

3476
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:51,920
smooth fall-off

3477
02:52:48,639 --> 02:52:53,920
right like you don't see

3478
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:56,398
the squareness of the fall-off at all

3479
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:58,719
like it's perfectly radial

3480
02:52:56,398 --> 02:52:58,719
um

3481
02:52:58,959 --> 02:53:05,519
it's also just not very bright

3482
02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:08,478
right uh so again so i i don't know like

3483
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:10,880
i just get that twinge that like

3484
02:53:08,478 --> 02:53:12,959
there's one more like step here that

3485
02:53:10,879 --> 02:53:14,478
we're like missing there's like one more

3486
02:53:12,959 --> 02:53:17,438
thing that like

3487
02:53:14,478 --> 02:53:20,079
there's there's like a

3488
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:21,520
and and again like i said before

3489
02:53:20,079 --> 02:53:23,920
i

3490
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:25,520
this is certainly because i'm just not a

3491
02:53:23,920 --> 02:53:27,439
lighting person so

3492
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:31,120
a lot of the things that i would know if

3493
02:53:27,439 --> 02:53:34,000
i was like did a lot of

3494
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:36,000
um work on lighting

3495
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:38,639
i'm sure i would just kind of know

3496
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,799
oh yeah like you need to to structure

3497
02:53:38,639 --> 02:53:42,079
the equations thus and and understand

3498
02:53:40,799 --> 02:53:44,239
that these units should look a

3499
02:53:42,079 --> 02:53:45,359
particular way and and whatever else

3500
02:53:44,239 --> 02:53:50,079
right like

3501
02:53:45,359 --> 02:53:52,399
all that is is almost certainly um

3502
02:53:50,079 --> 02:53:54,079
something you would

3503
02:53:52,398 --> 02:53:56,879
know if this is the kind of code you did

3504
02:53:54,079 --> 02:53:59,359
on a daily basis right but i don't so

3505
02:53:56,879 --> 02:54:01,519
you know it's it's me kind of like

3506
02:53:59,359 --> 02:54:05,960
looking

3507
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:05,960
like poking around for solutions

3508
02:54:06,879 --> 02:54:11,759
so yeah like you know

3509
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:11,760
it does

3510
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:16,959
oddly enough i will say and and i guess

3511
02:54:14,559 --> 02:54:19,840
i don't know why

3512
02:54:16,959 --> 02:54:22,559
it seems weird how the power is related

3513
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:25,680
here and i don't really know um

3514
02:54:22,559 --> 02:54:28,680
kind of confused by that to be honest

3515
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:28,680
um

3516
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:44,559
the glove freaking out on

3517
02:54:42,239 --> 02:54:48,039
time steps like would be nice to fix at

3518
02:54:44,559 --> 02:54:48,039
some point right

3519
02:54:48,639 --> 02:54:51,840
um it's just annoying

3520
02:54:58,478 --> 02:55:02,760
the glove code is is terrible

3521
02:55:16,239 --> 02:55:20,159
so like if one assumes that that is what

3522
02:55:18,719 --> 02:55:22,559
it should look like

3523
02:55:20,159 --> 02:55:25,520
roughly and then like you'd go ahead and

3524
02:55:22,559 --> 02:55:28,000
change this to 1024 to get like a ton of

3525
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:28,000
samples

3526
02:55:28,799 --> 02:55:31,799
um

3527
02:55:32,799 --> 02:55:38,959
and it kind of converges

3528
02:55:34,799 --> 02:55:38,959
to like that looks kind of right

3529
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:41,600
um

3530
02:55:39,469 --> 02:55:43,679
[Music]

3531
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:46,960
you can see why i'm like weirded out a

3532
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:46,960
little right uh

3533
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:51,040
i guess i have an equivalent question

3534
02:55:49,279 --> 02:55:53,760
too which like like that just looks

3535
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:53,760
right so maybe

3536
02:55:57,040 --> 02:56:00,319
this is this is really tricky

3537
02:55:59,439 --> 02:56:02,559
um

3538
02:56:00,318 --> 02:56:04,559
the other question i have is like okay

3539
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:05,529
so suppose we go back to kind of like

3540
02:56:04,559 --> 02:56:07,119
the crappy one

3541
02:56:05,530 --> 02:56:09,120
[Music]

3542
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:11,040
um that we were having a ton of problems

3543
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:14,079
with before and

3544
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:16,240
like it's very square

3545
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:17,520
is it square at high sampling counts

3546
02:56:16,239 --> 02:56:20,719
because i don't know

3547
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:22,399
right i'm kind of i have no idea so so

3548
02:56:20,719 --> 02:56:23,599
that's another question i would be

3549
02:56:22,398 --> 02:56:26,599
interested to hear

3550
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:26,600
um

3551
02:56:26,719 --> 02:56:30,278
because i don't know

3552
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:46,880
so here we go um

3553
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:48,720
you know there's there's the square

3554
02:56:46,879 --> 02:56:52,318
version right

3555
02:56:48,719 --> 02:56:54,959
and if i crank the sampling up of that

3556
02:56:52,318 --> 02:56:57,920
uh to a high number

3557
02:56:54,959 --> 02:57:01,559
uh does it make it less square

3558
02:56:57,920 --> 02:57:01,559
and i have no idea

3559
02:57:08,639 --> 02:57:11,519
looks like no

3560
02:57:14,719 --> 02:57:17,119
maybe

3561
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:21,760
i would i would

3562
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:23,840
say that assuming that that is what it

3563
02:57:21,760 --> 02:57:23,840
is

3564
02:57:30,559 --> 02:57:36,398
so like interestingly enough like that

3565
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:38,800
at that point it just doesn't change

3566
02:57:36,398 --> 02:57:40,799
so that again to me also says maybe

3567
02:57:38,799 --> 02:57:43,519
spheres would really

3568
02:57:40,799 --> 02:57:44,799
make a meaningful difference here

3569
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:47,800
you know

3570
02:57:44,799 --> 02:57:47,799
um

3571
02:57:55,680 --> 02:57:59,680
yeah we could just disable the temp

3572
02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:00,639
temporal smoothing with the 1024 but i

3573
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:03,639
don't think it's going to make a

3574
02:58:00,639 --> 02:58:03,639
difference

3575
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:18,799
um so here is turning off smoothing

3576
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:20,559
entirely so this is just full noise

3577
02:58:18,799 --> 02:58:22,079
right

3578
02:58:20,559 --> 02:58:23,600
and here's

3579
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:27,000
turning on

3580
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:27,000
a lot of samples

3581
02:58:32,079 --> 02:58:34,639
and like

3582
02:58:34,719 --> 02:58:39,358
you know it's still square

3583
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:41,760
and again i wonder like is that just

3584
02:58:39,359 --> 02:58:43,520
because the light's shape is square

3585
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:45,359
if the light shape was spherical would

3586
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:47,840
we not have this problem

3587
02:58:45,359 --> 02:58:47,840
um

3588
02:58:48,398 --> 02:58:50,879
and

3589
02:58:49,439 --> 02:58:54,159
and i don't know

3590
02:58:50,879 --> 02:58:56,398
uh so i kind of want to add a sphere in

3591
02:58:54,159 --> 02:58:56,398
here

3592
02:58:56,478 --> 02:58:59,478
um

3593
02:59:02,398 --> 02:59:06,719
because because i almost wonder if is it

3594
02:59:04,478 --> 02:59:09,119
really just because the thing is square

3595
02:59:06,719 --> 02:59:10,879
i i don't know and if that were the case

3596
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:13,120
then

3597
02:59:10,879 --> 02:59:15,438
it might be worth the extra computation

3598
02:59:13,120 --> 02:59:15,810
to fix that

3599
02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:17,200
i

3600
02:59:15,809 --> 02:59:19,760
[Music]

3601
02:59:17,200 --> 02:59:19,760
i don't know

3602
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,318
um

3603
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:25,040
so

3604
02:59:24,318 --> 02:59:27,600
like

3605
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:28,800
temporal anti-listing turned off so full

3606
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:30,960
full flicker

3607
02:59:28,799 --> 02:59:33,278
uh massively over braided light so you

3608
02:59:30,959 --> 02:59:35,599
can really see

3609
02:59:33,279 --> 02:59:35,600
um

3610
02:59:36,879 --> 02:59:41,358
you can really see what it looks like

3611
02:59:39,279 --> 02:59:44,319
if we wanted to do

3612
02:59:41,359 --> 02:59:45,920
these as

3613
02:59:44,319 --> 02:59:49,039
[Music]

3614
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:49,040
as spheres

3615
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:55,040
then this computation has to effectively

3616
02:59:52,719 --> 02:59:57,278
take

3617
02:59:55,040 --> 03:00:00,240
just team in

3618
02:59:57,279 --> 03:00:02,479
so what we would need is

3619
03:00:00,239 --> 03:00:04,159
like a thing here that's like

3620
03:00:02,478 --> 03:00:07,760
team okay

3621
03:00:04,159 --> 03:00:12,799
i don't know i don't know what that is

3622
03:00:07,760 --> 03:00:12,800
did the ime just turn on yes it did

3623
03:00:14,239 --> 03:00:17,840
we are not typing japanese now

3624
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:24,800
so we would need a t sphere

3625
03:00:22,478 --> 03:00:27,519
value

3626
03:00:24,799 --> 03:00:27,519
and

3627
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:34,960
like i think

3628
03:00:36,959 --> 03:00:40,719
we would have to compute those two

3629
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:42,960
computation

3630
03:00:40,719 --> 03:00:44,879
like we have to compute those two

3631
03:00:42,959 --> 03:00:46,799
points

3632
03:00:44,879 --> 03:00:49,119
uh those two t's

3633
03:00:46,799 --> 03:00:53,438
and then we would do a select

3634
03:00:49,120 --> 03:00:56,720
so the actual t-min would be a select

3635
03:00:53,439 --> 03:01:00,479
using the emission flag

3636
03:00:56,719 --> 03:01:04,398
where we select the emission if it's an

3637
03:01:00,478 --> 03:01:04,398
emitter we do t min sphere

3638
03:01:04,879 --> 03:01:09,438
otherwise team in

3639
03:01:06,879 --> 03:01:11,759
uh and if it's

3640
03:01:09,439 --> 03:01:11,760
um

3641
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:17,920
uh if it's if emissions off we we take

3642
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:19,279
the aab one

3643
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:22,079
right

3644
03:01:19,279 --> 03:01:24,399
so you know it's pretty straightforward

3645
03:01:22,079 --> 03:01:25,680
what i'm talking about but uh we have to

3646
03:01:24,398 --> 03:01:27,199
actually do this for intersection

3647
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:29,040
computation here and it's going to be

3648
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:32,159
ugly

3649
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:32,160
um spheres

3650
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:39,079
like they they kind of require like a

3651
03:01:36,079 --> 03:01:39,079
divide

3652
03:01:48,478 --> 03:01:53,519
although we can probably phrase it in

3653
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:55,840
terms of invade d like we did here maybe

3654
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:55,840
um

3655
03:01:59,439 --> 03:02:03,439
i guess i'm not

3656
03:02:00,840 --> 03:02:04,880
sure if i should go to the white board

3657
03:02:03,439 --> 03:02:06,079
for this i'm not going to be able to or

3658
03:02:04,879 --> 03:02:07,839
i should say the light board i'm not

3659
03:02:06,079 --> 03:02:09,520
going to be able to just like miracle a

3660
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:12,000
sphere intersection

3661
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:13,520
code out of my head

3662
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:15,520
uh you know that's

3663
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:17,120
that ain't going to happen

3664
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:19,439
um so we should probably go to the light

3665
03:02:17,120 --> 03:02:20,880
board if we're gonna try and do this

3666
03:02:19,439 --> 03:02:22,079
this is probably too late in a stream

3667
03:02:20,879 --> 03:02:26,519
for this but

3668
03:02:22,079 --> 03:02:26,520
i guess we do it anyway hold on a second

3669
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:51,079
all right

3670
03:03:58,559 --> 03:04:00,719
so

3671
03:04:02,398 --> 03:04:05,278
what are we doing

3672
03:04:04,079 --> 03:04:07,200
we have

3673
03:04:05,279 --> 03:04:09,439
a

3674
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:11,940
ray origin

3675
03:04:09,439 --> 03:04:13,840
um and we've got array direction

3676
03:04:11,940 --> 03:04:15,359
[Music]

3677
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:17,439
like so

3678
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:19,439
uh and then we've got a sphere

3679
03:04:17,439 --> 03:04:21,279
with a center

3680
03:04:19,439 --> 03:04:23,359
and we want to know

3681
03:04:21,279 --> 03:04:25,200
these two points

3682
03:04:23,359 --> 03:04:27,920
right

3683
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:31,040
so these are the two points that are

3684
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:34,559
whatever the sphere radius is are

3685
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:36,000
away from the sphere like center

3686
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:37,519
whatever that point is maybe i'll just

3687
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:39,760
call that point p because that's like

3688
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:41,040
the location of the thing

3689
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:44,159
and we've got the

3690
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:44,160
um the radius value

3691
03:04:44,398 --> 03:04:49,760
for the sphere and we want to know like

3692
03:04:46,799 --> 03:04:53,119
if we have hit this

3693
03:04:49,760 --> 03:04:54,079
um and and if so where

3694
03:04:53,120 --> 03:04:54,450
so

3695
03:04:54,079 --> 03:04:57,658
the

3696
03:04:54,450 --> 03:04:57,659
[Music]

3697
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:04,000
the ray origin here i guess we'll call

3698
03:05:01,359 --> 03:05:05,760
this arm we can't call uh yeah i can't

3699
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:08,239
call that r so let's let's call this

3700
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:10,639
this is the light probe location

3701
03:05:08,239 --> 03:05:12,719
um so normally i call it l maybe we'll

3702
03:05:10,639 --> 03:05:14,959
just call it the atlas

3703
03:05:12,719 --> 03:05:16,000
location so a so where we're casting

3704
03:05:14,959 --> 03:05:18,639
from

3705
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:20,478
and we can call the direction here d

3706
03:05:18,639 --> 03:05:23,599
that seems fair

3707
03:05:20,478 --> 03:05:25,679
so we know that we have the

3708
03:05:23,600 --> 03:05:28,318
equation for this ray is pretty

3709
03:05:25,680 --> 03:05:30,398
straightforward right the equation for

3710
03:05:28,318 --> 03:05:33,039
the ray

3711
03:05:30,398 --> 03:05:34,079
is just a function of the t value along

3712
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:37,600
the ray

3713
03:05:34,079 --> 03:05:40,239
and it's just going to be like a plus t

3714
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:40,239
times d

3715
03:05:40,398 --> 03:05:43,840
right

3716
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:46,960
um pretty straightforward

3717
03:05:43,840 --> 03:05:48,960
uh and the equation for the things on

3718
03:05:46,959 --> 03:05:49,839
the circle

3719
03:05:48,959 --> 03:05:51,759
uh

3720
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:53,680
is

3721
03:05:51,760 --> 03:05:55,279
i guess

3722
03:05:53,680 --> 03:05:57,279
well i shouldn't say circle the thing is

3723
03:05:55,279 --> 03:05:58,159
on the sphere

3724
03:05:57,279 --> 03:06:00,760
um

3725
03:05:58,159 --> 03:06:04,318
is going to be

3726
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:06,719
pretty much the same

3727
03:06:04,318 --> 03:06:09,278
right like it's just going to be

3728
03:06:06,719 --> 03:06:13,879
saying that anywhere in space like a

3729
03:06:09,279 --> 03:06:13,880
sphere is just the

3730
03:06:16,478 --> 03:06:19,438
is just saying anywhere in space that

3731
03:06:18,478 --> 03:06:20,398
you are

3732
03:06:19,439 --> 03:06:21,279
right

3733
03:06:20,398 --> 03:06:25,358
um

3734
03:06:21,279 --> 03:06:26,319
we are going to have the equation be

3735
03:06:25,359 --> 03:06:29,520
uh

3736
03:06:26,318 --> 03:06:31,199
x squared

3737
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:33,200
plus y squared

3738
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:34,880
plus z squared

3739
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:36,960
right

3740
03:06:34,879 --> 03:06:39,599
um i i guess i should probably say that

3741
03:06:36,959 --> 03:06:40,639
i would like these things to be sort of

3742
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:42,479
centered

3743
03:06:40,639 --> 03:06:45,119
probably around the sphere to get rid of

3744
03:06:42,478 --> 03:06:46,879
the p value because we would like these

3745
03:06:45,120 --> 03:06:48,720
these would normally have the center

3746
03:06:46,879 --> 03:06:50,318
subtracted out of them i don't really

3747
03:06:48,719 --> 03:06:51,920
feel like writing it quite

3748
03:06:50,318 --> 03:06:54,318
all out that way

3749
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:56,478
so we would like to maybe say that this

3750
03:06:54,318 --> 03:06:58,559
here is the origin let's say so you know

3751
03:06:56,478 --> 03:07:01,920
we'll we'll just say this this is what

3752
03:06:58,559 --> 03:07:04,398
we're looking around and this

3753
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:05,920
a value we can trivially just subtract

3754
03:07:04,398 --> 03:07:07,039
ahead of time to put it into the same

3755
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:09,520
space

3756
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:12,240
as the sphere but you know we can mess

3757
03:07:09,520 --> 03:07:15,920
the equations however we want later

3758
03:07:12,239 --> 03:07:18,159
so we know that this length so x squared

3759
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:20,719
plus y squared plus z squared square

3760
03:07:18,159 --> 03:07:23,359
rooted that's the distance

3761
03:07:20,719 --> 03:07:25,199
we know that that distance always has to

3762
03:07:23,359 --> 03:07:27,840
be um

3763
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:30,159
right equal to well i guess i don't

3764
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:31,920
really know why i bothered uh square

3765
03:07:30,159 --> 03:07:33,760
rooting at half time but whatever so

3766
03:07:31,920 --> 03:07:36,159
that distance has to be whatever our

3767
03:07:33,760 --> 03:07:38,079
radius value is right so the distance

3768
03:07:36,159 --> 03:07:40,478
from the center just the length of that

3769
03:07:38,079 --> 03:07:40,478
vector

3770
03:07:40,719 --> 03:07:46,318
has to be equal to r and we could say

3771
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:47,439
this in a easier way here right by also

3772
03:07:46,318 --> 03:07:50,159
just saying

3773
03:07:47,439 --> 03:07:53,359
like x squared

3774
03:07:50,159 --> 03:07:54,799
plus y squared plus z squared

3775
03:07:53,359 --> 03:07:58,318
minus r

3776
03:07:54,799 --> 03:08:01,920
right would have to be equal to zero

3777
03:07:58,318 --> 03:08:04,239
so so we can write that kind of uh

3778
03:08:01,920 --> 03:08:05,680
we can write that kind of in in

3779
03:08:04,239 --> 03:08:09,199
a various

3780
03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:11,760
various numbers of ways right

3781
03:08:09,200 --> 03:08:12,800
but the point is we have our

3782
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:14,559
ray

3783
03:08:12,799 --> 03:08:17,119
and we want to know

3784
03:08:14,559 --> 03:08:19,600
if we have an equation for the places

3785
03:08:17,120 --> 03:08:21,920
that hit the sphere we want to solve for

3786
03:08:19,600 --> 03:08:22,720
t because we know everything else

3787
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:26,478
right

3788
03:08:22,719 --> 03:08:29,039
so what we want to do is plug this point

3789
03:08:26,478 --> 03:08:31,119
in as the xyz coordinates of our

3790
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:34,120
equation here

3791
03:08:31,120 --> 03:08:34,120
yeah

3792
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:42,000
that's that's like all we're actually

3793
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:42,000
doing

3794
03:08:42,719 --> 03:08:46,478
um

3795
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:48,399
so in theory the only thing we actually

3796
03:08:46,478 --> 03:08:49,679
need out of this

3797
03:08:48,398 --> 03:08:52,398
is to say

3798
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:54,318
look if we assumed we pre-transformed it

3799
03:08:52,398 --> 03:08:55,840
so everything's around the center of the

3800
03:08:54,318 --> 03:08:58,318
sphere

3801
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:59,760
then if we and so we got rid of the

3802
03:08:58,318 --> 03:09:01,278
value p which is great because now i can

3803
03:08:59,760 --> 03:09:02,960
use p to actually talk about the point

3804
03:09:01,279 --> 03:09:04,399
along the line so everything's about the

3805
03:09:02,959 --> 03:09:06,000
center of the sphere

3806
03:09:04,398 --> 03:09:08,159
we know we have a radius value that's

3807
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:10,478
the value at which we would be on the

3808
03:09:08,159 --> 03:09:12,719
surface of the sphere

3809
03:09:10,478 --> 03:09:14,318
and so if we think about the point a

3810
03:09:12,719 --> 03:09:17,519
plus td

3811
03:09:14,318 --> 03:09:21,199
um so if our if our point along the ray

3812
03:09:17,520 --> 03:09:22,720
is going to be equal to a plus td

3813
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:24,000
then really all we're talking about with

3814
03:09:22,719 --> 03:09:27,920
this equation

3815
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:30,879
is that the length of p

3816
03:09:27,920 --> 03:09:32,799
um minus r has to be equal to zero or

3817
03:09:30,879 --> 03:09:35,679
the length of p has to be equal to r

3818
03:09:32,799 --> 03:09:37,840
that's when you're on the surface right

3819
03:09:35,680 --> 03:09:41,279
so what we're saying is that the length

3820
03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:45,840
of a plus td

3821
03:09:41,279 --> 03:09:48,319
minus r has to equal zero um and if we

3822
03:09:45,840 --> 03:09:50,799
actually multiply this out uh

3823
03:09:48,318 --> 03:09:54,159
you know we can presumably get

3824
03:09:50,799 --> 03:09:55,840
um to the fact that i'm terrible at math

3825
03:09:54,159 --> 03:09:57,600
notwithstanding and i probably make some

3826
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:59,040
mistakes in here somewhere we will

3827
03:09:57,600 --> 03:10:00,399
probably get

3828
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:02,160
uh

3829
03:10:00,398 --> 03:10:04,559
something under you know something under

3830
03:10:02,159 --> 03:10:05,920
a square root and a plus or minus sign

3831
03:10:04,559 --> 03:10:07,760
which is why there will be two of them

3832
03:10:05,920 --> 03:10:09,279
and so on and so forth right

3833
03:10:07,760 --> 03:10:10,478
so if we take a look at doing that we

3834
03:10:09,279 --> 03:10:13,120
would just say well how do we get the

3835
03:10:10,478 --> 03:10:15,438
length of a plus td well like we just

3836
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:18,479
said that would be

3837
03:10:15,439 --> 03:10:21,520
a a plus or minus right

3838
03:10:18,478 --> 03:10:21,519
and our minus r

3839
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:28,559
equals zero so expanding out this length

3840
03:10:26,719 --> 03:10:30,079
well the length of something is just the

3841
03:10:28,559 --> 03:10:33,119
square root of each of the components

3842
03:10:30,079 --> 03:10:37,680
squared so it would literally be exactly

3843
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:37,680
this it would be um so the

3844
03:10:38,840 --> 03:10:43,760
the i guess you end up in a kind of

3845
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:47,840
slightly nasty situation that you would

3846
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:47,840
like to avoid here which is the time

3847
03:10:48,879 --> 03:10:52,719
trying to think if i wrote this in the

3848
03:10:50,159 --> 03:10:54,559
most expedient way or not but anyway um

3849
03:10:52,719 --> 03:10:56,000
so anyway if you look at what these

3850
03:10:54,559 --> 03:11:00,639
values are actually going to be it would

3851
03:10:56,000 --> 03:11:02,159
be ax plus t dx right

3852
03:11:00,639 --> 03:11:03,920
squared

3853
03:11:02,159 --> 03:11:06,238
and you would then just do that for the

3854
03:11:03,920 --> 03:11:09,439
other two terms as well so the actual

3855
03:11:06,238 --> 03:11:11,279
thing we care about is this ax plus tdx

3856
03:11:09,439 --> 03:11:14,079
squared term

3857
03:11:11,279 --> 03:11:15,439
which if we multiply out is what it's

3858
03:11:14,079 --> 03:11:17,039
like

3859
03:11:15,439 --> 03:11:20,479
uh

3860
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:24,000
ax plus t dx

3861
03:11:20,478 --> 03:11:25,519
times ax plus t dx

3862
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,200
is just going to be

3863
03:11:25,520 --> 03:11:30,079
distributive rule

3864
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:33,040
ax squared right

3865
03:11:30,079 --> 03:11:33,840
plus 2 t

3866
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:35,359
2

3867
03:11:33,840 --> 03:11:37,439
t

3868
03:11:35,359 --> 03:11:40,000
a x dx

3869
03:11:37,439 --> 03:11:41,359
right because everything's positive in

3870
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:44,398
here there's no

3871
03:11:41,359 --> 03:11:48,079
negatives um plus

3872
03:11:44,398 --> 03:11:48,079
t squared dx squared

3873
03:11:48,478 --> 03:11:51,920
do i have that right

3874
03:11:50,559 --> 03:11:53,519
um

3875
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:55,920
so effectively

3876
03:11:53,520 --> 03:11:58,238
yeah we're we would end up with this is

3877
03:11:55,920 --> 03:11:59,920
our is our term here i suppose we don't

3878
03:11:58,238 --> 03:12:01,279
have to care about this root i don't

3879
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:03,040
know why like i said i don't know why i

3880
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:05,760
put that in there to begin with because

3881
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:07,279
you could have just not done that and

3882
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:08,800
left the r on the other side and squared

3883
03:12:07,279 --> 03:12:10,960
them so it would just be an r squared

3884
03:12:08,799 --> 03:12:13,358
here right and you would just have this

3885
03:12:10,959 --> 03:12:14,879
terms so why i didn't do that to begin

3886
03:12:13,359 --> 03:12:16,559
with i don't know it's because like i

3887
03:12:14,879 --> 03:12:19,599
said i'm bad at math

3888
03:12:16,559 --> 03:12:21,760
um so anyway uh if we

3889
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:24,720
if we want to solve this actual equation

3890
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:27,040
we would end up with these terms right

3891
03:12:24,719 --> 03:12:28,639
so we would these are constants

3892
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:30,720
um

3893
03:12:28,639 --> 03:12:33,840
the ax squareds

3894
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:35,599
are in the a y squares the a z squared's

3895
03:12:33,840 --> 03:12:38,639
those are all constant

3896
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:40,479
um so they're just they're just added up

3897
03:12:38,639 --> 03:12:43,199
right we would just have an ax squared

3898
03:12:40,478 --> 03:12:44,478
plus a b x plus a a y squared plus an a

3899
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:46,399
z squared

3900
03:12:44,478 --> 03:12:47,760
we would just add those up and then

3901
03:12:46,398 --> 03:12:49,199
those would just be in there and we

3902
03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:51,200
don't care about them

3903
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:53,680
from then on right

3904
03:12:51,200 --> 03:12:56,000
um these we actually do care about

3905
03:12:53,680 --> 03:12:58,000
because they have tea in them

3906
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:59,520
right

3907
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:02,159
but if you look at how this is

3908
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:06,000
structured again these are constants

3909
03:13:02,159 --> 03:13:09,680
like dx is a constant right

3910
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:11,359
so if we want to just imply

3911
03:13:09,680 --> 03:13:13,520
let's get this out here

3912
03:13:11,359 --> 03:13:15,040
so if we want to just skip all of the

3913
03:13:13,520 --> 03:13:16,640
nonsense and go straight to the

3914
03:13:15,040 --> 03:13:19,840
quadratic equation

3915
03:13:16,639 --> 03:13:21,358
we actually just can because we can see

3916
03:13:19,840 --> 03:13:23,760
we've got it right here right we've got

3917
03:13:21,359 --> 03:13:25,120
a t squared

3918
03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:28,398
term

3919
03:13:25,120 --> 03:13:33,840
with dx squared as the coefficient right

3920
03:13:28,398 --> 03:13:36,318
we've got a t term here with 2 ax dx

3921
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:39,040
as the coefficient there's the t right

3922
03:13:36,318 --> 03:13:41,119
here's the t squared here's the t

3923
03:13:39,040 --> 03:13:43,840
and then we have a

3924
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:43,840
ax squared

3925
03:13:45,760 --> 03:13:49,760
as the as the constant term that doesn't

3926
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:52,079
have a t value

3927
03:13:49,760 --> 03:13:53,680
now if we had multiplied this out all

3928
03:13:52,079 --> 03:13:56,000
the whole way

3929
03:13:53,680 --> 03:13:58,479
so that we had each one of these terms

3930
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:00,559
nothing would change except for the fact

3931
03:13:58,478 --> 03:14:02,879
that we'd now have one of each of these

3932
03:14:00,559 --> 03:14:05,840
so rather than just dx squared we would

3933
03:14:02,879 --> 03:14:06,639
have had like you know dx

3934
03:14:05,840 --> 03:14:10,079
um

3935
03:14:06,639 --> 03:14:13,519
squared plus d y squared plus dz squared

3936
03:14:10,079 --> 03:14:13,520
times t squared right

3937
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:20,318
so my assumption is

3938
03:14:17,359 --> 03:14:23,040
we literally just compute these values

3939
03:14:20,318 --> 03:14:26,159
for the sphere

3940
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:29,439
right and they are

3941
03:14:26,159 --> 03:14:32,318
they're not quite computable

3942
03:14:29,439 --> 03:14:32,800
ahead of time because remember we have

3943
03:14:32,318 --> 03:14:34,238
to

3944
03:14:32,799 --> 03:14:36,799
[Music]

3945
03:14:34,238 --> 03:14:41,119
a has to be put

3946
03:14:36,799 --> 03:14:44,398
a a and d are like based on the ray

3947
03:14:41,120 --> 03:14:46,160
so we can't just like

3948
03:14:44,398 --> 03:14:47,199
we can't just like pre-compute them or

3949
03:14:46,159 --> 03:14:48,159
something

3950
03:14:47,200 --> 03:14:51,960
um

3951
03:14:48,159 --> 03:14:51,959
which is kind of annoying

3952
03:14:58,559 --> 03:15:02,000
i mean that seems pretty straightforward

3953
03:15:00,079 --> 03:15:04,000
but then now i'm just wondering

3954
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:05,920
is there a smarter way to do this

3955
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:08,639
because there's really not much you can

3956
03:15:05,920 --> 03:15:08,639
pre-compute

3957
03:15:11,840 --> 03:15:15,238
in this case

3958
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:32,318
like that just seems like a lot of work

3959
03:15:30,559 --> 03:15:33,199
maybe some of these terms like cancel

3960
03:15:32,318 --> 03:15:35,199
out

3961
03:15:33,200 --> 03:15:37,520
a little bit

3962
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:37,520
but

3963
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:49,600
i don't really see what i've done stupid

3964
03:15:48,159 --> 03:15:51,760
there

3965
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:54,399
i'll try it one more time

3966
03:15:51,760 --> 03:15:57,200
and we'll look it up after

3967
03:15:54,398 --> 03:16:00,398
just to see what the smartest thing is

3968
03:15:57,200 --> 03:16:02,399
but i don't quite see where i went wrong

3969
03:16:00,398 --> 03:16:05,920
there and that does seem kind of

3970
03:16:02,398 --> 03:16:07,439
expensive more expensive than i think

3971
03:16:05,920 --> 03:16:09,439
it should be

3972
03:16:07,439 --> 03:16:11,920
so that may just be me not having done

3973
03:16:09,439 --> 03:16:13,760
3d math in years

3974
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:14,960
the only time i do 3d math these days is

3975
03:16:13,760 --> 03:16:16,238
on handmade here well that's not

3976
03:16:14,959 --> 03:16:17,679
entirely true occasionally i have to

3977
03:16:16,238 --> 03:16:18,478
hack something in like the other day i

3978
03:16:17,680 --> 03:16:20,559
was

3979
03:16:18,478 --> 03:16:22,478
writing scripts in sketchup and blender

3980
03:16:20,559 --> 03:16:24,000
to do some stuff for art pipelines so i

3981
03:16:22,478 --> 03:16:26,879
guess i still do do

3982
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:29,520
i do 3d math occasionally but

3983
03:16:26,879 --> 03:16:30,719
um not the nitty gritty of it like i

3984
03:16:29,520 --> 03:16:31,840
used to

3985
03:16:30,719 --> 03:16:35,278
um

3986
03:16:31,840 --> 03:16:35,279
so you know there's that

3987
03:16:35,920 --> 03:16:39,600
but i'm not sure any other way to phrase

3988
03:16:37,520 --> 03:16:41,279
this problem right the point is

3989
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:42,079
at some point you're going to get down

3990
03:16:41,279 --> 03:16:44,640
to

3991
03:16:42,079 --> 03:16:47,279
the origin of the ray plus

3992
03:16:44,639 --> 03:16:50,238
the ray direction times some value you

3993
03:16:47,279 --> 03:16:51,359
wanted to produce as your t value

3994
03:16:50,238 --> 03:16:53,520
um

3995
03:16:51,359 --> 03:16:55,520
you're going to take this and you're

3996
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:57,279
going to say that the length of this

3997
03:16:55,520 --> 03:16:59,120
should be equal to

3998
03:16:57,279 --> 03:17:01,439
the radius of the sphere

3999
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:05,359
you could square both sides

4000
03:17:01,439 --> 03:17:05,359
right and say that like

4001
03:17:06,079 --> 03:17:13,840
the length of this squared

4002
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:16,719
equals r squared so you can remove

4003
03:17:13,840 --> 03:17:18,478
a root term trivially from it like we

4004
03:17:16,719 --> 03:17:19,760
did before

4005
03:17:18,478 --> 03:17:22,398
but again

4006
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:23,760
i'm not sure that we really care because

4007
03:17:22,398 --> 03:17:25,599
we're going to be

4008
03:17:23,760 --> 03:17:28,079
rooting things

4009
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:30,800
either way because of the

4010
03:17:28,079 --> 03:17:33,039
uh quadratic nature of solving a sphere

4011
03:17:30,799 --> 03:17:35,278
right so so the like we can only get rid

4012
03:17:33,040 --> 03:17:36,399
of one of those

4013
03:17:35,279 --> 03:17:37,520
um

4014
03:17:36,398 --> 03:17:40,079
we're not going to get rid of both of

4015
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:42,960
them right

4016
03:17:40,079 --> 03:17:47,520
so anyway uh if we imagined

4017
03:17:42,959 --> 03:17:48,478
uh this a plus uh td in here

4018
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:51,600
uh

4019
03:17:48,478 --> 03:17:54,000
again i don't see a lot of wiggle room

4020
03:17:51,600 --> 03:17:55,760
there i mean it's going to be so it's

4021
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:57,760
going to be root

4022
03:17:55,760 --> 03:18:00,000
squared

4023
03:17:57,760 --> 03:18:01,840
equals r squared of

4024
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:04,079
uh you know

4025
03:18:01,840 --> 03:18:08,398
it's just going to be ax

4026
03:18:04,079 --> 03:18:10,719
plus t times dx squared dot dot

4027
03:18:08,398 --> 03:18:10,719
and

4028
03:18:12,238 --> 03:18:16,719
i don't see how you get around that so

4029
03:18:15,279 --> 03:18:18,319
at that point you're just

4030
03:18:16,719 --> 03:18:20,879
you know the square and the root cancel

4031
03:18:18,318 --> 03:18:23,680
each other out so your dx

4032
03:18:20,879 --> 03:18:26,000
squared equals r squared

4033
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:28,079
and you're solving this equation

4034
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:28,559
of

4035
03:18:28,079 --> 03:18:31,359
i mean

4036
03:18:28,559 --> 03:18:32,799
[Music]

4037
03:18:31,359 --> 03:18:34,318
it seems simple enough that even i

4038
03:18:32,799 --> 03:18:35,519
couldn't screw it up right i mean you're

4039
03:18:34,318 --> 03:18:38,238
going to square this term you're going

4040
03:18:35,520 --> 03:18:39,680
to have one of those for each of your

4041
03:18:38,238 --> 03:18:42,000
components and you're going to subtract

4042
03:18:39,680 --> 03:18:46,279
the r squared over to the other side you

4043
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:46,279
know this will eventually be

4044
03:18:50,879 --> 03:18:54,238
that

4045
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:56,398
um and so so you're

4046
03:18:54,238 --> 03:18:57,920
you know like we said uh before you're

4047
03:18:56,398 --> 03:19:01,199
gonna end up with

4048
03:18:57,920 --> 03:19:04,398
ax squared plus bx squared plus cx

4049
03:19:01,200 --> 03:19:06,319
squared minus r squared is your c

4050
03:19:04,398 --> 03:19:08,398
right that's going to be your your in

4051
03:19:06,318 --> 03:19:11,680
your quadratic equation i need a new

4052
03:19:08,398 --> 03:19:11,680
marker this thing is so dull

4053
03:19:11,840 --> 03:19:15,359
um

4054
03:19:13,120 --> 03:19:16,800
you're going to end up with this as your

4055
03:19:15,359 --> 03:19:18,479
c term

4056
03:19:16,799 --> 03:19:20,559
uh your a term

4057
03:19:18,478 --> 03:19:23,920
is going to be the

4058
03:19:20,559 --> 03:19:26,159
t squareds so t it's going to be just t

4059
03:19:23,920 --> 03:19:28,398
squared with dx squared plus dy squared

4060
03:19:26,159 --> 03:19:29,840
plus dz squared and then your t term is

4061
03:19:28,398 --> 03:19:31,599
going to be the interior term so it's

4062
03:19:29,840 --> 03:19:35,680
going to be ax dx

4063
03:19:31,600 --> 03:19:37,200
plus a y d y plus right

4064
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:40,960
and

4065
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:42,720
so uh i don't know

4066
03:19:40,959 --> 03:19:44,159
again very rusty at this sort of stuff

4067
03:19:42,719 --> 03:19:45,438
so take it with a grain of salt that

4068
03:19:44,159 --> 03:19:47,200
might have sucked

4069
03:19:45,439 --> 03:19:50,720
that's just like you know trying to

4070
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:52,319
summon up 15 years ago brain

4071
03:19:50,719 --> 03:19:54,238
it's a simple problem but you know i

4072
03:19:52,318 --> 03:19:57,799
probably missed some stuff but that's

4073
03:19:54,238 --> 03:19:57,799
basically it

4074
03:20:11,920 --> 03:20:17,520
uh yeah we do unfortunately

4075
03:20:14,799 --> 03:20:19,278
need to know the coordinates because if

4076
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:20,800
we don't

4077
03:20:19,279 --> 03:20:23,120
um

4078
03:20:20,799 --> 03:20:25,119
if we don't know the coordinates of the

4079
03:20:23,120 --> 03:20:27,359
intersection of the sphere

4080
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:29,439
then we wouldn't know whether we hit the

4081
03:20:27,359 --> 03:20:30,318
sphere or something else

4082
03:20:29,439 --> 03:20:32,720
right

4083
03:20:30,318 --> 03:20:34,079
because if you just find out if you've

4084
03:20:32,719 --> 03:20:36,559
hit the sphere

4085
03:20:34,079 --> 03:20:38,318
then you wouldn't actually know if there

4086
03:20:36,559 --> 03:20:40,840
was some other intersection that was

4087
03:20:38,318 --> 03:20:42,398
closer than the sphere

4088
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:43,520
so

4089
03:20:42,398 --> 03:20:46,959
you know

4090
03:20:43,520 --> 03:20:48,399
so it's pretty simple but um

4091
03:20:46,959 --> 03:20:51,358
i just am

4092
03:20:48,398 --> 03:20:53,599
kind of worried about the cost

4093
03:20:51,359 --> 03:20:55,040
uh amusingly we've already done it on

4094
03:20:53,600 --> 03:20:56,960
handmade hero

4095
03:20:55,040 --> 03:20:58,000
uh and i don't know whether we did it

4096
03:20:56,959 --> 03:21:00,318
well

4097
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:04,238
but we already did it for handmade rey

4098
03:21:00,318 --> 03:21:04,238
for those of you who watch that right

4099
03:21:04,398 --> 03:21:07,599
um in here somewhere

4100
03:21:06,318 --> 03:21:08,959
we have

4101
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:11,200
a uh

4102
03:21:08,959 --> 03:21:14,799
a thing to to

4103
03:21:11,200 --> 03:21:16,000
uh raycast against the sphere right

4104
03:21:14,799 --> 03:21:17,358
um

4105
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:21,040
here it is

4106
03:21:17,359 --> 03:21:23,279
and here's the code that we wrote for it

4107
03:21:21,040 --> 03:21:24,399
so

4108
03:21:23,279 --> 03:21:25,680
as i

4109
03:21:24,398 --> 03:21:27,680
predicted

4110
03:21:25,680 --> 03:21:29,920
past me did the same thing as

4111
03:21:27,680 --> 03:21:31,840
current me

4112
03:21:29,920 --> 03:21:35,439
we subtracted

4113
03:21:31,840 --> 03:21:38,079
the sphere's origin from the ray origin

4114
03:21:35,439 --> 03:21:39,920
uh which gives us a a sphere relative

4115
03:21:38,079 --> 03:21:42,639
ray

4116
03:21:39,920 --> 03:21:43,760
uh we took the inner product of the ray

4117
03:21:42,639 --> 03:21:46,879
direction

4118
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:47,920
and itself which is just the length of

4119
03:21:46,879 --> 03:21:48,799
it

4120
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:50,719
right

4121
03:21:48,799 --> 03:21:53,119
and hey guess what that's exactly what i

4122
03:21:50,719 --> 03:21:56,159
just said it would be it's dx squared

4123
03:21:53,120 --> 03:21:59,279
plus d y squared plus dz squared right

4124
03:21:56,159 --> 03:22:01,359
that's what the inner product is

4125
03:21:59,279 --> 03:22:04,079
i mean yeah it's it's the same thing i

4126
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:04,079
just wrote on the board

4127
03:22:04,840 --> 03:22:10,000
right it's the same thing i just wrote

4128
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:12,399
on the board and then here's the here's

4129
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:16,959
the quadratic equation right the root

4130
03:22:12,398 --> 03:22:16,959
term is b times b minus four ac

4131
03:22:17,680 --> 03:22:20,960
i mean

4132
03:22:19,279 --> 03:22:23,200
what do you want

4133
03:22:20,959 --> 03:22:23,199
right

4134
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:26,920
what do you want

4135
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:46,200
um

4136
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:59,960
i mean it's not that bad

4137
03:23:07,520 --> 03:23:11,279
right

4138
03:23:09,359 --> 03:23:12,640
i mean i wouldn't necessarily cry about

4139
03:23:11,279 --> 03:23:15,640
it

4140
03:23:12,639 --> 03:23:15,639
but

4141
03:23:25,200 --> 03:23:28,319
i mean it ain't cheap

4142
03:23:29,200 --> 03:23:34,000
you know it it doubles the cost

4143
03:23:32,879 --> 03:23:36,639
uh

4144
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:38,238
of of the raycast for sure of the ray

4145
03:23:36,639 --> 03:23:40,559
walk for sure

4146
03:23:38,238 --> 03:23:40,559
um

4147
03:23:42,079 --> 03:23:45,079
so

4148
03:23:52,879 --> 03:23:57,119
and right i mean you're going to use

4149
03:23:54,639 --> 03:23:58,879
this the

4150
03:23:57,120 --> 03:24:00,479
you're going to use the square root

4151
03:23:58,879 --> 03:24:03,278
instruction for this it's going to be

4152
03:24:00,478 --> 03:24:05,599
like six cycles or something

4153
03:24:03,279 --> 03:24:05,600
um

4154
03:24:05,760 --> 03:24:09,439
probably overlaps well because it's

4155
03:24:07,520 --> 03:24:12,720
probably on like the divider or whatever

4156
03:24:09,439 --> 03:24:14,880
i don't know where is it let's find out

4157
03:24:12,719 --> 03:24:16,719
i love how freaky the like super bright

4158
03:24:14,879 --> 03:24:17,679
lights look

4159
03:24:16,719 --> 03:24:19,199
um

4160
03:24:17,680 --> 03:24:21,200
i'm gonna try it

4161
03:24:19,200 --> 03:24:22,720
as the last thing we do today it'll

4162
03:24:21,200 --> 03:24:24,079
probably suck

4163
03:24:22,719 --> 03:24:26,799
but it's fine

4164
03:24:24,079 --> 03:24:28,879
i just want to test it anyway

4165
03:24:26,799 --> 03:24:31,119
so if we go in here to

4166
03:24:28,879 --> 03:24:32,159
[Music]

4167
03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:34,160
i

4168
03:24:32,159 --> 03:24:36,079
i've loaded the entirely wrong thing if

4169
03:24:34,159 --> 03:24:38,478
we go in here to

4170
03:24:36,079 --> 03:24:42,559
a web browser

4171
03:24:38,478 --> 03:24:43,840
and we type in ups dot info

4172
03:24:42,559 --> 03:24:44,239
and

4173
03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:47,040
um

4174
03:24:44,239 --> 03:24:50,318
[Music]

4175
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:51,840
i open up the table

4176
03:24:50,318 --> 03:24:53,600
and i ask it

4177
03:24:51,840 --> 03:24:55,600
for

4178
03:24:53,600 --> 03:24:59,279
i don't know why these are checked

4179
03:24:55,600 --> 03:24:59,279
because i don't have one of those

4180
03:25:00,238 --> 03:25:06,959
if i were to ask

4181
03:25:03,279 --> 03:25:09,040
where the square root instruction was

4182
03:25:06,959 --> 03:25:10,159
what would you tell me

4183
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:15,680
so

4184
03:25:10,159 --> 03:25:15,680
no apparently it is not on the divider

4185
03:25:15,920 --> 03:25:18,960
oh and that's

4186
03:25:17,920 --> 03:25:20,840
much

4187
03:25:18,959 --> 03:25:23,119
faster than i thought it

4188
03:25:20,840 --> 03:25:27,760
was i thought it would have been more

4189
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:27,760
expensive than three cycles

4190
03:25:28,719 --> 03:25:33,438
all right

4191
03:25:31,200 --> 03:25:37,359
i mean

4192
03:25:33,439 --> 03:25:38,159
if it only costs three cycles

4193
03:25:37,359 --> 03:25:39,840
so

4194
03:25:38,159 --> 03:25:42,799
divide is

4195
03:25:39,840 --> 03:25:44,238
is way more expensive

4196
03:25:42,799 --> 03:25:46,318
is it not

4197
03:25:44,238 --> 03:25:48,159
no it's not all right so basically the

4198
03:25:46,318 --> 03:25:51,159
only divide that's still slow is integer

4199
03:25:48,159 --> 03:25:51,159
divide

4200
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:54,719
i mean three cycles is still really

4201
03:25:53,439 --> 03:25:57,520
freaking slow

4202
03:25:54,719 --> 03:25:58,398
for compared to anything else

4203
03:25:57,520 --> 03:26:02,000
um

4204
03:25:58,398 --> 03:26:02,000
but that's that's sorry yeah

4205
03:26:02,318 --> 03:26:05,920
that's all right

4206
03:26:04,478 --> 03:26:07,119
um

4207
03:26:05,920 --> 03:26:08,318
caveat

4208
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:09,920
emperor

4209
03:26:08,318 --> 03:26:11,920
as they say

4210
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:13,200
um this

4211
03:26:11,920 --> 03:26:14,879
is

4212
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:17,279
somewhat concerning so

4213
03:26:14,879 --> 03:26:18,879
it still is only on one divider right

4214
03:26:17,279 --> 03:26:21,920
you can see

4215
03:26:18,879 --> 03:26:23,119
that it's only on port zero here

4216
03:26:21,920 --> 03:26:25,920
so

4217
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:25,920
uh you know

4218
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:33,479
the multiplies are dual

4219
03:26:29,398 --> 03:26:33,478
ported um

4220
03:26:33,600 --> 03:26:36,800
so

4221
03:26:35,120 --> 03:26:39,840
you know

4222
03:26:36,799 --> 03:26:42,799
uh the latency is pretty wicked

4223
03:26:39,840 --> 03:26:44,398
so there's that like you ain't like you

4224
03:26:42,799 --> 03:26:47,759
do have to have a bunch of

4225
03:26:44,398 --> 03:26:49,199
this stuff in flight to get the three

4226
03:26:47,760 --> 03:26:52,200
um

4227
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:52,200
but

4228
03:27:16,559 --> 03:27:20,318
so yeah

4229
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:20,318
i mean

4230
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:26,040
i don't know it's not that bad

4231
03:27:34,318 --> 03:27:37,039
it's not that bad

4232
03:27:39,040 --> 03:27:43,840
all right well uh so i mean here's the

4233
03:27:41,680 --> 03:27:43,840
code

4234
03:27:45,040 --> 03:27:47,439
and

4235
03:27:51,120 --> 03:27:55,479
oops didn't mean to actually

4236
03:27:56,799 --> 03:28:00,639
uh so we've already written it and we

4237
03:27:58,719 --> 03:28:03,199
know it at least somewhat works so

4238
03:28:00,639 --> 03:28:05,599
really the main problem here is just us

4239
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:07,120
welding this thing

4240
03:28:05,600 --> 03:28:10,640
uh into

4241
03:28:07,120 --> 03:28:12,720
the code as it stands

4242
03:28:10,639 --> 03:28:15,358
so uh

4243
03:28:12,719 --> 03:28:16,959
we want to compute this with

4244
03:28:15,359 --> 03:28:19,680
you know exactly what we would expect so

4245
03:28:16,959 --> 03:28:22,318
we turn the ray origin into the you know

4246
03:28:19,680 --> 03:28:24,159
let's say the boxman

4247
03:28:22,318 --> 03:28:25,600
is going to hold the value for the

4248
03:28:24,159 --> 03:28:26,719
sphere

4249
03:28:25,600 --> 03:28:28,159
uh

4250
03:28:26,719 --> 03:28:29,278
the the center

4251
03:28:28,159 --> 03:28:32,000
of the sphere

4252
03:28:29,279 --> 03:28:36,159
just i'm just saying that

4253
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:36,159
arbitrarily because i

4254
03:28:36,520 --> 03:28:42,640
can um

4255
03:28:39,359 --> 03:28:42,640
we then compute

4256
03:28:44,559 --> 03:28:49,119
the

4257
03:28:46,238 --> 03:28:51,840
a b and c values

4258
03:28:49,120 --> 03:28:53,120
the ray direction

4259
03:28:51,840 --> 03:28:55,359
is

4260
03:28:53,120 --> 03:28:57,439
not an issue right because the ray has

4261
03:28:55,359 --> 03:29:01,200
already been normalized

4262
03:28:57,439 --> 03:29:01,200
so like a is just one

4263
03:29:04,238 --> 03:29:07,359
right

4264
03:29:05,439 --> 03:29:09,279
because that's not even the inverse ray

4265
03:29:07,359 --> 03:29:11,760
direction that's just the actual ray

4266
03:29:09,279 --> 03:29:11,760
direction

4267
03:29:12,879 --> 03:29:16,238
um

4268
03:29:14,959 --> 03:29:18,318
right

4269
03:29:16,238 --> 03:29:21,520
so so we don't need a

4270
03:29:18,318 --> 03:29:23,840
um a a can go away

4271
03:29:21,520 --> 03:29:26,800
uh we

4272
03:29:23,840 --> 03:29:29,439
we do need b because we have no idea

4273
03:29:26,799 --> 03:29:32,159
like what this value is relative to the

4274
03:29:29,439 --> 03:29:37,040
ray direction like like we we have no

4275
03:29:32,159 --> 03:29:39,119
idea right um so so we do need that

4276
03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:41,040
and

4277
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:43,840
this is

4278
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:47,239
like not known until after we do

4279
03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:47,238
yeah i mean

4280
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:54,238
uh

4281
03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:03,840
is that actually true though

4282
03:30:10,559 --> 03:30:15,680
i suspect it probably is i mean the only

4283
03:30:12,879 --> 03:30:17,599
reason i hesitate there is because

4284
03:30:15,680 --> 03:30:19,359
since the sphere relative origin is a

4285
03:30:17,600 --> 03:30:21,600
subtraction

4286
03:30:19,359 --> 03:30:24,000
and it's a subtraction between something

4287
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:26,479
we don't know which is the right origin

4288
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:28,398
with something we do know which is the

4289
03:30:26,478 --> 03:30:30,719
center of the sphere

4290
03:30:28,398 --> 03:30:33,680
in theory you could pre-compute the part

4291
03:30:30,719 --> 03:30:36,639
of this that was constant

4292
03:30:33,680 --> 03:30:38,800
my guess is there's no win meaning you

4293
03:30:36,639 --> 03:30:41,760
would still end up doing as much or more

4294
03:30:38,799 --> 03:30:43,438
work if you pulled out the constant part

4295
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:45,600
then if you just do the subtract and

4296
03:30:43,439 --> 03:30:47,040
then take the dot product

4297
03:30:45,600 --> 03:30:48,640
but i

4298
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:50,239
couldn't promise you that i

4299
03:30:48,639 --> 03:30:51,760
thought i'd mention it like we you would

4300
03:30:50,238 --> 03:30:53,439
actually want to like

4301
03:30:51,760 --> 03:30:54,800
write it out and make sure

4302
03:30:53,439 --> 03:30:56,960
you wouldn't want to do what i just did

4303
03:30:54,799 --> 03:31:01,438
is say like hey

4304
03:30:56,959 --> 03:31:01,438
um so the sphere radius

4305
03:31:02,959 --> 03:31:07,679
in this case is going to be like one of

4306
03:31:04,799 --> 03:31:09,920
the boxmans right so

4307
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:11,040
like sphere r i'm sorry one of the box

4308
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:13,200
maxes

4309
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:16,000
like we don't care which one

4310
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:20,319
um anyone will do

4311
03:31:16,000 --> 03:31:20,318
uh so you know that's fine

4312
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:28,000
ray direction

4313
03:31:23,359 --> 03:31:28,000
may not be an actual thing um

4314
03:31:30,159 --> 03:31:33,600
yeah it's called ray d

4315
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:42,719
it sounds like a cool guy named ray like

4316
03:31:39,279 --> 03:31:44,960
hey man what's up i'm ray d

4317
03:31:42,719 --> 03:31:44,959
uh

4318
03:31:45,279 --> 03:31:51,040
apparently we don't have times

4319
03:31:48,318 --> 03:31:53,199
for constants

4320
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:56,720
apparently

4321
03:31:53,200 --> 03:31:56,720
so that has to happen

4322
03:31:57,359 --> 03:32:01,439
um

4323
03:31:58,799 --> 03:32:01,438
this

4324
03:32:01,680 --> 03:32:10,159
is just squaring the b term

4325
03:32:04,959 --> 03:32:14,238
and then subtracting this c term

4326
03:32:10,159 --> 03:32:16,559
same rule applies

4327
03:32:14,238 --> 03:32:16,559
um

4328
03:32:18,398 --> 03:32:22,959
and now we're not really going to go

4329
03:32:21,040 --> 03:32:26,560
into an if statement here right because

4330
03:32:22,959 --> 03:32:28,159
we we need to actually um

4331
03:32:26,559 --> 03:32:30,398
this this we have to add we probably

4332
03:32:28,159 --> 03:32:33,359
don't have one of those for

4333
03:32:30,398 --> 03:32:36,559
f32 x's so we'll have to add that

4334
03:32:33,359 --> 03:32:38,880
but then we get to the part where like

4335
03:32:36,559 --> 03:32:41,600
we can't afford to if around this like

4336
03:32:38,879 --> 03:32:43,839
that's probably not gonna happen

4337
03:32:41,600 --> 03:32:43,840
so

4338
03:32:44,879 --> 03:32:49,039
you know

4339
03:32:46,719 --> 03:32:51,679
we're gonna have to do something here

4340
03:32:49,040 --> 03:32:54,000
uh so the mask is whether or not the

4341
03:32:51,680 --> 03:32:56,639
root term is positive right because it

4342
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:58,959
has to be over zero otherwise we didn't

4343
03:32:56,639 --> 03:33:03,519
intersect

4344
03:32:58,959 --> 03:33:07,278
so we would need to like prep the mask

4345
03:33:03,520 --> 03:33:07,279
value for that

4346
03:33:10,478 --> 03:33:13,679
which is sucks

4347
03:33:15,279 --> 03:33:21,200
and it's just gonna have to be

4348
03:33:18,639 --> 03:33:21,199
so like

4349
03:33:24,719 --> 03:33:28,238
it's just gonna have to be another thing

4350
03:33:26,559 --> 03:33:29,199
that we merge

4351
03:33:28,238 --> 03:33:30,719
right

4352
03:33:29,200 --> 03:33:35,120
like we're going to have to merge the

4353
03:33:30,719 --> 03:33:35,119
regular mask with a sphere mask

4354
03:33:38,959 --> 03:33:42,719
or knock out part of the sphere mask

4355
03:33:40,879 --> 03:33:45,759
it's yeah like

4356
03:33:42,719 --> 03:33:46,799
welcome to cindy

4357
03:33:45,760 --> 03:33:50,079
uh

4358
03:33:46,799 --> 03:33:51,519
it's actually totally fine if you have

4359
03:33:50,079 --> 03:33:55,318
you know a thing like a shader language

4360
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:55,319
that's designed for it

4361
03:34:00,238 --> 03:34:02,559
so

4362
03:34:08,478 --> 03:34:12,398
um

4363
03:34:10,478 --> 03:34:14,478
the denominator

4364
03:34:12,398 --> 03:34:16,719
of this

4365
03:34:14,478 --> 03:34:19,679
uh then produces the two

4366
03:34:16,719 --> 03:34:19,679
t values

4367
03:34:21,040 --> 03:34:25,040
why are they called t p and t n o

4368
03:34:23,600 --> 03:34:26,880
positive and negative that's probably

4369
03:34:25,040 --> 03:34:28,479
what we called those

4370
03:34:26,879 --> 03:34:30,398
let's let's claim that's what we call

4371
03:34:28,478 --> 03:34:32,879
those

4372
03:34:30,398 --> 03:34:34,398
um and so once we have the positive

4373
03:34:32,879 --> 03:34:37,519
negative terms we don't really know

4374
03:34:34,398 --> 03:34:39,439
which one would be which

4375
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:42,439
right

4376
03:34:39,439 --> 03:34:42,439
um

4377
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:50,238
oh well no we

4378
03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:51,200
we sort of do right because the root

4379
03:34:50,238 --> 03:34:53,119
term

4380
03:34:51,200 --> 03:34:55,920
is a square root

4381
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:57,600
so it's not like it can be negative

4382
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:59,920
right the negative is like baked into

4383
03:34:57,600 --> 03:34:59,920
here

4384
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:04,079
so we kind of know

4385
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:05,120
that it's like min and max already right

4386
03:35:04,079 --> 03:35:06,959
like

4387
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:09,960
like this is gonna be

4388
03:35:06,959 --> 03:35:09,959
um

4389
03:35:11,600 --> 03:35:15,760
like you can't add a positive value to

4390
03:35:13,680 --> 03:35:18,559
something and have it get smaller can

4391
03:35:15,760 --> 03:35:22,079
you oh well a

4392
03:35:18,559 --> 03:35:24,398
can a ever be yes it can

4393
03:35:22,079 --> 03:35:27,760
so actually that's not true

4394
03:35:24,398 --> 03:35:30,478
because if the denominator is negative

4395
03:35:27,760 --> 03:35:30,478
it will flip

4396
03:35:32,238 --> 03:35:37,119
so much for that

4397
03:35:34,879 --> 03:35:40,478
thought we were gonna get off easy there

4398
03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:40,479
but we didn't

4399
03:35:44,719 --> 03:35:49,679
right

4400
03:35:45,760 --> 03:35:49,680
you see why i'm saying like i don't

4401
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:55,279
i don't think so

4402
03:35:52,959 --> 03:35:55,278
um

4403
03:36:05,359 --> 03:36:10,399
oh whoa whoa

4404
03:36:06,879 --> 03:36:13,358
no no i take it back i take it all back

4405
03:36:10,398 --> 03:36:15,439
it's it's b that i was looking at a

4406
03:36:13,359 --> 03:36:18,800
doesn't exist

4407
03:36:15,439 --> 03:36:21,520
no no no so i'm sorry we do luck out we

4408
03:36:18,799 --> 03:36:23,759
totally do

4409
03:36:21,520 --> 03:36:26,479
nevermind right

4410
03:36:23,760 --> 03:36:29,120
we're okay we're okay so the denominator

4411
03:36:26,478 --> 03:36:29,119
is just two

4412
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:32,398
i think

4413
03:36:32,879 --> 03:36:37,839
right um and if the denominator is just

4414
03:36:35,920 --> 03:36:40,799
two then really this is just multiplying

4415
03:36:37,840 --> 03:36:44,000
by 0.5 which means that it can't it

4416
03:36:40,799 --> 03:36:45,119
wouldn't it would never flip

4417
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:48,079
right

4418
03:36:45,120 --> 03:36:50,000
um it would never it would never flip so

4419
03:36:48,079 --> 03:36:51,600
i think we dodged a bullet there just in

4420
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:53,920
the nick of time

4421
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:55,840
um i want to say that that

4422
03:36:53,920 --> 03:36:57,439
is is actually

4423
03:36:55,840 --> 03:37:00,159
will actually compute the minimum and

4424
03:36:57,439 --> 03:37:03,159
maximum because

4425
03:37:00,159 --> 03:37:03,159
i

4426
03:37:08,879 --> 03:37:12,318
let me just make sure that's actually

4427
03:37:10,079 --> 03:37:12,318
true

4428
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:18,000
because starting at negative b if you

4429
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:19,840
subtract a positive value from it you

4430
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:21,600
can only get smaller

4431
03:37:19,840 --> 03:37:24,398
and starting at negative b if you add

4432
03:37:21,600 --> 03:37:26,640
yes so so right

4433
03:37:24,398 --> 03:37:26,639
um

4434
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:32,238
right that seems fine

4435
03:37:30,799 --> 03:37:33,840
uh so that's

4436
03:37:32,238 --> 03:37:34,539
cool

4437
03:37:33,840 --> 03:37:37,639
um

4438
03:37:34,540 --> 03:37:37,639
[Music]

4439
03:37:42,318 --> 03:37:46,159
that seems pretty good uh this is

4440
03:37:44,879 --> 03:37:47,599
looking better than i thought it was

4441
03:37:46,159 --> 03:37:50,799
going to

4442
03:37:47,600 --> 03:37:50,800
um this part

4443
03:37:51,439 --> 03:37:55,680
is

4444
03:37:52,159 --> 03:37:58,680
all just what we already are doing

4445
03:37:55,680 --> 03:37:58,680
um

4446
03:38:01,680 --> 03:38:07,279
so we're close

4447
03:38:04,799 --> 03:38:10,559
um but we've got a little bit more work

4448
03:38:07,279 --> 03:38:12,720
to do here uh

4449
03:38:10,559 --> 03:38:14,000
so so i think we're good right i think

4450
03:38:12,719 --> 03:38:15,920
we're good

4451
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:17,760
um

4452
03:38:15,920 --> 03:38:20,639
if everyone is is down with that let me

4453
03:38:17,760 --> 03:38:22,559
see the chat's down with that

4454
03:38:20,639 --> 03:38:24,318
yeah

4455
03:38:22,559 --> 03:38:26,559
the chat is down with that

4456
03:38:24,318 --> 03:38:28,238
so so that's good so those are those are

4457
03:38:26,559 --> 03:38:30,478
simplified so let's take a look at this

4458
03:38:28,238 --> 03:38:32,159
other stuff up here

4459
03:38:30,478 --> 03:38:34,238
um and and really this is the part

4460
03:38:32,159 --> 03:38:36,000
that's going to be annoying because uh

4461
03:38:34,238 --> 03:38:37,279
we have to basically do a separate

4462
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:41,199
select

4463
03:38:37,279 --> 03:38:43,680
because unlike the aabb

4464
03:38:41,199 --> 03:38:46,640
where this is sufficient

4465
03:38:43,680 --> 03:38:48,559
if it's a sphere we need this extra mask

4466
03:38:46,639 --> 03:38:52,079
term here

4467
03:38:48,559 --> 03:38:54,478
um so we got like yet another and

4468
03:38:52,079 --> 03:38:57,039
which sucks right that that's kind of

4469
03:38:54,478 --> 03:39:02,358
annoying because

4470
03:38:57,040 --> 03:39:02,359
i don't see any way out of that uh

4471
03:39:08,639 --> 03:39:14,398
i mean maybe what we could do is set the

4472
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:18,680
t mask

4473
03:39:14,398 --> 03:39:18,680
set t max to zero

4474
03:39:23,520 --> 03:39:26,640
i don't know uh well the crossover come

4475
03:39:25,359 --> 03:39:29,199
to it let's just check out the rest of

4476
03:39:26,639 --> 03:39:31,920
it first so okay so we assume that box

4477
03:39:29,199 --> 03:39:34,239
max x is our radius

4478
03:39:31,920 --> 03:39:34,238
you know

4479
03:39:34,318 --> 03:39:39,278
uh we assume that that the sphere

4480
03:39:36,559 --> 03:39:41,039
relative origin we've got is boxman is

4481
03:39:39,279 --> 03:39:44,319
the center of sphere

4482
03:39:41,040 --> 03:39:46,960
uh we're taking our b value

4483
03:39:44,318 --> 03:39:46,959
is

4484
03:39:49,680 --> 03:39:56,000
oh wow okay so actually these can go

4485
03:39:52,559 --> 03:40:00,398
away sort of can't they

4486
03:39:56,000 --> 03:40:01,840
so so our b value is multiplied by two

4487
03:40:00,398 --> 03:40:04,000
right

4488
03:40:01,840 --> 03:40:05,520
um

4489
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:08,159
you know what i'm saying

4490
03:40:05,520 --> 03:40:09,680
and if we just didn't do that

4491
03:40:08,159 --> 03:40:11,920
so let's say we

4492
03:40:09,680 --> 03:40:11,920
uh

4493
03:40:12,159 --> 03:40:14,959
we like

4494
03:40:13,439 --> 03:40:16,398
chat watch me here where i do this

4495
03:40:14,959 --> 03:40:18,639
because i probably should have done this

4496
03:40:16,398 --> 03:40:21,439
on the board i didn't

4497
03:40:18,639 --> 03:40:22,639
so if the b value did not have the two

4498
03:40:21,439 --> 03:40:25,359
in it

4499
03:40:22,639 --> 03:40:26,478
right so the two goes away

4500
03:40:25,359 --> 03:40:28,559
then

4501
03:40:26,478 --> 03:40:30,719
the in here

4502
03:40:28,559 --> 03:40:34,879
normally this would produce a four

4503
03:40:30,719 --> 03:40:37,119
so this would actually have a 4 in it

4504
03:40:34,879 --> 03:40:37,119
right

4505
03:40:38,478 --> 03:40:41,920
because we used to have a 2 and 2 times

4506
03:40:40,559 --> 03:40:44,000
2 here would have been 4 so this would

4507
03:40:41,920 --> 03:40:45,199
have been a 4 here and there would also

4508
03:40:44,000 --> 03:40:47,279
have been

4509
03:40:45,199 --> 03:40:48,720
a 2 here

4510
03:40:47,279 --> 03:40:50,270
right

4511
03:40:48,719 --> 03:40:51,920
so so there's like a 2

4512
03:40:50,270 --> 03:40:54,319
[Music]

4513
03:40:51,920 --> 03:40:54,318
in there

4514
03:40:55,120 --> 03:40:57,359
right

4515
03:40:57,439 --> 03:41:01,600
that pops out

4516
03:40:59,439 --> 03:41:03,439
and

4517
03:41:01,600 --> 03:41:04,960
if you look

4518
03:41:03,439 --> 03:41:07,040
this is

4519
03:41:04,959 --> 03:41:08,559
this is factorable now

4520
03:41:07,040 --> 03:41:11,439
so this

4521
03:41:08,559 --> 03:41:15,680
because they both have a 4

4522
03:41:11,439 --> 03:41:17,760
is like b squared minus c

4523
03:41:15,680 --> 03:41:20,318
um i think

4524
03:41:17,760 --> 03:41:21,279
the four can come out because it's a

4525
03:41:20,318 --> 03:41:22,719
product

4526
03:41:21,279 --> 03:41:24,399
can come out

4527
03:41:22,719 --> 03:41:26,000
as a two

4528
03:41:24,398 --> 03:41:29,840
and if it does

4529
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:29,840
that means that there's a two here

4530
03:41:30,398 --> 03:41:34,719
which means that all of this disappears

4531
03:41:32,719 --> 03:41:37,039
because there's two twos

4532
03:41:34,719 --> 03:41:38,159
on the inside which means you can factor

4533
03:41:37,040 --> 03:41:41,359
it out

4534
03:41:38,159 --> 03:41:44,159
and if you multiplied it by 0.5 then you

4535
03:41:41,359 --> 03:41:44,159
just get nothing

4536
03:41:46,559 --> 03:41:49,119
is that right

4537
03:41:50,559 --> 03:41:53,680
did i do that right

4538
03:41:54,719 --> 03:41:57,840
watch me math people

4539
03:41:59,439 --> 03:42:03,680
um

4540
03:42:00,398 --> 03:42:03,680
so that seems good

4541
03:42:04,478 --> 03:42:07,478
um

4542
03:42:10,318 --> 03:42:14,318
i think we followed that through

4543
03:42:12,238 --> 03:42:15,840
so we're just down well you know one the

4544
03:42:14,318 --> 03:42:16,959
easiest thing to do

4545
03:42:15,840 --> 03:42:18,719
uh

4546
03:42:16,959 --> 03:42:20,559
right off the bat is just to add our

4547
03:42:18,719 --> 03:42:22,238
square root because that's kind of a

4548
03:42:20,559 --> 03:42:23,198
no-brainer right

4549
03:42:22,238 --> 03:42:24,799
um

4550
03:42:23,199 --> 03:42:26,880
so like in here where we've got our

4551
03:42:24,799 --> 03:42:29,198
other functions like like that we

4552
03:42:26,879 --> 03:42:32,398
actually have so we have an approximate

4553
03:42:29,199 --> 03:42:34,880
inverse square root so you know like

4554
03:42:32,398 --> 03:42:37,680
now we have an approximate i'm sorry now

4555
03:42:34,879 --> 03:42:41,839
we have an actual uh square root

4556
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:44,559
so there squirt ps done right

4557
03:42:41,840 --> 03:42:46,398
um so now our only problem is that we

4558
03:42:44,559 --> 03:42:48,318
need an additional criteria for

4559
03:42:46,398 --> 03:42:48,809
intersection here that's not actually

4560
03:42:48,318 --> 03:42:50,079
being

4561
03:42:48,809 --> 03:42:53,600
[Music]

4562
03:42:50,079 --> 03:42:56,079
measured by the other

4563
03:42:53,600 --> 03:42:57,120
by the other case

4564
03:42:56,079 --> 03:42:59,359
so

4565
03:42:57,120 --> 03:42:59,359
um

4566
03:43:05,279 --> 03:43:11,439
so this will correctly select the

4567
03:43:09,520 --> 03:43:14,319
the hit that we're doing

4568
03:43:11,439 --> 03:43:17,439
but we also then need to add into our

4569
03:43:14,318 --> 03:43:21,119
mask here a sphere mask value which

4570
03:43:17,439 --> 03:43:23,680
itself is selected this way uh and this

4571
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:26,160
is this kind of sucks

4572
03:43:23,680 --> 03:43:28,159
um but it's gonna be like this so

4573
03:43:26,159 --> 03:43:29,520
we've got a mask that says that this has

4574
03:43:28,159 --> 03:43:32,079
to be true

4575
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:34,479
in order for this to be uh

4576
03:43:32,079 --> 03:43:35,520
in order for us to count this

4577
03:43:34,478 --> 03:43:38,959
right

4578
03:43:35,520 --> 03:43:41,040
um so if this thing isn't you know

4579
03:43:38,959 --> 03:43:42,719
isn't greater than zero

4580
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:44,399
then then you can't process this

4581
03:43:42,719 --> 03:43:46,559
intersection but

4582
03:43:44,398 --> 03:43:49,039
the reason i say this gets worse

4583
03:43:46,559 --> 03:43:51,680
is because the sphere mask here is only

4584
03:43:49,040 --> 03:43:54,319
allowed to operate if

4585
03:43:51,680 --> 03:43:57,760
we are in the emission case

4586
03:43:54,318 --> 03:43:58,719
so the sphere mask itself has to be like

4587
03:43:57,760 --> 03:44:01,040
an

4588
03:43:58,719 --> 03:44:01,039
um

4589
03:44:01,439 --> 03:44:06,880
you know what i'm trying to say

4590
03:44:04,238 --> 03:44:09,840
right we need to select

4591
03:44:06,879 --> 03:44:12,799
based on leaf emission

4592
03:44:09,840 --> 03:44:16,398
um we need to select which one of these

4593
03:44:12,799 --> 03:44:17,679
we're going to do so do we have all ones

4594
03:44:16,398 --> 03:44:20,000
anywhere

4595
03:44:17,680 --> 03:44:20,000
um

4596
03:44:25,920 --> 03:44:30,478
uh if we don't this is a little harder

4597
03:44:28,559 --> 03:44:32,680
uh we could just invert it and use an

4598
03:44:30,478 --> 03:44:35,039
and not

4599
03:44:32,680 --> 03:44:37,279
[Music]

4600
03:44:35,040 --> 03:44:37,279
like

4601
03:44:42,398 --> 03:44:49,519
and then say like okay so it's zero

4602
03:44:46,639 --> 03:44:53,198
if it's emission it becomes

4603
03:44:49,520 --> 03:44:53,199
uh this term

4604
03:44:54,959 --> 03:44:57,959
right

4605
03:44:58,398 --> 03:45:02,719
um it's not great

4606
03:45:00,799 --> 03:45:04,079
uh but it's

4607
03:45:02,719 --> 03:45:06,238
something

4608
03:45:04,079 --> 03:45:08,879
uh and so now what we would need to do

4609
03:45:06,238 --> 03:45:10,478
is when we build the spatial partition

4610
03:45:08,879 --> 03:45:12,719
i mean in theory that's actually running

4611
03:45:10,478 --> 03:45:14,238
now i mean who the heck knows if it's

4612
03:45:12,719 --> 03:45:16,398
right at all

4613
03:45:14,238 --> 03:45:19,680
um we can try to cabin it off a little

4614
03:45:16,398 --> 03:45:19,680
bit so so like

4615
03:45:25,120 --> 03:45:29,760
i mean mostly right it's this

4616
03:45:36,799 --> 03:45:41,318
uh and you know you i got an idea

4617
03:45:55,760 --> 03:45:58,719
right

4618
03:45:56,639 --> 03:46:00,719
so if we turn this off

4619
03:45:58,719 --> 03:46:05,278
we we now have

4620
03:46:00,719 --> 03:46:07,039
no spheres like if i if i take this code

4621
03:46:05,279 --> 03:46:09,920
and i said

4622
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:12,640
yeah like don't run that then we should

4623
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:14,398
just get our squarey square squareness

4624
03:46:12,639 --> 03:46:15,358
squareness and

4625
03:46:14,398 --> 03:46:16,719
um

4626
03:46:15,359 --> 03:46:18,238
version

4627
03:46:16,719 --> 03:46:19,039
right

4628
03:46:18,238 --> 03:46:21,520
uh

4629
03:46:19,040 --> 03:46:24,319
whereas if i turn this on then like in

4630
03:46:21,520 --> 03:46:26,238
theory we're doing a sphere intersection

4631
03:46:24,318 --> 03:46:29,278
uh

4632
03:46:26,238 --> 03:46:31,520
um and and i don't really know that we

4633
03:46:29,279 --> 03:46:32,880
actually are it looks kind of broken so

4634
03:46:31,520 --> 03:46:34,479
i think it's probably not quite doing

4635
03:46:32,879 --> 03:46:37,519
that but it is actually doing something

4636
03:46:34,478 --> 03:46:40,559
different right

4637
03:46:37,520 --> 03:46:42,960
furthermore when we actually insert

4638
03:46:40,559 --> 03:46:45,920
these in we have to actually set these

4639
03:46:42,959 --> 03:46:48,079
correctly so at the moment

4640
03:46:45,920 --> 03:46:48,960
these are set wrong

4641
03:46:48,079 --> 03:46:53,760
so

4642
03:46:48,959 --> 03:46:53,759
what what i would propose is like

4643
03:46:58,398 --> 03:47:02,398
something like this

4644
03:46:59,840 --> 03:47:06,000
so we say okay if lights are spheres

4645
03:47:02,398 --> 03:47:08,559
then when we build the spatial partition

4646
03:47:06,000 --> 03:47:10,559
uh and we insert these things in

4647
03:47:08,559 --> 03:47:13,359
we have to actually take into account

4648
03:47:10,559 --> 03:47:15,760
whether or not the thing was a light

4649
03:47:13,359 --> 03:47:19,040
so in here where we get this kind of

4650
03:47:15,760 --> 03:47:20,079
thing and it's like is

4651
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:23,120
um

4652
03:47:20,079 --> 03:47:26,559
we don't want to do this anymore for

4653
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:28,000
spheres so this the spheres like don't

4654
03:47:26,559 --> 03:47:29,680
that's not

4655
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:32,879
possible right

4656
03:47:29,680 --> 03:47:35,199
and this creates a potential problem for

4657
03:47:32,879 --> 03:47:36,238
us which which is that our our actual

4658
03:47:35,199 --> 03:47:37,840
tracing

4659
03:47:36,238 --> 03:47:39,840
is not going to be quite right because

4660
03:47:37,840 --> 03:47:40,719
things aren't clipped to

4661
03:47:39,840 --> 03:47:41,159
the

4662
03:47:40,719 --> 03:47:42,959
um

4663
03:47:41,159 --> 03:47:46,318
[Music]

4664
03:47:42,959 --> 03:47:47,438
they're not clipped to the volume

4665
03:47:46,318 --> 03:47:49,840
i

4666
03:47:47,439 --> 03:47:50,880
you know what i'm saying

4667
03:47:49,840 --> 03:47:52,960
so

4668
03:47:50,879 --> 03:47:54,478
this could be bad

4669
03:47:52,959 --> 03:47:55,919
one of the really nice things about aabs

4670
03:47:54,478 --> 03:47:58,719
is their clip to the volume

4671
03:47:55,920 --> 03:48:00,398
the spheres cannot be clipped

4672
03:47:58,719 --> 03:48:02,559
you would have to add code specifically

4673
03:48:00,398 --> 03:48:05,760
to clip them because you can't clip a

4674
03:48:02,559 --> 03:48:05,760
sphere uh

4675
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:08,799
if you clip a sphere

4676
03:48:08,000 --> 03:48:10,159
to

4677
03:48:08,799 --> 03:48:12,639
anything

4678
03:48:10,159 --> 03:48:15,439
it is no longer a sphere

4679
03:48:12,639 --> 03:48:16,559
right it's it's now some segment section

4680
03:48:15,439 --> 03:48:19,600
of a sphere

4681
03:48:16,559 --> 03:48:21,519
an aab clipped by another aab is always

4682
03:48:19,600 --> 03:48:23,040
a resulting aab so

4683
03:48:21,520 --> 03:48:26,079
you're right

4684
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:28,720
so it's it's like not great

4685
03:48:26,079 --> 03:48:31,520
um

4686
03:48:28,719 --> 03:48:31,519
it's not great

4687
03:48:33,840 --> 03:48:38,639
so in here we would say okay if lights

4688
03:48:37,279 --> 03:48:42,600
or spheres

4689
03:48:38,639 --> 03:48:42,599
which sometimes they are

4690
03:48:43,199 --> 03:48:46,640
i

4691
03:48:44,478 --> 03:48:48,639
if

4692
03:48:46,639 --> 03:48:52,478
this box is a light

4693
03:48:48,639 --> 03:48:52,478
then this stuff gets set differently

4694
03:48:53,359 --> 03:48:59,199
first of all uh the x y and z are

4695
03:48:57,040 --> 03:49:01,439
actually like get the center of the

4696
03:48:59,199 --> 03:49:01,439
thing

4697
03:49:02,398 --> 03:49:07,519
uh it's not the leaf box it's like the

4698
03:49:05,199 --> 03:49:11,279
box bounds

4699
03:49:07,520 --> 03:49:12,079
right the it's the

4700
03:49:11,279 --> 03:49:14,560
uh

4701
03:49:12,079 --> 03:49:15,600
it's it's

4702
03:49:14,559 --> 03:49:17,840
this

4703
03:49:15,600 --> 03:49:19,279
i i don't know what clipping region is

4704
03:49:17,840 --> 03:49:22,600
in fact it's not even that it's like

4705
03:49:19,279 --> 03:49:22,600
it's like this

4706
03:49:26,318 --> 03:49:31,039
um this is the

4707
03:49:28,279 --> 03:49:32,880
insertion rex

4708
03:49:31,040 --> 03:49:36,000
i guess

4709
03:49:32,879 --> 03:49:38,238
i don't know what you want to call that

4710
03:49:36,000 --> 03:49:41,120
but we want to use the original so no

4711
03:49:38,238 --> 03:49:43,039
matter what we did when we did this

4712
03:49:41,120 --> 03:49:43,840
whole thing

4713
03:49:43,040 --> 03:49:45,760
uh

4714
03:49:43,840 --> 03:49:46,799
we want to just use the center of that

4715
03:49:45,760 --> 03:49:50,238
now

4716
03:49:46,799 --> 03:49:51,599
right so the x y and z's get spammed out

4717
03:49:50,238 --> 03:49:54,238
in this

4718
03:49:51,600 --> 03:49:54,238
dumb way

4719
03:49:55,359 --> 03:50:01,040
uh and then the dimensions of the

4720
03:49:58,559 --> 03:50:03,760
insertion rect are what we care about

4721
03:50:01,040 --> 03:50:06,560
here and we only store one of them so

4722
03:50:03,760 --> 03:50:07,600
it's you know whichever one it is it is

4723
03:50:06,559 --> 03:50:10,879
right

4724
03:50:07,600 --> 03:50:12,880
um this is going to be a radius so

4725
03:50:10,879 --> 03:50:14,799
so like i assume we don't have a get

4726
03:50:12,879 --> 03:50:15,679
radius function

4727
03:50:14,799 --> 03:50:17,119
do we

4728
03:50:15,680 --> 03:50:19,920
we do

4729
03:50:17,120 --> 03:50:21,840
um so we just say it's going to be half

4730
03:50:19,920 --> 03:50:24,559
right of the dimension

4731
03:50:21,840 --> 03:50:27,040
of the thing and now we've inserted them

4732
03:50:24,559 --> 03:50:29,039
in the format that was actually supposed

4733
03:50:27,040 --> 03:50:30,080
to be inserted for lights right i don't

4734
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:31,840
know

4735
03:50:30,079 --> 03:50:32,799
uh it doesn't look promising but again i

4736
03:50:31,840 --> 03:50:36,079
think that's probably just because it's

4737
03:50:32,799 --> 03:50:37,759
buggy not because uh

4738
03:50:36,079 --> 03:50:39,359
we have concluded that spherical light

4739
03:50:37,760 --> 03:50:41,840
sources don't work in this system or

4740
03:50:39,359 --> 03:50:43,760
something like that right

4741
03:50:41,840 --> 03:50:47,600
um so now

4742
03:50:43,760 --> 03:50:50,238
given the current setup as it is uh i'm

4743
03:50:47,600 --> 03:50:51,840
curious to know how squary this looks

4744
03:50:50,238 --> 03:50:54,000
over time

4745
03:50:51,840 --> 03:50:55,680
um

4746
03:50:54,000 --> 03:50:57,279
given that maybe this is actually kind

4747
03:50:55,680 --> 03:50:58,318
of buggy and not working properly it's

4748
03:50:57,279 --> 03:51:00,560
hard to say

4749
03:50:58,318 --> 03:51:00,559
but

4750
03:51:00,879 --> 03:51:05,920
let's give it a test so if we blur

4751
03:51:11,760 --> 03:51:17,199
i mean it's definitely

4752
03:51:14,879 --> 03:51:18,799
less squary

4753
03:51:17,199 --> 03:51:19,600
right

4754
03:51:18,799 --> 03:51:21,679
um

4755
03:51:19,600 --> 03:51:24,079
it's not perfect

4756
03:51:21,680 --> 03:51:26,318
but it's better

4757
03:51:24,079 --> 03:51:27,120
even without knowing if this is debugged

4758
03:51:26,318 --> 03:51:28,000
yet

4759
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:30,399
i

4760
03:51:28,000 --> 03:51:32,398
it's it's probably better if we're

4761
03:51:30,398 --> 03:51:34,799
honest about it right

4762
03:51:32,398 --> 03:51:38,000
um and let me go ahead and try

4763
03:51:34,799 --> 03:51:40,159
uh our little trick of you know instead

4764
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:43,159
of 16

4765
03:51:40,159 --> 03:51:43,159
um

4766
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:48,960
where is that

4767
03:51:46,478 --> 03:51:51,198
undo happening oh it's right there

4768
03:51:48,959 --> 03:51:52,959
uh let's try and

4769
03:51:51,199 --> 03:51:54,800
and set it up to something

4770
03:51:52,959 --> 03:51:57,799
um actually significantly higher than

4771
03:51:54,799 --> 03:51:57,799
that

4772
03:51:58,559 --> 03:52:02,278
and see what it looks like

4773
03:52:18,799 --> 03:52:23,198
so it's kind of hard to say but yeah

4774
03:52:21,600 --> 03:52:24,720
like i don't know

4775
03:52:23,199 --> 03:52:26,560
it's a little bit buggy because the

4776
03:52:24,719 --> 03:52:29,039
sphere is like

4777
03:52:26,559 --> 03:52:31,119
centered wrong like this is not i don't

4778
03:52:29,040 --> 03:52:33,439
think this is quite right

4779
03:52:31,120 --> 03:52:34,640
i guess is what i would say

4780
03:52:33,439 --> 03:52:37,120
um

4781
03:52:34,639 --> 03:52:41,549
so a little bit

4782
03:52:37,120 --> 03:52:43,760
uh wrong but it does look a lot circular

4783
03:52:41,549 --> 03:52:45,278
[Music]

4784
03:52:43,760 --> 03:52:45,880
right

4785
03:52:45,279 --> 03:52:47,120
um

4786
03:52:45,879 --> 03:52:49,599
[Music]

4787
03:52:47,120 --> 03:52:51,600
so i don't know maybe this is something

4788
03:52:49,600 --> 03:52:54,600
we should investigate

4789
03:52:51,600 --> 03:52:54,600
um

4790
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:58,800
it seems plausible that you would

4791
03:52:57,199 --> 03:52:59,840
actually want this

4792
03:52:58,799 --> 03:53:04,238
and

4793
03:52:59,840 --> 03:53:04,238
i don't know i'm not thrilled about it

4794
03:53:04,318 --> 03:53:07,439
but

4795
03:53:05,600 --> 03:53:10,559
uh if

4796
03:53:07,439 --> 03:53:12,559
if that's what we've got to do

4797
03:53:10,559 --> 03:53:14,238
that's what we've got to do and if we we

4798
03:53:12,559 --> 03:53:16,639
should probably go debug this code maybe

4799
03:53:14,238 --> 03:53:19,039
that's we'll do next weekend

4800
03:53:16,639 --> 03:53:20,879
uh debug this code and and see what the

4801
03:53:19,040 --> 03:53:23,840
quality is like because it just looks a

4802
03:53:20,879 --> 03:53:23,839
lot better

4803
03:53:26,559 --> 03:53:30,719
uh you know what i'm saying

4804
03:53:29,120 --> 03:53:32,720
um

4805
03:53:30,719 --> 03:53:34,318
so

4806
03:53:32,719 --> 03:53:36,000
and i'm pretty sure it's not right like

4807
03:53:34,318 --> 03:53:38,799
i'm pretty sure it's still got it's i'm

4808
03:53:36,000 --> 03:53:41,040
pretty sure it's still buggy actually

4809
03:53:38,799 --> 03:53:41,039
um

4810
03:53:48,159 --> 03:53:54,478
yeah like it's it's off in weird ways

4811
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:54,479
so it's it's not quite right

4812
03:53:56,478 --> 03:54:01,039
um so we'll have to go do some debugging

4813
03:53:59,040 --> 03:54:02,560
but it might be better

4814
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:05,840
um the only way we're gonna know is if

4815
03:54:02,559 --> 03:54:05,840
we debug it

4816
03:54:14,398 --> 03:54:19,119
just to make sure we're doing this right

4817
03:54:15,760 --> 03:54:22,159
here so the boxman x y and z is the

4818
03:54:19,120 --> 03:54:23,279
center x y and z

4819
03:54:22,159 --> 03:54:25,520
uh

4820
03:54:23,279 --> 03:54:27,840
the box max x

4821
03:54:25,520 --> 03:54:30,880
is the radius

4822
03:54:27,840 --> 03:54:33,840
that's what we expected

4823
03:54:30,879 --> 03:54:33,839
um

4824
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:40,399
and here

4825
03:54:45,279 --> 03:54:49,840
i mean like i said we do have the

4826
03:54:46,959 --> 03:54:52,159
problem of this could actually

4827
03:54:49,840 --> 03:54:52,159
um

4828
03:54:56,079 --> 03:55:00,600
this could actually be

4829
03:55:03,359 --> 03:55:08,079
just because

4830
03:55:04,959 --> 03:55:10,318
we're doing the cast wrong like i said

4831
03:55:08,079 --> 03:55:12,238
it's gonna be it's gonna

4832
03:55:10,318 --> 03:55:13,840
test it it's gonna hit the sphere

4833
03:55:12,238 --> 03:55:16,398
sometimes when something else should

4834
03:55:13,840 --> 03:55:17,680
have been hit first

4835
03:55:16,398 --> 03:55:19,198
um

4836
03:55:17,680 --> 03:55:21,279
and that could have really unpredictable

4837
03:55:19,199 --> 03:55:23,359
results so that's a huge problem and and

4838
03:55:21,279 --> 03:55:25,120
maybe this that makes this a non-starter

4839
03:55:23,359 --> 03:55:28,920
i don't know

4840
03:55:25,120 --> 03:55:28,920
um but

4841
03:55:49,680 --> 03:55:54,600
so the tmnt max getting selected

4842
03:56:09,760 --> 03:56:14,040
i mean it looks fine

4843
03:56:36,000 --> 03:56:39,639
this cool beat

4844
03:56:54,879 --> 03:56:57,879
hmm

4845
03:57:15,279 --> 03:57:20,520
i don't see a lot wrong with that um

4846
03:57:34,159 --> 03:57:37,199
that all just looks

4847
03:57:39,600 --> 03:57:46,439
uh good let's i i just try one thing

4848
03:57:43,199 --> 03:57:46,439
which is

4849
03:57:52,799 --> 03:57:56,920
like don't break

4850
03:58:02,719 --> 03:58:07,039
i guess i'm not sure how you would

4851
03:58:05,359 --> 03:58:09,279
the way the routine is structured i'd

4852
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:10,560
like to try it with letting it keep

4853
03:58:09,279 --> 03:58:14,840
going

4854
03:58:10,559 --> 03:58:18,920
so that you wouldn't s early out on

4855
03:58:14,840 --> 03:58:18,920
collisions um

4856
03:59:10,079 --> 03:59:14,079
i'm wondering if we shouldn't attach

4857
03:59:11,680 --> 03:59:16,960
this to the hero instead of the glove

4858
03:59:14,079 --> 03:59:19,600
since the glove sucks

4859
03:59:16,959 --> 03:59:21,839
and i don't have much

4860
03:59:19,600 --> 03:59:24,000
intention of actually writing controller

4861
03:59:21,840 --> 03:59:27,520
code

4862
03:59:24,000 --> 03:59:29,840
in the near future we could just say

4863
03:59:27,520 --> 03:59:29,840
like

4864
03:59:30,079 --> 03:59:33,799
yeah um

4865
03:59:41,199 --> 03:59:46,680
i don't know what this will do but we

4866
03:59:43,199 --> 03:59:46,680
can do it

4867
03:59:54,398 --> 03:59:57,358
so this adds like a head

4868
03:59:56,478 --> 03:59:59,358
light

4869
03:59:57,359 --> 04:00:03,159
as well um and we could just turn off

4870
03:59:59,359 --> 04:00:03,159
the glove light for now

4871
04:00:29,840 --> 04:00:34,199
so it's pretty hard to say

4872
04:00:44,639 --> 04:00:46,559
um

4873
04:00:45,600 --> 04:00:48,399
we're probably gonna have to put it off

4874
04:00:46,559 --> 04:00:50,559
till next time it's hard to say whether

4875
04:00:48,398 --> 04:00:52,478
that really is

4876
04:00:50,559 --> 04:00:54,719
it might be just correct

4877
04:00:52,478 --> 04:00:56,959
and that's just the fact that it's not

4878
04:00:54,719 --> 04:00:58,478
actually now it will not do the correct

4879
04:00:56,959 --> 04:01:00,478
first hit detection

4880
04:00:58,478 --> 04:01:03,599
it will hit the sphere sometimes if the

4881
04:01:00,478 --> 04:01:04,639
sphere happened to extend into that

4882
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:05,600
um

4883
04:01:04,639 --> 04:01:07,680
cell

4884
04:01:05,600 --> 04:01:08,880
and it will record it as having hit the

4885
04:01:07,680 --> 04:01:10,880
sphere when it really would have hit

4886
04:01:08,879 --> 04:01:13,438
something else first

4887
04:01:10,879 --> 04:01:15,198
and so it'd be hard to know if that was

4888
04:01:13,439 --> 04:01:16,479
happening or not without actually

4889
04:01:15,199 --> 04:01:18,000
instrumenting it

4890
04:01:16,478 --> 04:01:19,198
um

4891
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:20,079
more

4892
04:01:19,199 --> 04:01:22,720
right

4893
04:01:20,079 --> 04:01:25,199
so it's highly likely that that could

4894
04:01:22,719 --> 04:01:28,238
just be what's happening

4895
04:01:25,199 --> 04:01:28,239
what i will say is

4896
04:01:28,398 --> 04:01:32,879
i'm not sure it's good enough

4897
04:01:31,199 --> 04:01:38,040
it is better

4898
04:01:32,879 --> 04:01:38,039
i'm not sure it's enough better to care

4899
04:01:50,559 --> 04:01:54,879
why would we be having nans though

4900
04:01:55,439 --> 04:01:59,318
i don't think we are

4901
04:02:03,840 --> 04:02:08,000
why would we have that

4902
04:02:06,238 --> 04:02:10,398
i don't think we would

4903
04:02:08,000 --> 04:02:10,398
would we

4904
04:02:10,639 --> 04:02:16,959
um

4905
04:02:12,398 --> 04:02:20,079
right because so in order for the

4906
04:02:16,959 --> 04:02:20,079
in order for this

4907
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:27,359
oh

4908
04:02:24,959 --> 04:02:28,879
wait this is so

4909
04:02:27,359 --> 04:02:29,920
this is wrong

4910
04:02:28,879 --> 04:02:32,639
though

4911
04:02:29,920 --> 04:02:35,279
why are we doing this

4912
04:02:32,639 --> 04:02:36,799
did we cop cut and paste this code wrong

4913
04:02:35,279 --> 04:02:38,800
this is supposed to happen before the

4914
04:02:36,799 --> 04:02:41,840
square root

4915
04:02:38,799 --> 04:02:43,840
this is this is supposed to test

4916
04:02:41,840 --> 04:02:45,760
this thing so i agree

4917
04:02:43,840 --> 04:02:48,079
um i agree with you but that's not

4918
04:02:45,760 --> 04:02:51,199
what's supposed to be happening so the

4919
04:02:48,079 --> 04:02:54,799
root term is supposed to be that

4920
04:02:51,199 --> 04:02:57,840
right and then we only actually i guess

4921
04:02:54,799 --> 04:03:01,599
we just copy pasted that so th this

4922
04:02:57,840 --> 04:03:01,600
is supposed to have the mask

4923
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:07,760
right it's supposed to look like this

4924
04:03:08,398 --> 04:03:12,000
i'm glad you said that because yeah

4925
04:03:09,840 --> 04:03:14,639
that's not how that's supposed to work

4926
04:03:12,000 --> 04:03:16,959
right so the idea here is yes it's true

4927
04:03:14,639 --> 04:03:19,760
that this produces nands but they mask

4928
04:03:16,959 --> 04:03:22,000
out right but for some reason we were

4929
04:03:19,760 --> 04:03:23,439
testing

4930
04:03:22,000 --> 04:03:26,079
i don't know why we would do that

4931
04:03:23,439 --> 04:03:29,520
because you can't have that occur like

4932
04:03:26,079 --> 04:03:32,318
it's never going to be negative

4933
04:03:29,520 --> 04:03:33,920
um so that was wrong like this is what i

4934
04:03:32,318 --> 04:03:34,959
think you know what probably the problem

4935
04:03:33,920 --> 04:03:35,680
was

4936
04:03:34,959 --> 04:03:37,839
so

4937
04:03:35,680 --> 04:03:40,318
i imagine we could we probably know

4938
04:03:37,840 --> 04:03:41,600
exactly what the problem was

4939
04:03:40,318 --> 04:03:43,840
it's this

4940
04:03:41,600 --> 04:03:43,840
uh

4941
04:03:46,000 --> 04:03:49,359
no this is wrong wait no this code is

4942
04:03:48,000 --> 04:03:51,600
wrong

4943
04:03:49,359 --> 04:03:52,720
it should should right like it should be

4944
04:03:51,600 --> 04:03:55,760
doing

4945
04:03:52,719 --> 04:03:55,760
the test on this

4946
04:03:59,520 --> 04:04:04,920
so our old handmade ray really let us

4947
04:04:01,680 --> 04:04:04,920
down here

4948
04:04:23,439 --> 04:04:26,720
so i don't know what the heck was going

4949
04:04:25,040 --> 04:04:28,960
on there

4950
04:04:26,719 --> 04:04:28,959
um

4951
04:04:30,000 --> 04:04:33,920
i mean it's handmade ray which we don't

4952
04:04:32,238 --> 04:04:36,000
technically do like it was just a time

4953
04:04:33,920 --> 04:04:39,840
killer thing that we did

4954
04:04:36,000 --> 04:04:40,260
so okay but still

4955
04:04:39,840 --> 04:04:42,079
um

4956
04:04:40,260 --> 04:04:43,760
[Music]

4957
04:04:42,079 --> 04:04:45,600
that was not how that was supposed to

4958
04:04:43,760 --> 04:04:47,199
work uh i don't know that has anything

4959
04:04:45,600 --> 04:04:49,840
to do with the problems we were seeing

4960
04:04:47,199 --> 04:04:49,840
but it might

4961
04:05:00,159 --> 04:05:04,000
i like i don't know that that really

4962
04:05:01,840 --> 04:05:05,520
changed much but it might have right

4963
04:05:04,000 --> 04:05:08,478
because i don't know what exactly that

4964
04:05:05,520 --> 04:05:12,199
would have done it depends on how the

4965
04:05:08,478 --> 04:05:12,198
nan would have compared

4966
04:05:20,879 --> 04:05:23,679
yeah it does it actually does look like

4967
04:05:22,318 --> 04:05:26,318
that fixed

4968
04:05:23,680 --> 04:05:28,000
um at least some of the problem

4969
04:05:26,318 --> 04:05:32,318
right

4970
04:05:28,000 --> 04:05:34,799
so i would say i don't know it's

4971
04:05:32,318 --> 04:05:37,119
it's still kind of squary

4972
04:05:34,799 --> 04:05:37,119
um

4973
04:05:41,520 --> 04:05:46,640
let's raise the power a little bit of it

4974
04:05:45,359 --> 04:05:50,040
and see

4975
04:05:46,639 --> 04:05:50,039
what that does

4976
04:06:01,359 --> 04:06:04,359
hmm

4977
04:06:22,799 --> 04:06:29,109
so it's still a bit

4978
04:06:24,700 --> 04:06:29,110
[Music]

4979
04:06:38,840 --> 04:06:46,040
um i want to go ahead and take a

4980
04:06:42,238 --> 04:06:46,039
long sample here

4981
04:07:34,840 --> 04:07:40,559
so

4982
04:07:36,559 --> 04:07:41,359
that might i don't know it's hard to say

4983
04:07:40,559 --> 04:07:42,959
uh

4984
04:07:41,359 --> 04:07:44,640
because we're not really doing perfect

4985
04:07:42,959 --> 04:07:46,478
sphere intersection here right like it

4986
04:07:44,639 --> 04:07:48,478
could be that we need to actually do

4987
04:07:46,478 --> 04:07:50,639
this for intersections i mean the sphere

4988
04:07:48,478 --> 04:07:52,398
intersection computation is correct but

4989
04:07:50,639 --> 04:07:54,398
we're not uh

4990
04:07:52,398 --> 04:07:56,318
properly continuing the cast to make

4991
04:07:54,398 --> 04:07:58,158
sure that you actually hit the sphere so

4992
04:07:56,318 --> 04:08:00,719
it could still be some artifacts in

4993
04:07:58,158 --> 04:08:00,719
there but

4994
04:08:01,920 --> 04:08:08,478
at the moment anyway if that actually is

4995
04:08:05,760 --> 04:08:11,520
as good as it gets if that's not part of

4996
04:08:08,478 --> 04:08:13,679
the bug then that would mean that like

4997
04:08:11,520 --> 04:08:16,960
the rest of the squariness

4998
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:19,840
is just in our actual reconstruction

4999
04:08:16,959 --> 04:08:19,839
right

5000
04:08:20,639 --> 04:08:22,879
so

5001
04:08:24,639 --> 04:08:30,079
you know

5002
04:08:26,000 --> 04:08:32,719
um let's see what happens if we unsphere

5003
04:08:30,079 --> 04:08:34,158
does that do we what's the difference

5004
04:08:32,719 --> 04:08:36,959
like does it look

5005
04:08:34,158 --> 04:08:36,959
different or not

5006
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:40,720
so let's switch from spheres to not

5007
04:08:38,719 --> 04:08:44,119
spheres

5008
04:08:40,719 --> 04:08:44,119
what do we see

5009
04:08:57,840 --> 04:09:01,920
so it gets brighter which we would

5010
04:08:59,439 --> 04:09:03,920
expect because the volume is larger and

5011
04:09:01,920 --> 04:09:07,520
we don't currently divide the intensity

5012
04:09:03,920 --> 04:09:10,520
by the volume which we probably should

5013
04:09:07,520 --> 04:09:10,520
um

5014
04:09:16,719 --> 04:09:20,318
is it more square

5015
04:09:21,040 --> 04:09:24,600
i mean probably

5016
04:09:30,959 --> 04:09:34,318
it's not being clipped to the voxel why

5017
04:09:33,120 --> 04:09:37,479
why are you saying it's being clipped to

5018
04:09:34,318 --> 04:09:37,478
the voxel

5019
04:09:44,000 --> 04:09:49,120
it's not being clipped to the voxel

5020
04:09:45,600 --> 04:09:49,120
nothing's getting clipped to the voxel

5021
04:09:54,840 --> 04:09:58,920
um um

5022
04:10:15,680 --> 04:10:20,158
so i don't know um it might be worth

5023
04:10:18,238 --> 04:10:21,600
keeping it might not be i really

5024
04:10:20,158 --> 04:10:22,840
couldn't say

5025
04:10:21,600 --> 04:10:26,158
that's a tough

5026
04:10:22,840 --> 04:10:26,158
one um

5027
04:10:26,719 --> 04:10:32,639
it may what it may mean is we have to go

5028
04:10:29,600 --> 04:10:34,479
look at our at fixing our

5029
04:10:32,639 --> 04:10:36,719
reconstruction

5030
04:10:34,478 --> 04:10:40,478
a little bit better

5031
04:10:36,719 --> 04:10:42,719
um and if we fix our reconstruction a

5032
04:10:40,478 --> 04:10:44,959
little bit better

5033
04:10:42,719 --> 04:10:46,398
then compare the differences

5034
04:10:44,959 --> 04:10:48,238
uh

5035
04:10:46,398 --> 04:10:48,840
right

5036
04:10:48,238 --> 04:10:50,959
so

5037
04:10:48,840 --> 04:10:52,559
[Music]

5038
04:10:50,959 --> 04:10:54,158
yeah i mean

5039
04:10:52,559 --> 04:10:54,959
i don't know i think we just have to

5040
04:10:54,158 --> 04:10:56,559
probably just play with the

5041
04:10:54,959 --> 04:10:58,478
interpolation and see

5042
04:10:56,559 --> 04:11:00,559
uh

5043
04:10:58,478 --> 04:11:03,358
we could also try writing direct values

5044
04:11:00,559 --> 04:11:07,439
in to the instead of doing it seeing

5045
04:11:03,359 --> 04:11:07,439
what the interpolation reproduces like

5046
04:11:12,719 --> 04:11:17,478
but yeah beyond that i don't really have

5047
04:11:14,238 --> 04:11:17,478
a lot of ideas

5048
04:11:24,639 --> 04:11:29,439
beyond that i don't think i've got any

5049
04:11:26,559 --> 04:11:30,398
more bright ideas

5050
04:11:29,439 --> 04:11:32,398
so

5051
04:11:30,398 --> 04:11:35,278
i i think that's probably our next

5052
04:11:32,398 --> 04:11:37,039
week's plan then folks

5053
04:11:35,279 --> 04:11:38,238
is to take a look at that what time is

5054
04:11:37,040 --> 04:11:40,319
it

5055
04:11:38,238 --> 04:11:42,559
it's 4 30.

5056
04:11:40,318 --> 04:11:42,559
um

5057
04:11:44,079 --> 04:11:49,680
so yeah i mean i think it's probably

5058
04:11:47,199 --> 04:11:50,960
pretty good here it would be nice to get

5059
04:11:49,680 --> 04:11:53,600
the cool

5060
04:11:50,959 --> 04:11:54,799
get the speed the raycasting speed up a

5061
04:11:53,600 --> 04:11:56,640
little bit

5062
04:11:54,799 --> 04:11:59,039
um there's a little more of a trail

5063
04:11:56,639 --> 04:12:03,799
there than we probably want

5064
04:11:59,040 --> 04:12:03,800
so like you know

5065
04:12:13,199 --> 04:12:16,399
i think we probably want to try to get

5066
04:12:15,040 --> 04:12:18,159
this

5067
04:12:16,398 --> 04:12:21,039
up

5068
04:12:18,158 --> 04:12:23,279
maybe to like 20

5069
04:12:21,040 --> 04:12:25,600
if we could

5070
04:12:23,279 --> 04:12:25,600
um

5071
04:12:26,639 --> 04:12:31,079
you know maybe to something like this

5072
04:12:31,359 --> 04:12:36,238
because that's pretty locked on not a

5073
04:12:33,920 --> 04:12:40,920
lot of blur there but

5074
04:12:36,238 --> 04:12:40,920
down by 10 was a little bit worse

5075
04:12:46,238 --> 04:12:49,840
um so hard to say

5076
04:12:48,238 --> 04:12:51,039
you know

5077
04:12:49,840 --> 04:12:53,760
hard to say

5078
04:12:51,040 --> 04:12:55,600
uh but it does seem like 12 is

5079
04:12:53,760 --> 04:12:57,600
12 out of 60 is about as good as we can

5080
04:12:55,600 --> 04:12:59,439
do right now in terms of flicker free

5081
04:12:57,600 --> 04:13:00,720
moving it to the gpu might help a lot

5082
04:12:59,439 --> 04:13:01,020
but

5083
04:13:00,719 --> 04:13:03,840
um

5084
04:13:01,020 --> 04:13:05,760
[Music]

5085
04:13:03,840 --> 04:13:07,680
it seems like we have a frame of lag

5086
04:13:05,760 --> 04:13:09,359
there whether we like it or not because

5087
04:13:07,680 --> 04:13:11,279
of the fact that the values from the

5088
04:13:09,359 --> 04:13:12,960
last frame are used

5089
04:13:11,279 --> 04:13:16,399
for the um

5090
04:13:12,959 --> 04:13:16,398
for the light samples right

5091
04:13:16,799 --> 04:13:21,759
so that's a separate issue as well

5092
04:13:19,760 --> 04:13:24,000
because this is without any temporal

5093
04:13:21,760 --> 04:13:28,238
blur and you see you get

5094
04:13:24,000 --> 04:13:28,238
you still get a little right um

5095
04:13:28,478 --> 04:13:30,719
so

5096
04:13:35,680 --> 04:13:40,318
and i assume that's what that's from i

5097
04:13:37,040 --> 04:13:41,520
guess i don't know

5098
04:13:40,318 --> 04:13:43,760
you know maybe that's not what that's

5099
04:13:41,520 --> 04:13:43,760
from

5100
04:13:43,840 --> 04:13:46,478
we should probably have something that

5101
04:13:45,279 --> 04:13:47,520
moves

5102
04:13:46,478 --> 04:13:49,039
like

5103
04:13:47,520 --> 04:13:50,880
smoothly

5104
04:13:49,040 --> 04:13:52,319
that's just like a thing we should

5105
04:13:50,879 --> 04:13:53,759
probably create a little entity that's

5106
04:13:52,318 --> 04:13:55,840
just like a light

5107
04:13:53,760 --> 04:13:59,120
that moves around

5108
04:13:55,840 --> 04:14:01,040
um in like a really like consistent way

5109
04:13:59,120 --> 04:14:02,960
so that we can analyze some of this

5110
04:14:01,040 --> 04:14:05,199
stuff a little bit better

5111
04:14:02,959 --> 04:14:05,198
but

5112
04:14:05,680 --> 04:14:09,840
at the moment anyway i don't know

5113
04:14:19,279 --> 04:14:23,359
i don't know

5114
04:14:20,478 --> 04:14:25,119
we're very close to lighting that i

5115
04:14:23,359 --> 04:14:27,920
would say is like yes

5116
04:14:25,120 --> 04:14:28,960
ship it uh but it's still just not quite

5117
04:14:27,920 --> 04:14:31,199
there

5118
04:14:28,959 --> 04:14:32,719
for certain cases

5119
04:14:31,199 --> 04:14:34,000
and

5120
04:14:32,719 --> 04:14:37,639
i don't

5121
04:14:34,000 --> 04:14:37,639
really know

5122
04:14:37,920 --> 04:14:40,238
um

5123
04:14:41,600 --> 04:14:46,040
what approach i think we want

5124
04:14:58,158 --> 04:15:01,158
um

5125
04:15:15,520 --> 04:15:20,079
i mean it's probably good enough as it

5126
04:15:17,680 --> 04:15:21,279
is but

5127
04:15:20,079 --> 04:15:23,039
i don't know

5128
04:15:21,279 --> 04:15:25,600
so fixing the interpolation to be less

5129
04:15:23,040 --> 04:15:27,199
square definitely a thing that we would

5130
04:15:25,600 --> 04:15:28,640
like uh

5131
04:15:27,199 --> 04:15:31,279
whether or not that gets us all the way

5132
04:15:28,639 --> 04:15:33,278
there though i don't know

5133
04:15:31,279 --> 04:15:37,359
and i also just don't fundamentally know

5134
04:15:33,279 --> 04:15:37,359
whether the circles make a difference

5135
04:15:44,879 --> 04:15:48,639
i i'm i'm kind of guessing they sort of

5136
04:15:47,120 --> 04:15:50,319
don't

5137
04:15:48,639 --> 04:15:53,119
like it's just hey it happens to be

5138
04:15:50,318 --> 04:15:55,680
brighter so the effect is worse

5139
04:15:53,120 --> 04:15:58,319
because it's got more volume but i don't

5140
04:15:55,680 --> 04:16:01,318
know that it actually matters

5141
04:15:58,318 --> 04:16:01,318
so

5142
04:16:06,639 --> 04:16:10,639
so we'll see

5143
04:16:08,000 --> 04:16:12,318
i think that's it for today either way

5144
04:16:10,639 --> 04:16:14,959
um

5145
04:16:12,318 --> 04:16:17,039
thanks everyone for joining me

5146
04:16:14,959 --> 04:16:19,358
i will be back here

5147
04:16:17,040 --> 04:16:19,359
um

5148
04:16:19,439 --> 04:16:23,840
i will be back here tomorrow

5149
04:16:21,920 --> 04:16:24,799
is what i will do

5150
04:16:23,840 --> 04:16:26,478
um

5151
04:16:24,799 --> 04:16:29,478
no i won't i'll be back here next

5152
04:16:26,478 --> 04:16:29,478
weekend

5153
04:16:30,959 --> 04:16:35,759
i don't know fire i need to stop using

5154
04:16:33,120 --> 04:16:35,760
firefox

5155
04:16:37,199 --> 04:16:40,720
um

5156
04:16:38,639 --> 04:16:42,238
anyway uh i don't know what we'll do

5157
04:16:40,719 --> 04:16:43,198
we'll install a new web browser is what

5158
04:16:42,238 --> 04:16:44,398
we'll do

5159
04:16:43,199 --> 04:16:46,079
um

5160
04:16:44,398 --> 04:16:49,039
i'll be back here next weekend in the

5161
04:16:46,079 --> 04:16:51,039
meantime i did want to mention to anyone

5162
04:16:49,040 --> 04:16:53,520
who likes movies

5163
04:16:51,040 --> 04:16:55,680
uh anna and i are doing a new thing on

5164
04:16:53,520 --> 04:16:57,040
substance that you can go to if you want

5165
04:16:55,680 --> 04:16:59,199
to

5166
04:16:57,040 --> 04:17:02,000
so i thought i'd mention it

5167
04:16:59,199 --> 04:17:03,520
i it's just cause we didn't feel like

5168
04:17:02,000 --> 04:17:05,279
like we always like to discuss movies

5169
04:17:03,520 --> 04:17:06,880
and stuff and we didn't

5170
04:17:05,279 --> 04:17:10,479
feel like there was a good thing for

5171
04:17:06,879 --> 04:17:11,759
movie discussions so we made one uh it's

5172
04:17:10,478 --> 04:17:13,519
pretty easy to get to it's just molly

5173
04:17:11,760 --> 04:17:15,279
movie club

5174
04:17:13,520 --> 04:17:16,399
and so if you want to check that out

5175
04:17:15,279 --> 04:17:18,399
that's another thing you can check out

5176
04:17:16,398 --> 04:17:20,158
besides handmade hero

5177
04:17:18,398 --> 04:17:21,920
if you if you just need more molly

5178
04:17:20,158 --> 04:17:24,799
rocket stuff in your life it's over

5179
04:17:21,920 --> 04:17:27,439
there

5180
04:17:24,799 --> 04:17:27,619
i'll be back here next weekend

5181
04:17:27,439 --> 04:17:29,199
to

5182
04:17:27,620 --> 04:17:30,560
[Music]

5183
04:17:29,199 --> 04:17:32,479
i guess we just gotta have to make a

5184
04:17:30,559 --> 04:17:35,198
judgment call maybe we just look at

5185
04:17:32,478 --> 04:17:37,119
interpolation quality at that point

5186
04:17:35,199 --> 04:17:39,120
um

5187
04:17:37,120 --> 04:17:41,100
because maybe that's really just what

5188
04:17:39,120 --> 04:17:42,960
it's about i don't know i

5189
04:17:41,100 --> 04:17:44,158
[Music]

5190
04:17:42,959 --> 04:17:45,599
i

5191
04:17:44,158 --> 04:17:47,760
maybe we'll have some thoughts during

5192
04:17:45,600 --> 04:17:50,479
the week you know about what we want to

5193
04:17:47,760 --> 04:17:52,880
do i'm not really 100 sure

5194
04:17:50,478 --> 04:17:55,119
all i would say is that's where we're

5195
04:17:52,879 --> 04:17:56,238
headed we're almost there it looks

5196
04:17:55,120 --> 04:17:57,680
really good

5197
04:17:56,238 --> 04:17:59,119
uh but it might be able to look a little

5198
04:17:57,680 --> 04:18:00,238
bit better

5199
04:17:59,120 --> 04:18:01,680
if we

5200
04:18:00,238 --> 04:18:03,279
change some things around so we'll have

5201
04:18:01,680 --> 04:18:04,960
to take a look

5202
04:18:03,279 --> 04:18:07,040
that's it for today everybody thanks for

5203
04:18:04,959 --> 04:18:08,559
joining me i will catch you all back

5204
04:18:07,040 --> 04:18:09,920
here next weekend until then have fun

5205
04:18:08,559 --> 04:18:11,119
programming and i'll see you on the

5206
04:18:09,920 --> 04:18:14,398
internet

5207
04:18:11,120 --> 04:18:14,399
take it easy everybody
