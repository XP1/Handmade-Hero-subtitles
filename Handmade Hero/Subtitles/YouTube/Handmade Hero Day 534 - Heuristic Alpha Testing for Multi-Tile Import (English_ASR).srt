00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,388
hello everybody and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:08,419
here oh sure we could a complete game

3
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:12,178
live on stream I have updated the github

4
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:18,210
with an issue list that we can turn over

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,948
to Anna to fix the art and this I think

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,850
was a important thing because you know

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,350
she just gives us art assets and at some

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,650
point we should just move the game over

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,420
to her machine so she can run it to and

10
00:00:27,649 --> 00:00:32,640
work on things herself but in the

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,989
meantime when we discover errors we

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,308
didn't really have any way to log them

13
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:36,689
and so they never really had a way to

14
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,488
get fixed because if an artist has to

15
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,709
fix them but we're the people who find

16
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:43,169
them we need some communication channel

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,939
there and so what I did is I just used

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,379
the issue list that we had on github

19
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:49,890
since we went through the trouble of

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:51,750
setting up a github these issues marked

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,759
with art on the side should be easy

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,730
enough for her to just go like this and

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,358
see just specifically what the art

24
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:03,419
problems are so far and that way we can

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,180
just like kick those over and have them

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,829
fixed sort of asynchronously and then we

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,150
can update the art assets so I went

28
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,150
ahead and did that these are the ones

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,250
that I remember us encountering on the

30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,359
stream I added them in there if anyone

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,728
can think of any that we did not list

32
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,560
here that we've seen feel free to add

33
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,688
them yourself if you're on the github or

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,549
just mention it in the chat and all add

35
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:32,789
them when we get to the Q&amp;A today so I

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,700
will with with that in mind I will get

37
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:42,170
started on what we're doing now if I

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:46,560
recall correctly we stopped yesterday on

39
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,240
what I think well it's it's either a bug

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,460
or a missing feature let's put it that

41
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:55,408
way we have a particular art asset and I

42
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:58,019
will show you the art asset for those of

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,000
you just joining us we have a particular

44
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:07,590
art asset that at least looks reasonable

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,360
in the in like a viewer right and we

46
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,780
look at this and we we looked at it

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,250
lined up with a template as well and we

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,110
just you know

49
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,878
look to see whether or not this thing

50
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,519
had anything in other squares and it

51
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,859
doesn't it's just these four squares of

52
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,450
import four different directions of the

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,180
flour now they go in the wrong order I

54
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:33,000
already found a bug on that but

55
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,219
regardless only four tiles should have

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,438
been extracted from this 4x4 but what we

57
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:41,098
actually saw when we look is that six

58
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:45,289
tiles were being extracted from the 4x4

59
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:47,729
and so something has gone wrong here

60
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:49,078
either when I said either it's a bug or

61
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:52,798
missing feature what I meant by that was

62
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:56,730
either there's a bug and the bug is that

63
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:59,219
we're Rowan ously determining through

64
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,590
some you know slip-up in the code that

65
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:03,780
there's actually content in cells that

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,030
don't have any content so that's an

67
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,989
obvious bug and we would need to figure

68
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:12,359
out what's happening there right or the

69
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,959
other option is that actually this file

70
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:18,689
does have some really like alpha of you

71
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,870
know one out of 255 or something in

72
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:24,810
these squares and if that's the case

73
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,609
then it's a missing feature because what

74
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,289
we would probably want to do is we we

75
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:31,769
probably don't want to require the

76
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:33,568
artist to be so diligent about cleaning

77
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,629
up squares that have nothing in them

78
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:38,578
that they can't have what is essentially

79
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:40,739
invisible alpha m'm so we would probably

80
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:42,900
want to do a thing that thresholds a

81
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,750
square and says look if we don't see

82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,158
anything any pixels higher than like 16

83
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,750
out of 256 and maybe even more stringent

84
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,750
than that we might even say look we want

85
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,818
to see at least 64 different pixels all

86
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,680
of which have more than this or

87
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:00,719
something right you know we might want

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,949
to have some kind of a metric that's

89
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:08,039
like like you know like given the size

90
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,269
of the square that we find we want to

91
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,459
make sure that the number of pixels we

92
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,039
counted with some reasonable proportion

93
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,548
of that Square had more than like a

94
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,839
nominal alpha you know what I mean um

95
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,228
and so that's why I mean I'm missing

96
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,908
feature is that if it turns out is not a

97
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:26,848
bug and the codes actually doing what we

98
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,389
told it to do it still it probably needs

99
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:29,788
some

100
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,090
improvement so that we don't have to

101
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:35,310
have such a person tickity you know I

102
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:38,938
don't want to have to constantly raid

103
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,949
bugs back to the to the art and say oh

104
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:41,789
go clean up this square that doesn't

105
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,680
even look like icing in there like

106
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:44,938
that's just annoying it's annoying for

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,860
everybody it's annoying for me it's

108
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,020
annoying for the artist nobody wants

109
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,968
that so we can fix that type of thing in

110
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,818
the code using a little bit of like

111
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:56,069
fuzzy detection so we should so the

112
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,810
first thing I want to do is is determine

113
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:00,240
which of those two things is going on or

114
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,639
if it's or mysterious category 3 which

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,110
is some other bug in the art pipeline is

116
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,180
just seriously creating those things

117
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,569
right we I mean there could be that too

118
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,968
there could be a reason that we're

119
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:15,360
getting six is due to some something I

120
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:16,468
have not contemplated so we need to

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,879
figure out which of those three things

122
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:19,740
is going on and that's the first thing

123
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:22,379
I'm going to do I think what I'd like to

124
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,129
do here is say look we can load this

125
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:29,658
thing in an external sort of way and

126
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:33,240
look at what the Alpha is in each square

127
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:37,079
or something like that and then you know

128
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,418
give us some idea of what's going on now

129
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:43,019
I think that the easiest way to do that

130
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:47,189
would be to say look we've got right you

131
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:49,588
know we actually have a little art a PNG

132
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:53,038
like like contester thing right like

133
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:54,509
this test PNG thing still compiles if I

134
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,000
remember correctly I guess I don't

135
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:59,338
really know if that's Yeah right here we

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,680
still compiled our little test PNG here

137
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:10,709
and that test PNG allows us to yeah it

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,129
allows us to load one image in and then

139
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:18,448
write out a bunch of images like the RGB

140
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:20,278
in the Alpha so what I can do there is I

141
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,169
can have something that writes out an

142
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:25,139
alpha bitmap that's like let's say like

143
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:27,478
thresholded right so if I want to I

144
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,150
could take and anywhere that there was

145
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,620
alpha I could if there was any off at

146
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,468
all I mean if it's just if it's non zero

147
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,978
I could write it as full white you know

148
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:41,288
what I mean and then that would show me

149
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:46,240
anywhere that there was any possibility

150
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:48,269
of detection of the image so let's do

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,269
that

152
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:59,348
all right so in here you can see we have

153
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:03,038
the art count here and we do these right

154
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:08,468
outs with this repple a I'm gonna do a

155
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:12,418
pixel op threshold a-and I'm gonna

156
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:16,680
introduce one of those up here which is

157
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:27,668
threshold a when this gets written out I

158
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:29,619
will test it like this and down inside

159
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:33,668
the code what we'll do is after

160
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:35,289
everything is done right where we do the

161
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:36,930
replicate alpha and all that stuff well

162
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:40,329
I guess actually probably do it earlier

163
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,088
here where we do mol alpha and repple

164
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:53,800
alpha right before that I think what

165
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:57,069
I'll do is do if Thresh that's great

166
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,180
don't ask me how I type that in there we

167
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,919
go

168
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,959
what I'm gonna do is just say all right

169
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,338
every time we get that let's go ahead

170
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,338
and do a Thresh a on it

171
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:13,028
and that'll just be something that we

172
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:16,808
have I guess we put these in a sort of a

173
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:19,749
you know reusable section here I don't

174
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:22,689
really I I don't think I actually want

175
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:26,709
that to be the case so probably what

176
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:30,129
I'll do is I think I'll take this code

177
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:34,469
here and I'll put that I'll just put the

178
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:38,079
threshold version in here the rest shelf

179
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:40,419
do it like that and what we'll do is

180
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:42,908
we'll threshold the Alpha by extracting

181
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:45,549
it so the same way we're doing it here

182
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:47,259
we don't actually need to extract the RG

183
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:48,519
and be here right because we're not

184
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:51,278
actually going to use them differently

185
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,250
so we only really need to extract the

186
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,970
Alpha like so and then what we want to

187
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,059
do is

188
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,300
if the Alpha is anything at all

189
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:02,889
besides zero then it equals full alpha

190
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:06,699
so we're just gonna threshold it

191
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:09,610
directly up to one then when we reset

192
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,300
this we just need to combine it with the

193
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,879
original like so but remember the

194
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:21,189
original potentially has some alpha in

195
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:24,519
it so we could you know do that to mask

196
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:28,060
it off but remember the only thing we're

197
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,429
doing here is thresholding it so really

198
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:33,069
we don't even have to do that because

199
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:35,229
whatever the high bits were of see that

200
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,270
where the alpha we're just gonna either

201
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,779
leave them the same in which case the or

202
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:42,460
does nothing or rob them with FF in

203
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,879
which case we don't care what they were

204
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,940
they all get set to one so really this

205
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,230
is all we needed to do there isn't

206
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,990
anything else to it

207
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,539
so I think that's it now if we want to

208
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,490
do a threshold of the Alpha in theory

209
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:00,699
now that we've recompiled test up P and

210
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,250
G I should be able to do that let's go

211
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,460
ahead and try it so if I go ahead and

212
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,269
load out of handmade sources based game

213
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:14,759
art that I believe was item hat oh three

214
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:20,500
so here I can do you know just W temp

215
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:23,769
hat three RGB bitmap W temp hat three

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,539
alpha dot bitmap and in theory we should

217
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:32,590
get something that we can view now right

218
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:34,719
so here's the RGB from the Hat and you

219
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,840
know that looks about right and hey that

220
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,889
looks pretty suspicious there doesn't it

221
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:44,320
and then here's the alpha from the Hat

222
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:48,159
what it looks like to me so it looks

223
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,860
like the Alpha is actually clean meaning

224
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,509
I don't see anything in there right you

225
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,060
can see that this did threshold it right

226
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,960
all of these parts that were previously

227
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:59,399
fuzzed

228
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,490
are not fuzz anymore but the RGB is

229
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,829
there right there's some some RGB

230
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,060
happening like right here there doesn't

231
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,590
seem to be any in any of the other

232
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:11,289
places so I'm not sure

233
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:15,129
about that but at least that tile does

234
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:18,789
have them um so what I'd like to do is

235
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:21,549
say let's go check to see where that

236
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:24,639
data actually was coming like what I

237
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:27,939
suspect we probably have is that alpha

238
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:34,149
channel is probably set to not actually

239
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:38,050
be there so it's eliminating the image

240
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:41,740
but the RGB that's there is getting

241
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:47,379
detected as valid right so inside import

242
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:49,930
if I if I go in here and let's see we've

243
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:53,620
got no I don't need a right image that's

244
00:11:49,929 --> 00:12:01,809
this right here probably so that's down

245
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:03,580
sample process multi tile so this is the

246
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:07,589
detection code to see whether or not

247
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:11,830
we're going to extract one of these and

248
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:14,680
inside here you can see that we are just

249
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,610
looking at only the Alpha as far as I

250
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,609
can tell right

251
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:31,980
at least yeah I mean so this is looping

252
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:36,269
over it right here you can see it it's

253
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:48,089
using min and Max looping over the alpha

254
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:50,309
like so so that seems fine meaning it

255
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:54,350
doesn't look like we're using the RGB at

256
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:54,349
all there right

257
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:13,840
so I'm not sure I don't know why we are

258
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:17,019
having that issue

259
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,019
[Music]

260
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,859
hmm so I'm gonna have to step through

261
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:24,659
this code because it looks like I mean

262
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:35,850
just from doing this analysis I don't

263
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:38,129
see I don't see any reason why we would

264
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,129
be picking that up even though there is

265
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:45,929
some there to be picked up in the square

266
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:58,799
that we picked up the alpha value is not

267
00:13:45,929 --> 00:14:00,208
there isn't alpha there so there isn't

268
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,609
alpha there so I don't really know

269
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,989
that's that's a tough one because you

270
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,470
would think I mean based on the

271
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,850
pathology of the bug it seems like what

272
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:15,240
I would have expected to see here is

273
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:17,430
testing sorce by itself right and then

274
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:23,909
you would have seen something where the

275
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:27,568
RGB values got you know where what what

276
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:30,000
was triggering the the indication that

277
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:37,698
there was something in the grid cell so

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,698
I don't know about that and hmm

279
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:51,819
I think I'm just gonna have to step

280
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:54,079
through because that that's really my

281
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,370
that's all I've got I don't have it I

282
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:02,210
don't have another theory that comes to

283
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:08,539
mind looking at if I open this up with

284
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:19,759
the the jimp here we go

285
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:23,449
and I take this is the that the item

286
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:31,179
overlay so I can see exactly what's

287
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:31,180
going on in terms of grid squares

288
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,309
there's that overlay I'm going to change

289
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:43,909
this to multiply so that you can see

290
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:50,000
through it or I'm going to try it there

291
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:51,919
it is so you can see here that these all

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,159
lie entirely within the grid squares

293
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,289
except for this one this is this other

294
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:01,370
square that was getting exported however

295
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:03,230
I will admit there was one other square

296
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,330
that did get exported and it's not

297
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,659
showing up here so it is true that

298
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,520
really I guess even this I shouldn't

299
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:14,029
have really expected because there isn't

300
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:17,059
any indication of why the other grid

301
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:20,209
square would have gone out just if you

302
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:32,799
bear with me for a second here if I load

303
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:32,800
up tab view so inside the

304
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:44,460
inside the base game and we look at the

305
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:50,779
asset listing so you know when we

306
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:54,030
imported the item list there here it is

307
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:57,360
when you look at what we're seeing for

308
00:16:54,029 --> 00:17:04,889
import lists you know the the import

309
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:09,380
list for it here we go

310
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:13,950
so you can see that to 0 to 1 to 2 to 3

311
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:18,180
which is here here here and here

312
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:22,110
that's this row and that's correct

313
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:24,480
to 1 which is this line here that's this

314
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:26,339
square and that would have been a dead

315
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,779
giveaway and I would have expected to

316
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,919
find while I looked and you know would

317
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:33,299
have expected to find that to be the

318
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:36,080
case but it is true that 3 3 is also

319
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:40,049
marked as having something in it and

320
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,240
that doesn't have any indication of why

321
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:44,369
there would be something there looking

322
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,769
back here you can see like there's

323
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:51,359
nothing there's nothing in it right so I

324
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:54,349
guess I'd have to admit my theory just

325
00:17:51,359 --> 00:18:00,119
isn't very good anyway because why would

326
00:17:54,349 --> 00:18:02,639
fixing this fix the the lower corner so

327
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:05,489
something else is still wrong somehow

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,810
this piece of code is getting tripped up

329
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:11,789
and I'm not exactly sure how

330
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,069
looking at the image width and height

331
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:18,119
here I'm assuming these are all set

332
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:22,519
reasonably but I don't know maybe

333
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,519
there's some kind of a padding problem

334
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:32,639
but I don't think we even store a stride

335
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:34,079
for these so none of the code would work

336
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,009
properly if there was some kind of a

337
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,799
padding problem so I've got nothing so I

338
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:42,720
think what we're gonna have to do now is

339
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:45,809
I'm going to have to force process multi

340
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,910
tile import to get called and I'm gonna

341
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:52,669
have to force it to get called on

342
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:55,970
this particular file so that we can look

343
00:18:52,670 --> 00:19:06,259
and see what actually is going on now

344
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:09,589
it's possible just looking at it I might

345
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:13,069
be able to cheese out and do the

346
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:17,869
following don't I'm not gonna promise

347
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:19,669
that I can but I'm gonna try because if

348
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:22,849
I can this will be an easier way to

349
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:26,720
debug it if we copy process multi file

350
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:28,909
multi tail import in here and we get rid

351
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:35,120
of all of this other stuff so we're only

352
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:39,019
saying here is the image like this we

353
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:41,989
should be able to run this again if we

354
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:43,609
know that this is always these these are

355
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,509
rate counts here I think they're set to

356
00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:49,849
sixteen by sixteen normally right and

357
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:51,890
then you know all of this stuff I mean

358
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:54,859
this can just be a printf right because

359
00:19:51,890 --> 00:20:01,790
this is a routine that you know just

360
00:19:54,859 --> 00:20:05,419
just print stuff out so if I'm lucky I

361
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:08,509
may be able to just run this directly in

362
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,660
the PNG importer and have it tell me

363
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:16,029
what it thinks is going on when we do

364
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:19,220
this nonsense here

365
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:22,220
it doesn't require any access to the art

366
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:27,410
asset system so in theory all of this

367
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:32,059
stuff can still happen and yeah I think

368
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:34,040
we're I think we're good to go so this

369
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,750
way I can debug it in a nice controlled

370
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,819
environment that doesn't involve us

371
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,069
having to run anything else it'll also

372
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:42,259
allow me to verify it externally so that

373
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:45,730
then we could see well hey if it doesn't

374
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:48,710
fail here maybe it's some other problem

375
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,579
deeper into the art system that we

376
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,470
should know about

377
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:53,299
so I don't care about any of this

378
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,000
because we don't need to know any of

379
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:59,180
this so really all that has to happen is

380
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,079
now I just have to say whether or not we

381
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,788
would have extracted this tile

382
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,490
right because we you know if we got in

383
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:09,009
here we would have done so and so then

384
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:19,528
what we want to say is these this stuff

385
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:23,558
here is the the extraction so it's like

386
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:26,980
that I think and then I could just

387
00:21:23,558 --> 00:21:29,918
literally keep this math as it was being

388
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,220
done pret previously and then get rid of

389
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,250
all of this so this would tell me you

390
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,899
know exactly what happened in theory I

391
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,308
can just compile it I don't think

392
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:42,369
there's anything that it depends on it

393
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:46,658
all right so now I could just call

394
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:48,239
process multi tile import or maybe we'll

395
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:50,559
call it test of all types I'll import

396
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,919
and so then here when we're actually

397
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:56,470
doing after we do the load we can do the

398
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,049
test and we just pass this image and

399
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,509
that's it right and that should do it

400
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:05,950
so now if I come back and rerun this

401
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:07,450
line of code this test PNG line I should

402
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,620
be able to see what it thought it was

403
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,620
extracting right and so you can see that

404
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:17,829
this is great I'm this is fantastic you

405
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:19,778
can see that it does actually do six

406
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:24,359
extractions that means the bug does

407
00:22:19,778 --> 00:22:28,558
reproduce outside of the art pipeline

408
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:34,388
which should give us all we really need

409
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:36,158
you know I'm saying okay so I guess the

410
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:40,148
next question is how do we want to debug

411
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:43,059
this first of all I think the extraction

412
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:45,250
code should probably have in it which X

413
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:48,038
index and Y index it was actually doing

414
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,638
so maybe something like this where we

415
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:55,230
can say all right X index Y index that

416
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:59,439
way we can get some sort of a you know

417
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:01,720
easy for us to understand and it would

418
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,840
also match what's in the tab view just

419
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,970
so we can see which one's the wrong one

420
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:10,298
so if we look here we know that that's

421
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:14,009
correct these are correct and then this

422
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:15,970
and this are wrong you know I'm saying

423
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:19,359
now if you look at where

424
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,490
these are they are tiny right there

425
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,500
they're very small I will print out the

426
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,528
dimensions here as well

427
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:30,548
so if I did I do we have I think we've

428
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:32,319
got a rectangle - I think that has a

429
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:33,940
bunch of stuff in it that we might want

430
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,908
there as well although those are floats

431
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,159
I don't know if we do a rectangle - I we

432
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:41,169
do so we could do one of these rectangle

433
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:44,500
two eyes here I don't know if we've got

434
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:49,690
to get dim for it it looks like we don't

435
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:53,378
so yeah less useful anyway

436
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:57,690
maybe we shouldn't make one let's

437
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:57,689
actually make this rectangle - I hear

438
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,659
guess maybe I'll do it this way

439
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:23,428
there's the min on both here's the max

440
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:23,428
on both oops that's no good

441
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:37,190
and now we can just do extract-min X

442
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,190
stretch and Y stretch max X expect X Y

443
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:49,620
and now I can print out some size

444
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:53,250
information so here we can do extract

445
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:58,288
max X - extract min X and extract max Y

446
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:59,819
- extract min Y and that I just wanted

447
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:03,450
so I don't have to do that math in my

448
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:07,139
head so what you can see is these are

449
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:12,870
like garbage little tiny things says 17

450
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:13,409
by 17 right and so where that's coming

451
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:17,418
from

452
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:21,409
I have no idea but I want to find out

453
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:24,950
somehow there's this sort of bogus in

454
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:28,650
bogus stuff coming out of here and

455
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:31,110
what's weird is when you look at the

456
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,200
values that we're getting in the PNG it

457
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:36,389
you know we could say oh maybe our PNG

458
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,429
parser was busted and it's writing out

459
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,940
some garbage there but we looked at

460
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:44,580
dumps of it and we'd seen anything now

461
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,558
we did see something in this square but

462
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:48,210
we're not looking at the RGV so that

463
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,190
shouldn't have been a problem and we

464
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:53,009
didn't see anything in this square right

465
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,230
there's there was nothing there so it

466
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:57,298
does seem like especially we just

467
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:01,589
concentrate on this one this three three

468
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:05,129
we see nothing there and yet we're

469
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:07,168
getting this this extraction you know

470
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:11,490
getting triggered the fact that they're

471
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:13,350
both 17 by 17 does sort of suggest that

472
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,690
we have some kind of a fancy bug

473
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:18,959
happening like maybe we're looking in

474
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:22,110
the wrong place somehow when we do some

475
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,500
of the source pixel advance sing or

476
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:29,788
something like this code is slightly off

477
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,190
or I don't know right but but it does

478
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:35,700
seem like we've got something Squinkie

479
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:38,039
happening here and we need to get a

480
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,960
little bit more insight into what it

481
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,409
thinks it's extracting in these cases

482
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:49,230
right

483
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:52,140
now fortunately for me I can just do

484
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,900
that right we've got a thing that heat

485
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,360
right here that's like hey man why don't

486
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,600
you write this out what I should be able

487
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,549
to do is write out the Alpha Channel and

488
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,599
it will like it write out both if I

489
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:05,779
wanted to write

490
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:09,269
I could write out each of these things

491
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:12,059
as an extraction test and say look show

492
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:17,579
me what you thought the pixels work you

493
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:20,190
know it's just a reasonable start so in

494
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:21,960
here if I'm gonna do an extraction what

495
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:32,880
I would want to do is get that width and

496
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:36,600
height so so in here I'm going to say

497
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,420
this is the the width and height that

498
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,279
I've already computed for purposes of

499
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:45,330
printing it out and I'm just going to

500
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,389
keep it so that I can use it in here so

501
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:52,710
curiously extract width and the extract

502
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:54,150
height now I need to take that info

503
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,910
stream so if there's a place that dump

504
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,259
errors I probably should have done that

505
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,910
to begin with because I could have just

506
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:02,400
used that as the place and I could have

507
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,970
used out F's in the first place but I

508
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,410
think we just want to do that right and

509
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:11,180
so here where it's gonna take that info

510
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:15,060
stream I'll just pass that along like so

511
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:18,750
and then when it does this nonsense here

512
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:22,470
I just need to give it a name so when

513
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:25,950
we're doing this right what I can do is

514
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:31,980
say alright you know I've got a little

515
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:35,420
buffer here and a little buffer here let

516
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,420
me go ahead and sprint up into those

517
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:56,189
nothing interesting happening here and

518
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:59,940
again this is just cheesy nonsense

519
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:03,269
nothing nothing good so I need to get

520
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:06,570
the extract pixels pointer here this is

521
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:10,408
going to be the location where if you

522
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:12,509
were gonna start you would youwould this

523
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:15,030
is where you'd move to the problem for

524
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:18,089
me is unfortunately in order to do that

525
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:21,990
I need like I would need a stride for

526
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:23,609
right top-down image rgba and what you

527
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,890
can see here is that this doesn't

528
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:29,069
actually take one so this would this

529
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:31,770
needs to actually condense what it's

530
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:35,038
this needs to sort of do that extract

531
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:37,859
and again I think you know because this

532
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,849
was actually doing extract image here

533
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:43,949
right I suspect what I could do is again

534
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:49,109
just keep calling that so if I look at

535
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:53,870
extract image oops this code right here

536
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:53,869
it does do it does the alpha multiply

537
00:29:55,609 --> 00:30:09,418
which I don't really want unfortunately

538
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:11,970
but I can use it so if we take this and

539
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,860
get rid of that what I can probably do

540
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,839
well and you know what I guess we have

541
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,779
that so I could just do this I could

542
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,939
literally do it exactly this way what I

543
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:24,359
could do here is just don't you know

544
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:29,029
don't do this right so instead it would

545
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:29,029
just be copy directly

546
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:40,619
and leave it at that so if I want to do

547
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:42,569
that I need one more thing I need to be

548
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:44,459
able to pass the memory rename here just

549
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:46,919
to keep this flowing exactly the way it

550
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,650
was before so that would look like this

551
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,930
and then we could just call it the way

552
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,820
we were calling it before so if we

553
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,789
wanted to do that then this becomes even

554
00:30:53,819 --> 00:31:00,359
easier because now we have an image u32

555
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:03,000
here which is this is the extracted oops

556
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:06,959
the extracted image and then we would

557
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,869
just say alright extract image extract

558
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:17,340
min extract min Y extract max extract

559
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:19,379
max Y and I don't actually remember the

560
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:23,449
other things this takes so it needs the

561
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:29,190
source image which was what just image

562
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:32,430
yeah so it takes the source image the

563
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:35,160
rectangle and the temporary no and

564
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:37,289
that's it then the extract width and

565
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,130
height is it's actually now we can just

566
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:43,440
say extracted with extracted height this

567
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,390
doesn't need to occur anymore these can

568
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,559
happen and then here we just say

569
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:53,100
extracted with extracted height

570
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:58,409
extracted pixels so there's no other

571
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:59,029
stuff there and we may need to cast that

572
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:06,630
though

573
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:11,460
so right so that needs to be you 8

574
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:14,030
pixels what was it was au 32 so that

575
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,029
needs to go like that

576
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:24,050
[Music]

577
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:26,859
there we go okay so at that point I

578
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:30,169
think we're good to go

579
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:33,529
we'll find out but now we should get

580
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:40,880
like just a local dump of those files in

581
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:45,549
theory right so here they are it's one

582
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,550
it's like one alpha dot

583
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:07,069
so they both think there is literally

584
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:09,710
one alpha dot just sitting there and so

585
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:14,418
now we're left unfortunately still with

586
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:17,329
a conundrum because we didn't see an

587
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:21,739
alpha dot there but I guess we can make

588
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:25,638
sure by looking at this maybe in a real

589
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:27,409
program because you know you can't

590
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:39,498
really trust microsoft with something

591
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:47,739
like that lo and behold so there is one

592
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:57,889
alpha dot there and one alpha dot there

593
00:33:47,739 --> 00:34:06,259
all right so we almost need to make this

594
00:33:57,888 --> 00:34:09,558
bloom out the alpha or something because

595
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:17,000
that doesn't so yeah I mean I don't know

596
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:19,789
anyway we saw those it is exactly what I

597
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,849
thought it was at the start it's hard to

598
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:25,278
detect those what I'm going to try to do

599
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:31,548
now I think is just change that

600
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:36,369
detection routine to be more forgiving

601
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:44,418
and so what I think we want to do here

602
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:46,159
you say hey when we do the multi tile we

603
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:49,690
probably want to just prevent things

604
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:56,298
that are too small just in general right

605
00:34:49,690 --> 00:35:00,349
so when we do multi tile extract so this

606
00:34:56,298 --> 00:35:03,619
code here what we want to do is when

607
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:06,559
we're doing this we then do like the

608
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:11,990
expansion here we probably want to say

609
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:20,540
look is the minimum you know is the

610
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:23,479
sighs exceeded or not you know so let's

611
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:31,550
figure that out what we would do there

612
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:34,309
is say first of all the min X has to be

613
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:38,930
less than the max X and the min Y have

614
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:49,250
to be Lexx in the max Y right so it

615
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:51,859
would you know it has to be it has to

616
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,510
have found something and the only

617
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,369
problem is so the way we're doing it

618
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:59,240
here like if you look at this with the

619
00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:02,990
min X and the max X and stuff there

620
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:14,689
isn't really a way to add some to that

621
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:17,209
so I'm not sure exactly how we want to

622
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:20,349
do that I think what we'd want to say is

623
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,349
something more like this

624
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,800
so what i'm doing here is i'm just doing

625
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:43,559
a computation of the length that is safe

626
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,250
so it's just saying or at least somewhat

627
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:49,650
safe it's saying look we're gonna start

628
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,929
with zeros here if you found something

629
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,480
determine what the width is and then i'm

630
00:36:51,929 --> 00:37:00,029
gonna say if test dim X is greater than

631
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:05,849
let's say 4 and test dim Y is greater

632
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:09,059
than 4 then off we would go right and

633
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:11,190
you know the pixel cap you know what I'm

634
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:12,420
thinkin maybe that doesn't even matter

635
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,980
now I think about it

636
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,780
maybe I don't need to do this at all

637
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:23,010
what if we just counted the number of

638
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:35,220
pixels so if in here we just said look

639
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:37,530
how many pixels are there then we coming

640
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:42,118
here I want to see the valid pixel count

641
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:45,690
is greater than the 16 and write the min

642
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:53,760
x max X right has has some thing to say

643
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:56,940
about that right and then I think we

644
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,640
probably also want in here I want

645
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:05,548
probably a second layer which is that

646
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:06,509
once we know that the thing has area we

647
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:07,769
don't really need to test that I guess

648
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:12,569
because that would just automatically

649
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:14,989
happen um and so this this really is

650
00:38:12,568 --> 00:38:14,989
just this

651
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,159
[Music]

652
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:28,400
so I think we also maybe want the the we

653
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,690
want the purr of pixels to have to be

654
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:36,930
properly proportioned to the area

655
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:39,380
possibly to so the bigger the area the

656
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:43,079
more pixels should have to be filled up

657
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,670
to a certain number right because we'd

658
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,500
really like to say look if there's not

659
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,150
like 128 pixels it's probably isn't

660
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,889
valid but if it was some small little

661
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:53,210
thing then maybe that's fine like for

662
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:53,210
the fonts or whatever right

663
00:38:53,219 --> 00:39:00,659
so maybe what I'll do is say something

664
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:02,639
like pixels per area right and then

665
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:04,379
we'll say if the valid pixel count is

666
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,269
greater than eight which is like the

667
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,880
lowest number we're gonna accept or

668
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:14,489
something for for I don't know and then

669
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:20,369
what we want to do is take the area so

670
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:24,029
we would say max X minus min X times max

671
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:25,588
Y minus min Y right so we do the

672
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:31,380
multiplication to find out what the area

673
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:34,019
is there and then we would want to take

674
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,210
the valid pixel count and sort of like

675
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:40,289
determine how many pixels per unit area

676
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:42,210
we have covering us I think so then we

677
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:43,858
would have loops then we'd have I don't

678
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,659
know what that just did don't want to

679
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:47,699
know thank you windows for whatever that

680
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:50,009
awesome thing that just happened was our

681
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:55,608
pixels per area would want to be the

682
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:59,849
valid pixel counts divided by the area

683
00:39:55,608 --> 00:40:06,569
right and so what we want to say is look

684
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:13,050
you know something like this if the

685
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:18,869
pixels per unit area is not sufficient

686
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:19,550
then it's probably just noise right and

687
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:22,769
off we go

688
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:26,400
so the problem with this is that if you

689
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:28,159
just had like a little splotch we

690
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,858
wouldn't necessarily be able to tell

691
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,828
that you know that wasn't what you

692
00:40:31,858 --> 00:40:34,598
wanted but then

693
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:36,789
again you know fonts and stuff they

694
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:41,709
don't really go in here for the most

695
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:44,559
part so I feel like because they get

696
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:47,259
generated by a separate path their

697
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,660
process does a single tile import so I

698
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:51,759
do wonder if maybe it would be okay to

699
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:54,098
be more stringent right and say that

700
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:56,259
like at least 25% in the area at least

701
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:57,759
you know I don't know but saying 10% of

702
00:40:56,259 --> 00:41:01,690
the area has to be covered should be

703
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:03,369
enough and since we have to have more

704
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,809
than just one pixel that would get rid

705
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:07,239
of the case that we're looking at now I

706
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:10,180
just don't know if we're really still we

707
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:13,150
still probably aren't quite testing as

708
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:14,228
stringently as we need to in the pixels

709
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:18,729
for area Department because like for

710
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:22,328
example in this case a little 3x3 filled

711
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:25,449
solid pixel would pass but maybe it

712
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:28,568
should I mean I don't know so I'm gonna

713
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:31,718
claim that that is what should happen

714
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:35,829
here and I'm gonna see if now we can

715
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:37,838
repress our at our art assets and and if

716
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:41,048
they all pass correctly and see you know

717
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:43,139
see if that actually works if that makes

718
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:43,139
sense

719
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,070
yeah I mean the only thing I think is

720
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:59,859
this maybe really should be more like

721
00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:05,480
sixty you know so I'm gonna say sixteen

722
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:07,579
and I also don't know if this needs to

723
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,179
have a secondary counter that's like

724
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:13,489
actually stronger pixels so pixels with

725
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:18,559
an alpha value that's higher you know

726
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:21,469
that's that's like more than say sixteen

727
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:36,590
or something like that we may want to do

728
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:39,279
that as well like so maybe we would do

729
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,280
something like this

730
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:49,759
and so this way we would say look

731
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,650
there's a solid pixel count and a valid

732
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,200
pixel count valid pixel count just lets

733
00:42:51,650 --> 00:43:01,309
us know we saw anything solid pixel

734
00:42:54,199 --> 00:43:08,480
count is sort of separate right so we

735
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:11,509
here where we've got oops in here where

736
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:16,300
we've got the Alpha production what I'd

737
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,300
like to do is say like alpha equals

738
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,119
shifted so we'll shift it down we'll see

739
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:28,309
if there's anything there if there is

740
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:32,569
something there then we will look at it

741
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:35,119
and this will only increment that if the

742
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:37,789
Alpha is greater than 16 that's gonna be

743
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,909
our alpha threshold right the magic

744
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:43,039
number 16 everyone knows it and so in

745
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:45,500
here we're gonna look to see if we got

746
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,150
any region at all if we did we're gonna

747
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,429
look at the area that was covered by

748
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:53,030
that region and see whether or not the

749
00:43:49,429 --> 00:44:01,509
solid pixel area actually was reasonable

750
00:43:53,030 --> 00:44:01,510
right I think that's about it

751
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:14,500
it's not a great routine but hopefully

752
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:17,889
that'll get us started okay so if I now

753
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,400
run an asset rebuild so let's suppose

754
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:30,609
that we go in here I'm gonna also inside

755
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:32,980
test PNG I'm gonna if this code now just

756
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,900
to leave it the way it used to work so

757
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:36,940
what I want to do now is just go back in

758
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,170
and have it do a full rebuild and see if

759
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:43,380
they can import everything like it's

760
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:49,300
supposed to so if I go to handmade data

761
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:52,990
and we just dell base game HHA and intro

762
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:55,720
cutscene hij so now there's nothing left

763
00:44:52,989 --> 00:45:00,489
right it's gone there's no game data

764
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:03,669
whatsoever if I now force it to actually

765
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:05,859
I mean low up remedy here if I force it

766
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:11,079
to run and rebuild everything that it

767
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:12,400
had there we go what does it do right

768
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:14,529
does it actually grab everything

769
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,760
properly or did I you know horribly ruin

770
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:17,760
it you know we'll see

771
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:37,900
I love how Linux just like you know

772
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:40,389
initializes a mouse it's on it's plugged

773
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,639
in it's powered up but forget it we

774
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:58,119
can't read that Mouse why because we're

775
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:59,799
Linux and we don't read mice all right

776
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:01,750
so I think this is where we were

777
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,539
actually so it looks like it did read

778
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,920
everything properly but we want to get

779
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:08,440
rid of the quick thing so that we can

780
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,340
look at the old asset and see whether it

781
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:15,700
got imported properly so inside the

782
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:18,579
where we actually create the player we

783
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:20,439
want to go ahead and remove the part

784
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:25,179
where we added that that we were a cook

785
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:28,619
because we're not a cook and now we can

786
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:33,069
run and see what's up with that

787
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:35,829
so that fixed our problem I'm not sure

788
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:37,900
that code is really all that great but

789
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:39,489
it's at least better than it was and so

790
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,610
now we have at least some protection

791
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:45,879
against garbage alpha pixels that just

792
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:48,010
sneak through causing issues that we

793
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,510
can't see all right so that's good

794
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:51,280
enough for now we may need to revisit

795
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:55,530
that code later because it's sort of

796
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:58,210
just a you know a sort of arbitrary

797
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:01,990
heuristic that we you know we just kind

798
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:03,579
of pulled out and so it's not you know

799
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:05,589
it's not really something that's robust

800
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:08,440
enough probably to last us the entire

801
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:16,930
time but for now we're gonna call that

802
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:26,079
good so so all right let's we got to do

803
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:28,000
some thinking now I think we're at the

804
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,449
point where it's time to start doing any

805
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,579
work cuz I don't think there was

806
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:37,419
anything else that I had to do or wanted

807
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:40,460
to do here yeah I don't think so

808
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:44,960
I might before I do the entity work

809
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:50,240
I might maybe possibly want to go ahead

810
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:53,360
and well actually you know what I do

811
00:47:50,239 --> 00:48:07,809
want to do as well is I want to turn off

812
00:47:53,360 --> 00:48:13,269
all these rectangles let's go in here so

813
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:13,269
what I'd like to do is why did that not

814
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:23,120
weird just took a while I guess so what

815
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:25,340
I would like to do now is I'd like to

816
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,079
play some furniture I guess would be the

817
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,789
next obvious thing to do and then after

818
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:31,279
that I'd like to go address the entity

819
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:33,409
system like the reason we need to

820
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,480
upgrade a couple things in there now

821
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:37,460
because we want to do stuff like be able

822
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,679
to change our body to a cook body

823
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:42,440
without changing our head to a to some

824
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,059
other head as well right so we have some

825
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,769
things we need to do there that we

826
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:47,539
haven't really addressed and that will

827
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:50,360
allow us to create our orphans properly

828
00:48:47,539 --> 00:48:52,130
as well so there's a bunch of stuff like

829
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,599
that that we'd like to do I suppose

830
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:56,780
another thing that we might want to do

831
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,489
here is also like set up the rest of the

832
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,960
wharf and heads and bodies so that there

833
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:01,369
they have such snap points and that

834
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,170
stuff we also need to think about

835
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:05,269
scaling so we just have a lot of work to

836
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:08,389
do because we're sort of opening up a

837
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:10,940
bunch of world creation sorts of stuff

838
00:49:08,389 --> 00:49:13,489
and so then there's just tons of work we

839
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:16,010
can do there all right so everything

840
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:17,329
else seems to be looking fine and of

841
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:20,120
course we have a nice flower on our head

842
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:22,340
now which is always a plus as well and

843
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:25,750
let me just make sure that like these

844
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:28,130
guys are still hopping around they are

845
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,269
they never set they're facing direction

846
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,349
they should

847
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:31,400
is there a reason they don't suck

848
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:33,880
they're facing direction we're just

849
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,539
we're just being lazy I'm assuming

850
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,539
inside brain here

851
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:50,929
where's the snake so when it actually

852
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,929
does the transactional occupy like I

853
00:49:57,889 --> 00:50:07,559
think we would want to do this right we

854
00:50:03,389 --> 00:50:16,618
want to take that Delta and do the a tan

855
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:26,369
on it I think why re tan to doesn't take

856
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:28,440
a vector no idea yeah there we go so I

857
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:30,150
don't know why they weren't doing that

858
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,338
to begin with I also don't know why this

859
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,059
guy can hop diagonally cuz that doesn't

860
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:35,338
make any sense

861
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:37,920
so this is probably totally wrong as

862
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:40,170
well what we probably should be doing

863
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,180
here is saying look if the Delta X is

864
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:45,030
greater than the Delta Y then it's X

865
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:50,659
otherwise it's Y you know I'm Sam so it

866
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:50,660
should be something like you know

867
00:50:51,769 --> 00:51:03,389
whichever one's greater then the Delta y

868
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:06,000
equals zero and the Delta X zero here

869
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:11,608
something like that you know I'm saying

870
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:14,489
I also don't know why this is why this

871
00:51:11,608 --> 00:51:16,199
isn't normalized so this was just I

872
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,669
think this is just crap code we typed in

873
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:19,889
because no one would write that I don't

874
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:21,530
know why anyone would write that but

875
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:24,299
that's what it should have been right

876
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:26,280
and so now it should only be able to hop

877
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,080
vertically or horizontally like you're

878
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,599
not allowed to hop diagonally so I don't

879
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,369
know why this was probably from a time

880
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,019
period where we hadn't necessarily said

881
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:37,170
that that was so or something I don't

882
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:40,338
know so now you can only hop you can

883
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:42,720
only hop along the grid as it should and

884
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:44,929
you know it can go around and have a

885
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:47,009
little party and whatever else it wants

886
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:50,368
but anyway it looks like all of those

887
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:51,540
are working fine and sorry I didn't

888
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:51,970
quite explain what I was doing there I

889
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:53,170
didn't really

890
00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:54,639
care about that could I just wanted to

891
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,670
not leave it in weird state it's just

892
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:59,829
this was picking a random direction but

893
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,358
it also ends up with a random length and

894
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:03,190
we don't really need it to have a random

895
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,420
length we just need a random direction

896
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,159
so I made it so it would basically

897
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,440
threshold and say whichever one was

898
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:12,639
greater don't go diagonal so just either

899
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:14,590
go X or Y and then once you zero out the

900
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,480
one that's lesser normalize it so that

901
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,340
it's going to be one in one of the four

902
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,679
cardinal directions this code we

903
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:22,960
probably will have pulled out at some

904
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:25,329
point to like get random direction

905
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,490
that'll just give us one of the the four

906
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:29,049
cardinal directions right but for right

907
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:30,549
now I just wanted to clean it up in

908
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:33,550
place so it wasn't sitting around being

909
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:35,950
crappy I don't remember how we got in

910
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:42,099
here wasn't this way was it was the

911
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:46,348
other way yeah we need to put in some

912
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:49,059
punching codes because they're kind of

913
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:53,830
again that's game play stuffs not really

914
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:56,170
my domain all right so I think we're all

915
00:52:53,829 --> 00:53:02,440
that stuff's fine and now what I want to

916
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:03,909
do is I would like to make a I would

917
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,559
like to take some time now and figure

918
00:53:03,909 --> 00:53:09,549
out like how we want to place furniture

919
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,929
probably I think that's what I want to

920
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:13,050
do the other thing I want to do is make

921
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:16,118
sure that entities can have multiple

922
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:20,230
that I have a strategy that I want to

923
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,789
try for making entities have more

924
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,740
flexibility with how the tags are set

925
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:27,489
there's a way that I think I want to do

926
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:29,469
that that you know I want to try I'm not

927
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:31,299
sure if it's gonna be correct or not how

928
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:34,889
much time do we have is maybe the best

929
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,890
way to look at that

930
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,379
[Music]

931
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:51,970
so I think we have 45 minutes left

932
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:54,818
probably so assuming we have 45 minutes

933
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:58,169
left what I'd like to do is do the

934
00:53:54,818 --> 00:54:00,519
furniture I think so inside room Jen I

935
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,200
want to be able to place like just an

936
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:04,239
inanimate object and I don't really

937
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:06,338
think that we mean separate entity

938
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:07,899
brains or anything for this because it's

939
00:54:06,338 --> 00:54:11,139
literally just an entity that sits there

940
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:13,450
it doesn't do anything it just occupies

941
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:15,879
a square so that that square can't

942
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:19,868
actually have anything on it in terms of

943
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:22,750
walking or anything right so I think in

944
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:25,180
order to do that what I would need to do

945
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,769
is when we place monsters so inside

946
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:30,669
inside room Jen we've got stuff that

947
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:33,900
places monsters sometimes right and well

948
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:37,318
I guess where is that that's like in the

949
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:41,289
here right fine place to put entity

950
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:45,159
right so that's where we're gonna place

951
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:48,190
these entity groups that I think is how

952
00:54:45,159 --> 00:54:52,298
we would do it and there's a couple

953
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:54,099
things that we're gonna have to do later

954
00:54:52,298 --> 00:54:56,259
I'm not probably gonna do them now I'm

955
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:57,130
gonna let them fail and then we'll deal

956
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,349
with it later

957
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,990
but what I want to do is place furniture

958
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:04,450
using this system I think that will

959
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:07,209
actually allow furniture to block exits

960
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:10,419
which we don't want it to do

961
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:12,460
and so we will probably make that be

962
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:15,608
something that we add to the checking

963
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,449
here when it's actually placed and we'll

964
00:55:15,608 --> 00:55:19,150
go from there

965
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:20,139
so I don't remember how to use any

966
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:23,740
systems because of course we haven't

967
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:26,318
used them in a real long time but when

968
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:30,719
we actually push these on inside the

969
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:33,869
gencode which i think is in here

970
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:33,869
[Music]

971
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:48,630
anyone here it is uh so when we do this

972
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,630
stuff right you can see us here's place

973
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:56,809
cap it goes through the options for

974
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:59,400
where cats can be right and adds them in

975
00:55:56,809 --> 00:56:02,549
so I think the same is true for

976
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,530
furniture so we can really just when

977
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:08,160
replacing things we can just place

978
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:10,050
furniture as and as a pass that comes

979
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,909
after I think that's probably the

980
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:15,150
easiest way to do it I don't actually

981
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:18,539
know we could just do it at the time as

982
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,920
well maybe that's a better idea so maybe

983
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:23,849
in here what we want is really this

984
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:27,420
right we want this this code to just

985
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:30,389
place it in a room so you know inside

986
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:36,269
create orphanage here we added all these

987
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:43,489
rooms and maybe inside the main room we

988
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:43,489
want to add some furniture so like yeah

989
00:56:45,260 --> 00:57:05,850
like this so this thing is a chair it's

990
00:56:54,719 --> 00:57:08,819
facing some direction this is going to

991
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:10,980
have to be the function that adds that

992
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:15,170
thing

993
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:24,389
why isn't add orphan shouldn't there be

994
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:27,360
a door Fionn as a function oh I bet

995
00:57:24,389 --> 00:57:29,309
those are in the energy gen those are

996
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,440
those were call backs yeah you can see

997
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:33,539
them unfortunately the jump call doesn't

998
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,869
know it doesn't understand the macros

999
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:40,440
here so it can't know where those are so

1000
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:43,319
I think what we have here is like add

1001
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,150
cat right it just puts a thing on there

1002
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,039
and it doesn't have a brain that's what

1003
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:50,780
we want so I think we want something

1004
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:53,849
this which is like all right this is add

1005
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,849
[Music]

1006
00:57:54,199 --> 00:58:03,269
scenery I guess maybe we'll call it AB

1007
00:58:00,389 --> 00:58:05,699
obstacle because it it does like place

1008
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:11,489
itself on to the thing that's standing

1009
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:15,269
on probably I don't know so it's gonna

1010
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:19,399
be something like that and it has the

1011
00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:23,039
collider on it it doesn't have you know

1012
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,650
anything here it's it's just scenery

1013
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:29,190
and so all of that should be the same in

1014
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:30,690
this connect piece to world thing we

1015
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:32,639
would need yeah this would be the same

1016
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:35,789
and that doesn't have to happen so it's

1017
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:38,129
really just this so I think this is add

1018
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:39,630
obstacle we say it's a chair we say this

1019
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:43,940
is the facing direction here's where

1020
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:43,940
we're placing it we add the entity in

1021
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:53,880
and that should be it so I think that's

1022
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,230
all I don't think we need any the other

1023
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,360
code because all the other code was

1024
00:58:55,230 --> 00:59:07,260
there for other to handle other aspects

1025
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:10,860
of it alright so what is the problem

1026
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:13,950
here for add entity by the way it takes

1027
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:18,840
a Gen and an entity creator add obstacle

1028
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:19,949
is one of those and Gen is a world

1029
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:25,340
generator right

1030
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:28,469
Oh result is not that so identity

1031
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:37,010
returns a gen entity there so we need to

1032
00:59:28,469 --> 00:59:37,009
do this something like this maybe this

1033
00:59:37,768 --> 00:59:44,439
that might take care of all of it

1034
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:46,990
actually so I think that's it and then

1035
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,298
when I run I don't know if we actually

1036
00:59:46,989 --> 00:59:51,219
got a chair or not I tried to put a

1037
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:52,599
chair in the main room

1038
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:54,759
it'll since we don't have any

1039
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:57,220
sophisticated lyoko right now it should

1040
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:59,170
just be in the upper corner or the first

1041
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:01,469
place it can be and it actually is there

1042
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:09,369
it is and of course it blocked the

1043
01:00:01,469 --> 01:00:10,868
entrance whoops so okay so that lets us

1044
01:00:09,369 --> 01:00:12,460
place furniture everywhere we don't

1045
01:00:10,869 --> 01:00:13,660
actually have the different directions

1046
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,920
of furniture so I should probably use

1047
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:28,690
the only direction we actually have

1048
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:32,858
which is to say that's well I'll leave

1049
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:35,588
that in for now that it should be facing

1050
01:00:32,858 --> 01:00:38,558
in the direction so now we need some way

1051
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:41,858
of actually placing this stuff in some

1052
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:50,890
way that makes sense this may require us

1053
01:00:41,858 --> 01:00:52,469
to have more of a explicit layout not

1054
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:54,940
really sure how we want to do that

1055
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:56,439
because I think probably when we're

1056
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:59,170
creating rooms we're going to want to

1057
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:04,450
lay them out by some various game design

1058
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:10,750
criteria and so you know here we can you

1059
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:14,409
can kind of see there's our right

1060
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:16,389
there's our chair there so we want to be

1061
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:18,699
able to do stuff like place those in a

1062
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:22,838
way that makes more sense and I'm not

1063
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:24,460
sure exactly how or where we want to do

1064
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:25,690
that we have to think about more about

1065
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:30,150
like what's gonna be required for

1066
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:35,980
gameplay to have that happen and yeah I

1067
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:37,778
would like also to be able to control

1068
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,278
the size a little more easily because

1069
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:41,380
for example you know the chair is too

1070
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:43,588
small probably at the moment it should

1071
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:46,630
really be the whole size of the square

1072
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:48,608
inside the add obstacle like there's the

1073
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:50,820
sizing there's a couple different ways

1074
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:53,039
we can do that we could just

1075
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:54,300
even at one point oh I don't again don't

1076
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,599
really know what the best way to do this

1077
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:59,550
would be we could leave it at one point

1078
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,319
oh and if we do then the way that we

1079
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:04,470
would adjust the size would actually be

1080
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:07,710
like encoded into the placement point so

1081
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:12,989
for example we would go like this and

1082
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:19,170
say oh this thing right it's default

1083
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:20,849
placement size is on here right and then

1084
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:23,220
we would size it up to however big it

1085
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:26,159
was and also we would place it like in

1086
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:28,230
the square right and maybe that's the

1087
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,359
right thing so everything is just 1.0 by

1088
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:33,570
default and you scale it up in there

1089
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:37,230
right but again like you don't really

1090
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:41,420
know exactly how we want that to go so

1091
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:46,500
I'm not sure yet but something like that

1092
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:47,460
and so then you know if that's not what

1093
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:53,900
I wanted

1094
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:53,900
i ex adieu the game also that's wrong

1095
01:02:54,139 --> 01:03:00,210
that's not our title screen we got to

1096
01:02:58,469 --> 01:03:04,079
add a different query it looks like does

1097
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:06,420
the rest of our stuff work okay yeah so

1098
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,099
the rest of the stuff works just fine so

1099
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,320
I think our title screen doesn't have

1100
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:12,559
the right query on it anymore let's take

1101
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,559
a look

1102
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:24,360
[Music]

1103
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:29,520
shot index one layer index one title

1104
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:32,400
screen so yeah if we go to cutscene I

1105
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:34,409
think it's still using the old query for

1106
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,470
when we didn't have a separate thing for

1107
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:40,399
the title screen so we probably want

1108
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:40,399
that yeah

1109
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:07,379
so that should now actually pick out the

1110
01:04:03,268 --> 01:04:09,028
title screen properly and you know we

1111
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,470
can add more layers later there's only

1112
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:11,670
one layer for telson right now but

1113
01:04:10,469 --> 01:04:13,439
that's that's what it should have done

1114
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:14,880
because remember we added tag to that I

1115
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,619
guess we never went in and actually done

1116
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:22,619
anything about it so yeah much better

1117
01:04:19,619 --> 01:04:24,210
now um alright so this is getting there

1118
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:25,349
now we're able to drop things in pretty

1119
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:27,298
easily

1120
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:29,028
maybe that scale should just always stay

1121
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:31,409
1.0 and then the alignment points

1122
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:48,480
adjusted that does seem like a pretty

1123
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:51,798
good way to go so yeah I guess I don't

1124
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,798
really know what to do next

1125
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:59,940
we've got a ton of time left so I don't

1126
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:02,909
know if that means I should go in there

1127
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:10,700
and actually start the furniture layout

1128
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:10,699
stuff I just really don't know

1129
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:15,119
[Music]

1130
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:35,500
all right hand me yours over I can't

1131
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:35,500
think what to do next weird we're done

1132
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:45,199
yeah so I don't actually know what we

1133
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:46,730
should be doing now the next two things

1134
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:48,049
to start on both seeing bigger than

1135
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:53,480
stuff that we would want to start at the

1136
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:58,730
end of the episode crumpets

1137
01:05:53,480 --> 01:06:00,590
so because yeah we either want to start

1138
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:04,670
doing layout for stuff that goes into

1139
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:07,130
the world or we want to upgrade the

1140
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:12,230
entities to have the tag problem fixed

1141
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:15,920
and I don't yeah I don't know about

1142
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:20,329
either of those so what you know what we

1143
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:22,159
could maybe do instead is how I turn

1144
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:24,349
those rectangles off maybe we should go

1145
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:27,139
in and put in a little UI for turning on

1146
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:28,909
and off debug overlays or something like

1147
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:32,690
that because it does seem like the kind

1148
01:06:28,909 --> 01:06:35,299
of thing that we do pretty often here so

1149
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:39,019
there's that I could also go make some

1150
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:41,750
tree I could extract the trees and then

1151
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:44,509
we could put in some trees that seems

1152
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:48,440
like it might be a good idea I don't

1153
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:50,570
know I would like to see how the trees

1154
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,579
look let's put in some trees I don't

1155
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,230
know I thought we were gonna have more

1156
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:57,289
work to do today than it turned out we

1157
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:58,969
did so that was a you know sometimes

1158
01:06:57,289 --> 01:07:01,489
programming you get a bug it takes you

1159
01:06:58,969 --> 01:07:02,689
forever and so you know you spend a lot

1160
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:04,189
more time than you think and then other

1161
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:07,490
times you're just like oh all that stuff

1162
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:10,340
just worked so I guess we don't care uh

1163
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:13,129
so yeah if I wanted to get the trees in

1164
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:16,490
there let's let's look at that inside

1165
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:19,460
handmade sources in the base game area

1166
01:07:16,489 --> 01:07:22,849
so of the stuff that we didn't do right

1167
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:25,280
you know here we got the temp chairs

1168
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:30,549
that I did oh I should ask for the

1169
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,550
chairs in different orientations perhaps

1170
01:07:30,909 --> 01:07:39,069
well we can always leave that for later

1171
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:39,070
I guess I could put some lamps in

1172
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:54,870
let's put lamps and trees and just just

1173
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:56,550
cuz alright so in here we've got some

1174
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:59,460
trees I don't really know what to do

1175
01:07:56,550 --> 01:08:02,070
about the trees the problem is about how

1176
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:05,820
we're labeling them labeling them or it

1177
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:09,300
wise and minoo I guess there's like

1178
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:12,570
destroyed versus snowy I guess I don't

1179
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:15,930
know so there's kind of two axes there

1180
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:19,230
and I don't really have a strong opinion

1181
01:08:15,929 --> 01:08:21,119
about how those should should work so

1182
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:24,149
we'll just do our best

1183
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,529
I guess if I load up the carrot the sort

1184
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:30,858
of the character at the item template

1185
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:32,909
and I say alright for the item template

1186
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:36,600
and you know what yeah you know what I

1187
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:40,380
should do too you know let's go hog-wild

1188
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:43,588
here let's just go hog-wild if I go back

1189
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:49,680
here I could just say like that there's

1190
01:08:43,588 --> 01:08:50,939
templates in here right so that our

1191
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,909
templates are all in the same place

1192
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:55,338
which kind of seems like a good idea to

1193
01:08:53,909 --> 01:09:06,659
me

1194
01:08:55,338 --> 01:09:17,369
so character template there's no other

1195
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:20,279
templates are there so let's just go

1196
01:09:17,369 --> 01:09:23,130
back here and we'll say inside sources

1197
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:25,199
underneath templates there's character

1198
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:28,260
template so I've got these two templates

1199
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:31,949
I'd go ahead and open this one up into

1200
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:35,670
the jimp and then I'll go grab out of

1201
01:09:31,949 --> 01:09:46,949
base game art this tree thing open with

1202
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:51,989
this I convert convert I guess and so if

1203
01:09:46,949 --> 01:10:00,059
I didn't want to do that did I open as

1204
01:09:51,989 --> 01:10:07,380
layers item template so if I okay nope I

1205
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:09,960
take it back I did want to do that so if

1206
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:13,220
I go over here and I grab some of these

1207
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:18,510
out so let's say I grab this tree okay

1208
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:21,770
let's say I grab this tree and I paste

1209
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,770
that in there

1210
01:10:28,908 --> 01:10:34,939
and then we just pretend that these axes

1211
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:37,779
are what I just said they are so damaged

1212
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,779
is on one end

1213
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,119
so like

1214
01:10:57,069 --> 01:11:00,719
and snow-covered is on the other

1215
01:11:10,829 --> 01:11:15,600
so if it's something like this

1216
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:44,419
and then we say okay that's my tree like

1217
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:45,769
scenery or I guess this actually needs

1218
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:49,550
to be it since it's going to have a

1219
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:52,040
different sort of labeling system I

1220
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:56,380
guess I want this to be some other word

1221
01:11:52,039 --> 01:12:00,979
besides scenery this is like an out

1222
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:04,550
outdoor or something

1223
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:07,939
I don't really know so it's like outdoor

1224
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:19,460
it's like an outdoor tree or it might

1225
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:21,289
just be yeah I don't know I know I

1226
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:23,420
almost don't want to do it because if we

1227
01:12:21,289 --> 01:12:27,350
just use the other thing we could just

1228
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:28,609
get away with not having so maybe

1229
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:31,070
there's just like a damage but you know

1230
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:34,429
so so I'm gonna take that back I must

1231
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:36,439
say that we just have the snow covered

1232
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:40,970
going this way maybe so the variant is

1233
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:42,349
just that or maybe it's maybe it's just

1234
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:43,670
a separate one for each of them so

1235
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:46,310
they're just a couple different variants

1236
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:48,619
I don't know it would only be the top

1237
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:50,330
row so I think maybe that's what I'll do

1238
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:52,479
so I think what I'll do is say look

1239
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:55,579
there's gonna be one for each of these

1240
01:12:52,479 --> 01:13:00,369
so I'll just like put them up like this

1241
01:12:55,579 --> 01:13:03,369
on top of themselves

1242
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:03,369
oops

1243
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:15,469
right and then I'll just save them out

1244
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:34,880
separately so like this is just going to

1245
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:39,909
be damaged tree this is like a pine tree

1246
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,909
right or an evergreen

1247
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:51,439
and then this is snow-covered

1248
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:03,960
and then this is just regular

1249
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:24,300
that seems good for some definition of

1250
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:24,300
good and I don't know about these guys

1251
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:37,690
exactly so let's just start there inside

1252
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:39,489
the base game tag file here I want to go

1253
01:14:37,689 --> 01:14:44,009
to where we were like defining scenery

1254
01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:53,260
there and I'll just say like hey scenery

1255
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:56,560
scenery evergreen PNG and this is like

1256
01:14:53,260 --> 01:15:00,220
you know tree evergreen or something

1257
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:03,910
like this and we'd have three of these

1258
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:08,949
there was like the damaged one and there

1259
01:15:03,909 --> 01:15:12,130
was the snow one right I think this is

1260
01:15:08,949 --> 01:15:16,720
what I called them so evergreen damaged

1261
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:20,859
evergreen snow and so we need tags for

1262
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:36,640
those out in here so I don't know if

1263
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:41,079
we've got snow as a tag yet tag snow so

1264
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:43,539
we need those tags and I guess we could

1265
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:53,109
call like ever the other kind of tree

1266
01:15:43,539 --> 01:16:01,029
deciduous but that's about it

1267
01:15:53,109 --> 01:16:04,449
right and that way we can just sort of

1268
01:16:01,029 --> 01:16:09,539
set those tags and then if someone wants

1269
01:16:04,449 --> 01:16:09,539
to access them they can

1270
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:21,630
so that should import those they should

1271
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:25,939
work as is and then inside like the room

1272
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:29,909
Jen where it was placing walls before

1273
01:16:25,939 --> 01:16:36,079
you know you can see oh we even have an

1274
01:16:29,909 --> 01:16:39,210
app we have an ad lamp call interesting

1275
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:42,630
we should put lamps in there's a call

1276
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:45,239
for it so what we want to do here is say

1277
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:48,420
look the places where we were gonna put

1278
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:51,269
walls before we don't put walls when

1279
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:55,409
it's not a room so if it's outdoors we

1280
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:57,750
like to skip that and you can kind of

1281
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:59,880
see like alright here's the connection

1282
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:01,859
stuff here's adding the entities here's

1283
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,900
the wall height blah blah blah and so

1284
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:07,109
what happens here is you can see you've

1285
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:12,149
got a thing that actually does the tag

1286
01:17:07,109 --> 01:17:13,859
wall tag wood stuff right and it looks

1287
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:16,409
like the way we're doing that right now

1288
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:19,920
is if you're on the boundary the wall

1289
01:17:16,409 --> 01:17:22,829
height goes up we set the on boundary

1290
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:26,369
tag if you're outdoors to like not be

1291
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:29,579
there right but I think that's actually

1292
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:31,710
not quite what we want to do so what we

1293
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:43,939
actually want to do is if we look at

1294
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:48,390
that on boundary right here this code is

1295
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:53,699
like if we're outdoors we would place a

1296
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:56,160
tree otherwise we'd do that right and so

1297
01:17:53,699 --> 01:17:59,849
up here we want to probably get rid of

1298
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:02,670
this code and in here we would want to

1299
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:08,720
actually place an entity that is a tree

1300
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:08,720
on this square right and so

1301
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:30,370
whether or not those should actually be

1302
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:34,329
entities is a little hard to say I'm

1303
01:18:30,369 --> 01:18:35,260
gonna say yes for now so we're gonna do

1304
01:18:34,329 --> 01:18:39,609
something like this

1305
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:44,949
and I'm going to try to put that entity

1306
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:48,569
on top here so this code basically is

1307
01:18:44,949 --> 01:18:48,569
probably what I would do

1308
01:18:56,380 --> 01:19:00,989
for place unity I think

1309
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:16,600
so honestly I guess it's really just

1310
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:16,600
this and later on we would say all right

1311
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:33,650
so at the end of this we would want to

1312
01:19:31,579 --> 01:19:34,880
say after you've placed this like if

1313
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:40,099
we're supposed to place a tree put a

1314
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:42,440
tree on top of it I guess right

1315
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:50,240
and so that is essentially this code

1316
01:19:42,439 --> 01:19:52,159
here it would be like we need to get the

1317
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:55,819
tile but we already know what the tile

1318
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:58,099
is so we don't need that we need to look

1319
01:19:55,819 --> 01:19:59,869
to see whether or not we can grab the

1320
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:04,280
structural element out of it it has to

1321
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:05,989
be I guess in this case so that part

1322
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:08,689
like we already know it's just the

1323
01:20:05,989 --> 01:20:13,130
entity that we're placing here so I

1324
01:20:08,689 --> 01:20:23,269
don't think that that matters at all so

1325
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:26,150
this is is just this and then here where

1326
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:29,600
we do place entity I think this is all

1327
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:33,979
good all we really have to do is like

1328
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:35,510
create a tree here and add that so I

1329
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:42,649
don't know what kind of tree we're

1330
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:44,510
necessarily gonna do right but since we

1331
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:53,500
only have evergreens at the moment we'll

1332
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:53,500
hard-coded to that maybe snow ones and

1333
01:20:55,659 --> 01:21:00,800
if we go ahead and do that all we really

1334
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:05,720
need here is just a straightforward

1335
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:07,909
identity I think and we need to add one

1336
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:13,520
visible piece which is just the tree

1337
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:15,619
like the the scenery of it I think we

1338
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,720
can just call the creator function here

1339
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:18,738
so we should be able to do just add

1340
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:29,630
obstacle

1341
01:21:18,738 --> 01:21:33,109
and that probably would do it I think so

1342
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:35,770
that was kind of a random thing to do

1343
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:40,479
[Music]

1344
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:40,480
I'm not sure why that failed

1345
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:54,899
so tile structural entity and the idea

1346
01:21:52,079 --> 01:22:02,909
gets from so this what is the complaint

1347
01:21:54,899 --> 01:22:04,949
here so somebody's no but it should

1348
01:22:02,909 --> 01:22:07,699
always be valid right this entity should

1349
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:07,699
be valid

1350
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:28,170
so I suppose it's possible that the

1351
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:30,719
thing just doesn't have a traversable

1352
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:32,460
which I suppose we should check why it

1353
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,650
wouldn't have one on a place where it's

1354
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:38,789
going to place a tree though that I'm

1355
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:42,179
not sure about but we certainly can

1356
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:44,720
check so in here we could say hey yeah

1357
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,720
like

1358
01:22:54,750 --> 01:23:02,539
well no I mean how could it not have I

1359
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:02,539
guess we'd have to say if it's open

1360
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:15,529
because it would have to right am I

1361
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:17,900
missing something I must have just been

1362
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:24,679
missing something symbol there let's

1363
01:23:17,899 --> 01:23:27,769
take a look so it did not it it looks

1364
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:33,409
like it removed that from the set though

1365
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:37,190
which is a little bit weird so right

1366
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:41,119
like for some somehow that activity of

1367
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:44,960
saying if spec outdoors at place three

1368
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:52,399
equals true like made us not actually

1369
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:58,909
get any any visible piece here at all

1370
01:23:52,399 --> 01:24:00,379
which doesn't make a lot of sense unless

1371
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:02,090
I'm missing something so let me just

1372
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:05,020
verify I want to make sure that this is

1373
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,020
actually the cause of that

1374
01:24:21,448 --> 01:24:25,759
know so I ruined something else there

1375
01:24:25,939 --> 01:24:30,210
what did I do

1376
01:24:27,539 --> 01:24:32,100
I thought that was the only thing I

1377
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:34,170
changed but evidently that is not the

1378
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,360
only thing I changed because I clipped

1379
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:38,730
out all of the stuff that was around the

1380
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:43,159
perimeter there accidentally you can see

1381
01:24:38,729 --> 01:24:43,159
it the same thing happened here right so

1382
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:50,429
what did I accidentally change there

1383
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:54,649
that I didn't mean to so we come through

1384
01:24:50,429 --> 01:24:56,579
here and we say are we on the boundary

1385
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:59,698
previously what I said is if we're on

1386
01:24:56,579 --> 01:25:03,390
the outside then the answer is that we

1387
01:24:59,698 --> 01:25:04,319
are not right so I guess the main change

1388
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:07,289
was that

1389
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:12,238
now I thought on boundary only really

1390
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:17,340
ever did one thing so it won't go in

1391
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:25,079
here ah I see but we do need a

1392
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:28,010
traversable there so I guess on boundary

1393
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:30,929
is probably is the wrong thing there

1394
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:32,940
because we do want to go in here and we

1395
01:25:30,929 --> 01:25:37,199
do want to specify that it's grass and

1396
01:25:32,939 --> 01:25:39,599
that sort of stuff right so I guess we

1397
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:43,409
do need to do this we want to leave this

1398
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:45,920
this way and we want to say okay yeah

1399
01:25:43,409 --> 01:25:45,920
like

1400
01:25:55,460 --> 01:26:02,250
we want to say something a little bit

1401
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:04,920
more specific here so inside you know we

1402
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:06,539
do this sort of stuff and you know all

1403
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:09,720
of this should still happen the way that

1404
01:26:06,539 --> 01:26:12,090
it's happening I guess we do call this

1405
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:18,030
and then the only thing that happens is

1406
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:19,710
the place tree call if we're in here we

1407
01:26:18,029 --> 01:26:22,559
want to make sure that we're not on a

1408
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:25,140
connection so I think we want to do that

1409
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:33,830
but otherwise we're okay

1410
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:33,829
right I think that's all we really need

1411
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:56,279
and so that should place our trees

1412
01:26:56,329 --> 01:26:59,869
[Laughter]

1413
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:08,399
I forgot it also has to be on the actual

1414
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:12,659
boundary so that's what we need that for

1415
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:12,659
so we really need something like this

1416
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:34,330
that's just a few too many trees is the

1417
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:35,920
problem so let's see now that we've got

1418
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:37,630
some trees we should also probably size

1419
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,399
them they're gonna be sized wrong but

1420
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:41,590
there we go so now there's at least a

1421
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:43,239
tree boundary and normally you know

1422
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,770
we're gonna want to do a lot more stuff

1423
01:27:43,239 --> 01:27:48,039
there to make this look like a forest

1424
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:51,610
and all kinds of other things so you

1425
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:55,269
know they're stuff that has to happen

1426
01:27:51,609 --> 01:27:57,369
there let's go ahead and also look why

1427
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:59,650
didn't the baby get placed there that's

1428
01:27:57,369 --> 01:28:00,939
another issue I think we have yeah I

1429
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,899
mean we've got a lot of work to do on

1430
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:04,269
this code this doesn't really do

1431
01:28:01,899 --> 01:28:08,170
anything right now but we'll get there

1432
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:12,240
so if we want these to be the right size

1433
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:16,739
we need them to be you know I don't know

1434
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:16,739
something more like that probably

1435
01:28:20,909 --> 01:28:23,909
right

1436
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:31,140
I think that's roughly what we're

1437
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:31,140
looking for

1438
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:44,140
and that way you know there's some big

1439
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:48,609
trees and stuff and they look fine that

1440
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:50,710
seems reasonable we would probably want

1441
01:28:48,609 --> 01:28:54,699
to like vary that height a little bit as

1442
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:58,119
well but it seems to work pretty well

1443
01:28:54,699 --> 01:29:03,939
the occlusion looks about right

1444
01:28:58,119 --> 01:29:05,769
I don't know if that center point is is

1445
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:08,409
quite right though let me let me look at

1446
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:11,580
that a little bit more closely on

1447
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:11,579
something like here

1448
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:22,960
if that looks a little mouse a little

1449
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:26,109
better it's never quite right you know

1450
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:32,310
because it's to its 2d trying to be 3d

1451
01:29:26,109 --> 01:29:32,309
right so it's never quite right but

1452
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:41,850
seems a little bare it may be a little

1453
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:41,849
left shifted as well

1454
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:07,539
now it looks a little right shifted

1455
01:30:25,988 --> 01:30:28,988
right

1456
01:30:36,908 --> 01:30:39,960
seems about right

1457
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:08,299
all right so I think that's sufficient

1458
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:11,029
for trees for now and again like in

1459
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:16,310
theory anyway we should be able to just

1460
01:31:11,029 --> 01:31:19,279
like change those parameters pretty

1461
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:22,640
easily one thing that I'm not sure about

1462
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:25,460
is so let's say that you have an entity

1463
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:29,420
here I don't actually know if entities

1464
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:35,079
are tracked to any significant degree

1465
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:43,460
but you know like if we did do that so

1466
01:31:35,079 --> 01:31:46,609
that's camera F what is nothing not sure

1467
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:53,510
how I would want that to work but just

1468
01:31:46,609 --> 01:31:56,420
you know just to sort of show you what

1469
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:59,869
I'm thinking about here inside the

1470
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:02,930
editor we I don't really remember what

1471
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:05,720
we track cuz it looks like we just use

1472
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:09,890
assets we don't actually use entities I

1473
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:12,260
think anywhere I think and so it would

1474
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:15,079
be nice to have access to the entity

1475
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:17,420
itself as well so that we could you know

1476
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:19,460
actually tweak some of those parameters

1477
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:21,319
that's so that we could look at what

1478
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:23,510
happens when we change tags you know I'm

1479
01:32:21,319 --> 01:32:25,039
saying so that would be a nice thing to

1480
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:26,180
do I just don't know it's it's not we

1481
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,670
only got ten minutes left let's find out

1482
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:32,180
something we should do now but point

1483
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:34,250
being so if we like inside the I don't

1484
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:41,630
want this to accident accidentally get

1485
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:46,609
overwritten by the way what I would like

1486
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:48,590
to do is take a look at the code where

1487
01:32:46,609 --> 01:32:52,279
we're actually placing this stuff we

1488
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:54,949
could in here randomize this value so

1489
01:32:52,279 --> 01:33:00,039
instead of this like you know we could

1490
01:32:54,949 --> 01:33:00,039
do just to prove that we can

1491
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:11,210
I think this would give us like an

1492
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:16,250
assortment of the trees that we had in

1493
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:25,850
there in theory I believe it's damaged

1494
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:32,210
right is the tag is that did we not put

1495
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:34,480
that in there yes I didn't put that in

1496
01:33:32,210 --> 01:33:34,480
there

1497
01:33:34,998 --> 01:33:55,569
I didn't see if I add that in and say

1498
01:33:46,578 --> 01:33:55,569
that there's a damaged here like so

1499
01:33:58,248 --> 01:34:06,618
then I should also be able to randomize

1500
01:34:03,229 --> 01:34:10,999
on that previously it looks like I

1501
01:34:06,618 --> 01:34:12,759
wasn't actually marking that and so now

1502
01:34:10,998 --> 01:34:16,519
we should have some different trees

1503
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:18,829
possibly and actually new so I could

1504
01:34:16,519 --> 01:34:21,260
only pick the damaged ones there and I'm

1505
01:34:18,828 --> 01:34:24,378
not really sure why

1506
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:24,378
[Music]

1507
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,789
that should have in us a random number

1508
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:38,109
between zero and one for the snow and

1509
01:34:36,789 --> 01:34:47,470
for the damaged

1510
01:34:38,109 --> 01:34:50,489
I guess the tag matching is the tag

1511
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:53,530
matching biased against zero values

1512
01:34:50,489 --> 01:34:56,649
because if so that would be a problem

1513
01:34:53,529 --> 01:34:58,929
for us we have to do some work on our

1514
01:34:56,649 --> 01:35:02,259
tag matching anyway and it's been on the

1515
01:34:58,930 --> 01:35:05,760
to-do list forever but just in terms of

1516
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:05,760
getting best match asset

1517
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:19,090
I'm not sure now it doesn't look like it

1518
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:29,130
because the match vector would just be

1519
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:32,150
zero there and so the difference should

1520
01:35:29,130 --> 01:35:32,150
be also zero

1521
01:35:39,498 --> 01:35:43,389
so I don't I don't see why that's a

1522
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:43,389
problem

1523
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:08,609
hmm well let's find out also I feel like

1524
01:36:07,078 --> 01:36:10,828
the alignment is probably the same on

1525
01:36:08,609 --> 01:36:12,899
all these so I can probably just do this

1526
01:36:10,828 --> 01:36:14,038
right I don't need to like manually

1527
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:15,058
align each of those because they're

1528
01:36:14,038 --> 01:36:18,630
gonna all be the same

1529
01:36:15,059 --> 01:36:19,889
I would assume anyway uh so yeah let's

1530
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:21,420
find out why that matches we're

1531
01:36:19,889 --> 01:36:24,929
happening weird because I assume all

1532
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:31,319
those folks got different tag values and

1533
01:36:24,929 --> 01:36:34,559
so I feel like they should all have like

1534
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:38,340
they should all have different pics

1535
01:36:34,559 --> 01:36:41,880
there and I'm not sure why what you can

1536
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:44,099
see is it looks like it's biased against

1537
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:46,078
things that don't have the tag in them

1538
01:36:44,099 --> 01:36:47,909
at all so in other words things that

1539
01:36:46,078 --> 01:36:51,058
have snow or things that have damaged

1540
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:52,888
are both matching like reasonably but

1541
01:36:51,059 --> 01:36:54,960
things that have neither are not

1542
01:36:52,889 --> 01:36:56,099
matching right so it's like it's it's

1543
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,748
like refusing against that are saying

1544
01:36:56,099 --> 01:37:00,538
that doesn't have the channels that were

1545
01:36:57,748 --> 01:37:02,069
requested at all but I'm not sure why it

1546
01:37:00,538 --> 01:37:03,569
would do that because in theory if those

1547
01:37:02,069 --> 01:37:05,549
values are 0 that shouldn't actually

1548
01:37:03,569 --> 01:37:07,768
give it much but maybe that's because

1549
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:11,820
we're doing some kind of other thing

1550
01:37:07,769 --> 01:37:14,248
there but anyway other than that it

1551
01:37:11,819 --> 01:37:17,099
looks okay and you can see like yeah

1552
01:37:14,248 --> 01:37:18,630
treat evergreen never got picked even

1553
01:37:17,099 --> 01:37:20,159
though there should be some where these

1554
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:22,498
have less than point each of these are

1555
01:37:20,158 --> 01:37:28,198
less than 0.5 it should be the preferred

1556
01:37:22,498 --> 01:37:35,689
right at that point but it's not and I'm

1557
01:37:28,198 --> 01:37:45,808
not sure why looking at the asset picker

1558
01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:49,189
if the tag just doesn't if the if the

1559
01:37:45,809 --> 01:37:49,190
tie just doesn't exist at all

1560
01:37:57,979 --> 01:38:03,769
see we're looping over the tags the

1561
01:38:00,288 --> 01:38:07,788
asset actually has right and then what

1562
01:38:03,769 --> 01:38:11,179
we do is say all right for each tag that

1563
01:38:07,788 --> 01:38:13,518
the asset actually has it gets like a

1564
01:38:11,179 --> 01:38:15,679
better it gets the more things that can

1565
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:20,329
match the better so I guess the problem

1566
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:23,840
that we see here is that if you didn't

1567
01:38:20,328 --> 01:38:29,719
have a tag at all then you don't get any

1568
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:32,889
credit for it in the match so even

1569
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:45,050
though you were closer it doesn't count

1570
01:38:32,889 --> 01:38:48,498
and I'm not sure that maybe the way we

1571
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:50,510
want it to be you know because we may

1572
01:38:48,498 --> 01:38:52,458
want to control what the parameters are

1573
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:53,599
of the matching so like I don't know you

1574
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:56,179
know one way to look at it would be

1575
01:38:53,599 --> 01:38:57,949
you'd want to do this for things that

1576
01:38:56,179 --> 01:39:02,229
were on there and another way would be

1577
01:38:57,948 --> 01:39:02,228
well oops

1578
01:39:07,269 --> 01:39:12,380
right and that would allow you to say

1579
01:39:10,130 --> 01:39:13,578
like okay this all participates in the

1580
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:16,639
matching so we're not trying to like

1581
01:39:13,578 --> 01:39:18,529
eliminate anybody but really my son my

1582
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:20,059
feeling on that is it's probably just

1583
01:39:18,529 --> 01:39:21,618
needs that we need to extend the tag

1584
01:39:20,059 --> 01:39:28,248
system to know the difference between

1585
01:39:21,618 --> 01:39:34,488
those two types of picking right and say

1586
01:39:28,248 --> 01:39:40,248
oh all right if we're going to pick

1587
01:39:34,488 --> 01:39:41,958
amongst these then you can tell me if a

1588
01:39:40,248 --> 01:39:44,139
tag is something that should always

1589
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:46,309
count whether you've got it or not

1590
01:39:44,139 --> 01:39:47,719
and or whether it's something that

1591
01:39:46,309 --> 01:39:49,340
should only count for people who

1592
01:39:47,719 --> 01:39:51,828
actually have the tag right and I think

1593
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:54,708
those two need to be kind of handled

1594
01:39:51,828 --> 01:39:57,948
separately anyway that's fine for today

1595
01:39:54,708 --> 01:40:00,429
so I'll go ahead and go to Q&amp;A here let

1596
01:39:57,948 --> 01:40:00,428
me go ahead and

1597
01:40:13,789 --> 01:40:17,819
and while we're at it I'm a while I'm

1598
01:40:16,409 --> 01:40:21,809
waiting for the questions to come in we

1599
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:25,049
could also add lamp back in so the thing

1600
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:27,720
that does the add lamp this thing if we

1601
01:40:25,050 --> 01:40:30,029
actually did do add lamp we could now

1602
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:31,680
actually place a lamp which we don't

1603
01:40:30,029 --> 01:40:35,009
really want to do because it's gonna be

1604
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:37,230
stupid and weird because there's gonna

1605
01:40:35,010 --> 01:40:39,570
be so many stupid lamps like you can see

1606
01:40:37,229 --> 01:40:41,519
like just how much light there is but

1607
01:40:39,569 --> 01:40:45,059
what we could do is just put one in each

1608
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:55,620
room so this on lamp maybe it only does

1609
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:59,900
just like just this one for now and so

1610
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:59,899
on here it will place the lamp

1611
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:41,329
all right so if I said we had an on lamp

1612
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:42,560
now then this same thing would happen

1613
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:44,930
right

1614
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:52,039
and this actually here could just be

1615
01:41:44,930 --> 01:42:01,250
shared probably and so I don't know

1616
01:41:52,039 --> 01:42:09,170
something like this where is that add

1617
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:12,319
lamp yeah so add lamp would then become

1618
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:15,199
one of those like helper functions so

1619
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:21,949
yeah like much like add scenery or

1620
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:23,929
whatever it is I know that was your

1621
01:42:21,949 --> 01:42:24,679
summer right we just had it add obstacle

1622
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:27,440
that's what it was

1623
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:32,180
so we'd have like a gen create entity

1624
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:35,059
add lamp for now and I don't know it

1625
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:37,840
would be like well actually I guess we

1626
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:41,210
don't really even need that because

1627
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:51,430
probably what you would do is just do

1628
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:51,430
this and so that's the color of the lamp

1629
01:42:51,520 --> 01:43:01,760
right and this would just be the

1630
01:42:59,029 --> 01:43:07,219
obstacle a durp thingy and we would say

1631
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:09,590
well it's a lamp right so you don't

1632
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:11,930
really need an actual add lamp call

1633
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:13,340
because the add lamp is not actually

1634
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:15,470
having to do anything that the scenery

1635
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:19,430
doesn't do it just sticks another one on

1636
01:43:15,470 --> 01:43:24,530
there right so this is like the light

1637
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:26,090
the lamp light let's say so I think that

1638
01:43:24,529 --> 01:43:28,279
would do it I don't know that we need

1639
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:30,170
anything else there for that and so now

1640
01:43:28,279 --> 01:43:31,429
we could also have little lamps again

1641
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:32,000
they're just kind of scattered around in

1642
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:35,470
a stupid way

1643
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,470
that doesn't make any sense

1644
01:43:40,199 --> 01:43:49,649
this has to look like that and then I

1645
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:59,740
think we're good

1646
01:43:49,649 --> 01:44:02,409
maybe so now we've got little lamps in

1647
01:43:59,739 --> 01:44:03,849
there and that's fine so there's always

1648
01:44:02,409 --> 01:44:04,840
lamps in the corner of every room for no

1649
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:07,870
reason

1650
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:15,520
and you know we can align those a little

1651
01:44:07,869 --> 01:44:17,680
bit better too if you want to so yeah if

1652
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:20,820
I go over here and look at that and I

1653
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:26,340
want to make that seem like it's not

1654
01:44:20,819 --> 01:44:40,359
totally wrong it's probably like

1655
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:45,480
something like that maybe let's say so

1656
01:44:40,359 --> 01:44:48,489
now we've got the furniture lamp thing

1657
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:49,419
and that's fine and we still don't

1658
01:44:48,489 --> 01:44:52,029
really know we're gonna do about the

1659
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:53,649
chairs oh yeah we got lamps outdoors

1660
01:44:52,029 --> 01:44:55,889
that's good probably shouldn't do that

1661
01:44:53,649 --> 01:44:55,889
huh

1662
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:18,880
all right got any question that's what

1663
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:21,719
do you got for questions we'll be fixing

1664
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:26,279
the lighting who knows when I want to

1665
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:26,279
what's your favorite game of all time

1666
01:45:26,969 --> 01:45:31,960
mm-maybe Dance Dance Revolution is there

1667
01:45:30,488 --> 01:45:34,479
going to be lighting affecting the

1668
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:36,609
shading of the entities yes if so would

1669
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:39,579
that lighting strength be uniform along

1670
01:45:36,609 --> 01:45:41,829
the height of unity within a square no

1671
01:45:39,579 --> 01:45:43,658
we'd probably do a little bit more than

1672
01:45:41,829 --> 01:45:48,250
that just to add some directionality to

1673
01:45:43,658 --> 01:45:51,069
it but you know it'll depend a little

1674
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:53,560
bit on on how we end up wanting that to

1675
01:45:51,069 --> 01:45:55,118
work when we get a little closer let me

1676
01:45:53,560 --> 01:46:02,469
get a little closer to wanting to deal

1677
01:45:55,118 --> 01:46:07,408
with that if you have normal maps you

1678
01:46:02,469 --> 01:46:07,408
can also do other stuff there right

1679
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:14,080
suppose no he's supposed to point in

1680
01:46:12,219 --> 01:46:15,939
whatever direction you pointed him so

1681
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:18,460
you can appoint him in any direction you

1682
01:46:15,939 --> 01:46:20,979
want there is an art bug right now where

1683
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:22,539
the in the actual art file the left

1684
01:46:20,979 --> 01:46:23,919
that's supposed to point left and that's

1685
01:46:22,539 --> 01:46:26,380
supposed to point right but the heads

1686
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:28,239
are reversed so that's why there's a bug

1687
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:33,250
filed in the github when we get an art

1688
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:34,750
pack update that will fix itself like

1689
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:36,698
you're supposed to be able to like punch

1690
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:40,829
backward and walk forward so it's never

1691
01:46:36,698 --> 01:46:40,829
supposed to change your facing direction

1692
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,520
if that makes sense

1693
01:46:56,170 --> 01:47:01,250
thoughts on creating some sort of

1694
01:46:57,979 --> 01:47:06,679
weather system and/or sun noon dusk etc

1695
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:12,859
system well in our case we have an

1696
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:16,820
inbound lighting direction we haven't

1697
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:19,309
really played too much with it yet but

1698
01:47:16,819 --> 01:47:21,019
basically what happens there is you

1699
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:29,630
could for free

1700
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:32,570
probably just change that I'm guessing

1701
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:34,400
to just make it be like day or night or

1702
01:47:32,569 --> 01:47:35,509
whatever if you could just change that

1703
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:37,099
inbound lighting direction and that

1704
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:43,030
would probably give you most of what you

1705
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:43,030
want right that makes sense

1706
01:48:02,288 --> 01:48:06,550
it seems like the tree graphics are for

1707
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:11,009
different seasons I don't think the one

1708
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:15,969
evergreen is supposed to be damaged oh

1709
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:17,800
so you think that that's no I think

1710
01:48:15,969 --> 01:48:20,859
that's supposed to be damaged I don't

1711
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:27,038
know though I agree that snow might be

1712
01:48:20,859 --> 01:48:28,328
pointless how will we do shadows I don't

1713
01:48:27,038 --> 01:48:31,059
know how we want to do shadows we

1714
01:48:28,328 --> 01:48:33,460
probably will just use some darkening of

1715
01:48:31,059 --> 01:48:36,630
the region underneath for that I'm not

1716
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:36,630
sure how we want to do that yet

1717
01:48:37,658 --> 01:48:43,448
I don't super miss them much so I don't

1718
01:48:42,309 --> 01:48:45,099
know how much I really care about

1719
01:48:43,448 --> 01:48:53,368
anything other than darkening the area

1720
01:48:45,099 --> 01:48:55,989
underneath seems probably fine so yeah

1721
01:48:53,368 --> 01:48:58,238
but you're right snow should probably

1722
01:48:55,988 --> 01:49:01,118
not be there probably winter is better

1723
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:06,308
so that it's more uniform that seems

1724
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:13,359
probably like a good idea so if we can I

1725
01:49:06,309 --> 01:49:21,820
revert this buffer no so if I kill and

1726
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:26,969
then reload this and look for snow maybe

1727
01:49:21,819 --> 01:49:26,969
this should be winter oops winter

1728
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:47,760
like that and then maybe we could change

1729
01:49:39,448 --> 01:49:52,319
the tags to not have that so this tag is

1730
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:58,469
like deprecated now wait up well I guess

1731
01:49:52,319 --> 01:50:00,059
I can just mow since we reparse I could

1732
01:49:58,469 --> 01:50:11,569
just even change them but I'm not going

1733
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:15,090
to so so I'm going to remove that one

1734
01:50:11,569 --> 01:50:18,599
sort of temporarily and if we go could

1735
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:24,210
condense the tags I'll change it around

1736
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:31,139
but but for now we'll deprecated that

1737
01:50:24,210 --> 01:50:33,739
tag and make a deal with trans dead I do

1738
01:50:31,139 --> 01:50:33,739
think that's a good idea

1739
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:35,989
alright looks like we're good so I'm

1740
01:51:33,449 --> 01:51:35,989
going to close it up

1741
01:51:47,559 --> 01:51:50,838
thank you everyone for joining me from

1742
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:53,058
episode of handmade heroes my pleasure

1743
01:51:50,838 --> 01:51:54,618
coding with you as always if you want to

1744
01:51:53,059 --> 01:51:55,849
follow along the series at home you can

1745
01:51:54,618 --> 01:51:57,978
always peer to the game on handmade hero

1746
01:51:55,849 --> 01:52:00,469
org and it comes with a source code

1747
01:51:57,979 --> 01:52:02,239
and we will try to in the very near

1748
01:52:00,469 --> 01:52:06,378
future since we're kind of wrapping up

1749
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:08,238
the art import stuff put up a complete

1750
01:52:06,378 --> 01:52:11,358
set of the current art assets as they

1751
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:12,918
exist on my machine that should help get

1752
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:14,539
us to a point where it's pretty easy for

1753
01:52:12,918 --> 01:52:16,488
new people to just download and build

1754
01:52:14,538 --> 01:52:17,448
and build their art assets as well which

1755
01:52:16,488 --> 01:52:18,529
is something we hadn't really be able to

1756
01:52:17,448 --> 01:52:20,208
do in the past because it was kind of

1757
01:52:18,529 --> 01:52:21,798
like piece mail so that'll be a nice

1758
01:52:20,208 --> 01:52:23,118
thing to do too and maybe next weekend

1759
01:52:21,798 --> 01:52:24,378
we can get to that point cuz it seems

1760
01:52:23,118 --> 01:52:25,608
like things are going pretty well at

1761
01:52:24,378 --> 01:52:27,788
this point we should be able to kind of

1762
01:52:25,609 --> 01:52:31,819
do a an art pack update at that point

1763
01:52:27,788 --> 01:52:32,898
that's about it until next week have fun

1764
01:52:31,819 --> 01:52:35,919
programming and I'll see everyone on the

1765
01:52:32,899 --> 01:52:35,919
Internet take it easy everybody
