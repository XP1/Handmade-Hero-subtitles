1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:07,169
hey everyone its case from handmade here

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,460
here wanted to go over what the handmade

3
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,750
fund is for those of you who don't know

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,969
or even for those of you who already

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,980
decided to contribute but maybe don't

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:16,948
know some of the stuff that it does so

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,140
on handmade hero we produce a lot of

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,609
episodes that go over all kinds of low

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,589
level programming and that sort of stuff

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,510
and that's the part that I do but

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,579
actually ever since I started it there's

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,460
been a lot of people out there on the

13
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:31,409
internet who have made things related to

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,850
the series or that branched off or that

15
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,700
did things that were inspired by the

16
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,149
series some of which are kind of awesome

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,730
and we wanted to try and help them be

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,799
supported as they try to make them more

19
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,898
usable or more complete or continue

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,979
working on them and dedicating a

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,390
significant lot of time to them so

22
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,128
that's what the handmade fund does it

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,049
basically allows people who enjoy

24
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,628
handmade hero to contribute to a fund

25
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:56,609
that they know will pay out to various

26
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:58,530
people making stuff that goes along with

27
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:00,299
the series or that helps out other

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,058
people doing things related to the

29
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:05,670
series so two of the big things that we

30
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,158
do that we support on handmade fund our

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,269
handmade Network and the antidote guides

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,340
I just want to kind of show you what

33
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,048
those were handmade Network if you've

34
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,810
never seen it is actually the place that

35
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,549
hosts forums for handmade hero we don't

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,930
host any ourselves but they host forums

37
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,150
for handmade hero that lots of people

38
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,890
participate in it's a place where people

39
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,770
can ask questions about things that are

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,569
happening on the series and episodes

41
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,859
that they maybe need help following

42
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,389
along with or just general questions

43
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,549
related the series if they have and

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,500
there's tons of people out there who

45
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,090
frequent the forums who help answer

46
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,469
those questions and help people through

47
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,700
if they're trying to stuff like compile

48
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,289
something that isn't working or stuff

49
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,060
like that and it's a great resource for

50
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,240
that but it's actually so much more than

51
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,540
that

52
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,368
if you click on the main handmade hero

53
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,530
site so just go to handmade sorry if you

54
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:51,478
go to the made handmade Network site not

55
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,670
the hero portion of it then you actually

56
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:56,340
get a whole host of projects that are

57
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,290
kind of in the handmade theme right

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,710
things which are for example the STP

59
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,930
libraries that are very popular are now

60
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:06,179
hosted here people are making debugger

61
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,479
projects there's people making some

62
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,760
games that are handmade there's a series

63
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,520
making an entire like VLSI stack thing

64
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,859
and

65
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,719
handmade CPU and all this stuff there's

66
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,360
just great projects on here and of

67
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,340
course for coder the editor that we use

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,440
on handmade here was actually hosted on

69
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,069
here now forums for that so there's just

70
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,689
a ton of projects that go kind of

71
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,799
alongside of handmade hero that are by

72
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,180
completely different people doing

73
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,620
completely different things but that you

74
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,540
are probably interested in if you're

75
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,280
interested in handmade hero and handmade

76
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:38,409
network has gathered those all into one

77
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,759
place just a great resource and so one

78
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:41,199
of things we do on handmade fun is we

79
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,479
just pale all the hosting costs for that

80
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,069
and we'd like to be able to keep doing

81
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,229
that that's one of the really big

82
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:48,969
reasons why we want handmade fun to

83
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:50,319
continue to be successful so we can pay

84
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,180
for that because it's all volunteer

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,310
based they did an amazing job on the

86
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,740
site and we don't want them to have to

87
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,060
pay the cost of hosting as well so we

88
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,640
try to fund that and that's one of the

89
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,640
big things we do another big thing we do

90
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,769
with handmade fund is we fund this

91
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,509
amazing episode guide this was

92
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,340
originally a work of several people out

93
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:13,149
there and now it's maintained almost

94
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:17,200
entirely by one person and it's a

95
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,360
massive massive archive of time markers

96
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,219
that say basically everything that

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,660
happened on handmade heroes so one of

98
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,219
the things that's true about handmade

99
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:25,990
hero since it's supposed to capture all

100
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:29,229
of the programming for a game there's

101
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,520
just hundreds of hours a video there and

102
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:32,619
if you're looking for something specific

103
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,150
or just want to watch a particular thing

104
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,710
or have a question that you think might

105
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,110
already be answered it would be

106
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,120
impossible to find that if it weren't

107
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,030
for this episode guy it's amazing let me

108
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,740
just show you how crazy this thing is if

109
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,509
you want to see all the times that

110
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,939
OpenGL is discussed you can literally

111
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:51,189
just type OpenGL and not only does it

112
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:53,469
give you a huge listing of everything

113
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:56,409
that I've ever done that had something

114
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:59,020
to do with OpenGL or the file related to

115
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,990
OpenGL or a function that had open shell

116
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,080
in the name but you can click right on

117
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,990
one of these things and it will jump you

118
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,520
to that place in that episode I'll

119
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,950
discuss sort of some things that we can

120
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,050
do and some things that we can't do so

121
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:16,180
if you take a look at what happens in

122
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,420
our right and it's even got the time

123
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,769
here you can jump directly to it and you

124
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,020
can see all the rest of stuff that

125
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,039
happened now it's even crazier than that

126
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:27,079
it's got Webley

127
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,240
that reference for things that reference

128
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,430
out to other things you can actually

129
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,100
just get hyperlinks in here to them so

130
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,980
it's a great viewer for the series in

131
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,670
addition to just being a good way to

132
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,730
find things

133
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,160
it also has stuff like labels on them

134
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,810
where you know I've done things like if

135
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,020
I go on a rant or something it's got

136
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,339
that or if I say something related to a

137
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:51,829
specific thing it's got that in there

138
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:54,019
there's also the the credits list you

139
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:55,069
can see who contributed to this part of

140
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:57,019
the series there are other people

141
00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:00,019
involved all sorts of stuff like that

142
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:01,490
right and even a quote thing which I

143
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:03,949
probably say a lot of stupid things that

144
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,170
handmade here well they're all captured

145
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,449
in here so that's another thing we fund

146
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,920
out of the handmade fund and we'd love

147
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,899
to continue doing that because it's

148
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,550
thanks to the handmade fund we can pay

149
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:16,279
to have it kept completely up to date

150
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,040
for the entire series and so every time

151
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,899
a new series airs it actually goes up on

152
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,120
there so that's what we do with handmade

153
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,679
fund right now and as handmade fund

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,649
expands if more people contribute to it

155
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,780
we will give more to those projects and

156
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:31,459
we'll also set aside money for other

157
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:34,129
projects as we can find them one of the

158
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:36,469
big things we'd like to do is get a new

159
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,909
debugger out there that we can use and

160
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,020
we'd also like to give some more money

161
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,670
to the image program that we use on on

162
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:45,529
handmade hero it's called Milton it's

163
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,300
this drawing program that I use every

164
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:50,479
episode that was actually made by

165
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,310
someone in response this series as well

166
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,319
and so there's just been so many great

167
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,879
products out there there is no lack of

168
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,949
people to fund with handmade funds so

169
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,810
we'd love to expand it and have more

170
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,599
money to give away every month to people

171
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,910
doing great things now you may also ask

172
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,980
in addition to those things that that

173
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,870
I've been showing that maybe you think

174
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,720
are worth funding another question would

175
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,360
be what do I get if I fund because it's

176
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,430
not nothing actually I put together a

177
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,960
little bonus pack as a thank you and

178
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,759
I'll just kind of go over some of that

179
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,509
stuff now basically what I did is I went

180
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,370
back over old code stuff that I had back

181
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,750
from when I was in junior high school or

182
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,930
in high school or stuff where and I used

183
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,740
to program

184
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,660
in das or in in the very early like win

185
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,300
3-1 days that sort of stuff that can

186
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,860
still be run on today's computers and I

187
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,329
kind of pulled that source code together

188
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,520
and I put together a little bonus pack

189
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:43,349
and it's something that will update over

190
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,439
time as we have more stuff to add to it

191
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:49,080
as well so if you take a look when you

192
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:53,300
subscribe to handmade fun no matter how

193
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:55,800
much you you pledge the support and and

194
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,270
it doesn't matter which level you get

195
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,759
the bonus pack so it's just included

196
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:02,009
with every contribution no matter large

197
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,389
or small and what we have in it is we've

198
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,680
got a concept art directory that we're

199
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,900
going to fill up with handmade hero of

200
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,550
concept art I put all of yankton's

201
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,589
original concept art in there we're

202
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,870
gonna put Anna's concept art in there

203
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,849
too as more comes online sort of stuff

204
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,620
so that and we'll probably put other

205
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,439
handmade hero related art things in here

206
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,569
eventually as we go as the serious kind

207
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,219
of goes more to completion but in

208
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,449
addition to those we've got all the

209
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,460
programs I was talking about and I just

210
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,250
kind of go over some of those right now

211
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:31,049
so starting really early on we've got

212
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,360
this das directory and I actually just

213
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,460
kind of rigged DOSBox to be able to play

214
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,740
these there's a number of different

215
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,750
amusing little programs in here that I

216
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,538
made for example this is my very first

217
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,610
triangle rasterizer you can see it doing

218
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,579
a test of a texture map Karoshi ated

219
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,990
triangle in das right you can see it

220
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,310
varying the colors it didn't have

221
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,918
differing it sees some really bad

222
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,079
banding there right for example and this

223
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,060
is just kind of like you know amusing

224
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:58,949
stuff that you had to do back then and

225
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,870
when I was first learning so you know

226
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,080
you can go in here and it's actually got

227
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,120
you know the original C files as they

228
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,769
were at the time that I wrote them and

229
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,079
you can go through and see what it

230
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,639
looked like some of it's actually very

231
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,598
similar to the way I program now some

232
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,038
things haven't changed

233
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,288
other things have changed quite a bit

234
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,360
and it's kind of interesting to see what

235
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,668
those look like so there's a bunch of

236
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,889
stuff like that other das things there's

237
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:24,418
like a little crazy like a flight

238
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:27,150
simulator thing that I had been working

239
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:29,158
on there that's that's really nuts it's

240
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:31,019
kind of when I was just first figuring

241
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:33,059
out how to do 3d stuff it's it's super

242
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:35,218
touchy I think probably because you know

243
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,078
I maybe it ran at a much slower frame

244
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,329
rate or maybe the mice were a lot less

245
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:41,139
sensitive back then I don't know but

246
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:44,120
it's kind of just a

247
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:45,470
what kind of back down memory lane when

248
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,019
I look at these things to sort of see

249
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,639
how you know things that nowadays I

250
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:53,659
would think are kind of laughably simple

251
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,860
to make or were like really hard for me

252
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,179
back then as I was just learning and

253
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,528
stuff and again all the source codes

254
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:00,528
included in that so you can kind of see

255
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:02,059
how those things were created as well

256
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:05,059
which is kind of interesting even for me

257
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,379
to look back at now I also included sort

258
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:08,569
of some other things here are some more

259
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:11,269
modern programs for example this is a

260
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,560
prototype 3d prototype that I did I

261
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,360
won't spoil the fun for you launching

262
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,819
that when it's kind of bizarre

263
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,740
it's basically well maybe I will spoil

264
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,160
the fun so if you go in here there's

265
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,009
it's basically a little 3d prototype of

266
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,809
sort of a inside of a cell with a bunch

267
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:30,169
of things in it and it was sort of a it

268
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:32,268
was a cool little prototype of a 3d user

269
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,889
interface back in the day my favorite

270
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:36,169
thing to do is right clicking in this

271
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:37,669
thing it causes the camera to follow

272
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:42,740
something so if you right-click on

273
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:44,208
somebody which is a little hard the

274
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,829
camera will actually kind of follow them

275
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,419
till it gets to them which it takes in a

276
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:49,250
while to do sometimes when they're kind

277
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:51,319
of squirrely and it's just kind of fun

278
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,480
to sort of follow them through the weird

279
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,010
sort of cell membrane thing and it also

280
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,570
had some fun code in it it's just like

281
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:58,100
it's not very much code but does all

282
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,649
sorts of stuff all this is software

283
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,509
rendered with line with like a brush and

284
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,620
ham line routine and it even has picking

285
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,819
and that all sort of stuff that's kind

286
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,049
of fun to see how it goes in there and

287
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,640
of course everyone was named after

288
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:08,469
people from the book hackers I think is

289
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,389
where that came from

290
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,820
anyway so it's got some of that stuff in

291
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:15,350
there also a little product I did

292
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,300
again a long time ago these are like

293
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,409
high school era stuff where I just made

294
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,359
like a little program for mapping

295
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,490
adventure games this one was kind of fun

296
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,990
I still really like the interface it

297
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,230
basically is a really quick interface

298
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,209
for making sort of adventure games we

299
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,129
adventure game maps that I thought was

300
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,989
kind of cool it's still like a really

301
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,278
fluid and fun way to do it I find it's

302
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,500
like a nice way to click through it I

303
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,028
really like the interface anyway so a

304
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,589
bunch of these things are here all of

305
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:41,750
the source is included for all of them

306
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,250
so you can pick through it and there's a

307
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,570
little thank-you file that actually

308
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,879
lists what they all are in case you

309
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,440
forget from my pretty poor description

310
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,049
there and you can kind of go through

311
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,190
those and again we add to those

312
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,929
occasionally when we find things that we

313
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,399
think would be interesting in there just

314
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:57,169
from the archivist we can put in there

315
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,820
maybe we'll add some more stuff later

316
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:01,519
but we update it you know once a year or

317
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,040
so with some new stuff as we as we find

318
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,679
it so anyway that's the entirety of

319
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:10,399
handmade fund we'd love it if you want

320
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,109
to contribute and we try very hard to

321
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,750
make sure that it's a lot easier than

322
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,669
say patreon or anything like that it's

323
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,350
pretty much just processing fees there

324
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:20,389
is no one who takes anything off the top

325
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,769
it's handled entirely by us so it's

326
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,360
basically just credit card processing

327
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:25,610
fees is the only part that comes out of

328
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,370
your donation and we tried pretty hard

329
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,930
to make the donation model be something

330
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,149
that would minimize those fees so for

331
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:34,159
example unlike on something like patreon

332
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,769
if you want to give a dollar a month to

333
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,299
a project that can be very difficult to

334
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,159
do because the credit card processing

335
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:41,809
fees on a dollar are quite high we've

336
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,730
put in things that allow you to do stuff

337
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:45,559
like pledge twelve dollars a year

338
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,240
instead of one dollar month to avoid

339
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,609
having those credit card processing fees

340
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,440
really add up or cause problems for you

341
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,700
so we tried to make that really easy -

342
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,589
if there's things we can do to make it

343
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,550
easier for you please let us know but we

344
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,770
hope that it's pretty straightforward

345
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,088
and again anyone who pledges gets the

346
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,679
bonus pack so that should be straight

347
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,650
for it it happens exactly the same way

348
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,028
as the handmade hero preorder works

349
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,889
where you get a send out will download

350
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:09,019
link and you can go download it anytime

351
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,519
you want as it's waiting ever it's

352
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,458
updated you can go download the new

353
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,929
stuff so hopefully you'll check that out

354
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:17,569
and thank you for taking the time to

355
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:19,429
take a look at handmade fund and look at

356
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,200
it we think that it's already done some

357
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:23,419
really great stuff and we're really

358
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,920
happy that it's something that people

359
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,599
have given - and that we've been able to

360
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:28,149
provide money to people who are doing

361
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,350
awesome stuff so we hope to continue

362
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:32,720
thanks everyone and I'll see you on the

363
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,870
next episode of handmade hero take it

364
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,870
easy
