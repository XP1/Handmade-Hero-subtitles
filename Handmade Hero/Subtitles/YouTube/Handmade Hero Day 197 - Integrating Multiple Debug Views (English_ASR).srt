1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
start recording hello everybody and

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:13,048
welcome to handmade hero show Rico to

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:14,879
complete game live on stream I really do

4
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:16,500
not know exactly what we are going to do

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,519
today I often say that I don't know what

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,039
we're going to do on the stream and I

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,358
mean it a lot of times you're at a point

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,890
on the stream where you're like okay

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,429
there's a number of things we could be

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,199
doing especially when you're you know in

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,289
the middle of a system that sort of got

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,300
multiple multiple axes along which it

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,160
could be improved sometimes it's hard to

14
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,988
know exactly what you should be doing so

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,898
yesterday we implemented some basic

16
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:42,179
debug you I handling and so I assume

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,679
that the best thing today would be to go

18
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,628
ahead and push that a little bit further

19
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,890
but I don't know yet so I'm just going

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,570
to dive right into the code take a look

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,789
at where we are and see what I think is

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,530
the best thing to sort of get the debug

23
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,020
stuff up to a point where I'm happy with

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,600
it and again like I said what I would

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,730
like to do is I'd like to be able to

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
sort of start to pull the debug system

27
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,069
together you I wise into something that

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,170
seems like it's relatively usable to us

29
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,279
that you know we will be able to do the

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,260
sorts of stuff that we want to do with

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,430
it and we have a bunch of things that we

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,170
might want to do with it now we've got

33
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,360
some variables we can tweak we've got a

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,519
profile that you know in a log we can

35
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,909
inspect things like that and so I'd like

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,289
to have some kind of a way of sort of

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,430
starting to pull those together so I

38
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,380
think that's what I'm going to try to do

39
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,729
like I said I don't know exactly how I

40
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:28,469
want to do that yet i'm just going to go

41
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,438
in there and see what the most logical

42
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,688
steps are to take and we'll work from

43
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,739
there so today is day 1 97 that means if

44
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:36,599
you'd like to follow along at home you

45
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:39,390
want to take a 106 is source code and

46
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,069
unpack it into a directory that is what

47
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,329
I am starting with now and so if you

48
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,559
want to follow along with me at home

49
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:47,129
that is what you should be starting with

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,689
as well here is the state of the code as

51
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:53,099
we left it and you know I think most of

52
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:57,539
the things we're working that we did

53
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:59,399
there we we sort of have this this V for

54
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,920
that has not been implemented so we have

55
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,109
not done any of the vector types or

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,530
things like that but we did add

57
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,270
adjustment for four scalar values right

58
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,830
we got that working so the debug camera

59
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:16,420
for example can be adjusted as

60
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:19,060
as necessary and all of our bull values

61
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:20,859
can also be adjusted as well you can

62
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,949
kind of see us playing with that there

63
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,930
so at this point like I said what I want

64
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:27,159
to do is kind of now that we sort of

65
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,710
have a little bit of this in place I

66
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,599
want to start to focus on getting the

67
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,189
debug system like sort of bringing it to

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,859
closure we've got all these like various

69
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:37,329
pieces in there I'd like to sort of try

70
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,160
to figure out how I can get these all

71
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,710
working together into a system that will

72
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,349
allow me to leverage what we've written

73
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,150
and also kind of continue on with with

74
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:48,430
with adding other things that we may

75
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,990
want so if late as leader and the

76
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,180
product if we come across something and

77
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,120
we're like you know what there's there's

78
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,290
probably this new debug thing that we

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,240
would really like to have that would

80
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:00,639
really help us out based on what we're

81
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,980
doing there'll be some clear way of

82
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:06,309
adding that into the system as it stands

83
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:07,659
so that's what I would like to do you

84
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,879
know that's that's how I would like

85
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,349
things to end up so this is kind of

86
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,370
interesting here actually using the room

87
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:17,859
based camera it's pretty funny actually

88
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,230
as I kind of go through it that's that's

89
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,459
pretty amusing I forgot that we have the

90
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:25,268
ability to switch between room based

91
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:28,479
camera and scrolling yeah Oh games

92
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:30,310
they're so wacky and weird all right so

93
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,049
anyway what I'm going to go ahead and do

94
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,550
now is I'm going to go ahead and start

95
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,840
playing around that and the first thing

96
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,160
that I'm going to try is I want to see

97
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,229
what I can do about starting to merge

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,459
this debug view with the ability to view

99
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:48,579
say those those what's what's my called

100
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:53,439
there the the profile the log profile

101
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,780
stuff I'm going to see if I can start a

102
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,120
kind of smoosh those two things together

103
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,759
so that we have a unified way of

104
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,060
interacting with them you know and so

105
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:07,629
one way that that I might try to do that

106
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,949
is is by putting them underneath you

107
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:11,139
know one of these things so that I can

108
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,238
like open up a profile and have it here

109
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,889
but so that I don't have to have it you

110
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,560
know it's something that kind of comes

111
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:19,629
and goes based on based on the hierarchy

112
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,759
right and like i said i don't know that

113
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:24,990
i don't know exactly where this will

114
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,158
lead but we're about to find out

115
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,870
and remember i also want to do a thing

116
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:29,949
where we could tear variables off to put

117
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,418
another thing in there so you know

118
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,639
that's a thing that i would like to do

119
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:36,430
at some point and we'll sort of we'll

120
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:40,658
see as we go how that goes alright so

121
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:45,280
here is a compilation directory there

122
00:04:40,658 --> 00:04:47,500
okay so here is our debug stuff at the

123
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,818
moment the way that we're doing this we

124
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,279
don't have any way of putting something

125
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,629
like the profile group in there but you

126
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,908
know we've got these debug variable

127
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:57,370
types and I it seems pretty clear to me

128
00:04:54,908 --> 00:05:01,060
that we should be able to go ahead and

129
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,439
add a debug hierarchy kind of concept in

130
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,468
here it seems like it should be pretty

131
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,699
straightforward right I should think

132
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:11,829
that I would be able to do something

133
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:13,658
like you know debug variable type I what

134
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:15,278
did I call the counter I think or

135
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:18,158
something like that I should think I

136
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:20,500
could do that and if we take a look at

137
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:23,259
how we've defined these things or rather

138
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,939
how we're drawing these things we should

139
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,759
be able to do something by just you know

140
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,800
taking a look at how I was drawing the

141
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,620
grass before and just start by putting

142
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,158
that into this system right like if I

143
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:39,189
look here we've got this sort of Steve

144
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:43,740
again thing here right if I if I look at

145
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:46,478
this I've kind of got I've kind of got a

146
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,639
thing that already draws them and the

147
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,430
way that the thing draws is it's

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,810
basically got these regions and it's got

149
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,588
its got two things right it's got

150
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,418
regions which are time spans and it's

151
00:05:56,588 --> 00:06:00,728
sort of any given region is in something

152
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:03,158
called a lane you know and each lane is

153
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:06,878
like a cpu I'm sorry each lane is like a

154
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:10,180
thread right so you know I'm not sure

155
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:13,810
exactly what the the faintest way to

156
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,240
create something like this would be but

157
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,319
what it occurs to me when I kind of look

158
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,079
at it is that like you know I kind of I

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,810
would kind of like to potentially view

160
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,698
that stuff in multiple ways like I feel

161
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,408
like I would like to be able to make it

162
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:35,588
so that there isn't necessarily a hard

163
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:37,389
and fast rule about what is in the

164
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:38,709
hierarchy if you look at how we

165
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,539
out here you know when I create these

166
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,810
debug variables there's sort of a hard

167
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,390
and fast rule with that's in there so

168
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,769
when I have a debug group it expects to

169
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,659
have this kind of thing like a first

170
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:53,680
child last child sort of a situation

171
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,870
right and so what I would rather do is

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,110
I'd rather have probably some way of

173
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,689
saying well some things that are you

174
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,920
know in this hierarchy I kind of like to

175
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:06,100
be able to say well they don't

176
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,199
necessarily have permanent storage like

177
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,430
these guys do you know there you know

178
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,110
there may be things that are kind of

179
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,990
transient like we kind of have here

180
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,150
where we've got you know something where

181
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,280
there's just these regions and you know

182
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:20,949
maybe a you know depending on what I've

183
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,689
toggle the regions will show up in as a

184
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,949
series of lanes that can be expanded and

185
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,300
maybe a different way to toggle them

186
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,560
would be show up as a series of function

187
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,400
so we're gonna expand it you know

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,629
something like that and so as I go

189
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,339
through this i'm going to try to think

190
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,079
about whether there's a good way i could

191
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:38,229
make it so that i wouldn't have to worry

192
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,459
about the fact that you know i don't

193
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,759
want to have to sort of create all this

194
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:45,039
stuff at the outset right i'd like to

195
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,579
have some way of doing a more immediate

196
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,960
mode you i sort of thing for that right

197
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,209
and i think i've got a fairly good idea

198
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:54,729
how i might be able to do that okay so

199
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:58,719
if i take a look at when I write these

200
00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:01,030
things out I'm thinking that what i

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,830
could do here is instead of counter what

202
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,599
I might do instead is make something

203
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:06,490
that's more like the top-level iterator

204
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,960
so instead what I'm going to try to do

205
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,879
is I'm going to say that like okay I've

206
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,259
got these debug variables in there and

207
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,459
they kind of say like what which kind of

208
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,110
variable they're looking at or whatever

209
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:18,279
but then I have another thing which is

210
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:22,150
like like debug variable type and it's

211
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:25,149
going to be you know a Elaine you know

212
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:27,250
maybe a lane list or something like a

213
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,829
list of lanes and then maybe I have

214
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,399
another debug variable type which is

215
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:39,718
like a you know some kind of parentage

216
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:42,538
concept so got the lane list in there

217
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,519
and then maybe I have a you know a

218
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:46,679
different thing which is like from a

219
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,019
particular function what was underneath

220
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,309
this function or something like that and

221
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,009
I guess you know maybe that's getting

222
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:54,268
ahead of myself you know counter

223
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,409
functionless counter laying this like

224
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:57,629
that so maybe I'll just start with one

225
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,068
and we'll see where we go from there so

226
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,438
if i wanted to do something like that

227
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:04,169
then what i can do is when we do the

228
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:08,039
create variables right after we do debug

229
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:09,809
create variables we can also do

230
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:14,028
something where we take those variables

231
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:16,500
and we you know create some some

232
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,240
additional you know we kind of a pen due

233
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,019
to the group that we started with right

234
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,639
so i could do something like where we do

235
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:30,089
that add variable thing where is that

236
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:31,318
guy handmade debug variables yeah so

237
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,449
where we do this thing where we do like

238
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:36,769
a debug add variable right I could just

239
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:42,169
at the end of this guy post penned

240
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:44,759
something to do that so let's do like

241
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:47,399
profile by lane or something like that

242
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,629
or profile by thread you know something

243
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,360
like this in fact that's really what I

244
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:54,180
probably should call it how let's call

245
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,949
this a counter thread list so I'm going

246
00:09:54,179 --> 00:10:01,349
to add one of these guys and I gotta add

247
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:03,599
it to one of these contexts here and so

248
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,149
what I'm thinking is I kind of want you

249
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,550
know the variable add stuff to maybe not

250
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,769
do everything itself so maybe what I

251
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:12,539
want to do here right is I want to be

252
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,009
the guy who initializes this context

253
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,360
this kind of makes more sense too

254
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:18,058
because then it doesn't write to this

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,100
thing so I kind of like that better just

256
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:21,838
in general to be honest it's kind of

257
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,430
like all right I can pull that out I can

258
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,430
make it so that I create the context out

259
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:31,769
here and then I called debug variables

260
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:33,448
and I pass the the context into it do I

261
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,899
actually need state in here at all then

262
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:38,729
I don't so you just pass in the context

263
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:43,350
and then once you know you add stuff to

264
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:45,389
the context I can also myself add a

265
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,699
bunch of things to the context you know

266
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,698
what I'm saying so that seems kind of

267
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:52,438
nice so if i do debug add variable to

268
00:10:50,698 --> 00:10:53,458
add something to the context you know

269
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:55,769
what i want to do sort

270
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,409
the direct one here I suppose where I do

271
00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:02,459
context I profile by thread so that's

272
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:05,338
that's good so if i do that that will

273
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:10,948
give me back a debug variable this is

274
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:12,990
the thread thread list and I don't know

275
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:14,849
that we actually need any variables for

276
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,100
that because I think that's just freely

277
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,600
determinants deterministic as it is so I

278
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,420
don't know that there's anything else to

279
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,980
do for that so I'm just going to start

280
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,828
with that as a very basic thing and that

281
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:30,178
would add it to here and i think that

282
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:33,568
should in theory just work right oops I

283
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:37,499
gotta get rid of that at sign at context

284
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:38,938
comes context so again i'm just all I'm

285
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:41,069
doing here is just saying like let's try

286
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:42,990
to stuff these two things together and

287
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:45,618
we'll sort of see what shakes out of it

288
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:50,428
right and we'll see what we can do let's

289
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:52,499
see here at debug state and debug create

290
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:55,970
variables does not need to debug state

291
00:11:52,499 --> 00:12:02,009
there we go so I think if i read this

292
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:05,610
i'm guessing oops drug debug menu do I

293
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:09,959
not set that anymore I thought I did oh

294
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,579
I I did not that's my bad i deleted one

295
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,318
of the lines there that i wanted to keep

296
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:19,669
I want the the debug state route group

297
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:24,198
of the hierarchy there whatever it was I

298
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:30,808
wanted to make sure that I still set it

299
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:33,448
so yeah so here's the root group now I'm

300
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:37,009
setting it correctly and so if i run

301
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:39,899
this i think i should be okay yeah so

302
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:42,688
when we create a debug when we do debug

303
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:46,159
variable to text obviously there is no

304
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:49,618
way to convert this guy and i'm assuming

305
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:52,198
that this is something that when i do

306
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:53,970
right hand made config as well i will

307
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:55,708
have to watch out for because when we do

308
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,990
right hand made config it's going to try

309
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:00,539
to turn that debug variable into text

310
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:03,089
right and i don't actually want to do

311
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:05,549
that or rather I don't want to ever save

312
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:10,500
these guys so you

313
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:13,469
I would I think well yeah maybe or do i

314
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,799
wanna i want them to show up there do I

315
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,089
not want them to show up there I don't

316
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,019
think they need to show up there so

317
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:24,060
anyway in right hand make it fig there's

318
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,230
some stuff that we don't want to do so

319
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,000
when we go through variables will

320
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,039
probably do something like just to test

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,470
whether or not a variable wants to be

322
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:36,179
printed so if you know should be written

323
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:41,490
we'll just check to see if this bar

324
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:48,059
should be written and we'll just have

325
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:49,639
sort of the notion but this thing and

326
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,409
what i can do is i can also put this

327
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:54,028
with the variables themselves so we can

328
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:57,659
just kind of see I'm sorry with the

329
00:13:54,028 --> 00:14:00,809
where's that guy yeah with the variables

330
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:02,370
themselves so we can kind of say what we

331
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,859
want to have happen here right this is

332
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,179
just kind of like a predicate that says

333
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,649
for any given variable type do we want

334
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,939
to save this guy or do we not want to

335
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,700
say this guy like does this guy have to

336
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,200
be processed or not right and so really

337
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,528
what that's going to do be at the moment

338
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:21,089
is very simple which would just be okay

339
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:25,350
whatever the counter thread list is if

340
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:28,020
that's the type then we don't save it if

341
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:30,360
it's is the type we do save it but we

342
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,789
probably kind of add that in right we

343
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,430
kind of we presumably like make more

344
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:37,110
stuff there eventually so we're drawing

345
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:38,729
the menu now we have to think about this

346
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,740
a little bit more too so what we'll do

347
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,740
what we do here is we do debug variable

348
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,180
to text and you know for debug variable

349
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,039
the text now we've got so this notion

350
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,389
that there are functions there are

351
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,389
people who might want to do more

352
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:52,919
complicated you I like their own UI but

353
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,720
that's really easy again since we can

354
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,519
just do whatever we want we don't have

355
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,829
any weird like kind of crazy heart like

356
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,850
like object oriented class hierarchy

357
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:02,359
anything to deal with we can just do

358
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,360
whatever we want

359
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:11,820
so we can just say like okay when we do

360
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:15,149
this text nonsense right we can take the

361
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,620
the sort of the concept of the bounds

362
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,379
right we could we could sort of

363
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,870
formalize this a little bit more we

364
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:25,889
could take the concept of the bounds and

365
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:30,750
then when we I think we should probably

366
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:34,169
roll this up like this right we should

367
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,419
probably do something like that so what

368
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:38,909
we would do here is we basically find

369
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,579
out if there's any sort of cool

370
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:45,240
rendering that we want to be able to do

371
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:48,090
and then you know for the text case we

372
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:56,460
would produce the bounds by doing this

373
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:57,810
sort of action right so we knit we're

374
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,190
just having exactly the same thing that

375
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:03,509
we had before but now it passes through

376
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,980
and sets the bounds but we can now and

377
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,080
this is just for anybody who we don't

378
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,580
know how to do we'll just say hey if we

379
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,710
don't know how to do something with you

380
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,900
then go ahead and try to convert you to

381
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,400
text but if we have some kind of special

382
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,309
rendering that we want to do we can just

383
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,259
do it right so in here where we've got

384
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,239
the counter thread list and we want to

385
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,679
do some kind of rendering to it we need

386
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,759
to be able to produce the bounds and we

387
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:29,669
need to be able to you know draw it so

388
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:36,019
that's actually both relatively you know

389
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:40,469
those are both relatively simple right

390
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:41,929
because all we have to do there is take

391
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,149
a look at that drawing code that we had

392
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:49,229
which we do have around here somewhere

393
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:55,379
right let's see it's around here

394
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:57,500
somewhere p people's here it is right so

395
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:01,409
you can kind of see what's going on here

396
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:05,039
we've got our we've got our profile

397
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:07,440
drawing code and if i take this profile

398
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,549
drawing code and i just do exactly the

399
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,230
same stuff that we were doing for right

400
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:15,299
then I should be able to just insert

401
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,289
that profile into our little hierarchy

402
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,329
pretty easily right

403
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:24,329
so I'm just going to go ahead and pull

404
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,329
this out this entire thing out like so

405
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:32,110
do-do-do-do do-do-do-do there we go and

406
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm just going to stick it right about

407
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:38,519
here and this is just going to be you

408
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:42,190
know I don't know Colonel Boyd raw

409
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:47,259
profile in or something like this you

410
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,910
know okay and what I'm going to do is

411
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,769
I'm just going to say well you know the

412
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,060
profiler just draws in whatever box we

413
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,920
tell it to so what I'm going to do is

414
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:57,129
I'm going to prescribe what the bounce

415
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,570
actually would be right and so here is

416
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,060
like sort of how the bounts are

417
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:02,409
constructed for the other one but I

418
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,759
don't really want to do that instead

419
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,200
what I want to do is just kind of use

420
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,720
the concept that like okay this is where

421
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,610
it would have started certainly so

422
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,019
that's all good although that's on the

423
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:17,859
baseline so we'll probably want to

424
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:20,889
offset it but at the moment that's

425
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:24,459
totally fine so this is the left corner

426
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,990
this is the you know the the top for now

427
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,039
but like I said we're gonna have to

428
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,930
offset I think that's actually the

429
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,129
baseline if i remember correctly i can't

430
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,930
remember but i think that's the baseline

431
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:36,400
so we may want to drop it down by the

432
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:38,830
baseline by the descender height so what

433
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,519
we want to do here is say like okay this

434
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:45,099
is the min corner right and the max

435
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:47,619
corner is going to be whatever the right

436
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:49,599
edge of the screen is which I don't know

437
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:52,179
whatever I don't actually know what that

438
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:56,169
is at the moment because I don't think

439
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,670
we ever define a right edge yeah so I'll

440
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,220
just go ahead and define one here so

441
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,550
we'll have a right edge like that so you

442
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,039
know it'll go over to the right edge and

443
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:09,399
we'll just do however big we want these

444
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:11,200
guys to be right and I don't know how

445
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,090
big it you know one of these graphs

446
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,500
should be we probably want to have some

447
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:16,959
kind of parameter that says how big they

448
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,849
are and so that'll probably something

449
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,730
that we you know we actually stick in a

450
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:23,529
parameter somewhere but for now let's

451
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,539
just say it's 100 pixels tall I don't

452
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:28,769
know why it just is that's how big it is

453
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,769
it's 100 pixels tall

454
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,870
all right okay so we've got our min

455
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,240
corner we've got our max corner here and

456
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,889
so if I want to make a rectangle I could

457
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,870
do that pretty easily I don't need any

458
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:48,720
of this stuff all I'd have to do now is

459
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:50,669
do a recommender max corner and then I

460
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,089
can just say like okay draw the profile

461
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:55,830
in and I would need to pass it you know

462
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:57,539
whatever it needs probably the debug

463
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:58,949
state would be my guess and then just

464
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,839
whatever the bounds are there's the

465
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:04,019
rectangle and so now I just have to make

466
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,449
this function be able to do whatever the

467
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:09,029
debug state you know stuff is that it

468
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,309
needs to do and then I need the bounds

469
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:13,379
right so the profile wreck just comes in

470
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,299
here now and then I can get rid of the

471
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,160
concept of it being in here at all

472
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,889
because now that stuff's in the UI in a

473
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,850
nice kind of clean way and so I can get

474
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,140
rid of all this stuff because I know

475
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:26,309
that I won't be getting called for any

476
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,920
other reason it wasn't weren't trying to

477
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,480
show it wouldn't get called i assume is

478
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,920
there an orthographic call somewhere

479
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,500
else yeah it starts right there so we

480
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,900
don't need that orthographic call either

481
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,839
at least I don't think so yeah there's

482
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,400
no reason to have that so we're all good

483
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,779
we've got the profile wrecked and we can

484
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,950
yeah we can go from there so at the

485
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,210
moment I'm not going to bother with this

486
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,150
although well you know what I could just

487
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:53,730
do it why not there's a profile wrecked

488
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,800
so here we go everything else should

489
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,180
work roughly the same let me go ahead

490
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,990
and look where that profile wrecked is

491
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:04,380
used profile wrecked there we go profile

492
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:08,460
wrecked you know profile wrecked profile

493
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,150
wrecked and off we go got to add that

494
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,150
right edge

495
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:21,519
okay debug should be written that is

496
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:26,829
true that should take the type of the

497
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:30,519
variable rectangle is actually rectangle

498
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:35,970
to I believe render group is probably

499
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:39,369
debug state render group ha and mouse p

500
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:42,819
so we need to do hit detection in here

501
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:45,909
which is totally fine as well Rob

502
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:47,710
profile in with the mouse be in there

503
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,779
but we're going to have to make that

504
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,769
stuff work with what we're doing so I'm

505
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:52,720
going to I'm going to get rid of that

506
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:53,829
hot record bit because we're going to

507
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,720
have to make this work with the rest of

508
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:57,129
the UI or even decide what that's going

509
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,890
to do you I wise because we don't really

510
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,800
know at this point alright so right edge

511
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:08,710
in this case is off of the debug state

512
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:12,339
there we go we've got our texts p what

513
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:18,400
is that for that is not supposed to be

514
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:22,569
there at all yeah that is part of this

515
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:26,320
guy and not necessary so that should

516
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:31,000
just go in there and this should

517
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:33,609
actually be so this since it's going

518
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,880
line advance I assume that at why should

519
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:39,309
actually be adjusted probably as part of

520
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,860
this but maybe it should just be part of

521
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:47,169
the bounds to it advance the way that it

522
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:48,849
does you know because you can see I feel

523
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:53,470
like when you get the text size and you

524
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:55,419
just go I may I don't know I mean can

525
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,829
you you can see why maybe the at why

526
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,380
should just be something that happens

527
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:01,059
out here based on the bounds so I don't

528
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,890
really love this but I'm gonna leave it

529
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:06,460
like this for a second but I do feel

530
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,750
like that's not great you know I feel

531
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,410
like we probably want something more

532
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:13,539
like this in fact you know what I'm just

533
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:17,140
going to do it this way for now so when

534
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:20,349
this guy does debug get text size what I

535
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:23,620
might do is say something like make sure

536
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:24,349
it's a certain size to to avoid like you

537
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:26,689
know

538
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:29,839
things being stacked differently or

539
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,130
something like that but but you know I'm

540
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,720
really just not going to care about that

541
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,610
stuff I'd rather have something that was

542
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,529
that was very reliable and does the same

543
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:38,629
thing every time for every path through

544
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,399
here especially in debug code so i think

545
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,620
what I'd rather do is say you know

546
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,640
forget all this stuff instead what I'm

547
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:46,668
going to do is I'm just going to say

548
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,490
after we draw something you know where

549
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,350
wherever at the at y is and we're going

550
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,029
to advance to the next thing what I'm

551
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:55,879
going to do is take whatever the bounds

552
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:59,058
are and I'm going to get the minimum of

553
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,950
that and the Y parameter of that is like

554
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:03,019
the next is like the lowest part now

555
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:07,400
that I would be advancing to you know

556
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:09,408
what I mean and so like here where we do

557
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,159
that hierarchy uip thing we start at the

558
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:15,380
Y or whatever you can kind of see what

559
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,390
I'm about changing sort of the idea of

560
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,220
what our why is because we want things

561
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,130
now that are not always text instead of

562
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,538
advancing like baseline wise I want it

563
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,520
to actually be like the upper left

564
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:26,990
corner of like the rectangles that we're

565
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,150
drawing of the rectangular things that

566
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,829
we're drawing so what I'm going to do is

567
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,419
I'm going to look at that uip thing

568
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:35,329
right you can see that it does the this

569
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:37,159
thing what uses at why you can see what

570
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:38,658
we did is we took Oh point 5 to type

571
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:41,240
that's the top of the screen then we

572
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:43,460
offset it by the font scale times that

573
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,558
starting base line y so what I'm gonna

574
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,960
do is going to remove that right that's

575
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:50,779
gone now and then what I'm going to do

576
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,340
is when we draw the text before we draw

577
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,279
the text I'm going to consider that

578
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:58,759
offset this offset right here to be

579
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,470
baked into the text drawing so that way

580
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,109
we give the text the upper left corner

581
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,600
and then it will offset down to where

582
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:08,298
the baseline is that way things that

583
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,859
want to draw rectangular lee don't have

584
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,730
to be like Oh where's the baseline

585
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,779
enough they don't have to think about

586
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:17,058
fonts at all which I like better so I

587
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,500
think that's a little more more nice so

588
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,819
we're going to have get min we're going

589
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,480
to get the minimum bounding box and what

590
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:23,689
we're going to do is we're going to

591
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,779
subtract away a spacing y value and the

592
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,640
spacing y value is just how many pixels

593
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:29,690
we want to leave between things so I

594
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,100
don't know you know that maybe we leave

595
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,640
four pixels between things I don't know

596
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:36,589
however many we want let's see get why

597
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,940
you know we could also do

598
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:41,259
some kind of a font scaling sort of

599
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:46,159
situation but anyway dot y must have a

600
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:49,908
class structure Union what is what is

601
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:54,440
this left of dot why what does get min

602
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:57,528
return early does it not return a does

603
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:05,058
not return the vector get min it's

604
00:25:57,528 --> 00:26:07,490
getting in corner very well okay so

605
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:10,220
let's see what's going on here that does

606
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,470
not seem very good our rectangle is not

607
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,360
good what is wrong with our what is

608
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:19,579
wrong with rectangle why is rectangle

609
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:25,509
broken why so I've got my at X in my

610
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:31,250
here and then I get whatever the ah

611
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:33,500
that's that's why right so we need to

612
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:38,119
remember the min corner which is before

613
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,919
we offset this thing right that's

614
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:43,788
actually the sort of the left corner

615
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,890
there of our of our thing and then where

616
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:52,210
we draw the text is offset by the

617
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:52,210
baseline right so where we draw the text

618
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:59,028
oops there we go where we actually draw

619
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:05,450
the text is what's going to be offset by

620
00:26:59,028 --> 00:27:09,079
the baseline like so that's more what

621
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,308
we're looking for so yeah so debug text

622
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,058
out that is where we're actually going

623
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:15,408
to draw the text out and let's see here

624
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:20,898
text be undeclared identifier yeah we

625
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:24,320
don't actually care about that um and we

626
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:27,609
use that there we go alright so let's

627
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,609
try that out ah

628
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:46,519
yeah I say mean court everything ok so

629
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:48,949
that is not that is not good that is bad

630
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,639
that is a bad thing that has happened

631
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,160
here and i am not sure what I did to

632
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,620
deserve that to be honest I feel like

633
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,190
that was correct but apparently it

634
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:03,979
wasn't so okay we have our min corner

635
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:12,860
that is the right location we then want

636
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:14,509
to do a yeah we then want to do a offset

637
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:17,059
to get ourselves to the baseline which

638
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:19,339
we do here and we should draw the text

639
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:21,740
we then take whatever the bounds

640
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:23,689
actually were that we ought that we

641
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,799
produced for whichever one of these you

642
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,049
know whichever case we were actually

643
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,819
working with when we produce the actual

644
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,980
bounds we then say whatever the lowest

645
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:35,240
point wasn't there that's what we want

646
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,500
our new top to be and we're going to

647
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,299
advance we're going to leave a little

648
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,430
bit of space in there so that seems it

649
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:44,000
right to me but I mousey forgetting

650
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,380
something at well for obvious reasons it

651
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,410
you know the fact that it's all

652
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:52,010
scrunched up it's not it's not how it

653
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,750
should go to say the very least so when

654
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,819
I get back this I feel like that should

655
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:01,549
be correct it offsets it by the min

656
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:03,200
corner and so I feel like that ah right

657
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:04,490
so I feel like part of the problem is

658
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,920
this is the top corner so that's

659
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:10,789
actually the max right that's actually

660
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,529
the max corner so I think that because

661
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:15,440
right we're saying we're at the upper

662
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:17,720
the very upper part so when I do here

663
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,110
like this this same thing here when I do

664
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,250
MIT min corner max corner this is that

665
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:24,229
standard thing where I always say I

666
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,460
think going down from the top of the

667
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,950
screen even though that's not the

668
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,680
correct case the min corner would

669
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,360
actually be the low point and the max

670
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,360
corner would be the high point right

671
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:38,659
look you can see there so I did the same

672
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:42,339
thing in this one and so the max corner

673
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,110
is actually going to be

674
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:46,359
or you can't even say max corner because

675
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:49,269
I don't know what the max corner is

676
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:52,719
going to be but point being I just know

677
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:55,480
that I've got sort of my my my left

678
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:01,058
point if you will which is this real

679
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:04,740
value and I've got my top point which is

680
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:07,778
this value and then when we get back

681
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,620
this rectangle and put put it in the

682
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:13,298
bounds what I need to do is say okay

683
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:15,489
that is essentially you know that's the

684
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:20,259
width and height of it right but now I

685
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:22,750
have to offset it by by a specific value

686
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:28,119
that's going to be constructed from

687
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:32,980
these guys so I want to offset it I want

688
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:39,398
to offset it by the the left PX that's

689
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:41,890
correct because I need to move it over

690
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:43,509
so that it starts there but in terms of

691
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,250
why I don't want to move it all the way

692
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,890
up I want to move it all the way up but

693
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,909
I want to move minus its width and I

694
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,890
guess that's why I sort of had

695
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:53,380
instinctively started to do it this way

696
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:56,500
I kind of have to be able to access

697
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,620
bounds itself to know what it is so

698
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,140
whatever like the height of the bounds

699
00:30:59,619 --> 00:31:06,398
actually is however tall the thing is

700
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:10,990
i'm placing i need to offset it by at

701
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:13,000
what by the top less that amount so that

702
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:19,210
it will actually line up properly that

703
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:23,980
makes sense then when we draw we would

704
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:26,319
draw at these at these values like we

705
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:31,269
like we thought before so I think that

706
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:34,558
should be roughly correct I think it may

707
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:34,558
not be it's a good question

708
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:45,819
my mind that's kind of cool-looking by

709
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:49,029
the way all right all right so not quite

710
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:50,740
there yet but getting there slowly but

711
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:52,450
surely working my way out of thinking

712
00:31:50,740 --> 00:32:00,059
from top down from the top of the screen

713
00:31:52,450 --> 00:32:00,059
down okay so

714
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:15,669
do you think uh yeah yeah so debug text

715
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,819
out at that part is not really

716
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:21,519
particularly prob odorous or interesting

717
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:24,759
i don't think it's really just these

718
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,888
guys that are that are yeah that are in

719
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:31,000
the mix so when i create one of these

720
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:33,128
guys with the get text size when i go to

721
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,609
offset it I'm offsetting it by the left

722
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:38,378
PX and i'm moving it up to where i think

723
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:41,019
it should be in the screen based on

724
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:43,298
wherever the at y is right and then I

725
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:45,308
just remove however much height it was

726
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:48,099
so that puts it back you know that

727
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:50,888
aligns its top edge with the top P Y

728
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:52,990
value and that seems just about that

729
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:54,638
seems correct to me and if I look at

730
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:58,269
what's happening here when I do debug

731
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:59,888
text out I think that's correct because

732
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,450
I've starting at the left VX which is

733
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:02,798
where I think I should be and I'm

734
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,870
starting at the top you why but I'm

735
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:07,298
offsetting by whatever the baseline is

736
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:10,388
which is again what I think should

737
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:12,099
probably happen at least that seems like

738
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:16,839
what should happen and then I draw the

739
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:18,819
text once we have those bounds up that's

740
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:24,819
the problem I did not save my offset

741
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:28,000
bounds okay so it's still a little wonky

742
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:30,788
though right it still looks a little bit

743
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,990
weird and I'm not sure what's going on

744
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:33,669
there that's that doesn't seem quite

745
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,899
right and I'm not getting the

746
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:37,690
highlighting that I would have expected

747
00:33:34,898 --> 00:33:40,750
to get so I'm still I'm thinking that

748
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:44,048
the bounds must still be a little bit

749
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:48,398
weird right although I didn't actually

750
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:50,769
look to see when i set the item color

751
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:53,798
okay that's the problem so i also need

752
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:55,388
to set my item color before i draw

753
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:59,470
things right that's obviously got to

754
00:33:55,388 --> 00:34:02,008
have to happen so let's see so all right

755
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,808
so we're in much better shape now

756
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:07,929
however when i open this guy I'm kind of

757
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:12,418
getting my code is getting stuck here

758
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:15,150
what is the what is the oddity here and

759
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:18,089
make it fig ah

760
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:20,380
man it's it's been a sloppy day today

761
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,390
it's been a sloppy day today so things

762
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,160
that should not get written obviously

763
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,739
all we really want to prevent them from

764
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,230
doing is that we don't want to stop them

765
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:31,329
from iterating otherwise we'll go into

766
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,949
it go into an infinite loop where we

767
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:36,610
just loop on VAR all day even though VAR

768
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:40,210
is not changing all right so we're

769
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,800
getting a little better here and we can

770
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,599
sort of we still have a little bit of a

771
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,039
weird positioning thing you can see what

772
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,980
sort of happening there I believe that's

773
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,840
because we're taking into account again

774
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,639
the rectangles it depends whether you

775
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,870
have a descender how big your rectangle

776
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,549
is so that was the thing I sing before

777
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:56,529
we might want to sort of change a little

778
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,539
bit but you can also see now that we

779
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,000
have done the the first part of what we

780
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:05,050
wanted to actually do which is to

781
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,019
include one of these profiles in line

782
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:10,539
with our actual with the rest of our

783
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:12,340
actual stuff and so if I wanted to make

784
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:14,710
that expandable or collapsible all I

785
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,890
would have to do now is actually make a

786
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,179
group for it to live inside right so

787
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:22,329
that it can be expanded and collapsed

788
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:24,429
that you know because right now it

789
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:26,529
doesn't have any way of doing that so

790
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:29,710
when I add that thread list what i can

791
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,000
do is inside hamidou you know variables

792
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,220
stuff we have this ability to kind of

793
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,510
open groups and close them so what I can

794
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,909
do in here is just a look all right

795
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,250
let's go ahead and get a group around

796
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:40,980
that guy like so and this will just be

797
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,389
like profile or something I don't know

798
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,750
and you know I probably just called it

799
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:53,109
this by thread I suppose so if I've got

800
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:55,809
this wrapping the thread then I should

801
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:58,510
be able to when I open up the profile

802
00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:01,599
you can see that now I've got that stuff

803
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:04,060
by thread there and you know I can

804
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,489
interact with it some degree I don't

805
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:07,719
think we want to yeah we're going to

806
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:09,399
have to think about exactly again how to

807
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,500
make this the UI for this thing a little

808
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,539
bit better but now we can at least kind

809
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,909
of open and close it along with

810
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:17,980
everything else we do have to do one

811
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:20,710
more thing which is that if we want we

812
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,449
probably want to fix those sort of guys

813
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,510
who are doing debug text line outs at

814
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:26,889
the bottom there because they're they're

815
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,170
not lined up properly and that's just

816
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:30,848
because when we actually sort of

817
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:35,680
print this stuff out where we do the

818
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:37,900
draw you know the menu draw stuff what I

819
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:41,078
want to make sure is that here right

820
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:44,230
we're sort of taking that at why I feel

821
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,970
like it's not quite it must I don't know

822
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,500
if that's because i'm setting the bounds

823
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:49,000
room on the min corner or something like

824
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,639
that but you can see that like

825
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,829
afterwards when we take this stuff oh I

826
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:56,379
know why it's because the debug text

827
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:58,990
line stuff does not include this offset

828
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:02,108
right it does not include the offset

829
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:06,039
doesn't use that top corner and so when

830
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:07,989
we do like debug text line text out at

831
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:11,380
the automatic stuff here where we're

832
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:13,899
using debug state at why that really has

833
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,450
to be again adjusted by the baseline

834
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,730
value if we want it to actually work

835
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:22,568
right if we want to be like Oh everybody

836
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:24,670
using sort of the min corner right but

837
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:30,130
then it's all good right then everybody

838
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:35,559
lines up properly and so on so i think

839
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:37,210
that seems pretty reasonable at least so

840
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:41,730
far right that all seems pretty

841
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,730
reasonable and hey now we can sort of

842
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:47,349
let's am I doing here now we can sort of

843
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,329
get that that profile in line and just

844
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:53,500
open it when we want it and so on right

845
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:55,690
and that's all pretty easy so yeah the

846
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,199
next step here is just to start making

847
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:03,130
this a little bit more sensible so I

848
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,929
feel like probably we'd want to clean up

849
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,490
a little bit of this stuff and then we'd

850
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:09,039
also want to start to think about how we

851
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:10,959
would actually make this UI thing usable

852
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,179
and you know you could imagine if I had

853
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,929
more than one of those so probably what

854
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:21,909
you want to do too would be something

855
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:27,129
like a you know when we begin the group

856
00:38:21,909 --> 00:38:30,308
when our group debug group where where

857
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:33,059
is group must be here somewhere well

858
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:33,059
thread list

859
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,960
so this thing here where we do begin

860
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:40,119
variable group and very little group

861
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,639
really we probably want two of them

862
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,789
because we want we might want multiple

863
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:49,420
things in here so be right this probably

864
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:53,139
doesn't have a name because it's just a

865
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:59,800
big block of stuff and again you could

866
00:38:53,139 --> 00:39:01,900
imagine in a second we'd probably have

867
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,180
you know by function or something in

868
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,410
here and have another way you know we'll

869
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:06,909
have another one of these that we could

870
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:09,098
do but for it for the moment i'll just

871
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:16,769
do both of them and this would be

872
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:19,809
function list like so so you know again

873
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:22,090
pretty basic stuff it's just now we have

874
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:24,549
ways of opening a profile views in here

875
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,349
so that it's kind of all looped into the

876
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,750
thing and now it's sort of annoying

877
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:30,190
because like you know we compile we

878
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:32,530
still have this kind of annoying compile

879
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:34,690
thing it was fun while it lasted but

880
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,670
again it just seems like a to owners to

881
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,659
kind of really have that be our model is

882
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,240
that we have to compile over time

883
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:44,108
because msvc just is not fast enough for

884
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,399
that but we can fix that as a separate

885
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:46,838
thing we do later so when we have

886
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,220
something like this you know the other

887
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:49,960
thing that you know you could imagine

888
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,819
wanting to do is like maybe we want to

889
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,338
be able to like resize how big these

890
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,530
profiles are or something like that so

891
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:58,539
if we wanted to change the size of one

892
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,580
of these profile views then it's pretty

893
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:02,409
easy because we already have a place

894
00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:04,420
that we store extra stuff associated

895
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:07,029
with the the debug variable group you

896
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,769
know so any one of these debug variables

897
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,900
where we have stuff we can it's free for

898
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:14,050
us to just add a thing which is like oh

899
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:18,990
this is a debug like profile or

900
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:22,539
something thing you know debug profile

901
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:24,848
settings I don't know so this is like

902
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:26,619
profile and that comes to have some

903
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:28,088
stuff in it and I don't know what it

904
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,700
would want to have in it but you know

905
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:32,380
it's got the bug profile settings and in

906
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:36,848
it there's you know maybe something in

907
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:38,980
like dimensions so it has like you know

908
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:41,580
within a height to it that maybe you

909
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:45,309
could drag out and so if we did that

910
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,119
then we could allow that to be something

911
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:48,788
that's edited by

912
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,490
the user so that when we actually do a

913
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:53,890
draw a profile in instead of the profile

914
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:55,568
wreck that we do they're coming from us

915
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:58,778
just making an assumption about what the

916
00:40:55,568 --> 00:41:01,659
max corner of the thing would be instead

917
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:03,159
what we could do is say like oh okay the

918
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,199
min corner of this thing is actually

919
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:07,748
going to be whatever the top is is minus

920
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,189
the dimension right so we've got the

921
00:41:07,748 --> 00:41:12,969
profile settings there we're going to

922
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:15,909
minus the dimension x and then the I'm

923
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:17,618
sorry I didn't mention why and then in

924
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:23,798
the the max corner we're going to do

925
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:26,588
like okay whatever the the whatever the

926
00:41:23,798 --> 00:41:28,929
left edge was the min corner we're just

927
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:32,528
going to take that and we're going to

928
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:33,940
move it over right so we're going to say

929
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:37,539
whatever the min corner x is plus

930
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:40,838
whatever the dimension x was something

931
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:43,059
like that right and so if we do that now

932
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:47,170
when we do one of those things where we

933
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:50,890
add the thread list sort of thing we go

934
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:52,778
oh threadless profile dimension equals V

935
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:56,278
2 I don't know it's like it's going to

936
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:59,199
be a 1024 why that's going to be hundred

937
00:41:56,278 --> 00:42:00,608
tall or something like this right that's

938
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,429
like time big that one's going to be and

939
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:06,009
this one will be a different size right

940
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:07,719
this one will be like 200 tall it's like

941
00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:12,818
this is taller we don't know why it just

942
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:13,808
is and so then when I open these you can

943
00:42:12,818 --> 00:42:15,998
see that now they're like they're

944
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:18,609
different sizes right and we never did

945
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:19,629
put in anything that tries to clip these

946
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:21,278
guys that's something that we should

947
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,509
probably do eventually the renderer can

948
00:42:21,278 --> 00:42:24,039
already clip them we just don't actually

949
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:26,440
say anything about it but anyway we can

950
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:28,269
see what size are supposed to be and so

951
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,039
if we wanted to we could probably put in

952
00:42:28,268 --> 00:42:32,409
as well like a little handle here that

953
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:35,109
we use to like resize where stuff is or

954
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:38,018
something like that wouldn't wouldn't be

955
00:42:35,108 --> 00:42:39,548
too hard right so like maybe we want to

956
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:41,018
make it so you can easily resize that

957
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:43,239
you want to be able to like have a

958
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:47,379
little handle there that you could grab

959
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:50,409
on and move back and forth and so if I

960
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,539
did that what I would have to do is when

961
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:55,328
I'm drawing these things when i do my

962
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:58,028
draw profile in right right after i do

963
00:42:55,329 --> 00:43:00,080
that i could add a thing that was like

964
00:42:58,028 --> 00:43:01,130
some kind of a little you know like a

965
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:10,250
little handle or something like that

966
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:13,369
like a little like a little grabbable

967
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:14,809
widget right so if I want to do

968
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:17,319
something like maybe do a push wrecked

969
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:19,340
and take wherever the max corner is I

970
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,710
guess it really wouldn't be the max

971
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,320
corner I guess it would be like a sort

972
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:27,230
of the size point or something like that

973
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:30,590
and the size point would be the min

974
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:32,690
corners or the max corners X and the min

975
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,920
corners why so it would be like the

976
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,380
lower because that's where people

977
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,010
usually think of sizing from the like

978
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:43,250
the lower right corner you know getting

979
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,750
that way so you know if we had run those

980
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:48,980
sighs Keys and we want to do a push

981
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:52,010
wrecked here here at it oops let's try

982
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:55,929
that one more time push wrecked there it

983
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:59,690
is so if I want to do a push back there

984
00:43:55,929 --> 00:44:03,019
what i could do is say let's do a

985
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:05,059
wrecked centre-half dim and push in the

986
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:10,039
size P and how big do we want this to be

987
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:13,070
I don't know something like to buy two

988
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:16,250
or maybe it's bigger maybe it's 4 by 4

989
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:20,510
i'm not sure i don't really care at the

990
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:25,179
moment how big it is at all but there it

991
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:27,440
is so once that does this little thing

992
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:29,149
you can see now that we've got like a

993
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,179
little handle that we could drag here

994
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,289
right we've got a little a little piece

995
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:36,079
that we could manipulate like a

996
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:39,769
manipulator that we could do and so

997
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,650
again what we'd like to do is we'd like

998
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:44,179
to have some way of expanding the UI to

999
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,309
have the notion that that what I am

1000
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:48,739
dragging at any particular time may not

1001
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:51,860
just be on a value it may be something

1002
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:54,919
else right and so again we already have

1003
00:44:51,860 --> 00:45:00,550
this concept sort of baked in there to

1004
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:03,320
the UI oops no there we go to the UI

1005
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,750
which is I've got and I don't really

1006
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,450
know even remember what the functions

1007
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,099
are these days like I said I brain so

1008
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:11,809
addled most the time I have so much work

1009
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:12,829
to do I like do work all day and then I

1010
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,279
come home I'm just like I don't even

1011
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:14,719
remember

1012
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,780
we're doing on handmade hero but then I

1013
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:21,859
see the code now I'm like oh right okay

1014
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:23,000
so debug begin interact as a way of us

1015
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,460
sort of saying what are we actually

1016
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,989
interacting with here right and so the

1017
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,639
problem that we would have is right now

1018
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:30,259
our model is to just store a debug

1019
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,210
variable and that's the only thing that

1020
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,470
we know about we only know that we're

1021
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:35,000
interacting with you bug variable but a

1022
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:36,619
debug variable might have lots of

1023
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,949
different handles to it now there's two

1024
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:42,949
ways that we can go about sort of making

1025
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:44,449
this a little bit different and you know

1026
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,189
I don't know which one of them would be

1027
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:47,599
the best way to do it there's there's

1028
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,159
sort of like two different branch to go

1029
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,750
around one is that we could just

1030
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:53,059
introduce a synthetic debug variable

1031
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,500
that's something like oh this is you

1032
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:58,579
know I'm dragging this v2 it's a

1033
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,139
synthetic debug variable that's a v2

1034
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:02,539
that's the dimensions of this box and

1035
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:06,980
then you still always have everything as

1036
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:09,139
just a v2 but the other way to do it is

1037
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,820
to sort of expand the notion of what I

1038
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:13,190
am pointing at to be different things

1039
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:14,570
right because since we already know that

1040
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,059
we've got like different debug

1041
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:20,570
interactions that might happen what we

1042
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:22,820
can do instead is change this concept

1043
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,710
where we do the begin interact to be

1044
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,140
instead of it picking what the

1045
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,240
interaction is going to be based on the

1046
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:32,119
thing that it sees it's just going to

1047
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:34,129
pick the interaction based on what the

1048
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:36,759
person who like place the things there

1049
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,690
says it was probably going to be right

1050
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,700
now I know that sounds a little bit

1051
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,130
strange but just bear with me for a

1052
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:46,429
second so here's our interaction types

1053
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:49,660
right so let's say that what I did is I

1054
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:53,929
said okay there's a debug interaction

1055
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:55,519
and inside here right I have whatever

1056
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:57,079
the hot variable and the next top

1057
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,420
variable and that sort of stuff is right

1058
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:02,380
well let's suppose I also have something

1059
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:04,880
like debug interaction hot interaction

1060
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,640
hot interaction what that is is this a

1061
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,360
thing that says when I was mousing over

1062
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:14,119
something if it's some kind of a special

1063
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:16,220
purpose manipulator it may want to say

1064
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:19,789
hey I know that normally you would do

1065
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:21,379
thing x by looking at the variable and

1066
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:23,360
picking something but I want you to do a

1067
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,210
different thing and I'm going to tell

1068
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,960
you what that thing is right so we hear

1069
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:35,750
what we would say

1070
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:39,650
is ok check to see if whatever the hot

1071
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:40,969
interaction is is valid if it is we just

1072
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:45,590
assume that that's what you're going to

1073
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:48,230
do right that's the thing to do so when

1074
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:50,870
we do like next hot here or whatever and

1075
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:52,369
we do that stuff let's go ahead and do

1076
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:54,769
that so when we clear this stuff out

1077
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:57,559
we'll just say well when we're about to

1078
00:47:54,769 --> 00:48:03,019
do a sweep right the next hot

1079
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:07,279
interaction is going to be cleared to

1080
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:15,889
debug interaction then and then when we

1081
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:22,490
process next hot which we process like

1082
00:48:15,889 --> 00:48:26,509
they're here we will do oops a hot

1083
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:33,649
interaction next hot interaction there

1084
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:35,810
we can and hopefully you can kind of see

1085
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:38,510
where this is going I assume that you

1086
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:46,509
can so if I want to I can just say debug

1087
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:50,300
interaction like sighs sighs resize

1088
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:52,850
profile for now I don't want to get too

1089
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,840
far ahead here so how to say okay look

1090
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:57,349
we're going to do a thing where we can

1091
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,519
resize the profile and so what happens

1092
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:02,360
is when we're interacting with this

1093
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:07,309
thing you know we'll go in here and

1094
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:11,730
we'll say yeah like where is where is

1095
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:14,880
this where are you where are you

1096
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:17,550
we had you in a second sighs p there we

1097
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:24,630
are we just take whatever the rectangle

1098
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:29,250
was this is the size box reproduce the

1099
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:31,769
size box we're going to draw it and what

1100
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:36,599
we can do is we can say oh well okay you

1101
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:40,500
know like we were doing down here when

1102
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:45,299
we do is in rectangle what we might want

1103
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:51,050
to do is say okay we make we we may want

1104
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:51,050
to set the next hot thing to be equal to

1105
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,599
yeah I'm thinking about this I feel like

1106
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,519
we kind of want the hit testing to be a

1107
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,929
little more specific so i think you know

1108
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:59,929
we want to do something like that right

1109
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,900
so what I want to say is I want us to

1110
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:10,890
size box first so if it's in the

1111
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:13,800
rectangle of the size box I want to do

1112
00:50:10,889 --> 00:50:17,279
one thing if it's if it's not going to

1113
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,710
do another right and so what I'll do

1114
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:24,780
here is debug state next taught

1115
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:26,789
interaction zero but in this case I'll

1116
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:30,660
do next site interaction equals resize

1117
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:32,210
profile you know I'm saying and I can do

1118
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:35,549
the same thing that I was doing before

1119
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:37,590
so for example in here I can actually do

1120
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:42,660
a thing where I say like okay when I

1121
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:44,430
push this wrecked on I can do a test to

1122
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:47,339
see whether the currently hot

1123
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:50,069
interaction is my interaction right I

1124
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:53,119
could say is the current interaction

1125
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:57,690
that would be hot is that resize profile

1126
00:50:53,119 --> 00:51:00,740
and am i hot right like you know and I

1127
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:05,889
could also do something like this is hot

1128
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:09,069
and that

1129
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:11,019
and if it is again I can do the yellow

1130
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:17,200
thing and if not I can do the white

1131
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:20,619
thing you know so testing whether

1132
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:23,139
something is hot we already do it's what

1133
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,579
we do right here so instead of making

1134
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:26,379
that be just a test for the color what

1135
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:28,710
we would do is we just say okay that's

1136
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,170
actually now the test that we just save

1137
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:34,090
and then the item color is just you know

1138
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:39,400
I'm going to see are we hot or are we

1139
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:45,880
not hot right and now we know the item

1140
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:48,670
color right so yeah and we could also

1141
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:51,519
say in here you know we could do things

1142
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:53,619
like if it's hot in and the interaction

1143
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:55,960
is not you know we could do something

1144
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:59,619
like this as well debug stay hot

1145
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,940
interaction equals zero something like

1146
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:02,829
this let's a bunch of things we can do

1147
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,869
I'm just putting some new stuff out

1148
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:06,489
there and you know normally we'd

1149
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:09,239
probably collapse these things up down a

1150
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:16,239
bit but like I said one thing in time

1151
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:17,829
right okay so once we get that in theory

1152
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:20,619
we should be able to see a little

1153
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:22,059
something happening here right which is

1154
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:24,460
that when I mouse over this it turns

1155
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:27,909
yellow so now you can see that i'm

1156
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:29,260
actually highlighting a particular piece

1157
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:30,309
of this guy but of course when I

1158
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,020
actually interact with it nothing

1159
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:33,009
actually happens and the reason for that

1160
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:35,019
is because we haven't actually written

1161
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,730
anything right to actually do the

1162
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:38,860
interaction but it's not particularly

1163
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:41,110
hard to write that interaction right if

1164
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,809
i want to write that interaction when we

1165
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:48,750
are doing our mousing around you know in

1166
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:56,199
here i can just say oh well if you know

1167
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:59,860
if the interaction type is to resize the

1168
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:04,569
profile then i can just say well okay

1169
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:07,019
you know whatever the group sorry

1170
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:10,269
whatever the the profile dimensions are

1171
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:13,269
i'm just going to go ahead and add to

1172
00:53:10,269 --> 00:53:16,119
them whatever the d mouse is right and

1173
00:53:13,269 --> 00:53:17,710
that'll change the dimensions but what i

1174
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:19,449
would also like to do when I you know

1175
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:19,929
when i change the dimensions I want to

1176
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:22,149
make sure

1177
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:23,799
that I don't go below a certain value so

1178
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:28,059
I'll also do something like you're well

1179
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:31,600
okay you know if the profile Dimension X

1180
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:33,309
is less than you know some minimum you

1181
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:39,190
know I won't let it get less than like

1182
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:42,549
10 by 10 or something right all right

1183
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:44,440
don't really know exactly what I want to

1184
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:46,450
say there but something like that I

1185
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:51,360
could do you know this like third

1186
00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:59,589
dimension x equals min you know

1187
00:53:51,360 --> 00:54:01,870
something like that you know I'm Sam so

1188
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:04,210
again really really simple nothing

1189
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:06,219
particularly tricky here I don't

1190
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:08,199
remember what our min function is in

1191
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:10,539
this particular thing but I'm pretty

1192
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:14,949
sure we have one minimum somewhere

1193
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:18,219
anyone platform minimum in do we have

1194
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:22,919
them in and actually know if we have a

1195
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:27,759
min minimum apparently we do we'll just

1196
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:34,750
say that we do uh so you know now if I

1197
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:38,530
open this right uh oh dear well that

1198
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:42,750
didn't go quite as I'd planned how did

1199
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:46,480
that change in the way that it just did

1200
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:55,960
d mashpee should not be particularly

1201
00:54:46,480 --> 00:55:00,699
large am I wrong about that oh that's

1202
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,920
why yeah if you want to clamp something

1203
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:06,460
you don't want to use minimum you want

1204
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:09,309
to use maximum yeah and it looks like

1205
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:14,380
our mouse is upside down as well right

1206
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:17,829
from the screen coordinates which which

1207
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:21,910
is a little janky so what did i do there

1208
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:24,279
to deserve that if the mouse is changing

1209
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:30,789
it should have increased oh so I must

1210
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:33,920
negate the Y value right when I actually

1211
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:39,199
subtract so when I do my

1212
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:41,510
I size boxer you know it I start at the

1213
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:43,669
top and i subtract the dimension down

1214
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:46,790
which means that you if you move up if

1215
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:50,900
you moves in positive Y the thing should

1216
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:53,539
actually get smaller which is crazy but

1217
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:59,930
that's just how that goes right so it's

1218
00:55:53,539 --> 00:56:04,519
really this kind of a thing you know I'm

1219
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:06,169
saying so that's you know again a really

1220
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:08,150
simple way to just kind of make that in

1221
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:10,338
there so now you know okay we want we

1222
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:12,829
want to make it so that we can have some

1223
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:16,250
profile graphs and that's all good you

1224
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:18,829
know it's fine it's fun whatever we can

1225
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:21,920
size those guys and you saw how easy

1226
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:23,990
that was for me to add right just based

1227
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,548
on the way that it that it goes now you

1228
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:28,129
don't usually want to actually do

1229
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:31,579
resizing this way you want to actually

1230
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:33,200
use the Delta from point A Delta from

1231
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:33,950
point method the reason I say that is

1232
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,568
because like you can see what happens

1233
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:38,899
here if because I'm just adding the

1234
00:56:35,568 --> 00:56:43,219
Delta once you clamp the mouse is now

1235
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,108
wrong you know I'm saying so you know if

1236
00:56:43,219 --> 00:56:46,608
you want to be a little more swanky

1237
00:56:45,108 --> 00:56:49,699
about it what you actually do is like

1238
00:56:46,608 --> 00:56:51,289
record what the down click point was and

1239
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:52,460
whatever but for debug you I don't know

1240
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:54,909
that we care about that hopefully

1241
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,539
everyone understands that's not you know

1242
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:59,000
something that we're trying to do for

1243
00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:00,409
any kind of fancy you I but you can kind

1244
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,639
of see like again it's really easy for

1245
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:03,259
us to add that in there and that's what

1246
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:05,358
we want we want it to be easy to add

1247
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,980
that now we can make it even easier to

1248
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:08,539
add stuff like that by starting to

1249
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,219
compress out some of that code that's

1250
00:57:08,539 --> 00:57:11,389
kind of like a little bit janky in there

1251
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:14,838
now that I just kind of like put it in

1252
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:16,219
and you know kind of wrote it in place

1253
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:17,750
but there's a bunch of things we can do

1254
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:18,980
to make that even easier as well and

1255
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,510
maybe we'll take a look at some of those

1256
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,400
tomorrow but for now I think we're

1257
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,140
getting towards the end of the time

1258
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:28,880
limit because I think I started around

1259
00:57:24,139 --> 00:57:31,279
ten if that makes sense but we're

1260
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,108
getting pretty close to some to some

1261
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,579
good stuff here right and hopefully you

1262
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:39,308
know you can see where where this sort

1263
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:42,430
of thing is going right and yeah there's

1264
00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:42,430
there's a

1265
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:47,609
there's this couple things I'm not sure

1266
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,280
about yet like I'm not sure how we're

1267
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:51,630
going to draw this the profile you I but

1268
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,730
at least it's kind of all in one system

1269
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:56,039
now and that's kind of good and I think

1270
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:59,099
that we could also do a pretty easy

1271
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,570
thing here where we kind of we could

1272
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:04,019
compress all this stuff into a pretty

1273
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:05,880
clean thing where we just have you know

1274
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:07,019
profile and debug kind of things so we

1275
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:16,050
could we could it you could imagine

1276
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:19,019
doing something like this right let's go

1277
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:21,300
grab a group so in here if I were to do

1278
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:23,250
something like this we're at the start

1279
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,580
of the context I just go like debugging

1280
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:29,309
or something like this and then close it

1281
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:32,659
here you know now I've kind of got this

1282
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:35,429
this notion of a root group up there

1283
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:37,710
where it's out of our way and it doesn't

1284
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:40,559
come into being until we start to like

1285
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:43,699
you know grab stuff from it you know

1286
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,920
what I mean so that's kind of nice too

1287
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:54,869
so yeah all right I'm going to go ahead

1288
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:55,980
and go to the QA let's take a look if

1289
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:59,339
anyone has any questions about what I

1290
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:03,829
was doing feel free to to put a queue

1291
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:03,829
coal in front of them and ask me

1292
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,390
Panik 00 do you think this way of

1293
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:25,700
structuring UI code to be used to build

1294
00:59:23,389 --> 00:59:27,739
a full application or is it just useful

1295
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:30,049
for the bug you is what extra things do

1296
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:36,799
you think you'd need to add to make it

1297
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:40,849
useful for a full app UI um well so the

1298
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:50,030
I guess what I would say is I can draw

1299
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:58,720
you a visual diagram it's going to be

1300
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:58,720
amusing here is what I would say

1301
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:23,858
so essentially I would say yes this way

1302
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:27,700
of structuring the code does totally

1303
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:32,199
work for doing a full app but the

1304
01:00:27,699 --> 01:00:34,000
problem is it's not like you like we're

1305
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:36,730
just at the beginning of the stuff that

1306
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,619
you would implement for that so even

1307
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:41,550
you'll see me do probably one or two

1308
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:44,019
compressions on this before we're done

1309
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:46,510
but there's a lot more sort of

1310
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:48,909
compressions you go through like you

1311
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:51,660
will like the first thing you do and

1312
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:55,389
we'll do this later right is you take

1313
01:00:51,659 --> 01:00:57,039
this stuff now hopefully you can see it

1314
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:59,049
start to grow do you see how we have

1315
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,759
debug interaction debug variable for the

1316
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,250
hot interaction and the hot variable

1317
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,280
we're interacting with but then we have

1318
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:08,079
this next Hut interaction next not that

1319
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,450
there's a concept there which is like

1320
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,480
the memento it's like the thing the

1321
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:14,588
interaction cookie if you will that

1322
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,230
stores the information that's necessary

1323
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:19,059
to understand what will start happening

1324
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:21,789
if the user should click down at this

1325
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:23,769
point right and that becomes a more

1326
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:29,529
complicated data structure that is not

1327
01:01:23,769 --> 01:01:31,300
just ad hoc like this okay then you've

1328
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:33,550
got other stuff like the interactions of

1329
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:36,099
cells have state there's like a bunch of

1330
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:39,190
stuff that will happen along the way and

1331
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:41,080
you know we're going to stop with the

1332
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:46,950
debug system we're going to stop like

1333
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:49,449
here this is this is where we will stop

1334
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:52,269
and there's all this other stuff that

1335
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:54,399
happens in between so nothing I'm I'm

1336
01:01:52,269 --> 01:01:56,469
doing now is stuff that you wouldn't do

1337
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,050
on the way to doing the full app version

1338
01:01:56,469 --> 01:02:03,838
but there's just a lot of stuff that

1339
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:07,650
happens along the way and so that's

1340
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:07,650
that's how i would say it

1341
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,710
let's see Connor rents were you nervous

1342
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:22,070
the first time you streamed handmade

1343
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:28,760
hero no I I was not really for whatever

1344
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:31,690
reason I feel like it's a lot like you

1345
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:34,070
can see me but I can't see you right and

1346
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:36,650
I feel like one of the things that's

1347
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:40,100
true about the nervousness of public

1348
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:42,980
speaking is the actual physical like you

1349
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:44,809
seeing a large group of people that you

1350
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:48,139
are communicating with makes people

1351
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:50,480
nervous you know and if you keep you

1352
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,039
can't see that there's a large group of

1353
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,920
people like I mean I you know I to see a

1354
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:57,889
number if I can't see all those actual

1355
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,809
people there's it I don't think it

1356
01:02:57,889 --> 01:03:01,969
elicits the same kind of response that

1357
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:06,259
that actually publicly speaking to that

1358
01:03:01,969 --> 01:03:08,869
many people would elicit you know and so

1359
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:11,290
I feel like I feel like it's pretty hard

1360
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:14,779
to get to get really nervous about

1361
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:17,029
streaming something because it doesn't

1362
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,920
evoke the kind of response that like you

1363
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:20,090
know you know we've had streams where

1364
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,349
they've been like three thousand people

1365
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:24,200
on or something when it was on the front

1366
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:26,059
page of twitch if you actually got up in

1367
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:27,679
front of 3,000 people that's kind of

1368
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:29,059
crazy like to see that many people

1369
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,139
that's a huge number of people and I

1370
01:03:29,059 --> 01:03:31,579
think that would have an effect on

1371
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,900
someone I don't know if it I don't

1372
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:34,269
affect on me personally but it would

1373
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:37,250
generally have an effect I would think

1374
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:38,480
but if you just are streaming to 3,000

1375
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,699
people well it's no different than

1376
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,760
streaming to one person as far as the

1377
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:46,219
actual sensory input that you get on the

1378
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,460
stream I just see one webcam no matter

1379
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:52,699
how many people there are out there and

1380
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:53,960
so I just it just doesn't have an effect

1381
01:03:52,699 --> 01:04:00,500
you're just like I'm just programmer on

1382
01:03:53,960 --> 01:04:02,900
computer you know the big giant head to

1383
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:07,280
what do you think about GCC and it's dbg

1384
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:10,460
I do not like debugging generally on

1385
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,410
those systems gdb is just not a very

1386
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:14,990
good heads up debugger it's a good you

1387
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:17,779
know it does the features you need for

1388
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:20,269
the most part but just the the console

1389
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:22,400
the heads up of it it just doesn't let

1390
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:23,568
you debug that as the as efficiently as

1391
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,769
you need to

1392
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:27,588
so you know it's finding a pinch but

1393
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:31,348
it's just not a good everyday to bugger

1394
01:04:27,588 --> 01:04:33,150
and so you know as a thing that you use

1395
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:35,910
like you know typically my interacts

1396
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:37,920
with GDB I try to keep to just like i'm

1397
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:39,210
porting somewhere and so I don't care

1398
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,440
how efficient to the bugging is because

1399
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,579
I've already written like ninety-nine

1400
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,190
percent of the code and I'm just doing

1401
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:53,579
the port or whatever in that it's fine

1402
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:57,150
but yeah do you ever get your IRS be

1403
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:58,589
fixed to show names again no hex chat

1404
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:01,170
still never doesn't show me needs to be

1405
01:04:58,588 --> 01:05:03,599
fair I haven't tried like I didn't

1406
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:07,278
actually try to get it working but no it

1407
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:09,450
did not spontaneously start working

1408
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:11,460
Archer awful have you considered working

1409
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:17,788
at valve what is your opinion of them

1410
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:21,380
and their structure um well I mean I did

1411
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:28,289
interview at valve long long ago and

1412
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:30,059
like in 1998 I think but I did not

1413
01:05:28,289 --> 01:05:31,469
decide to work there I decided to go

1414
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,460
work at gas powered games i thought the

1415
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:34,469
game they were making was more

1416
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:37,739
interesting I don't really like

1417
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:39,509
first-person shooters that much the last

1418
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:45,509
time I liked a first-person shooter it

1419
01:05:39,509 --> 01:05:47,278
was doom so I didn't really like the

1420
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:49,170
idea of working on half life which is

1421
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:50,369
what they were working on at the time it

1422
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:55,229
was right at the very end of the project

1423
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:57,450
I think and so I I have never really

1424
01:05:55,228 --> 01:06:00,649
considered working there after that for

1425
01:05:57,449 --> 01:06:02,848
again pretty much the same reasons I

1426
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:03,989
mean you know talking about their

1427
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:05,759
structure or other things like that

1428
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:07,440
there's plenty of things to like or not

1429
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:08,818
like about valve structure just like

1430
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,710
there's plenty of things to like and not

1431
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:14,608
like about any company that you might go

1432
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:16,170
to work for and so to some degree it's

1433
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:18,509
more about like what are the what you

1434
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:21,239
know what would I be working on and am i

1435
01:06:18,509 --> 01:06:24,719
interested in doing that thing and for

1436
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:26,670
to a large extent you know valve just

1437
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:29,729
isn't doing the things that I would

1438
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:34,729
necessarily be interested in doing if

1439
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:34,728
that makes sense but you know

1440
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:39,890
like I said if you're going to go work

1441
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:41,808
somewhere of the places you could work

1442
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:47,449
you know Brad game tools is probably my

1443
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:49,420
favorite place but you know valve you

1444
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:52,009
know they pay very well right and

1445
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:54,588
there's a lot of people there who I like

1446
01:06:52,009 --> 01:07:03,349
I have a lot of friends who work at

1447
01:06:54,588 --> 01:07:04,578
valve and so you know I it wouldn't it

1448
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:06,079
would not bother me if you'd like you

1449
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:07,489
have to go work at valve that that would

1450
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,479
not be I wouldn't be like oh my god

1451
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:09,708
that's going to be off for anything I

1452
01:07:08,478 --> 01:07:11,118
feel like that seems totally reasonable

1453
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:14,149
i don't i don't think it would be my

1454
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:21,439
first choice because i just i don't get

1455
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:25,729
excited about perhaps working on you

1456
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:26,688
know you know i mean at whatever it is

1457
01:07:25,728 --> 01:07:28,728
that that would be like dota or

1458
01:07:26,688 --> 01:07:31,068
something right I just I just don't like

1459
01:07:28,728 --> 01:07:32,659
that sort of thing very much and it

1460
01:07:31,068 --> 01:07:36,438
would be hard for me to really get super

1461
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:38,478
motivated about that so I don't know I

1462
01:07:36,438 --> 01:07:40,129
mean maybe you know working on the VR

1463
01:07:38,478 --> 01:07:41,268
system sounds like fun they got some

1464
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:45,170
digits and really good stuff there so

1465
01:07:41,268 --> 01:07:46,098
that might be interesting and and you

1466
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,449
know the other thing would be like maybe

1467
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:49,640
work on steam for a while there's a

1468
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:51,650
bunch of things about seem you know that

1469
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:54,379
maybe it would be interesting to change

1470
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:57,249
or something I don't know but hopefully

1471
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:57,249
that's a good enough answer

1472
01:08:06,018 --> 01:08:11,488
crow activities what will the game look

1473
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,139
like in 25 episodes it shouldn't look

1474
01:08:11,489 --> 01:08:14,909
really any different from now because I

1475
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:18,838
we just have we still have a few engine

1476
01:08:14,909 --> 01:08:22,519
things to finish up so I'm really just

1477
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:26,548
assuming that like we'll probably do

1478
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:29,190
like the art changeover to start like

1479
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:35,309
putting actual stuff in it like you know

1480
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:37,858
let's say 2 50 to 40 I don't know I mean

1481
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:39,569
it depends it's hard to say I don't try

1482
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:42,059
to pick those things because I don't

1483
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:44,130
like to rush things you know the point

1484
01:08:42,059 --> 01:08:46,679
is to be educational here and if the

1485
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:49,349
main point is people want to like just

1486
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:52,380
make a game doesn't really interest me

1487
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:53,250
very much right like you know that's if

1488
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,960
you're just trying to make a game

1489
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:58,170
quickly then and you don't really care

1490
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,969
about like the quality or in how to

1491
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:01,739
program the system's it you know then

1492
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:06,059
you know go grab game maker and drop

1493
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:07,738
some sprites in or whatever right so so

1494
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:09,480
I don't want to rush things when I say

1495
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:11,368
that like maybe we'll be there this

1496
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:15,178
that's just an estimate based on where

1497
01:09:11,368 --> 01:09:17,639
we are and like like I said 200 episodes

1498
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,750
was like kind of my my feel at the very

1499
01:09:17,639 --> 01:09:19,739
start I was like it'd probably take

1500
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:22,979
about 20 episodes through the engine

1501
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:24,838
stuff and you know where we could have

1502
01:09:22,979 --> 01:09:27,328
blitzed it to do that we could have not

1503
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:28,618
done this debug code much and just

1504
01:09:27,328 --> 01:09:31,380
focused on finishing the lighting and

1505
01:09:28,618 --> 01:09:34,259
the Z stuff and and probably hit that

1506
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,699
but I don't want to do that I I want

1507
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:37,588
things to take as long as they take and

1508
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:39,960
I want to be able to spend time showing

1509
01:09:37,588 --> 01:09:42,170
people how to do stuff even if that

1510
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:46,230
thing is not one hundred percent

1511
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:47,609
necessary I want to be able to do things

1512
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:48,928
that aren't my percent necessary ins

1513
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:52,489
show here's how you make a little you I

1514
01:09:48,929 --> 01:09:52,489
if you need one so that people know

1515
01:09:53,298 --> 01:09:57,868
their trucks will you be using profiling

1516
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:59,340
tools like jeepers fi hot spots in the

1517
01:09:57,868 --> 01:10:02,488
code or rely on your own debug system

1518
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:04,199
only I think we will probably we have

1519
01:10:02,488 --> 01:10:05,339
pretty good profiling now so I don't

1520
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,789
know that we will really need something

1521
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:10,710
like gpf we do use I ACA though to dump

1522
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:12,210
our assembly we've used that on the

1523
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,880
stream before and we would use that

1524
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,829
again

1525
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:30,750
to take a look at the instruction counts

1526
01:10:14,829 --> 01:10:30,750
for sure yeah yeah

1527
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:49,139
and again yet to on the on the time

1528
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:52,319
thing the thing to remember is 197 is

1529
01:10:49,139 --> 01:10:54,449
197 hours so like you know figure round

1530
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,340
that up to 200 hours 200 hours if you're

1531
01:10:54,448 --> 01:11:01,618
sued you're working like even like you

1532
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:06,659
know even 20 hours a week which is like

1533
01:11:01,618 --> 01:11:10,529
half time programmer right that's 10

1534
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:12,000
weeks it's a pittance of time right so

1535
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:13,920
you know it sounds like a lot because

1536
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,420
it's a it said sounds like a day but

1537
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,250
it's not a date it's an hour it's hardly

1538
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:18,630
any time at all right and so I feel like

1539
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,368
if you look at how much stuff we've done

1540
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:22,019
into it ours its kind of staggering I'm

1541
01:11:20,368 --> 01:11:24,509
like I feel like if anything we went

1542
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:26,070
pretty fast and you know if I wasn't

1543
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:27,389
worried about the fact that I don't want

1544
01:11:26,069 --> 01:11:30,090
to spend like seven years of my life

1545
01:11:27,389 --> 01:11:31,288
streaming this program I would ago I

1546
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:33,659
would have actually probably go like

1547
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:35,309
let's go slower right because I could

1548
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:38,098
spend more time talking about individual

1549
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:41,610
things or you know explore more options

1550
01:11:38,099 --> 01:11:42,690
for things and show people stuff so it's

1551
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:45,089
generally the case I think we've

1552
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:47,038
actually made pretty fast time and I

1553
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:48,440
really don't want to go any faster and I

1554
01:11:47,038 --> 01:11:51,059
know that some people just don't care

1555
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:52,828
and they're impatient about stuff too

1556
01:11:51,059 --> 01:11:54,150
and they just want to like see some

1557
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:56,639
particular thing that they care about

1558
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:58,500
but all I can say is really like that's

1559
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:59,849
not going to happen like it's it's never

1560
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,189
going to be rushed one way or the other

1561
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:07,170
and like I said if anything I feel like

1562
01:12:02,189 --> 01:12:08,308
it went pretty fast because at the end

1563
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:13,109
of the day we just haven't spent that

1564
01:12:08,309 --> 01:12:15,599
many hours on it have you met Michael a

1565
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:18,799
brush or carmack in person yes i have

1566
01:12:15,599 --> 01:12:18,800
met both of them in person

1567
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:33,789
I mean you know I've I've met Carmack a

1568
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:38,379
few times at conventions and meetings

1569
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:41,050
and stuff like this Michael a brash you

1570
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:44,199
know we worked you know work two offices

1571
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:46,329
down from me for three years four years

1572
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:49,889
something like that so I mean I know

1573
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:49,890
Mikey brush very well

1574
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:19,438
so we all good here

1575
01:13:29,729 --> 01:13:34,099
I guess we don't got no more questions

1576
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:40,439
so I'm going to close this down Odin six

1577
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:45,509
or seven are you going to see the

1578
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:50,759
Martian um I don't know I have not read

1579
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:53,100
the book and I don't know Anna Anna I

1580
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:57,539
read the book and she was going to the

1581
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:59,820
movie she said it was a really good book

1582
01:13:57,539 --> 01:14:01,140
I don't know if I should maybe when she

1583
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:03,599
goes to movie i'll ask her if i should

1584
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:13,890
read the book first or something or if I

1585
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:15,690
should just go see it icarus you talked

1586
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:17,400
about products you like to program we

1587
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:18,929
are seeing a bunch of space games now

1588
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:20,579
after being without decent ones for a

1589
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:24,780
while are you interested in space games

1590
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:32,729
at all um I guess I am interested in

1591
01:14:24,779 --> 01:14:35,189
space games at all but you know I'd have

1592
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:36,689
to think about it I want a real joystick

1593
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:41,159
like in the old days we used to have

1594
01:14:36,689 --> 01:14:42,689
that nice proportional flight stick I if

1595
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:45,359
I was going to play a space game I would

1596
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:47,879
want like a really good joystick for it

1597
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:51,170
and I would want the game to be like

1598
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,520
good like the old x-wing game was I

1599
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:56,250
don't like these stupid like I didn't

1600
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,840
like Wing Commander I don't like the

1601
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,399
model of just like some people randomly

1602
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,930
flying around sort of shooting at each

1603
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:01,738
other just kind of flying in loops all

1604
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:03,950
the time and not doing anything

1605
01:15:01,738 --> 01:15:07,649
interesting I like the idea of like

1606
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:09,119
having a lot more sort of intelligence

1607
01:15:07,649 --> 01:15:11,309
in the game and like situational

1608
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:13,229
awareness and stuff and managing things

1609
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:14,400
like you know like the x-wing games had

1610
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:16,019
like you know this content that you

1611
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,509
manage your shield and your power and

1612
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:21,180
your other stuff you're you're firing

1613
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:24,510
pattern and stuff if I was going to play

1614
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:27,690
a game again I would want it to be like

1615
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:28,980
really high quality space game I don't I

1616
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,238
wouldn't just play some random stupid

1617
01:15:28,979 --> 01:15:33,869
space game where you just kind of street

1618
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:37,979
at stuff a little bit and it's boring so

1619
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:39,599
so it depends and I have not bothered to

1620
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:41,759
order a joystick and I have not actually

1621
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,030
gone and looked to see if any of these

1622
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,469
new space games are

1623
01:15:43,029 --> 01:15:47,229
going to have that kind of quality to

1624
01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:48,550
them like I don't know if eval curry has

1625
01:15:47,229 --> 01:15:52,569
that I don't know if you elite dangerous

1626
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:54,520
has that I did play enemy Starfighter

1627
01:15:52,569 --> 01:15:56,078
but it was really early still and it

1628
01:15:54,520 --> 01:16:01,170
just didn't didn't seem to have a lot of

1629
01:15:56,078 --> 01:16:05,019
that stuff yet in terms of the feel and

1630
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:10,000
and I have so you have an IV also not

1631
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:13,409
played limit theory but that it looks

1632
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,408
like it's still pretty early as well I

1633
01:16:17,099 --> 01:16:21,279
did play kerbal space program a kerbal

1634
01:16:20,139 --> 01:16:22,719
space program kind of felt to me like

1635
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:24,779
the physics engine wasn't good enough

1636
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,819
for what they were trying to do like

1637
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:29,559
you'd build these things but it seemed

1638
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:33,250
kind of arbitrary it was like like a bad

1639
01:16:29,559 --> 01:16:35,980
spring-mass model or something it just I

1640
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:37,210
don't know it just didn't work and so I

1641
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:38,709
felt like if you're going to do kerbal

1642
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:41,230
space program right it should have like

1643
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:42,880
a awesome physics engine like it should

1644
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:45,279
have a physics engine so good that you

1645
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:51,190
can test it like NASA rocket on it and

1646
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:56,309
it'll be correct so I q 144 when is the

1647
01:16:51,189 --> 01:17:00,428
next Casey drink and game night ah um

1648
01:16:56,309 --> 01:17:04,659
you know I I don't really know about

1649
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:09,849
that it prop you know maybe in two to

1650
01:17:04,658 --> 01:17:11,259
three weeks something like that those

1651
01:17:09,849 --> 01:17:16,828
are pretty infrequent those tend to be

1652
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:16,829
pretty good frequent so

1653
01:17:25,769 --> 01:17:31,090
Graham 70 star citizen yeah I did not

1654
01:17:29,139 --> 01:17:33,368
mention star citizen because I have

1655
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:34,989
never looked a star citizen it sounded

1656
01:17:33,368 --> 01:17:36,969
to me like that thing was kind of an

1657
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:40,148
epic disaster where they just took a ton

1658
01:17:36,969 --> 01:17:43,599
of money but don't necessarily have like

1659
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:47,559
this sort of they don't necessarily have

1660
01:17:43,599 --> 01:17:49,840
the kind of a structure or like teams in

1661
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:50,889
place that can execute the kind of thing

1662
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:55,149
that they're talking about which is

1663
01:17:50,889 --> 01:17:57,279
massive and so I'm really nervous about

1664
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:58,749
star citizen I kind of feel like that

1665
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:00,609
may be one of those things where like a

1666
01:17:58,748 --> 01:18:04,438
hundred million dollars goes into a

1667
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:08,348
giant hole somewhere is never seen again

1668
01:18:04,439 --> 01:18:09,280
but you know I don't know so so I don't

1669
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:11,260
know what's going to happen with star

1670
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:13,509
citizen that's that's going to be

1671
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:15,070
interesting to see I hope that it

1672
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:17,229
doesn't happen because I don't want I

1673
01:18:15,069 --> 01:18:19,238
don't really like when people get burned

1674
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:20,619
by crowdfunding because then you know it

1675
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:22,418
makes them may be less likely to crown

1676
01:18:20,618 --> 01:18:23,348
fun things in the future and there's

1677
01:18:22,418 --> 01:18:25,148
been a lot of stuff that's been

1678
01:18:23,349 --> 01:18:26,679
crowdfunded that's you know I'm really

1679
01:18:25,149 --> 01:18:28,479
happy with craft fun and I want people

1680
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:32,260
keep doing that and so they've taken so

1681
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:33,849
much money and you know they weren't

1682
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:35,889
even like a studio to begin with right

1683
01:18:33,849 --> 01:18:37,269
and so you know you end up here with

1684
01:18:35,889 --> 01:18:38,550
like 80 million dollars or something and

1685
01:18:37,269 --> 01:18:42,820
you're supposed to build this gigantic

1686
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:45,519
game and like i don't know i mean like i

1687
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:47,498
said i hope i hope it i hope it goes

1688
01:18:45,519 --> 01:18:49,199
okay at least passably i hope it doesn't

1689
01:18:47,498 --> 01:18:53,368
crash and burn in a spectacular fashion

1690
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:53,368
because I think that would be pretty bad

1691
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:59,319
you know for maybe it would kind of ruin

1692
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,969
it would kind of take away some goodwill

1693
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:05,498
from the crowd funding because so it's

1694
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:08,639
so high visibility so so hopefully you

1695
01:19:05,498 --> 01:19:10,840
know it doesn't it doesn't go too wrong

1696
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:12,309
you know cuz elite dangerous went really

1697
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,569
well it seems like right like they took

1698
01:19:12,309 --> 01:19:14,949
money for that craft find they got a

1699
01:19:13,569 --> 01:19:16,538
reasonable amount they it seems like

1700
01:19:14,948 --> 01:19:17,888
they shipped the game you know in a

1701
01:19:16,538 --> 01:19:19,389
reasonable amount of time and it's you

1702
01:19:17,889 --> 01:19:22,059
know it seems like it's what they said

1703
01:19:19,389 --> 01:19:23,618
they would deliver you know I don't know

1704
01:19:22,059 --> 01:19:25,090
if it's like the best game ever anything

1705
01:19:23,618 --> 01:19:32,228
or if it's what people exactly want to

1706
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:34,380
but you know they delivered right so so

1707
01:19:32,229 --> 01:19:34,380
yeah

1708
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,650
correct tivities how did you end up

1709
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:42,420
working on the witness and what does it

1710
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:44,279
like to get jobs as a freelancer I

1711
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,949
probably don't really know that I answer

1712
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:48,029
the second question but so in terms of

1713
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:50,129
how you end up working on the witness

1714
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:54,059
that was just like John's a good friend

1715
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:56,340
of mine and I knew that they might need

1716
01:19:54,060 --> 01:20:00,360
some help so it was really just a like

1717
01:19:56,340 --> 01:20:04,560
you know it was it was like a friend

1718
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:05,908
thing I don't really know what much

1719
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,770
about what it's like to get jobs as a

1720
01:20:05,908 --> 01:20:10,109
freelancer because again I've really

1721
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:17,280
only mostly worked for just my friends

1722
01:20:10,109 --> 01:20:19,589
and and you know I if you just if you

1723
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,059
don't just already know places who would

1724
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:25,440
want you to do work for them I don't

1725
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:32,340
know what you would do I'm not really

1726
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:33,899
sure start your pancakes if star citizen

1727
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:35,190
does end up delivering do you think it

1728
01:20:33,899 --> 01:20:36,988
has a potential to change the current

1729
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:39,299
publisher triple a model or do you think

1730
01:20:36,988 --> 01:20:43,799
it will be a one-shot regardless of a

1731
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:46,860
success uh well I mean like anything

1732
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,810
else I'm not sure that even the people

1733
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:52,948
who did it would be able to reproduce it

1734
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:55,739
but you know I don't think it has that

1735
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:57,869
much of a of an impact on the publisher

1736
01:20:55,738 --> 01:20:59,158
triple a model because it's really no

1737
01:20:57,869 --> 01:21:00,929
different than the publisher triple a

1738
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:02,638
model at some level right the current

1739
01:21:00,929 --> 01:21:04,079
publisher triple a model is about

1740
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,779
charging a lot of money for a game like

1741
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:09,840
sixty dollars and then up selling you on

1742
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:13,380
a bunch of stuff right like in game

1743
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:16,260
stuff or pre-order bonuses special

1744
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:21,239
editions season passes as exactly what

1745
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:22,770
star citizen does right so I mean what

1746
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:24,658
would chain nothing would change like

1747
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:27,570
the triple a model is exactly like star

1748
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:29,039
citizen at some level and the only

1749
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:30,179
difference is publishers don't have to

1750
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:32,158
get the money up front because they have

1751
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:36,359
the money so there's no real need for

1752
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:37,799
them to do so but yeah so so i don't i

1753
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:42,139
don't think it would change things too

1754
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,139
much but i don't know you know

1755
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:50,520
all right I'm gonna wind down where

1756
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:51,539
where my page at there it is thank you

1757
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,440
everyone for joining me for an enough

1758
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:54,800
sort of handmade here at San

undercoating with you as always if you

1760
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,369
would like to follow along at home you

1761
01:21:57,569 --> 01:22:01,710
can always pre-order the game and it

1762
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:03,029
comes with the source code and you can

1763
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:05,189
play around that source code at home

1764
01:22:03,029 --> 01:22:09,000
experiment and learn from the source

1765
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:11,909
code in your own time you can do that on

1766
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,529
handmade hero dorg we also have a forum

1767

01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:21,210
scheduled at you if you want to catch

1772
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:25,319
the video series live and we also have

1773
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:27,449
if you type handmade con org into your

1774
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:29,729
browser we have a convention happening

1775
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:32,789
December fifth you can buy tickets right

1776
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:34,439
here I will say that the tickets sold a

1777
01:22:32,789 --> 01:22:37,619
lot faster than I thought they were

1778
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:39,359
going to sell and we've already sold

1779
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:41,670
more tickets than the number of tickets

1780
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:47,069
that I thought that I was hoping we

1781
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:49,409
would get so yeah I am a little bit

1782
01:22:47,069 --> 01:22:52,889
nervous that we may have too small of a

1783
01:22:49,409 --> 01:22:57,359
space I was thinking there was no way we

1784
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:59,789
would fill 275 seats but that is looking

1785
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:01,199
like maybe that was not such a safe bet

1786
01:22:59,789 --> 01:23:03,750
because I haven't even announced the

1787
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:06,389
speakers yet and pretty much all of the

1788
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:09,300
speakers are much bigger names than I am

1789
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:14,130
in the industry so I am a little nervous

1790
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:17,100
about what will happen but yes that's

1791
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:18,630
just bet it's better to be have too much

1792
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:23,160
of just into little interest and so

1793
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:27,260
we'll just leave it at that and what

1794
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:31,380
popcorn wait there is a limit oh yeah so

1795
01:23:27,260 --> 01:23:34,440
there that when I in here where you look

1796
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:36,449
at the thing where I'm talking about 275

1797
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:40,439
275 is the total number of people we

1798
01:23:36,449 --> 01:23:43,800
could fit in the room like that's it so

1799
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:46,219
after 275 there's no i mean because

1800
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:49,289
right like i had to have to rent a space

1801
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:51,270
i picked you know a space that i thought

1802
01:23:49,289 --> 01:23:54,510
would be big enough and you know it's

1803
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:56,579
expensive to rent places so

1804
01:23:54,510 --> 01:23:59,880
I just picked a place that would be

1805
01:23:56,578 --> 01:24:00,868
reasonably inexpensive and nice but that

1806
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,940
means it only fits two hundred

1807
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:05,279
twenty-five people I felt that was

1808
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:06,448
pretty safe because you know how many

1809
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:09,569
people are going to travel to this but

1810
01:24:06,448 --> 01:24:13,229
it looks like maybe I don't know what

1811
01:24:09,569 --> 01:24:15,268
will happen so we'll see but yeah I

1812
01:24:13,229 --> 01:24:16,468
guess what I would say is maybe if you

1813
01:24:15,269 --> 01:24:17,699
know you really want to go to handmade

1814
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:18,899
con and you haven't bought a ticket yet

1815
01:24:17,698 --> 01:24:20,788
you probably want to buy tickets soon

1816
01:24:18,899 --> 01:24:26,908
I'm nervous what's going to happen when

1817
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:28,109
I post the speaker list yeah I don't

1818
01:24:26,908 --> 01:24:30,359
know what's gonna happen point being

1819
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:34,828
there's a con it's going to be pretty

1820
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:38,009
awesome it's probably going to be really

1821
01:24:34,828 --> 01:24:39,808
ridiculously awesome actually I'm really

1822
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:41,250
looking forward to it so if you're

1823
01:24:39,809 --> 01:24:46,110
interested in that definitely sign up

1824
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:49,979

programming kind of like the way that

1829
01:24:55,078 --> 01:24:58,439
debug UI stuff is starting to shape up I

1830
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,788
think there's a lot of fun things we can

1831
01:24:58,439 --> 01:25:01,259
do with it I want to get the profiles

1832
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:03,809
working and I want to clean up some of

1833
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:06,210
that stuff so we've got several days you

1834
01:25:03,809 --> 01:25:07,800
know i i'd like to do tomorrow and then

1835
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:09,359
probably like next week i'd like to

1836
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,409
spend just doing debug UI stuff and kind

1837
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:13,768
of just getting all that stuff into a

1838
01:25:10,408 --> 01:25:17,069
nice clean package for us to use and so

1839
01:25:13,769 --> 01:25:18,420
we'll be doing that so again 5 p.m.
