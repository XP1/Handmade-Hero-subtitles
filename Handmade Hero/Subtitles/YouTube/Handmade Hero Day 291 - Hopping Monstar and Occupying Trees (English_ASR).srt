00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,370
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,120
here of the show we code a complete game

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,820
live on stream this is well you know

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,410
I'll be honest I don't really completely

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,460
remember what it is that we're supposed

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,969
to be doing on this stream

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,800
I really don't it was Wednesday we had

8
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:21,329
brains working we were hopping around we

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,939
made the thing in the in the post Jim

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,139
does somebody asked where you could swap

11
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:28,099
your head with something else that was

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,240
nearby and that was kind of funny

13
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:31,890
so to be completely honest with you I

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,649
really don't remember what we should be

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,670
working on right now what I will say is

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,929
that there's plenty of things I can

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,789
think of that we should be working on

18
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,799
right now so rather than try to give a

19
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,119
pre bit preamble on the stream that's

20
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,369
like here's what we're gonna do today I

21
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,530
don't know so I must open the cup based

22
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:49,229
code base and see what it is that we're

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,670
going to work on I suspect that the most

24
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,468
profitable thing to work on would be to

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,020
start doing some work in the brain code

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,730
stuff maybe make some monsters or things

27
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,920
like that we had talked about maybe

28
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:01,439
making a little snake thing like walks

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,719
around or who knows and so that might be

30
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,959
an interesting one as well so let's go

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,349
ahead and get started on that because

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:13,019
that's you know that's that's some stuff

33
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:14,219
and things like that and whatever so

34
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:15,629
that's good so I think we'll probably do

35
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,188
that playing with the brains and the

36
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:20,938
movement mode stuff to try and get those

37
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:23,069
into a good more mature area today is

38
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:24,899
day 2 91 so if you would like to follow

39
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,149
along at home you can unpack day 2 90s

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,040
source code into a directory and that is

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,500
what I am starting with at this very

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,409
moment in the real world in life in the

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,359
world so let's go ahead and see where we

44
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:41,040
are gonna put a for coder here and build

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,209
I gotta I remember to update the floor

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,979
coat of this machine there is a new

47
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,739
build there's a build that's newer than

48
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:50,819
the one that I'm using here and I got a

49
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:55,259
switch to it okay so yeah what we've got

50
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:56,879
at this point is is we have the hero is

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,560
the only person who's really going

52
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,589
through real movement code at the moment

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,969
and nobody else actually is and so I

54
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,618
guess one thing that I could do just

55
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,408
right off the bat is we could make the

56
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:09,118
monster right it was just a little torso

57
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,340
sitting there we could make the monster

58
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,469
start moving around I don't know where

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,409
he would move around to

60
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,629
we uh but you know that's okay it

61
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,639
doesn't matter we you know what we'll

62
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:26,759
just have them move around for some

63
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:28,679
reason mm probably shouldn't eat cheesy

64
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,629
poof's on the stream so there's probably

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,730
is too much crunching but they're so

66
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,819
darn delicious you know all right

67
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:40,229
anyway so let's see here what have we

68
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:45,090
got to work with I'm gonna go into the

69
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:46,769
brain code and I suppose if we look at

70
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,129
what's going on here really all that's

71
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,800
happening for example in here is like

72
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,139
I've got a thing that says like oh yeah

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,000
if there's a traversable and i'm planted

74
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:01,979
you know like let's hop around I feel

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,650
like we could do something where you

76
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,139
know how it wouldn't take very long

77
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,180
oh you know what I think this is what we

78
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,019
were doing - it looks like we start with

79
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,430
the figure I was gonna say we'll do

80
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,680
Monstar but we don't even have to master

81
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,879
but I guess you know either way let's

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,349
get both of those working familiar in

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,689
Monstar because it looks like we started

84
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:22,289
on that I was gonna say us I wonder if

85
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:25,349
we can just go ahead and actually move

86
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:27,659
the Daman star around by just saying

87
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:32,069
like okay you know if you're a monster

88
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:34,650
and I guess the monster you know doesn't

89
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,539
really have a body or anything

90
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,770
I'm sorry doesn't really have a head or

91
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:44,669
anything he just has a body then I guess

92
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:51,030
what I could do is say let's take the

93
00:03:44,669 --> 00:04:01,369
Monstar and grab out the parts for the

94
00:03:51,030 --> 00:04:07,110
Monstar and there we go and the Monstar

95
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:09,209
only has a body I could say you know if

96
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,120
the body is valid because I guess I

97
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,189
don't want to do anything if it's not at

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,030
all at the moment since there's nothing

99
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:24,660
else then I'm gonna say get the closest

100
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:27,000
traversable to wherever I am maybe like

101
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,090
plus some random

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,949
Delta right for now will actually do a

103
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:35,339
real Delta then will randomize it later

104
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:39,060
so we'll just say like oh yeah look look

105
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:42,599
you know one to the right of wherever

106
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,250
you are or something so find the thing

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,950
that's closest in that over that

108
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,329
direction if the movement mode is

109
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:54,329
planted then we'll go ahead and a second

110
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:56,459
we move this down here then we'll go

111
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:59,310
ahead and set this stuff up for doing

112
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:03,629
the hop right we'll do a transactional

113
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,879
occupy and and that's it I don't know

114
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,290
what that's gonna do to be completely

115
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,000
honest with you but that seems fine oh

116
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,730
I've got to have somewhere to put it I

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,730
suppose that traversable has to be

118
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:18,470
stored so let's go ahead and grab that

119
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:21,950
there we go okay

120
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:26,280
so a couple things we need to do here

121
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:29,099
first of all I need to actually assign

122
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,349
the Monstar to something although

123
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,270
actually wait let's that shouldn't have

124
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,450
crashed should it have well it didn't

125
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:39,029
actually crash I guess oh no it did get

126
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:45,478
some space reversible updating render

127
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:48,179
worlds came from and occupying what did

128
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:51,379
I do here Oh cuz right

129
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,060
he isn't starting on an actual occupying

130
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,978
so this is the same thing as before we

131
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,819
need to actually start initializing our

132
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:02,129
entities properly so we do that in the

133
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,168
in the player you can actually see that

134
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:07,139
happening right we get this occupying

135
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:10,799
equal standing on the sort of thing and

136
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:14,370
we need to do something for that in in

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,439
the case of the Monstar right and I

138
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,600
don't know I guess we do make a Monstar

139
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,978
brain I didn't realize we did make a

140
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,300
monster brain I guess we just did it for

141
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:22,740
completeness Oh cuz we wanted to swap

142
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,449
with them that's why

143
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,800
and we only allowed swapping with things

144
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,269
that had brains you know I just said I

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,418
wasn't gonna another cheesy poof and I

146
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:36,899
totally I totally did all right so

147
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:37,899
anyway point being we need some way of

148
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:42,418
saying

149
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:47,258
that this is where the dude stands right

150
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:52,060
so I put that standing on in there like

151
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:53,680
so and it looks like I can if you create

152
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,120
one of these things I guess I could

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,220
theoretically make it so that it knows

154
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,569
where it is in that case - I don't know

155
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,680
that I want to do that yet so I'm gonna

156
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:02,379
hold off on that for a second because

157
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,180
what we need to do when we move into the

158
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,860
code for like creating worlds is we'll

159
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,300
probably clean up the notion of how

160
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,850
we're like saying where things are

161
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,439
placed so I don't know that I really

162
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,990
want to think about that all too hard

163
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,209
right now so I'm just gonna say we're

164
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,750
gonna have standing on gets initialized

165
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:21,310
when you create a monster and so I just

166
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:27,850
have to make sure that we actually do

167
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:30,519
that sorry occupying so when we create

168
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:32,320
the monster we need some notion of where

169
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,259
the monster is actually going to be

170
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,620
placed and when we create stuff we

171
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,719
should actually be able to like we

172
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,970
should be able to remember when we

173
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,130
create a monster but we'd probably want

174
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,870
to do that in a you know we want to do

175
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,969
these things in a way that's a little

176
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,189
bit more conducive to how we would

177
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,889
actually be doing them so for example

178
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,319
when we are creating rooms and stuff we

179
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,720
have the information at that point when

180
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,908
we do like add standard room we have the

181
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,190
information at that point but we're not

182
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:05,560
actually returning it right so what I

183
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:07,629
would like to do is something that that

184
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,889
works sort of maybe in this context

185
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:13,329
where inside the standard room maybe

186
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,009
every time we make a standard room in

187
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:17,259
fact we could just make them so when I

188
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,149
do like add monster and add familiar or

189
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,439
whatever right I could come in here and

190
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:23,709
just say you know what let's bring those

191
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:27,069
out here and when we're creating these

192
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:28,989
things we can also say oh yeah if this

193
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:31,870
is the time when we want to make one of

194
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,360
these guys will when we create the

195
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:38,019
entity we can use that entity and and do

196
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:42,070
the placement on it right I don't think

197
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:43,838
I don't know if we want to do yeah so I

198
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,730
guess what we want to do here is just

199
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,520
have a couple of these right I'd also

200
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,519
say something like this oops

201
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:59,669
so maybe like if it's negative -

202
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,420
negative - I'm gonna I'm gonna not add

203
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:06,778
the familiar just yet so we'll say like

204
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:08,219
hey if we're here and you know what this

205
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,490
is not an else I guess now I think about

206
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:21,210
it cuz it's gonna stand on that thing so

207
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:22,169
it's actually an if here I could do

208
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,860
something like this where I say like

209
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,899
okay let's remember what entity we're

210
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,899
actually going to be doing on here and

211
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:34,139
we'll make one of these traversable x'

212
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:37,230
so when we need to do add Monstar and we

213
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,539
got this standing on here we can make

214
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,060
that actually refer to an entity

215
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,620
properly right so when we create this

216
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:46,049
entity we should be able to say like

217
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,409
okay you know standing on in this case

218
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:50,879
the entity and I don't know what this is

219
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,230
going to expect this is a traversable

220
00:09:50,879 --> 00:10:00,208
reference so I guess this is going to be

221
00:09:52,230 --> 00:10:03,379
have to expect an entity packed I'm not

222
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,379
sure what will happen there

223
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:16,550
let's take a look so inside the entity

224
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,770
code itself we have a traversable

225
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,439
reference it has an entity reference so

226
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:25,069
I could just set the entity reference

227
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:30,740
index right so this is standing on

228
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:34,460
entity index equals and the ID and and

229
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:38,830
then we would have standing on entity

230
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:41,750
oops standing on index equals zero right

231
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:44,389
which it already would be so I think

232
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,220
this is really all we need and then when

233
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:51,259
we add the monster we can just say like

234
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:55,610
standing on is that thing I think got to

235
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:59,230
make that a dot now when we add this

236
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,789
thing I guess we've got a world P and

237
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:05,120
when we add monster I feel like we would

238
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:08,179
just pass the world P through so I'm

239
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,740
just gonna do that right and then if I

240
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:11,089
look at that monster and again like I

241
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,860
said this is stuff that will clean up a

242
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:19,310
bunch more later so it won't be as weird

243
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:24,350
once we kind of have more of a handle on

244
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:25,969
it so okay there's add mon-star and when

245
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,220
we add it here I guess we'd have to put

246
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,930
it above this code because it's getting

247
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:37,120
called from there and familiar would

248
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:37,120
have to be the same okay standard room

249
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:46,550
all right

250
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:52,750
in it points do-do-do-do-do-do hit

251
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:52,750
points that would go right about there

252
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,960
shadow alpha we're gonna have to get rid

253
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,080
of eventually but I guess now's not the

254
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,560
time that's when we do our render pass

255
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:09,120
let's put that up here and then add

256
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:11,219
piece that stuff should be sort of that

257
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,560
should actually really probably be in

258
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:19,350
the entity code but you know all right

259
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:23,819
okay so let's see if that works I'm not

260
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:27,480
sure if it actually we'll see what's

261
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:29,790
going on here I'm gonna double so before

262
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,029
I even start with that and we do the

263
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:36,149
Monstar stuff I want to actually go into

264
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,069
that brain code and and nuke it and just

265
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:41,399
see if I can get that thing initialized

266
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:46,110
properly first so that we know like

267
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:49,559
where the dude is standing all right so

268
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:52,259
there's Monstar and you can see that it

269
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:54,599
doesn't appear to be initialized

270
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,789
correctly because what you'll notice is

271
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,950
the square underneath him is not lit

272
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:06,389
blue and if it was an inch less

273
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:08,370
correctly it would have been so we need

274
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:14,370
to figure out why that's not happening

275
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:16,830
on Pac and so let's do that now and like

276
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,000
I said we still have we got you know and

277
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,259
at some point we're gonna stress this I

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
just don't want to quite a dress it now

279
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:23,189
when we're actually creating worlds we

280
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,259
need to sort of have some idea of how

281
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,440
things get created impact the initial

282
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,909
time and we want to keep that as close

283
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,140
as possible to how we pack things

284
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,269
runtime because you don't want a lot of

285
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,620
variability there but it's just

286
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:36,750
something we haven't thought through yet

287
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,310
so we don't really you know I I don't

288
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,620
really want to jump into it if I don't

289
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:42,269
have to right now I'd rather have it

290
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,879
wait for a little while

291
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:46,470
all right so if this is the add Monstar

292
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,509
code you can see that we're setting the

293
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,879
standing on here but I'm just I'm

294
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,590
assuming that when we call an entity

295
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,659
we're ending up in a situation where for

296
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:59,220
some reason it's not backpacking that

297
00:13:54,659 --> 00:14:01,019
properly and right because we're setting

298
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:05,730
the index and in theory if an index is

299
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:07,769
set we should be having that that

300
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,889
work so let me take a look at what

301
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:17,639
happens inside world of CBP when we do a

302
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:23,669
pack of the entity right we recall is

303
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:27,870
deleted if there's a sim region if there

304
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:29,578
isn't so we set the value to zero if

305
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,009
there's no sim region that looks like

306
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:35,179
the error I think probably what we want

307
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:39,049
to do is leave the index the same right

308
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:45,388
what we would want to do instead is say

309
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:48,448
if simha region you know and get hash

310
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:50,310
from ID otherwise leave it leave it what

311
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:54,028
it is I think that's the more correct

312
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:55,259
interpretation there okay so that was

313
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:58,198
the problem and you can see now that

314
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:00,929
that's properly occupying a square so I

315
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:03,479
believe we can now go back to the way

316
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:05,609
the brain code was working and and test

317
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:11,670
this out see if this holds any water

318
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:13,980
here off we go so there we go

319
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,750
okay and that do it we'll just hop right

320
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,980
off into the middle of nowhere remember

321
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,899
we are not doing

322
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,930
we nullified the collision volume so

323
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:25,828
there's nothing to stop them from from

324
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:28,109
hopping hopping along so that's exactly

325
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:33,000
what we wanted and that's great

326
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:35,970
now not a very interesting Monstar it's

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,078
true but you know that's okay we're not

328
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,139
really trying to make a particular

329
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:43,948
interesting model star at this point

330
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:47,970
inside the code in an handmade world

331
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:49,769
mode I would like there to be a X

332
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:56,069
entropy I would like there to be a

333
00:15:49,769 --> 00:16:00,799
random series that's like game entropy

334
00:15:56,068 --> 00:16:00,799
that I can draw from

335
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:10,420
I don't know that we really need those

336
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,320
two things to be separate but for now

337
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:13,839
I'm going to say that we're going to

338
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,560
keep them separate so when we initialize

339
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:24,009
effects entropy we're also going to

340
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:26,199
initialize game entropy and the other

341
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,629
thing too is I feel like when we do the

342
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,190
series here we do random series here I

343
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:33,549
think we want that to be the game

344
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,830
entropy that that's coming from so we're

345
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:40,149
gonna want to do something like this is

346
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:42,700
actually you know I guess we could just

347
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:48,720
do serious but say random serious

348
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,720
serious equals world mode game entropy

349
00:16:48,870 --> 00:17:00,310
like so okay and so now what's I have a

350
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:04,440
source of entropy there what I can do is

351
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:07,359
I can make this be a sort of random

352
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,960
thing where we just say hey whatever the

353
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,669
world mode is that game entropy I'm

354
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,809
gonna make it so that we can hop in any

355
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:18,340
direction that we want and oops that's

356
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:26,169
not what I wanted I wanted to random

357
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:29,139
bilateral right just kind of get that so

358
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,820
that that Delta is is meaningful now

359
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,950
when we update brains I don't know that

360
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:34,659
we passed the world node it looks like

361
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,860
we don't I don't know what we do with

362
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,900
the game State I guess we get the

363
00:17:35,859 --> 00:17:42,240
controller's from that but I would like

364
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:46,650
that world mode here to be passed I

365
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:52,109
don't know what it's actually called

366
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:55,590
what is that called game world mode I

367
00:17:52,109 --> 00:18:00,039
know why it's called game world mode

368
00:17:55,589 --> 00:18:02,139
should be completely honest with you or

369
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,269
why we don't know what that is it's game

370
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,710
world mode not defined when we have

371
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:11,819
handmade brain CPP what are you talking

372
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:15,200
about it's right there dude

373
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:17,099
when does this get an itch what what

374
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:23,159
what are you saying

375
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:26,398
handmade NH world mode world mode is

376
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,679
their brain dot H is here but that's ok

377
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:30,558
because this is brain dot CPP so world

378
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,919
mode is right there

379
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:39,658
brain dot CPP is here how is it not been

380
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:42,049
defined yet does someone want explain

381
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,049
that to me

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:03,759
somebody's gonna have to swing that to

383
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:06,459
me I can tell you that hmm let's see

384
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:22,440
here did we include this somewhere we

385
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:24,519
should not have let's find out Sousa 9

386
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,250
who is actually I guess that doesn't

387
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,169
really help me now I really wish the

388
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,500
compiler would just tell me who included

389
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:38,730
what but of course that that's not on

390
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:44,019
the table alright so inside world mood

391
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:45,579
when I'm calling acute brain I should

392
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:50,679
have a game world mood world mode and I

393
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:52,778
do I'm gonna pass it here an ox figure

394
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,500
out why I can't actually use that like

395
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:58,929
what's the deal yeah so it thinks that's

396
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,940
an undefined type so somehow my world

397
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:06,038
load H is not actually taking effect

398
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:12,519
right it's just not even happening and

399
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:21,339
it I thought that it was right here and

400
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:23,710
it is right there's my world mode H and

401
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:27,009
so that should be included right here

402
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:31,899
before handmade brain dot CPP so I

403
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:35,589
literally have no idea why that wouldn't

404
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:37,719
be included so let's find out is

405
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:40,500
handmade world mode getting included

406
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,500
before hand

407
00:20:43,339 --> 00:20:52,658
yes it is so I must just be missing

408
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:56,690
something game world mode brain dot CPP

409
00:20:52,659 --> 00:21:04,220
is a game mode world and I'm just like

410
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:07,639
reading it backwards ha amazing why do

411
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:15,710
we call the file world's mode if it's

412
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:21,519
called mode world do we have an

413
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:23,778
explanation for that anyone anyone I

414
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,579
mean that just does not make a lot of

415
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:30,230
sense to me you know I'm saying

416
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:33,678
III do not understand why we would have

417
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:42,409
done that it's just kind of dumb but oh

418
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:43,490
well what are you gonna do who knows I'm

419
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:48,100
just gonna kick back on you some cheesy

420
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,099
poof's really do you like the best plan

421
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:52,868
those let be someone else's problem you

422
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:52,868
know Sam

423
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:05,019
your lies can't be bothered anyway um so

424
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,369
yeah this is now like I said starting to

425
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,558
work basically the way that I want it to

426
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:10,359
work which is to say that you know now

427
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,798
inside a brain we can just say oh we

428
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,659
want you to hop from here to here and

429
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:14,918
then the the underlying code just takes

430
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,009
care of making sure that that happens

431
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,179
and so that's fine at this point it

432
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:21,940
should also be the case that since

433
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:24,880
that's occupying a square we should not

434
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,190
have any more problems with you know

435
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,559
basically with it running in running

436
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,090
into it essentially we should not be

437
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,250
allowed to move where it can move in

438
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:37,689
theory and it should not be able to move

439
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:39,339
where where we are either because you

440
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,529
know because we did two transactional

441
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:43,980
Square stuff and that does appear to be

442
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,980
true right

443
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:58,680
that's kind of fast look too fast

444
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:10,009
all right um okay so there's a monster

445
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:11,629
doing whatever that is supposed to be I

446
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:12,919
have no idea it's like a mom start with

447
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,880
its head cut off which is basically

448
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:20,450
exactly what it is I suppose and so yeah

449
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,130
I would say that just for the not

450
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,659
because there's any reason that we have

451
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:27,470
to do this right now for any particular

452
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:33,860
purpose but I think when we add room we

453
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:36,110
should also like not add like we should

454
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:38,269
not put those point those ground points

455
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:40,189
down in places where they can't actually

456
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:43,278
be or we should make sure that trees

457
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,960
occupy them right and I think probably

458
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,869
what we want to do is just have trees

459
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,649
occupy them so we probably want to do

460
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:53,599
something like you know again not really

461
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:55,009
I don't want to go too far down this

462
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,619
route but I just feel like we might as

463
00:23:55,009 --> 00:24:00,589
well not like have it be totally broken

464
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:05,349
for right now when we add a standard

465
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:08,658
room I'm just gonna say like you know

466
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:12,199
just do something stupid like okay you

467
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:13,669
know a standard room when you add the

468
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,798
standard room there's gonna be this

469
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:18,520
thing that's like okay you know how many

470
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:21,769
things are there in the standard room

471
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:24,500
there's gonna be like a traversable

472
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:29,298
reference for the standard room that's

473
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:31,089
like you know ground and there's you

474
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:37,369
know however many there are so there's

475
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:39,379
what 17 across and I guess well I guess

476
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:41,449
we'd probably want to access it in what

477
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,190
looks like a good what looks right to us

478
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,679
which is of course the wrong way round

479
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:49,490
thanks to sees the way they do their

480
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,019
array stuff but we'll say seventeen by

481
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,048
nine and then we'll just in here say

482
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:56,210
okay when we make this reversible

483
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:58,639
reference we'll bank the traversable

484
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:06,019
reference and just say that the standard

485
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:08,200
room that we're creating is going to

486
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:08,200
have

487
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:17,340
all of its points specified here hereby

488
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:21,100
so we'll say like alright the offset why

489
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:28,928
it's offset X plus 8 and the offset y

490
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:31,178
plus 4 we'll set that standing on and

491
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:37,210
that way we can have this thing be like

492
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:38,620
oh yeah I wanted to do an ad Monstar you

493
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:47,919
know what I could also do I could do

494
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:49,418
this and again this is not good

495
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,090
I mean this is not what we should do

496
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:55,390
eventually but I just for now I feel

497
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:57,369
like we might as well just hack it in so

498
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,970
that we can play with it and not have to

499
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:05,558
care so I could just say let go okay you

500
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:08,890
know room P I want it at you know I

501
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:11,230
don't know that 3/4 or something and

502
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:18,870
it's just the same thing here room

503
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:18,870
around or something like that

504
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,640
oops

505
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,570
and so inside here we could do this at

506
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,569
the end now

507
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:45,819
and we should still get our little

508
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,130
monster are freaking out right and then

509
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:50,470
when I go down and do ad standard room

510
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:58,570
down here I could do it now where I say

511
00:26:50,470 --> 00:27:04,440
like okay you know the room gets added

512
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:04,439
here and then the Monstar

513
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:13,630
it gets added at this location right

514
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,600
what that would allow me to do later is

515
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:19,290
when I'm actually calling ad on anything

516
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:22,629
else like when I do ad wall for example

517
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:28,450
what I can do is I can actually go in

518
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:32,200
there and take the actual points and

519
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:33,789
have the the the trees or the walls or

520
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:41,559
whatever we're making occupy those

521
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:45,009
squares now you may ask and it's a fair

522
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:48,519
question why wouldn't I just not create

523
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:50,200
a traversable there rather than creating

524
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,900
a traversable and sticking something on

525
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,809
it and the answer is we may want

526
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,240
destructible walls we may want to be

527
00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:00,879
able to move trees by like burning them

528
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,009
or moving them or digging them up or who

529
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,140
knows what so I think we want to create

530
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:08,049
traversable everywhere you could ever

531
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,900
conceivably stand and then just put

532
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:12,069
stuff on them and the only place we

533
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,410
wouldn't create diverse those are places

534
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:24,899
you can never go like in the middle of a

535
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:24,900
mountain or something an undeveloped and

536
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,259
I think we would just always say yeah

537
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,720
you can stand here if you can move the

538
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:37,440
stuff that's in the way so if I was

539
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,850
gonna do that when I do an ad wall I

540
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,980
want to do the ad wall a little bit

541
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:44,409
differently now and in fact this AB

542
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,870
style X stuff is not super necessary

543
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,580
anymore to a certain extent this for

544
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:50,619
loop could actually be over the things

545
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:54,089
that are in the room structure so I

546
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:54,089
could do like a ray count

547
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:08,079
room p0r for the Y and then you know a

548
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:10,150
ray count room P for the X and then

549
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:14,409
instead of these abs is I could switch

550
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,548
these two just using you know what this

551
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,640
has got to go right now we don't have

552
00:29:15,548 --> 00:29:22,150
stairs I could switch these two just

553
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:27,640
using the p-value so I just say like oh

554
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:28,660
okay probably the rest of this stuff

555
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,450
still works all right

556
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:39,910
but the AB style stuff can come out ad

557
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:43,269
wall and stuff can be like this and then

558
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:45,640
the p-value can just be world you know

559
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:52,808
what is it world position he can just be

560
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:54,910
room P tile X Y right so then we just

561
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:56,289
have to make ad well do the same work

562
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,029
the same way we were doing before where

563
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,480
we pass in a world position instead of

564
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:03,609
passing in like weird stuff like this

565
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,940
and and then we just get rid of that

566
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:08,709
right so now in theory I think we'd have

567
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,250
the same thing we had before hopefully

568
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,720
and we do so that's good and so then all

569
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,490
I need to do is now say well when we

570
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,660
have the wall will also pass like we

571
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,819
were doing before the traversal

572
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,990
reference that the wall is standing on

573
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:21,879
and then of course since the wall is

574
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,620
standing on it it's a simple matter of

575
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,309
just saying oh here the entities occupy

576
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:34,479
you know occupation is there then all we

577
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:37,678
have to do is say like this that we pull

578
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,679
out the traversal reference

579
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:52,889
so now in theory those trees will occupy

580
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,490
those squares and I believe that no one

581
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,780
will be able to hop there and as you can

582
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,259
see it already seems to have worked

583
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:02,099
nicely

584
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:05,129
in that the the Monstar is now confined

585
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:06,709
to that location now you'll note that we

586
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,090
still have a little bit of work to do

587
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,650
which is to say you can kind of see that

588
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:15,569
I'm able to pass through anything we're

589
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:17,400
yet it's occupying that but I can pass

590
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:19,470
to something beyond it and the reason

591
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,350
for that is we don't currently have any

592
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,630
notion of how far you could hop so we

593
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:26,849
can just make you hop straight straight

594
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:31,170
over anything I could stretch

595
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:33,719
arbitrarily far and hop now I don't know

596
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:36,539
what we want to do about that right I

597
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,799
don't know what the maximum hop distance

598
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:40,309
should be or anything like that

599
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:43,470
I suspect we should just set it to be

600
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:45,210
some hop value that is whatever the

601
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,299
diamond is that you can hop inside of

602
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,750
but I don't actually know if that's

603
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,190
correct

604
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,799
like for example should there be a

605
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:56,880
collision point here that I can't you

606
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,950
know that my head hits is that a thing

607
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,470
that should happen I don't know right we

608
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,759
have that capability and certainly I can

609
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,220
turn that on

610
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:11,730
in fact it's trivial we already had it

611
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:14,569
right in fact where is it here so if I

612
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,799
turn the collision on for one of these

613
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:19,470
one of these dudes here where I just say

614
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,960
like oh yeah we'll still have the hero

615
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,180
and have a collision on it right then

616
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,160
when I run through here I've got a

617
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:30,450
collision box and so I can't right I

618
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:32,779
can't go any further you know and is

619
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,009
that the right solution I don't know

620
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:36,420
because there's like there's two ways

621
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:39,119
that we can choose to approach that

622
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:42,029
problem I'm not sure about that yet I

623
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,859
have a feeling that I shouldn't bother

624
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,420
with that like I have a feeling that

625
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:48,209
what we should probably do is make

626
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:52,340
collision not be for anything other than

627
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,600
actually reacting to things

628
00:32:52,339 --> 00:33:01,069
like when things hit each other or

629
00:32:53,599 --> 00:33:19,579
whatever that's my guess but I don't

630
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:21,559
know who knows all right um so I guess

631
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:23,629
one way to think about that would be

632
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:29,210
that well the head is actually a floatie

633
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:30,620
is actually a floaty thing right um you

634
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,750
know what that reminds me I wanted to go

635
00:33:30,619 --> 00:33:34,159
in and see why we get sticking now like

636
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:37,369
we get a lot of sticking you can see

637
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,670
that the head sticks in a nasty way and

638
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:42,049
I assume that's because when we when we

639
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:45,259
we had monkey with the controller code I

640
00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:48,500
think ID or rather when we composite

641
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:49,910
bill that code I think I didn't really

642
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,630
go through and finish making all this

643
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:59,930
stuff work correctly together so I would

644
00:33:53,630 --> 00:34:02,510
like to see what's going on there so

645
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:06,519
let's take a look so the parts we have

646
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:10,309
here are like inside the brain here oh

647
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:12,289
one thing we do is we say all right if

648
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:13,699
it's analog you know what I was thinking

649
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,809
- I don't think we need to check for

650
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,269
deletion and the reason for that is that

651
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:23,710
brains run up front so I think we can

652
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:26,690
avoid doing that famous last words

653
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,070
so anyway when we get out the control

654
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,429
stuff here you can see us doing this

655
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:33,200
setting the uptick on hero DDP stuff and

656
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:36,369
then we come through and this is just

657
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,289
was the weird like swap code we tried

658
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:41,269
nothing and particularly important then

659
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:44,090
we do this stuff here where we you know

660
00:34:41,269 --> 00:34:47,128
what I don't know why we've got change

661
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,710
volume and all that stuff on here

662
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:51,179
is d sword being used right now yet is a

663
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:55,048
little bit so I'm gonna leave D sword in

664
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:58,740
there but I mean get rid of this change

665
00:34:55,048 --> 00:35:00,659
line calls we then have this ad I don't

666
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:04,500
know that we want that anymore that's

667
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:06,469
not super necessary although I don't

668
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:09,480
really know why oh we deleted it because

669
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:11,548
also because we now have that spacebar

670
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,039
was like for swapping stuff right so

671
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:19,230
let's get rid of that we've got our

672
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:22,019
recenter timer that is clamping that's

673
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,579
the does the countdown clamping and

674
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:30,298
where does the recenter timer actually

675
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:42,119
get used the recenter timer gets used up

676
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:44,579
here so ya know what that should be

677
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,769
doing reset your timer equals recenter

678
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:52,140
and then recenter timer counts down the

679
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:53,848
center timer gets used here i guess and

680
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:55,500
i think we don't want to decrement it on

681
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:56,818
the same time it's used so it's probably

682
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,440
something like that it's probably a

683
00:35:56,818 --> 00:36:07,469
little bit better

684
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:10,858
alright so i don't know that get closest

685
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:14,879
traversable for the head i don't know

686
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:18,900
why we're doing that check that doesn't

687
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,670
seem to be all that relevant that get

688
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,160
closest traversable that seems to be

689
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,470
more well i don't know we'll see

690
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:27,210
anyway we get the closest p for that we

691
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:31,139
check to see what their whether or the

692
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:37,548
timer is up or not and if the timer is

693
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:37,548
not up then we're going to do well

694
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:48,129
timer is up then we're gonna do this

695
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:53,150
stuff right square DDPs less than 0.1

696
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:57,890
then we take the DDP we'll see if we'd

697
00:36:53,150 --> 00:37:01,760
do a spring on the head in that along

698
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:04,789
that axis whatever the axis is and no

699
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,980
push is determined if the Khan hero's

700
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:11,630
DDP right is is less than 0.1 so if

701
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,750
you're not pushing in any direction then

702
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,220
no push is active so if there's no push

703
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,559
before the timer is up in this

704
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:21,789
particular direction doesn't have

705
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:28,099
anything happening on it then off you go

706
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:29,929
right so it seems like what's happening

707
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:45,319
here is I don't feel like no push is

708
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:52,969
working properly so how is that working

709
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:54,890
if yeah I think what I really should do

710
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:57,259
probably honestly is not speculate about

711
00:37:54,889 --> 00:38:00,289
this I would rather just do a debug out

712
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:05,450
here so I'm just gonna say like hey why

713
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:10,090
don't you tell me debug boolean don't we

714
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:10,089
have a debug bool something like that

715
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:22,219
there it is I'm gonna say that I just

716
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:26,599
want to see these things so I can see

717
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:30,649
when no push is getting set and all that

718
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:32,380
sort of jazz so let's take a look so

719
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,389
there's timer is up and there's no push

720
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:39,349
so as you can see timer is up appears to

721
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:42,339
be working pretty well right and

722
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:42,339
honestly

723
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:48,308
so there's I mean there's the case

724
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,169
happening the bad case happening timer

725
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:53,170
is up was true which is correct

726
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:55,930
but no push is false so we should not be

727
00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:02,500
clamping anything while no push is false

728
00:38:55,929 --> 00:39:04,750
oh well we would if the DDP if that

729
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,369
particular element was less than zero

730
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:14,650
once so what I should probably also do

731
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:19,680
is do a debug value of DDP - so I can

732
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:22,900
look at that as well so there it is and

733
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:25,000
you know so it's negative one that

734
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,220
should easily prevent us from applying

735
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,869
this stuff here and you know what I can

736
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:35,909
I can make this a little bit more

737
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:48,450
explicit as well I could do something

738
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:48,449
like you know like this

739
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:01,079
so this will record whether we tried to

740
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,860
recenter and then I can just say like oh

741
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,289
why don't you tell me each of these so I

742
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:18,590
can see if you are or aren't doing it

743
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:21,630
right so yeah I mean it looks pretty

744
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:23,610
obviously like we are not recenter in it

745
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,320
it's Reese entering the two that it

746
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,870
should be and it's not resetting the one

747
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,380
that it shouldn't be so why is my dude

748
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:34,489
slowing down and does it have to do with

749
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,840
the head movement spec junk again which

750
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:38,639
was the culprit last time we had an

751
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,960
unusual error like this so should

752
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:45,420
probably go in there and take a look at

753
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:49,079
that but yeah in fact I probably should

754
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,809
do that right now when we do DDP we

755
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:57,059
initialize its Khan hero then we put it

756
00:40:51,809 --> 00:41:02,099
into here right I guess I could also see

757
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:09,269
what the heads actual code does in the

758
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:11,069
world mode let's take a look so that

759
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:13,679
stuff doesn't get doesn't get messed

760
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:16,350
with anywhere right it's it's strictly

761
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:26,159
half getting called in here and so let's

762
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:28,860
see what happens inside move entity so

763
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:32,159
we say if unit max accel vector is true

764
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,900
then we do that that's sort of unifying

765
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,839
I'm going to say we don't ever want that

766
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:46,430
because we we are doing that ourselves

767
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:46,430
right and in there

768
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:58,900
we don't modify the DDP otherwise but we

769
00:41:52,119 --> 00:42:01,509
do modify it by the speed right and that

770
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,579
seems fine speed and drag should still

771
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:06,030
be allowed to take effect that shouldn't

772
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:18,539
be a problem okay

773
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:20,860
let's take a look now that's interesting

774
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:26,079
so this is basically saying that an

775
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:28,300
entity somehow got going so fast that it

776
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:33,840
was in danger of violating the total

777
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,840
speed how did that happen

778
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:45,759
Wow the DDP with 72 per second although

779
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:52,509
it's got drag on it so I'm not sure that

780
00:42:45,759 --> 00:43:04,778
that necessarily matters right let me

781
00:42:52,509 --> 00:43:09,429
take a look here and just to be clear

782
00:43:04,778 --> 00:43:10,119
also I mean we do clear DDP right that's

783
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:14,068
how that works

784
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:16,630
so DDP comes in should come in at zero

785
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:19,298
and we should never have anything other

786
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:21,999
than zero so when we set it here it

787
00:43:19,298 --> 00:43:23,440
should always be set to something pretty

788
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:25,988
reasonable

789
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,358
similarly when we're calling it here if

790
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:33,730
the Kon hero

791
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:36,659
DDP how was that acceleration ever

792
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,659
plausible

793
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:55,739
I guess the spring itself would have had

794
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:55,740
to have created that result right

795
00:43:56,289 --> 00:44:00,679
and furthermore I don't really know

796
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:06,860
about any effect why do we want any of

797
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:08,599
these things we really don't want it to

798
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:16,789
modify anything in that in that code

799
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:19,659
right I guess we do want some drag

800
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,659
that's kind of fun

801
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:45,469
all right so essentially we're

802
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:48,228
multiplying whatever our acceleration is

803
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:50,358
by 30 and we're adding a certain amount

804
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:52,578
of drag I don't think that's a good idea

805
00:44:50,358 --> 00:44:54,889
because this already has the drag in it

806
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:57,380
right and so I think what we would

807
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:59,358
rather do all of this stuff really wants

808
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,749
to be considered together right so I

809
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:05,659
think having that sim region movement

810
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:07,129
code be a thing is just kind of dumb and

811
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:08,538
I think maybe since this has caused so

812
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,579
many problems I'm just gonna get rid of

813
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,410
it I don't think it's good anymore

814
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:14,119
right so I'm gonna get rid of that and

815
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:18,739
I'm going to say that move speck is just

816
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:20,869
not a thing right and so we'll handle

817
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:27,048
that outside if we want that if that's

818
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:29,150
something that we want and and we'll

819
00:45:27,048 --> 00:45:34,690
we'll deal with dragon those sorts of

820
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:34,690
things in in sort of a different way so

821
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,690
take a look at this here

822
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:09,268
drag is the only thing in there

823
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:33,890
so let's see come out of this and I'm

824
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:35,838
gonna put this here for the moment

825
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:39,608
but we're probably gonna move this in a

826
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:44,599
second in fact I probably leave this now

827
00:46:39,608 --> 00:46:47,059
so this is the well I don't know are we

828
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,050
gonna move it or we're gonna leave it so

829
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:51,588
this should be the only place with

830
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:53,089
errors now right except for the movement

831
00:46:51,588 --> 00:47:01,639
code I don't know why this is jumping to

832
00:46:53,088 --> 00:47:04,549
the wrong place okay so this movement

833
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:05,989
spec can go away and furthermore that

834
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:08,560
means entities don't have to have a

835
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,559
movements back

836
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:27,360
and I'm gonna get through all of that

837
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:30,159
out goodbye for you as well

838
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,230
okay so now the state that we should be

839
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:37,569
in is the hopper should still be able to

840
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:39,789
hop around right and but I can't move

841
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:44,559
the head because at the moment now we're

842
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:46,360
not actually applying the the DDP so now

843
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,549
let's go in here

844
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,240
to the part where we are actually doing

845
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:54,910
that and let's restore some of that code

846
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:57,669
so in here we'd say like okay we've got

847
00:47:54,909 --> 00:48:03,609
you know we we figure out what's going

848
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:06,309
on here in terms of what the in terms of

849
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:11,890
what we think should be happening this

850
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:14,079
is again not this is so you can sort of

851
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,309
see why I don't didn't like the way that

852
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,500
was coupled before because what's

853
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:20,380
happening here is we have two things

854
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,960
going on there's how much you wanted to

855
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,000
move right there's the attempted move by

856
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,280
the player that's the thing that should

857
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,389
actually be subject to the unit max

858
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,130
acceleration right but then we've got

859
00:48:31,389 --> 00:48:34,779
the Reis entering force and the Reis

860
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:36,970
entering force should have nothing to do

861
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,470
with that right there a centering force

862
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:39,939
is not something that the player is

863
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:44,439
using to move that's pulling the player

864
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:47,470
back and so so what we want here I think

865
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:51,039
is we want to say okay there's the con

866
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:53,409
hero DDP and the con hero DDP is the

867
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,599
thing that's actually going to get that

868
00:48:53,409 --> 00:48:58,679
that sort of truncation so when we come

869
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,869
through here we're gonna say all right

870
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:04,289
let's apply that max acceleration right

871
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:07,179
here so we'll just say like you know

872
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:11,559
assuming that it's it's greater than one

873
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:16,239
will will undo it right that makes sense

874
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:20,529
is there a DDP regular no this will just

875
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:22,179
become DDP right so we create the DDP we

876
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:24,070
make sure that it's now unit length so

877
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:25,659
that you don't go faster on a diagonal

878
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,400
then you do like left and right you know

879
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:29,980
that that's all we're really trying to

880
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,800
do there and then we

881
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,840
can go ahead and do the recenter encode

882
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,970
they're a century code could do whatever

883
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,500
it wants so it's allowed to exceed that

884
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:40,868
maximum because it's going to be pulling

885
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,380
you back towards a location you should

886
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:47,289
be at so we're not going to touch that

887
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:50,559
we're not going to ma x a movement speed

888
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:54,519
here rather we're going to multiply by a

889
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,380
movement speed up here I think right so

890
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:59,170
what we would do is say like GDP x

891
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:04,809
equals movement speed right and movement

892
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:07,059
speed plus 30 so now we properly create

893
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:08,320
a directional vector we multiply that

894
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:10,150
direction of vector by your movement

895
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,609
speed to get the requested amount we

896
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:14,519
adjust that acceleration by forces that

897
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:19,090
are attempting to do other things to you

898
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:23,650
and similarly drag this this is the drag

899
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:26,289
right here already factored in right and

900
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:28,750
so what we would want to do here is

901
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:30,489
probably say the drag is always gonna be

902
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:34,769
factored in a little so if you're not

903
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:46,118
putting that drag in click this drag in

904
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:47,980
right you know I'm saying so and you can

905
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:49,869
see now why I want this out here is

906
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,510
because I feel like for gameplay tuning

907
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:54,970
purposes especially on the player but

908
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:56,590
possibly on everything we're gonna want

909
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:58,779
to create these very organic kind of

910
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:00,670
weird not particularly mathematically

911
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:04,990
rigorous played with till it felt right

912
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:08,858
kinds of things and so you know you want

913
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:10,358
to make sure that that is what you can

914
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:14,769
do and you're not forced to do something

915
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:18,429
that's not the proper amount the proper

916
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:23,920
format I should say all right so finally

917
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:25,509
we'll assign that DDP get all this we do

918
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,500
probably want to look into an OD at some

919
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:31,270
point for the drag coefficients but

920
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:36,838
we'll leave that for now and then in

921
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:44,288
here so this is going to be DDP

922
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:55,438
EEE is just going to be equal to the

923
00:51:44,289 --> 00:52:05,019
negative drag times the DP alright uh

924
00:51:55,438 --> 00:52:06,518
moving along alright so now that that's

925
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:09,838
cleaned up a little bit I can get back

926
00:52:06,518 --> 00:52:09,838
to the debugging that I was doing before

927
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:16,318
mr. AMD card does not want it down with

928
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:20,889
the textures all right there we go

929
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:27,009
all right so let's see where was I

930
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:28,629
so DDP is equal to Clio DDP we then take

931
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:32,438
the length of it and assuming that's

932
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:36,160
greater than 1 we normalize it out to 1

933
00:52:32,438 --> 00:52:49,420
we multiply it by the movement speed and

934
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:52,409
then we we apply the drag wait is that

935
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,409
correct one second

936
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:08,849
is that too much drag drag used to be

937
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:11,160
eight and it's on the DP so I feel like

938
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:12,779
that should be okay but if I actually

939
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:17,750
look at what's going on there I can't

940
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,750
move the head at all when that's on so

941
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:23,000
what am I missing

942
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:46,449
somehow that's still that's applying too

943
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:46,450
much drag and I don't know oh well No

944
00:53:55,429 --> 00:54:01,699
I don't feel like that should be

945
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:03,880
creating as impossible and move it's

946
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:06,679
such an impediment to movement as it is

947
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,430
but maybe I'm wrong about that maybe I'm

948
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:13,129
not thinking about that correctly if we

949
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:19,669
reduce the drag force considerably can I

950
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:29,180
remove it oh yeah

951
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:31,250
I just realized a few things first of

952
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:33,649
all these DD Peas

953
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:37,250
if it's new push I want to add this

954
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:41,139
force in not equals it so there we go

955
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:41,139
there's that there we go

956
00:54:49,159 --> 00:55:00,608
and now we seem to have also fixed the

957
00:54:52,460 --> 00:55:00,608
bug so that is good as well

958
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:18,810
all right so I think that was most of

959
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,579
what I want to do there we have a couple

960
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:26,579
minutes left like three minutes left so

961
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:29,009
I could go back and get the familiar

962
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:31,500
head float we could start working on

963
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,730
that as well let me pull out some of

964
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,358
these debug code here we don't really

965
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,358
need it at the moment

966
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:45,779
and we'll just leave that like this all

967
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:57,240
right so in the familiar code first of

968
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:58,680
all we have to create one which we set

969
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:06,569
ourselves up to do but did not actually

970
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:16,199
do so in here would be like okay you

971
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:20,300
know add a familiar and the familiar

972
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:27,210
would be you know at room P for three

973
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:30,000
rounds or three and I'll compile that

974
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:33,800
and then we just have to make a familiar

975
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:40,380
take the p value it like it was before

976
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:44,210
position and now this sort is is going

977
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:48,119
to be important it's probably not

978
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:50,940
obvious as to why at first but this kind

979
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:52,559
of brings up a sort of another point

980
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:56,130
which is we're gonna have to just decide

981
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,989
at some point how we want to deal with

982
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:00,950
floating objects in terms of occupying

983
00:56:57,989 --> 00:57:00,949
squares right

984
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:09,778
so we'll see how that goes so there's

985
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:12,268
the familiar

986
00:57:09,778 --> 00:57:14,938
it's occupying that square so my body

987
00:57:12,268 --> 00:57:16,798
cannot go in there we still don't have

988
00:57:14,938 --> 00:57:19,889
it inside it again like what I what we

989
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:22,409
want to do with the head precisely but

990
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:24,989
that'll come a little bit later but now

991
00:57:22,409 --> 00:57:27,869
we want it to this the familiar head to

992
00:57:24,989 --> 00:57:30,239
be able to move as well and in order to

993
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:33,179
do that I think you know we're gonna

994
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:35,130
have to have a notion here first of all

995
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:37,459
you know we should probably do what I

996
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:40,108
said before which is the enemy flags

997
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:41,248
with like collides and movable and

998
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:44,009
deleted in that stuff

999
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:45,148
I think movable I was suggesting this no

1000
00:57:44,009 --> 00:57:49,380
longer necessary and I think that's

1001
00:57:45,148 --> 00:57:51,659
probably true so I'm gonna go ahead and

1002
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:55,528
say that that moveable is not necessary

1003
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:58,079
I think collides also I don't really

1004
00:57:55,528 --> 00:57:59,789
know how necessary that is anymore

1005
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,769
either

1006
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:03,899
but we'll leave it in for now because

1007
00:58:01,768 --> 00:58:07,168
we'll have to think about how we want

1008
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:20,699
that to be handled I guess so let let's

1009
00:58:07,168 --> 00:58:28,648
just continue remove these and that

1010
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:29,938
should do that right yeah I mean in some

1011
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:39,208
sense we should just be able to say like

1012
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:45,088
if the DDP if it's requested a move

1013
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:49,798
we'll move it for now right otherwise we

1014
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:52,108
won't try and move it so yeah getting a

1015
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:53,969
little closer and tomorrow I guess we'll

1016
00:58:52,108 --> 00:59:00,798
get up tomorrow but Monday we'll get the

1017
00:58:53,969 --> 00:59:00,798
familiar going ok time for Q&amp;A

1018
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:14,950
if you have questions go ahead put them

1019
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:14,949
in to the chat box

1020
00:59:50,269 --> 00:59:55,809
Gaston 5-yr the textures not Dowling

1021
00:59:53,269 --> 01:00:00,259
probably sense well if you remember a

1022
00:59:55,809 --> 01:00:02,630
few episodes back I may be 40 40 or 50

1023
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,430
episodes back when we did texture down

1024
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:06,890
those we tried doing multi-threaded

1025
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:09,949
texture downloads which were supposedly

1026
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:13,489
supposed to work but they don't work

1027
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:16,460
reliably and so eventually we have to go

1028
01:00:13,489 --> 01:00:21,139
back and stop doing that because it just

1029
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:25,300
doesn't work it usually works on this

1030
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:25,299
particular machine but it does not work

1031
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:31,909
let me put it this way

1032
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:33,889
it sometimes fails on this machine but

1033
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:36,440
it fails even more frequently on other

1034
01:00:33,889 --> 01:00:38,960
machines so it's definitely not an okay

1035
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:43,670
thing to be doing so we won't we won't

1036
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,960
be doing that in the we won't be doing

1037
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:52,519
any multi coated texture downloads in

1038
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:54,559
the final game so why did this isn't to

1039
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:56,869
make the game grid-based that's a design

1040
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:01,849
decision so not really a topic for the

1041
01:00:56,869 --> 01:01:04,130
stream there were sirens earlier it's

1042
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:06,610
man and tree back at it again we are not

1043
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:10,309
really that close to man in tree here so

1044
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:12,230
it's you know it's it's unlikely however

1045
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:13,789
maybe he's in a different tree this time

1046
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:15,010
in which case it could be closer to her

1047
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:17,099
I suppose

1048
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:19,800
skull crack

1049
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:28,529
do you think even after getting a

1050
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:41,850
four-year degree in M I s do I know what

1051
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:45,000
M is is ally I know what M is is can you

1052
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:46,049
tell me what M is is long brilliant I

1053
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,579
guess technically if the gameplay is

1054
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:49,289
centered around tiles and facing

1055
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:53,039
direction you wouldn't necessarily need

1056
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:54,750
collision detection so we definitely

1057
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,610
need the collision detection to remain

1058
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,050
in and the reason for that is we do need

1059
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:59,460
to know when people hit each other with

1060
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:03,390
projectiles and other things like that

1061
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:08,070
so and like I said the head moves freely

1062
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:11,879
so basically the game system does not

1063
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:14,730
can't be tile based right it's only the

1064
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,500
movement of the body pieces that is tile

1065
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:25,139
based but the rest still has to operate

1066
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:27,179
continuously so you know we can't get

1067
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:31,679
rid of collision detection it's got to

1068
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:35,399
stay in we just may never use it for

1069
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:41,279
movement right but we will use it for

1070
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:43,820
other things any other programming

1071
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,820
questions

1072
01:02:54,789 --> 01:03:01,730
to terrace what are the 18 threads that

1073
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:05,210
run with the game uh so I don't know if

1074
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:07,369
we set a max thread count right now but

1075
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:09,710
I can well I could tell you a couple

1076
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:11,719
things first of all you don't really

1077
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:13,340
need to ever ask assuming that you're

1078
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:15,649
running if you in order to see those

1079
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:17,630
threads you presumably would know you

1080
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:19,970
would be running on you must be running

1081
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,130
it on your machine and seeing it so if

1082
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:24,709
you have it it's pretty easy to just say

1083
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:28,700
like okay let me see what threads are

1084
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:31,730
being used right so here's all our

1085
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:33,849
threads and as you can see there's

1086
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:36,349
really only two threads that do anything

1087
01:03:33,849 --> 01:03:38,299
and then the rest of the threads are

1088
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:41,000
just there for background asset loading

1089
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,830
so I can have some of them do some stuff

1090
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,260
and you could see you saw them do

1091
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:48,769
something there right I don't know if we

1092
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:55,190
could find that usage again but there it

1093
01:03:48,769 --> 01:03:58,269
is and you can see that that's just like

1094
01:03:55,190 --> 01:04:01,070
asking the disk to please get us some

1095
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:05,210
some art assets so there's two

1096
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:08,269
background loading threads and there's

1097
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:10,010
oh you know what I lied this is not two

1098
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:11,960
threads this is showing you one thread

1099
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:13,310
and then usage inside the thread so this

1100
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,079
is actually just three threads to work

1101
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:19,099
the thread that does all the game stuff

1102
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:20,719
and the to loading threads right but

1103
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:21,949
that's only if you're not running with

1104
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:24,409
the software rasterizer

1105
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:26,629
so if you decide not to use opengl and

1106
01:04:24,409 --> 01:04:31,670
you use the thing where we render

1107
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:35,420
everything then you'll get a lot more so

1108
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:38,570
if I then allow it to start if I unpause

1109
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:41,960
right you can see that what actually

1110
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:44,330
happens is there's a bunch of work being

1111
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:48,409
done on the separate threads and this is

1112
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:49,519
just their rendering right and that red

1113
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:51,409
breeze going to be bit slow because this

1114
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,059
is a compiled of debug probe right now

1115
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:55,519
and it actually is significantly faster

1116
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:56,960
and release so you generally don't want

1117
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:59,000
to turn the software render on if you're

1118
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,349
not gonna compile in debug mode but you

1119
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,570
can see that these are the threads that

1120
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:04,579
are that we're actually using so here we

1121
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:06,090
still got one main game thread which

1122
01:05:04,579 --> 01:05:07,579
also does render work

1123
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:12,720
in the render its which is right here

1124
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:14,009
but then we also we did six threads of

1125
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:17,099
rendering because this is a machine that

1126
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:18,090
has like a bunch of cores right and then

1127
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,909
there's still those two background

1128
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:23,550
loading threads so that's our actual

1129
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:25,319
threads in addition to those threads

1130
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:27,750
there's usually Windows creates a bunch

1131
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,070
of crap threads for you unfortunately

1132
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:34,260
and there's really not much you can do

1133
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:36,840
about that that's just like the way life

1134
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,660
is and you can see those threads in here

1135
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:44,510
if I do break all you can see those

1136
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:48,869
threads in here here's our threads right

1137
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:50,850
and our main thread but then it just

1138
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:52,859
creates all this other garbage right and

1139
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:55,710
a lot of it's like here's the sound

1140
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:58,110
playing thread right and the this is

1141
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:59,070
these are multi medias and sound like

1142
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:00,570
the sound threads

1143
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,950
here's another sound thread another

1144
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:04,740
sound thread now why you need that many

1145
01:06:01,949 --> 01:06:06,269
threads to play sound I don't know cuz

1146
01:06:04,739 --> 01:06:08,459
ring the fact that we only open one

1147
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:09,980
output channel for sound but you know

1148
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,809
somebody thought that was a good idea

1149
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:14,940
and then in here you know we're in the

1150
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:17,880
kernel I don't know what these are doing

1151
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,889
I suspect they have some kind of

1152
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,690
something to do with some service but

1153
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:23,879
you know without further information we

1154
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:26,309
could try to load symbols from the

1155
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:30,180
symbol Server Microsoft symbol server

1156
01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:31,860
and I don't know if it'll do that there

1157
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:33,449
was a way to automatically do that but I

1158
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,590
don't know and then we could have a

1159
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:36,539
little bit more idea what's going on

1160
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:38,490
this one right here is the AMD driver

1161
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:40,500
thread right you can see it's an api's

1162
01:06:38,489 --> 01:06:45,389
driver so that's a thread for their

1163
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:47,309
driver but that's that's life in Windows

1164
01:06:45,389 --> 01:06:49,019
so basically we asked for these threads

1165
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:51,239
so that we could actually use all the

1166
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:52,619
cores of the machine or at least a

1167
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,989
significant number of the cores but we

1168
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:56,880
leave some unused so that Open

1169
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:58,349
Broadcasting System has some to use for

1170
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,300
streaming so we don't actually open as

1171
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:02,759
many as we would normally if you were

1172
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:04,980
just running the game by itself but then

1173
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,060
you know windows kind of spans us with a

1174
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:08,059
ton of threads

1175
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:22,170
does that answer the question what is

1176
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:24,000
going to replace the Graham's flat

1177
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:26,250
system just different types and seamless

1178
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,670
textures well I worked at how the game

1179
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:34,260
actually is supposed to look and it is

1180
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:36,840
not it does not want seamless it's it's

1181
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:38,550
got a specific visual design and the

1182
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:41,269
ground slats are just not appropriate

1183
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:43,650
that make sense

1184
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:46,500
pokey why don't you program any UNIX

1185
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:48,780
based OS we've answered that question a

1186
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,949
bunch of times but since there's no

1187
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:51,230
other questions I'll just answer it

1188
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:56,939
again

1189
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:58,889
this is why I'm obviously a game

1190
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,570
programmer so in order to make a living

1191
01:07:58,889 --> 01:08:02,039
you you need to program on operating

1192
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:09,269
systems where people actually buy games

1193
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:11,039
and there you go so less than 1% of all

1194
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:15,599
games are played on Linux so it's really

1195
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:17,699
not it's really not feasible to be you

1196
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,979
know primarily concern yourself with

1197
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:27,869
Linux because you know you're not really

1198
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:29,548
um you're not really I don't want to

1199
01:08:27,869 --> 01:08:31,108
eating your own dog food but I mean you

1200
01:08:29,548 --> 01:08:32,548
want to be the most familiar with the

1201
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:36,390
platform that the gamers are actually

1202
01:08:32,548 --> 01:08:39,539
using you don't want to like you know be

1203
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:41,069
super familiar with with Linux and have

1204
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:42,149
no idea how Windows works and then you

1205
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:43,350
know you ship on Windows and you have

1206
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:45,479
all these bugs and you can't fix them

1207
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,770
and people are complaining about your

1208
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:48,419
game constantly on Steam and all these

1209
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:49,770
seem forums and all that stuff right so

1210
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:53,759
you know if you're pretty game you've

1211
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:55,950
got a program on Windows first and

1212
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,689
foremost there's a there's a bunch of

1213
01:08:55,949 --> 01:08:59,818
other reasons not to use Linux

1214
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:01,798
separately and those have to do with the

1215
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:05,789
low quality of tools for game

1216
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:07,829
development on that platform and I

1217
01:09:05,789 --> 01:09:10,350
realize that's a very difficult thing

1218
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:12,269
sometimes for people to grapple with

1219
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:13,980
because they maybe are used to web

1220
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:15,600
programming where a lot of the tools are

1221
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:17,969
better on Linux than they are on Windows

1222
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,680
right and so if you're used to

1223
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:21,329
administering web servers or stuff like

1224
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,170
that you may be like well it's way

1225
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:24,000
easier to program online

1226
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:25,859
and windows or something but the

1227
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,510
opposites true like most game tools are

1228
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,859
on Windows most things work better on

1229
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,300
Windows for pro game programming because

1230
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:32,849
it's the primary platform that games are

1231
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,820
programmed on and so you take a big hit

1232
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:38,130
going to Linux as well specifically with

1233
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:39,989
respect to debugging GPU stuff which you

1234
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:44,359
know a web server cares not at all about

1235
01:09:39,989 --> 01:09:48,469
GPUs but a game cares a great deal and

1236
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:53,639
that's a problem I would prefer that

1237
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:57,560
that was not the case I don't really

1238
01:09:53,640 --> 01:10:03,240
like have being so having to be so

1239
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:06,450
closely coupled to Windows and so I feel

1240
01:10:03,239 --> 01:10:08,579
like it's not good that what I'm saying

1241
01:10:06,449 --> 01:10:10,739
is true but you have to respect the fact

1242
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:12,029
that it is right you just have to

1243
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:17,609
respect the fact that that is the truth

1244
01:10:12,029 --> 01:10:19,289
of the situation and so you know it's

1245
01:10:17,609 --> 01:10:21,119
not great it's not what I would like I

1246
01:10:19,289 --> 01:10:22,350
would like I would love it a 50% of

1247
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:23,760
games were sold on Linux or something

1248
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:25,560
that would be fantastic but that's just

1249
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,600
not the reality of it so eventually you

1250
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,580
know maybe we can hope that someday it's

1251
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:33,980
not it's not the same as it is now but

1252
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:33,979
that's that is the situation

1253
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,489
I'm destroyed why wouldn't

1254
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:50,649
multi-threading work all that well

1255
01:10:44,488 --> 01:10:52,509
complications limitations what does that

1256
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:57,819
mean why wouldn't multi-threading work

1257
01:10:52,510 --> 01:11:02,110
all that well multi-threading does work

1258
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:04,408
well it works well for us I'm not sure

1259
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:04,408
what you mean

1260
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:11,800
Casta five how did you manage to make

1261
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,510
things work in Windows when you started

1262
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,510
your career given that MSDN at least now

1263
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:18,849
is negligible or unreliable or both well

1264
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:22,179
I guess what I would say is two things

1265
01:11:18,849 --> 01:11:27,099
one is that Microsoft used to have a

1266
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:29,940
saner API set right like Microsoft is so

1267
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:32,440
far off the rails API wise now that it's

1268
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:33,819
yeah if you came to it now you'd be like

1269
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:37,149
I have no idea what's going on just like

1270
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:39,849
oh we required Windows RT compliant

1271
01:11:37,149 --> 01:11:41,229
thread pool base thing that has to be

1272
01:11:39,849 --> 01:11:42,849
written in C sure and you're just like I

1273
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:44,979
have no idea what's going on yeah it's

1274
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:46,360
it's a nightmare now that's just they're

1275
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:48,819
off the rails they're never coming back

1276
01:11:46,359 --> 01:11:50,408
what can you do when I first started

1277
01:11:48,819 --> 01:11:53,529
window spring that wasn't true there was

1278
01:11:50,408 --> 01:11:55,929
just the win32 api it's not a great API

1279
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:57,578
but it's sane right it's like you can

1280
01:11:55,929 --> 01:12:00,190
its tractable its small enough that you

1281
01:11:57,578 --> 01:12:02,590
could learn it was not this giant

1282
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:05,618
splatter of garbage that's just smeared

1283
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:07,360
all over the walls like some kind of you

1284
01:12:05,618 --> 01:12:08,769
know lunatic asylum

1285
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,049
where they're trying to like you know

1286
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:12,730
keep the poop from from sticking to the

1287
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:15,190
padded cell or whatever right like it is

1288
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:17,259
now so it was much more sane and the

1289
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:19,029
other thing was MSDN was a lot more

1290
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:21,610
accurate and well-maintained at that

1291
01:12:19,029 --> 01:12:24,069
time as well it came on a like CD or

1292
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:26,679
whatever you could put in your computer

1293
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:28,569
and read and it wasn't bad you know it

1294
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:30,429
was pretty kept pretty up to date and

1295
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:33,158
like I said there just weren't that many

1296
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:35,469
API so you could learn them so I

1297
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:37,089
wouldn't say that I did anything special

1298
01:12:35,469 --> 01:12:38,889
to be able to learn this stuff I would

1299
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:42,460
say that I just was in an environment

1300
01:12:38,889 --> 01:12:43,868
and at a time when it was tractable to

1301
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,520
learn how to program Windows and

1302
01:12:43,868 --> 01:12:47,649
thankfully you can still program it the

1303
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,070
way that I learned even today you don't

1304
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:51,579
have to use all their new crappy crap

1305
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:55,119
unfortunately

1306
01:12:51,579 --> 01:12:57,579
that may not be true forever you know

1307
01:12:55,119 --> 01:13:03,309
one of the horror of horrific things is

1308
01:12:57,579 --> 01:13:04,809
you know Windows or Microsoft seems to

1309
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:06,730
be doing their best to try and kill off

1310
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:08,230
Windows as a viable gaming platform by

1311
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:10,839
doing ridiculous stuff like requiring

1312
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:13,179
you to use weird api's or tying stuff to

1313
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:15,550
the Windows Store or god knows what you

1314
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,810
know maybe they'll succeed and the way

1315
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,159
that we're programming Windows on him a

1316
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,780
hero will go away at some point I just

1317
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,489
really hope not because it's at least

1318
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:23,170
tractable and you can ship a reasonable

1319
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:24,939
product on it whereas the new stuff they

1320
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:36,310
ship is completely unusable as far as

1321
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:37,269
I'm concerned I'm just right you said

1322
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:39,280
something about the multi thing to be

1323
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:42,430
funky Oh what I was saying is that

1324
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:44,229
downloading textures in OpenGL from a

1325
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:46,300
different thread than the thread you're

1326
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:47,559
rendering on that's the thing it's not

1327
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,260
multi-threading in general

1328
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:52,180
multi-threading in general is fine it's

1329
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:53,320
OpenGL context having to OpenGL context

1330
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:56,770
and using them in a multi-threaded way

1331
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:58,509
just doesn't seem to work reliably it's

1332
01:13:56,770 --> 01:14:00,310
not a big deal it's it's not something

1333
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:04,380
that's gonna affect us hugely in any way

1334
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:04,380
really it's that's all

1335
01:14:07,229 --> 01:14:10,389
do you have positive or negative

1336
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:12,280
thoughts when it comes to learning and

1337
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:14,289
using Python for building applications I

1338
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:17,519
don't really have any thoughts at all I

1339
01:14:14,289 --> 01:14:17,519
don't use Python so

1340
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:27,899
and the middle you said dynasty and came

1341
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:30,269
on to cities technically MSDN came on a

1342
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:32,159
lot of CDs I guess used to get like this

1343
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:33,330
big stack I don't remember how many of

1344
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,739
them were the documentation a lot of

1345
01:14:33,329 --> 01:14:36,269
them were like the checked build of

1346
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:39,659
Windows or whatever if they had debug

1347
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:44,780
built in and stuff like that I don't

1348
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:50,930
remember how many were actually the the

1349
01:14:44,779 --> 01:14:50,929
the CDs right we're actually the docs so

1350
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:07,700
all right all good ticket for us which

1351
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:10,869
purveyors do you use regularly just C

1352
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:10,869
and C++ that's it

1353
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:27,959
all right

1354
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:38,080
alright thanks for joining me for

1355
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:39,310
another episode of hand made here oh

1356
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:40,930
it's been a pleasure coding with you as

1357
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:42,400
always if you want to follow along at

1358
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:44,619
home of course you can pre-order the

1359
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:45,759
game on and made here org and it comes

1360
01:15:44,619 --> 01:15:46,989
with a source code if you want to play

1361
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,510
around with it in the comfort of your

1362
01:15:46,989 --> 01:15:51,099
own computing environment we have a

1363
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:53,320
forum site you can go to if you want to

1364
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,340
ask questions we have a patreon page you

1365
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:56,319
can go to if you want support the video

1366
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:58,029
series we have a schedule bot who will

1367
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,199
tweak the schedule at you if you want to

1368
01:15:58,029 --> 01:16:01,210
know when the series gonna be live and

1369
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:02,769
we have an episode guide for catching a

1370
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:04,420
fun past episodes if you want to see

1371
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:05,920
when we wrote the software renderer or

1372
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:07,210
when we did the debug system or whatever

1373
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,569
you can go over there and check it out

1374
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:12,970
that's about it I will be back here next

1375
01:16:10,569 --> 01:16:15,159
week check the schedule bot four times

1376
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:17,230
if you are interested in that until then

1377
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:18,699
have fun programming this weekend and I

1378
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:21,269
will see you guys on the Internet take

1379
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:21,269
it easy everyone
