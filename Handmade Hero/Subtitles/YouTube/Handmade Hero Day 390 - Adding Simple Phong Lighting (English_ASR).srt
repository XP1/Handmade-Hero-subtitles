00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,330
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,859
Hero the show recode a complete game

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,269
live on stream yesterday we added some I

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,830
don't even want to say we added some

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,170
lighting I basically just showed the

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,429
rudimentary first step I did a bunch of

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,840
stuff on the blackboard so you can

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,939
understand kind of various lighting

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,920
principles and we implemented the very

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,528
first step in putting some lighting into

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,670
the engine in just a few minutes all we

12
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:32,729
did basically was do a radial fall-off

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,980
to show how to light things and you know

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,049
amusingly enough so today it's a 390 so

15
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,628
if you're finally at home used a 389

16
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,030
source code but amusingly enough it's

17
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:47,250
surprising it is always surprising how

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,570
good fake things look at first when even

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,789
if you just get them a little bit

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:56,570
correct it's funny and I think in games

21
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,270
you know the people who play games are

22
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,890
so used to approximations and artistic

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,290
interpretations of things at this point

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,769
that getting things like the lighting

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,650
equation photorealistic or correct is

26
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,798
not even remotely required for people to

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,180
appreciate the effect and so here is an

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,460
example of like the dumbest possible

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,070
thing it's literally just a radial

30
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,048
fall-off there is no lighting at all in

31
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,169
terms of surface calculations or

32
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,840
anything but you can see that even just

33
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,689
putting in a radial fall-off function

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,640
already gives a fairly convincing

35
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,649
lighting effect it's like you know even

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,840
just that one little thing you can

37
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,640
already kind of see why it adds

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,079
something to a game to have some

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,489
lighting in there and so that's what we

40
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,368
did now at the end of the stream we

41
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:50,699
threw in normals normals are the ability

42
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:53,009
in the vertex stream to specify the

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,630
direction that surfaces are facing so

44
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,009
you know a flat surface saying what

45
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,780
direction that flat surface is facing

46
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,368
for example so the canoes in

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,500
calculations and what we're going to do

48
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:03,718
today is just play around that a little

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,759
bit to see if we can make this lighting

50
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,649
a little bit more accurate by adding the

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,989
idea that the directionality of the

52
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,169
surface off of which the light is

53
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:14,099
bouncing will determine some of the

54
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,469
lighting and we

55
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,849
talked about why this was yesterday

56
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,830
because of course lighting is a

57
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,620
directional function and have to do with

58
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,240
the SIRT the micro structure of the

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,460
surface it's bouncing off will determine

60
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,110
how the light bounces so knowing the

61
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,090
direction the service is facing is

62
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,560
important since surfaces bounce light

63
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,469
differently in different directions

64
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,060
depending on their micro facet geometry

65
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:42,060
so now that we did that work yesterday

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,870
what we would like to do here is have a

67
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,530
way of taking into account those normals

68
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:53,129
and what you can see from what we did on

69
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,460
the stream yesterday is in the render

70
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,009
group when we do our push quad function

71
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,200
and again everything in our game comes

72
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,699
through this push quad function at the

73
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,769
end because everything in our game is

74
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,299
quads our cubes are made up of quads our

75
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,710
sprites our quads just have an image

76
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,030
flapped on them so everything comes in

77
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,120
this function and all this function

78
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,060
really does right you can see here is it

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,189
just generates four virtus pieces of

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,009
information for the vert as vertex

81
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,449
records basically that are streamed

82
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,769
after the graphics cards this is just

83
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:27,389
writing to memory and that memory is

84
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,780
going to get picked up by the graphics

85
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,189
card that's all we do okay so if you

86
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,659
take a look at what happens in here you

87
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:36,210
can see that we're now specifying

88
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,740
normals and those normals we we

89
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,469
basically generate them by taking a look

90
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,719
at the quad and saying whatever this

91
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,370
direction the quad is facing we generate

92
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,719
vectors that point in that direction now

93
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:50,490
you may ask a very reasonable question

94
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,069
which is why do we need to specify those

95
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,200
at all because shouldn't the graphics

96
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,150
are just be able to know if we specify a

97
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,409
triangle it knows the triangle is a flat

98
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,260
triangle it knows which direction is

99
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:04,229
facing the answer is because most of the

100
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,509
time in computer graphics when we are

101
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,179
generating triangles to try to

102
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:11,879
approximate three-dimensional objects

103
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,340
that we want to draw they aren't always

104
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,750
supposed to be flat right a lot of times

105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,209
you may be generating triangles that are

106
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,269
supposed to comprise say a person's face

107
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,209
or a round ball or you know a

108
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:27,639
cylindrical shape a post a lamppost for

109
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:31,948
example these things are supposed to

110
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:34,538
not b-flat and so what we do there is we

111
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,430
say that the normals are specified

112
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:38,740
separately from the triangles the

113
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,900
triangles are used to fill the shape in

114
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,519
on the screen and we try to make the

115
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:44,918
triangles dense enough that you can't

116
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:47,620
really see the hard edges very much but

117
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:51,038
the lighting would be very obviously

118
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,620
faceted if we just drew each triangle as

119
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,269
flat because as it curves around the

120
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,908
curved surface each of those flat

121
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:59,799
triangles is going to reflect the light

122
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:02,050
very obviously differently and you see

123
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,060
hard lines so the reason we always

124
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,800
specify normals per vertex or most of

125
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,050
the time specify normals per vertex is

126
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,629
specifically because we often want to

127
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,090
specify normals that are smooth across

128
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:16,389
the vertices so that it's takes the

129
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:17,948
lighting to be continuous right and it

130
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,379
can make things that are comprised that

131
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,419
a flat shape like triangles seem round

132
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:25,509
because as the interpolation of the

133
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:27,490
normal goes across the surface you end

134
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:29,588
up with something that approximates a

135
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,150
more smooth blending equation for us on

136
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:33,490
handmade hero fortunately we don't

137
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:35,649
actually have that situation at all yet

138
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,329
we don't have to care so we are actually

139
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:39,310
just specifying the same normal for

140
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:40,718
times and we could be doing something

141
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,098
more efficient there if we really cared

142
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:43,538
on modern hardware you can do a lot of

143
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:44,829
stuff like specifying the normals in a

144
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:47,649
separate vertex stream that only get

145
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:49,718
specified once for every N vertices in

146
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:53,338
this case it would be 6 3 3 for each

147
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:55,810
quad you know 3 vertices for triangle

148
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:57,788
but actually I guess no these are

149
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,228
indexed so we would only specify 1 / 4

150
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:02,560
because these are actually indexed so

151
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:04,360
nevermind I so anyway that's the idea

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,949
there and we are specifying these

153
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,860
normals we're specifying them by taking

154
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,139
the cross product of the edges of our

155
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,550
quad and we're pointing all the normals

156
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,509
out in that direction to give us flat

157
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,800
surfaces which is what we want now we

158
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,028
don't have any way of knowing right now

159
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,588
whether those are correct because we're

160
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,879
not throwing them we probably should try

161
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,319
to draw them but we're not going to

162
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,139
right now we're just going to cross our

163
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,509
fingers at the moment and see where we

164
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,310
get with that what I'm going to do is

165
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:32,588
I'm going to pop over to the OpenGL code

166
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,060
and I'm going to take a look at the

167
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:44,668
shader that we have here which is

168
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:47,939
who's this one so what you can see here

169
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:49,379
is that we don't even take the normal in

170
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,819
yet even though we're specifying it and

171
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,469
of course we want to so what I'm going

172
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,899
to do is I'm going to start taking in

173
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,820
that vertex normal by specifying here

174
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,259
what it'll do is remember yesterday at

175
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,689
the end of the stream we specified a

176
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,519
vertex and array now we're actually

177
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,800
going to give that amount point so that

178
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,930
when the program code says hey is there

179
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,759
ever an array if so I'd like such high

180
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,340
it will actually find something to

181
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,439
specify we're going to pass that normal

182
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,269
through directly because we don't really

183
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,719
have anything else we need to do with it

184
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:20,819
so I'm just going to say we're going to

185
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,540
pass a world pose and a world normal I

186
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,579
might change those to world P in world n

187
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,889
because I don't really like delivering

188
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,259
the point so let's just do it this way

189
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,870
there's the world po-faced position and

190
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,579
the world space normal and then when I

191
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:40,379
go through and look at world post here

192
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:43,050
we'll just go ahead and make that a

193
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,300
little bit more straightforward vacuum

194
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,710
is going replace pose oops

195
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,710
replace photography there we go

196
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:55,680
okay so in theory now that should allow

197
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,620
us to get normal into our code of course

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,168
we're not using it yet so when I run it

199
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:05,269
we should basically get if I de bug any

200
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:09,649
things we have under the world pose oops

201
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,649
forgot to fix that in the vertex shader

202
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,520
here we go

203
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,280
we should just get the same results

204
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,560
you're getting for so no change here and

205
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,059
the only difference now is that in the

206
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,500
fragment shader we have access to the

207
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,389
normal so we can do something with the

208
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,310
normal if we want to do something with

209
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,259
the normal now there's another thing

210
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,639
that I kinda have to do here that'll

211
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,439
temporarily make our graphics be a

212
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,190
little bit worse and that is that the

213
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:37,679
color of our cubes needs to change a

214
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,930
little bit so if you remember correctly

215
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,819
the way that we were doing our cubes in

216
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,759
the render group we actually specify the

217
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,940
colors differently per side of the cube

218
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,509
you can actually see in push cube here

219
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,440
we were generating these colors

220
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:55,480
Ct CD right you can see those top color

221
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,790
bought colors dbcc all that stuff

222
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,860
okay expensive ice here and that was to

223
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:01,269
give our it a little bit of a sort of

224
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,100
gradient to make it feel like it was

225
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,429
getting lit a little bit in a fake way

226
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:12,340
right for the moment I want to stop

227
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:15,639
doing that and I want to go back to just

228
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,850
sort of overriding everybody with that

229
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,409
same color that's being sent down and so

230
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,800
what's going to happen there you can see

231
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:28,750
that now we're just getting lighting on

232
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:30,699
the cubes and there's not any there's no

233
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,519
differentiation between the various

234
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,500
surfaces of the cubes right they're

235
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,689
completely arbitrary

236
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,500
all of them are specified with the exact

237
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:43,420
same color so all we're getting is those

238
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,370
two fixed lights that I'm just playing

239
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,529
with right now that are always centered

240
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,810
at zero zero and you can see that it's

241
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,490
lighting everything exactly the same way

242
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:56,139
right there's no difference there

243
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:58,090
whatsoever um so that's a thing we got

244
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,189
to start with because we don't want that

245
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,269
fighting with our lighting yet that

246
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,840
doesn't mean we won't play with that a

247
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,850
little bit more in the future

248
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,310
potentially but for right now we don't

249
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,250
want to touch it so then we go ahead and

250
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:12,729
we say all right here's our program our

251
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,169
lighting program and I'm going to turn

252
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:25,570
off one of the lights for now I'm just

253
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:27,159
going to use one light like so and this

254
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,220
is going to be the light that's in the

255
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,899
middle so there's that light and I'm

256
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,170
just going to now start editing this

257
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:37,539
lighting equation to use those normals

258
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,979
that are coming through now one of the

259
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,990
things about the normals that come

260
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,070
through that's a little confusing and I

261
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,509
want to mention it here because it's

262
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,860
going to look like I don't need to do it

263
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:48,039
but I actually would have in other

264
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,800
circumstances is that this is and

265
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,240
actually I got a launched Milton I

266
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,039
forgot it rebooted this machine because

267
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,899
Windows wasn't finding the network of

268
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,740
course where could the network possibly

269
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:01,860
be so let me go ahead and launch Milton

270
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:13,620
up here and

271
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:16,528
a little day 90 normal interpolation so

272
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,950
the normal interpolation here on day 3

273
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:23,519
90s I want to talk about is just so if I

274
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:26,040
were to take up a triangle right and I

275
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,019
want you to think about the case where

276
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,799
for example like I talked about before

277
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:34,350
where there's a cylinder for example so

278
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,539
here's like my cylinder and let's say

279
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,000
that I was sort of drawing triangles on

280
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,189
the surface of this cylinder so you know

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,259
they look kind of like that well if you

282
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,060
take any given part of this here where

283
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,179
two of these triangles sort of meet up

284
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,369
right like this section here you've got

285
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:53,338
topology that looks something like this

286
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,100
right and what we know is this is

287
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,079
actually on a curved surface so the

288
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,659
normals for these things are going to

289
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,278
bend right each normal is going to be

290
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,958
pointy a different direction such that a

291
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,700
given triangle will have normals that

292
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:07,679
are pointing actually in different

293
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,879
directions right it's that one would be

294
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,409
the same if this one group the cylinder

295
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,570
there you go

296
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:17,789
right what that means is over the

297
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,860
surface of a triangle normals typically

298
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,719
will interpolate and if I took this and

299
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,300
laid it on its side so you could see

300
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,949
here's a triangle laying flat and I've

301
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,359
got one normal pointing this way and

302
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:30,088
I've got one normal pointing that way

303
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,759
let's say right like here and here not

304
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,860
to these two what you would notice is

305
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,809
that these two normals and I'm not

306
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,570
drawing these particularly well here I

307
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:41,389
should probably draw them to scale we

308
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,010
know that they're unit length so

309
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:48,059
actually it would be something more like

310
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:49,919
this right now the way we want to you

311
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,679
know if each of these is a unit length

312
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,719
the way we want these to work is we want

313
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,389
them to work kind of like this where

314
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,730
each time we interpolate the normal we

315
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:01,740
get a new unit length normal right we

316
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,959
want the length of our normal to equal

317
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,100
one at all times the reason we want to

318
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,509
do that because we're going to be taking

319
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,909
dot products with it and doing other

320
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:10,799
things where we don't want its length to

321
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:13,049
affect our computation so we want it to

322
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,329
be length one unfortunately what's going

323
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:18,659
to happen remember is

324
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,490
when we pass these down it's just like

325
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:22,559
everything else like fragment color and

326
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,740
that sort of stuff whenever we have a

327
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,989
vertex shader that outputs something to

328
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,299
the fragment shader that something is

329
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,159
linearly interpolated across the surface

330
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,750
now it's not strictly linear

331
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,730
interpolation because remember we get

332
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,289
perspective correction in there so it's

333
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,940
actually not really linear interpolate

334
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:41,730
it but it's linearly interpolated in

335
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,050
world space right it's just not linearly

336
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,360
interpolating the screen face because

337
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:47,219
it's pressure but if you put that out to

338
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,080
the side right now because all we're

339
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,850
talking about the moment is

340
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,070
interpolation in world space that we

341
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,350
actually care about and so that will be

342
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,390
happening linearly just like the

343
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,779
stepping along the triangle happens

344
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,309
linearly for all intents and purposes

345
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,220
you're never going to get something that

346
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:06,329
lies off of the line off of the triangle

347
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,879
right it's going to everything would be

348
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:11,550
on that triangle the same ends up being

349
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,519
true for normals so the normals will

350
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:16,259
also be interpolated in a line and what

351
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,289
that means is let's take a very

352
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:21,299
exaggerated case here's a two you know

353
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:23,099
one an edge of the triangle let's say we

354
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,139
had a normal pointing that way and a

355
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,210
normal pointing that way if you look at

356
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:28,620
what's happening here in between those

357
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,330
two we should get a normal that looks

358
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,009
like that we're actually going to get is

359
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,050
a normal that points yes in that

360
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,629
direction but that's much shorter right

361
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:39,179
it could be you know half the length

362
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,799
that it should be so instead of a length

363
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,449
of one instead of the length of the

364
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,709
normally glowing one the length of this

365
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:48,450
normals going to equal like point five

366
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:49,889
or something right so not only that but

367
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,629
we're not getting spherical

368
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,600
interpolation here so we're not getting

369
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:56,789
you know we're not getting that so as a

370
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,850
result when you interpolate linearly

371
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:01,949
across this you're also going to get a

372
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,930
difference in acceleration of the normal

373
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,870
so instead of a smooth rotation through

374
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:09,000
here it's actually going to have more at

375
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,950
the points than it does in the middle

376
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,509
it's going to get faster in the middle

377
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,860
meaning the the interpolation that are

378
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:16,649
one's going to change more dramatically

379
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,769
but at the end simply because a line is

380
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,970
getting projected out to an arc and

381
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:23,189
that's what happens in the line gets

382
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,769
projected out to an arc right you can

383
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,080
see this yourself just by drawing it if

384
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,919
you draw it like this so let's say I

385
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,019
have

386
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:36,269
it and I take an even number of steps

387
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:38,578
along it like so right so here these are

388
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,019
roughly equivalent steps if I then look

389
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:42,689
at what happens if I were to actually

390
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,028
take the real Ark here right if I extend

391
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,560
those outward look at what happens well

392
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,899
you know this is a really bad dry ground

393
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,338
I got it I got a little bit better than

394
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:55,708
that okay I'm gonna try really hard to

395
00:15:50,339 --> 00:16:02,570
draw a really good diagram here heaven

396
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:03,750
help me this is the worst circle ever

397
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,699
okay

398
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:17,458
so this part looks sort of circular

399
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:21,028
let's say there we go so let's say we

400
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:23,638
were going to take and use this as our

401
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:26,309
interpolation right so here's the

402
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:32,360
halfway mark here's the halfway mark

403
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:32,359
there let me see if I can do this

404
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,690
all right so I'll try my best to make

405
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,379
this work here I need like a ruler tool

406
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,380
or something

407
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:05,419
oops

408
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,250
so I didn't do as good as I would have

409
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,380
hoped but it's still good enough right

410
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,828
so hopefully you can see the difference

411
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,449
in speed that's happening there right

412
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:16,220
the distance between these two for

413
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,589
example is much less than this is

414
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,939
between these two and so that's what's

415
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:23,480
going to happen when you linearly

416
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:26,300
interpolate what is meant to be a

417
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,759
spherical quantity you're going to get

418
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:30,950
the angular interpolation is going to

419
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:32,599
get much more quick in the middle of

420
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,350
your things and much slower towards the

421
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:38,569
end right and so normally what you have

422
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:40,849
to do with normals normally yes too is

423
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:42,799
normals is you have to renormalize them

424
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:44,089
in the fragment shader or come up with

425
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
some other encoding scheme that's going

426
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,459
to interpolate properly right you have a

427
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,920
lot of different ways you could approach

428
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,600
it but you know the simplest one would

429
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,370
just be lets renormalize an illustrator

430
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,629
when you do that what you're spectively

431
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:56,119
doing is doing this projection outwards

432
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,770
to the speed the speed is wrong but

433
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,729
everything else is fine so all the rest

434
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:00,139
Cal goes right it's just the

435
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,009
interpolation is a little bit more wonky

436
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:07,130
than it should be right but for our

437
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:10,929
cases we have a much better situation we

438
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:13,670
only have cubes right and sprites

439
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:16,429
variables flat which means that for each

440
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:18,259
primitive we never round anything

441
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,120
we're always drawing a flat face on

442
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:21,859
something so our normals are always

443
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,569
playing the same direction which means

444
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:24,799
not only do we not to worry about that

445
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,329
speed problem because we're not

446
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,889
interpolating between anything they're

447
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:32,629
just constant right but we also don't

448
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,040
have to renormalize because the length

449
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,160
will stay one because they're not

450
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,569
actually bending at all and technically

451
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,400
if we wanted to instead of this being

452
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:43,819
smooth out we could probably actually

453
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,110
have this just be flat out but I don't

454
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:47,509
want to push my luck and start using

455
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:53,089
lots of different qualifiers because who

456
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:54,769
knows anyway so I'm not going to have to

457
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,909
do any of those things that I just said

458
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,139
but I want you to be aware of them

459
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,429
because if you're doing your own stuff

460
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,050
here and you want to make a curve privat

461
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,640
--iv or if we ever have to make a curve

462
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:04,519
primitive on handmade Hiro will have to

463
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,050
be aware of it all right so here's our

464
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,759
light distance fall-off here is the

465
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:09,319
amount of light that we have here now

466
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,179
what I want to do is I want to break up

467
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,799
this equation a little bit so the

468
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,230
distance equation right we all know what

469
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,750
the distance equation is

470
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,450
in this case it's the P - I guess we

471
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,240
should say the P of the surface - the P

472
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,850
of the light rank we're taking the

473
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,470
length of that that's the distance but

474
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:29,178
the problem with this equation right is

475
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,470
this produces a scalar that just tells

476
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,909
us how far away from the light we are

477
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,009
but we need more information for that

478
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:35,870
now we also need to know what direction

479
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,009
the light is shining on us because we

480
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:39,109
want to start to talk about these

481
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,210
surfaces and now we have the surface

482
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,408
normal because we specified that and we

483
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,210
know what point on the surface we're

484
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:46,519
talking about but now we need to know

485
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,679
some things right we need to know where

486
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,649
the viewer is right we need to know

487
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,480
where the viewer is and we need to know

488
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:55,638
where the light is because we want to

489
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,319
start constructing a reflection equation

490
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:59,269
here that will tell us how light is

491
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,519
supposed to bounce off of the surface so

492
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,048
we've got this we don't have this we

493
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,538
don't have this and we need to start

494
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:07,970
getting them now we did produce

495
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:10,339
essentially this because this equation

496
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:13,250
right here taking the length of PS minus

497
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:16,970
TL well what's PS minus PL well this is

498
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:19,429
PS and this is PL right so if we did PS

499
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,990
minus PL we would get this vector which

500
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:22,519
is the inbound lighting vector which is

501
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,990
exact what we want we want an outbound

502
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:25,909
lighting vector we can just switch these

503
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,950
two terms and do PL minus PS and get

504
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:29,899
that vector so whatever vector we want

505
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:35,538
we can get it pretty easily and that's

506
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:38,928
great right so without doing any more

507
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:47,000
work if I literally just pull out this

508
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:48,919
equation into two steps excuse me so

509
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,548
here's my vector that goes to the light

510
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,889
I can just say light P - royalty right

511
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:56,629
and now I can normalize this essentially

512
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:59,148
for free because I know I have to take

513
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,580
the light distance so I can say you know

514
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:05,229
length and you'll forgive me for never

515
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:13,308
remembering what the GLSL intrinsics are

516
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:16,339
GLSL reference card there you go just

517
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:18,408
lengths so if we take the length of that

518
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:20,599
to produce our like distance we then

519
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:22,700
know that we can normalize the vector to

520
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:26,058
the light by just saying I want to take

521
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,370
two light and I want to divide it equals

522
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:31,160
it by whatever that light

523
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:33,799
distance is right so this produces a

524
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,410
normalized to light vector we know we

525
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:41,450
have a world end vector so now we at

526
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:44,720
least know we at least know this and

527
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:47,120
this right so even with just that if we

528
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,100
assume a perfectly diffused surface we

529
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,769
could go ahead and dot product these two

530
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:54,308
together to emulate a fall-off of the

531
00:21:51,769 --> 00:22:00,829
light as it approaches a steeper angle

532
00:21:54,308 --> 00:22:02,149
to the surface right all right so let's

533
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:06,439
take a look at that so right now we're

534
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:08,360
doing this let's just rerun this here to

535
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,890
make sure that we're still computing the

536
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,329
fall-off properly right because we

537
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,860
haven't changed anything the fall-off

538
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:15,919
juice will be right and it does look

539
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:17,419
right so that's good but now we want to

540
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,308
do is take that two light vector and I

541
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,558
want to do the dot product of the two

542
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:23,420
light vector with that surface normal

543
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:26,149
right so now we're going to be producing

544
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,230
basically remember how many times we

545
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,910
talk about the dot product in the past

546
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,370
well it's coming back if it always comes

547
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,720
back right so now we've got essentially

548
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:36,439
this two lights vector we call that L

549
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,690
we've got n with dot product with L

550
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,509
right that's what we're producing here

551
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:46,279
now what what does that give us right

552
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:48,650
we've got in we got L what does that

553
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:50,450
give us well everyone everyone who's

554
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,820
left handmade hero had better be saying

555
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,340
it out loud right now it is the length

556
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:56,750
of n the length of L times the cosine of

557
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:58,939
the angle between them the angle between

558
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,259
them is right here right and anyone who

559
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,058
didn't just say that who has been

560
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:04,009
watching the series I'm going to

561
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:05,450
personally come over there and slap you

562
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,549
about the face a little bit just a

563
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:14,840
little bit not enough to leave any kind

564
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:17,659
of bruises okay so the M length of n

565
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,949
length of L cosine theta is what we're

566
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,840
going to get out of that now what do we

567
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,179
already say well this and this have

568
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,178
already been normalized right life of n

569
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:28,580
is one length of L is one so neither of

570
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:30,650
these two things is going to contribute

571
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:32,359
to this equation at all so all this will

572
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,390
compute is the cosine of the angle

573
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:37,189
between them right so this is the cosine

574
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,720
of the angle to our light source right

575
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:42,230
here and that is exactly what we would

576
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,419
need

577
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,419
to simulate the inbound lighting

578
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:49,250
equation right meaning if all we wanted

579
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:51,080
to do was pretend that all this surface

580
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,390
did was radiate light in every direction

581
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,548
whenever light hits it from any angle so

582
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,220
a completely diffuse perfect chalk

583
00:23:55,548 --> 00:24:00,589
surface well remember what happens is

584
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,720
that when light comes in it comes in you

585
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:05,750
know as as light hitting the surface

586
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,250
when light hits the surface the angle to

587
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,990
the light at which it hits the surface

588
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:15,230
right here is the angle which it hits

589
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:18,230
the surface the cosine of that is going

590
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,910
to be oops I wrote that in the wrong way

591
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:30,440
there we go

592
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:32,980
here's the address better and in fact

593
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,150
you know what this has always been

594
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,250
confusing to me for letting Cuevas so I

595
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:43,280
might work this out right now just to

596
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:44,599
satisfy my own self let's just let's

597
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,509
just do this out the whole way because

598
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:50,689
I'm interested to do it so first of all

599
00:24:47,509 --> 00:24:52,460
we have in inbound light right and the

600
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,890
inbound light is coming in at the

601
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,390
surface and we can assume that when it

602
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,770
strikes the surface if it's striking it

603
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,630
for a particular direction the cosine

604
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:05,839
rule should still apply right so here is

605
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:08,590
the inbound light and this triangle here

606
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:12,230
right this is the lighting direction

607
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:14,869
there's theta right and the right angle

608
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:18,650
the triangle is right there yeah so

609
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:21,349
here's the hypotenuse right there and

610
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,759
this right here is the amount of light

611
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:25,639
that's striking the surface in that

612
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:28,970
sense so it's reading the light out on

613
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:33,169
the surface proportional to basically

614
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:37,610
inverse of that cosine right so this

615
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:39,500
right here is the cosine of theta or I

616
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,689
should say H cosine theta so if we

617
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,339
assume this is just a unit size right we

618
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,410
would just have cosine theta is the

619
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:47,389
spreading function of this light so all

620
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,330
the light that comes in falls on cosine

621
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:55,370
Thetas worth of surface or so I should

622
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:58,009
say cosine cosine theta

623
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:03,250
worth of light falls on a unit length

624
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:08,410
surface right so 1/2 the cosine of theta

625
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:15,619
if you will right equals you know

626
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:17,420
surface light over incident light if

627
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:18,919
that makes sense this is the parts that

628
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,360
I've never really quite understood about

629
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,550
letting poisons I don't do a lot of work

630
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,719
with them so I just wanted to sort of

631
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:26,240
write out the equations for my own

632
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,000
amusement to see if they line up

633
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,809
intuitively or if you have to go make a

634
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,299
special leap right now for the viewing

635
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:37,399
direction you also get another situation

636
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:40,069
right where this exact same thing

637
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,410
happens so whatever angle I'm viewing at

638
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:43,309
and this is cosine Phi this is like a

639
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,720
different there's going to be a

640
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,789
different angle right the viewing

641
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,950
direction so this is the light up here

642
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:51,440
this is a viewer coming in here right so

643
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:58,850
the viewer on the other hand is is

644
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:02,059
viewing one units worth right of ups and

645
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:04,819
now to put this one units worth of the

646
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:10,039
surface is going to go out on cosine

647
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:11,509
Thetas worth of space right so if you

648
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:13,789
think about how much light you're

649
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:16,730
actually getting out on this shaft you

650
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:17,899
should be getting up more of the light

651
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,150
if that makes sense

652
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:25,040
if you I don't know if this makes any

653
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:27,340
time right so really just I shouldn't

654
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,659
say fate I shouldn't say cosine Phi

655
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:32,779
right so it's another angle that's the

656
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,460
viewing angle there right so the amount

657
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,649
of light that comes out that you're

658
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,710
seeing that coming off of the surface in

659
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,150
this case I feel like the amount of

660
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:48,110
light coming off of the surface should

661
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:49,850
be proportional to the inverse of that

662
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:54,139
because again you're going to end up

663
00:27:49,849 --> 00:28:00,740
with a situation of 1 over cosine C

664
00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:04,520
right this is the surface again and this

665
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:07,858
is the the width of the band right this

666
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:11,378
is the view that makes

667
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:15,308
but so if I had to do something

668
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:18,428
completely ridiculous here and just say

669
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:21,278
I want to take you know the incident

670
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:24,759
light that comes in right I want to

671
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:27,608
multiply that by the ratio of infinite

672
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:29,980
light to surface light right I want to

673
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:33,099
multiply that by the ratio of surface

674
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,528
I'm sorry of view light to surface light

675
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:37,959
and in so doing transform infinite light

676
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:39,579
into outbound light right what would

677
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,778
that equation look like it would be like

678
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:47,730
incidence times right surface over

679
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:47,730
incident which is one over cosine theta

680
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:57,519
times view over surface which is cosine

681
00:28:52,118 --> 00:29:00,038
5 times 5 over 1 equals my viewing

682
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,319
amount right because the view like

683
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,658
transmission and so looking at this I

684
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,548
would say naively not looking at any

685
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,139
graphics textbooks and having no idea

686
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:11,528
what I'm talking about right I'm I'm

687
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:14,408
literally just pretending I have two

688
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:17,108
surfaces and I'm just seeing what would

689
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:20,289
happen if I just write the map out no

690
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:24,939
preconceived notion here whatsoever then

691
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:28,868
I would get incident light x cosine Phi

692
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:33,850
over cosine theta equals the viewing

693
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:36,908
amount right that that's what I would

694
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:38,558
naively expect to see in my lighting

695
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:41,739
equation and what are these two things

696
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,168
well that's basically saying that I have

697
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:51,879
whatever my light strength is right this

698
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:55,330
is my light strength you know so my

699
00:29:51,878 --> 00:30:00,219
light strength times the cosine of the

700
00:29:55,329 --> 00:30:09,418
view angle over the cosine of the light

701
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:09,419
angle equals the viewed light strength

702
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:18,940
uh so yeah there you go that is that is

703
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:20,589
the naive persons wrote out the what

704
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,140
should happen to the amount of light

705
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:25,629
that gets like bounced off a surface if

706
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,460
you just tried to write it out as if you

707
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,660
literally have like bags of photons

708
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:34,090
coming down a beam and you wanted to

709
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:39,580
know what the proportional transfer to

710
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:41,470
that thing was right and so I don't know

711
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:43,659
if that holds a lot of water I don't

712
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,430
know if that's at all correct physics

713
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,680
wise but that's just what I would assume

714
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:50,080
and looking at that you know let's see

715
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,730
what that actually does so if we assume

716
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:58,119
for example that the light comes down at

717
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:02,079
disco sine theta right as that as that

718
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:05,859
same light band got you know steeper if

719
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:08,439
that makes sense you're shining quite a

720
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:12,009
bit less light on it so as this goes

721
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,970
down you get less light and the same

722
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:18,910
would be true of the other way around i

723
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,829
well know so as the viewer gets deeper

724
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,690
down you're seeing more of the surface

725
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:25,029
as a result so the opposite true of the

726
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:28,809
viewer meaning as the viewer gets higher

727
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:32,859
up you're seeing more of the unit area

728
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:35,440
of the thing right so I don't know that

729
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:37,959
that squares with what I expect from the

730
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,320
standard textbook lighting equations but

731
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,269
it seems like an interesting like I'm

732
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:45,879
not sure where the logic is flawed there

733
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:48,789
so it seems like that's roughly what I

734
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:56,500
would expect to have happen now that I

735
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:59,369
think about it right I mean I can't say

736
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,369
I know why that's wrong

737
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:11,239
yeah I would be interested to check I

738
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:16,769
would be interested to check this

739
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:18,960
against the physical lighting transfer

740
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:21,059
equations I don't know that we have

741
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,970
those in a particularly convenient form

742
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:26,669
that we can go look at because I would

743
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,769
like to see a real explanation of this

744
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:31,730
like I'd like to see what the actual

745
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:37,319
physical behavior is there worked out

746
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:38,940
because I feel like this seems

747
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:40,980
reasonable but I don't think I've ever

748
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,200
seen it written that way before so I'm

749
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:48,079
assuming it must not really be out works

750
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,080
but that seems relatively saying to me I

751
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:54,570
don't know anyway so we'll leave that as

752
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,859
an exercise for a little bit later

753
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:58,169
because we will have to check some

754
00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:00,599
reference material to when we get into

755
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,820
maybe some other lighting stuff but for

756
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,769
now I'm fine with it we can go ahead and

757
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:06,839
implement this and it'll just be

758
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:10,410
interesting at least to see what the

759
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:14,039
deal is so cosine Phi cosine theta on

760
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:16,560
the difference between those two and so

761
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,319
we already know how to implement one of

762
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,470
those which is the cosine theta portion

763
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:26,429
of that and so that would be 1 over

764
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:28,980
cosine theta would be the incident light

765
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:33,390
right which is to say that if the light

766
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,849
is directly down so if that angle and I

767
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:38,009
guess to be clear here we need to talk

768
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:39,329
about how we're measuring these angles

769
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:40,230
exactly but I'm measuring the angle on

770
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:43,949
the inside right now

771
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:46,440
so that 90 degrees right and this is a

772
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:48,870
little bit confusing so yeah how does

773
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,500
this work when cosine goes to 0 we want

774
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:54,989
cosine to go to 0 at this here so we

775
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,490
want this to be cosine of zero we want

776
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:01,410
this to be cosine of 1 right which is

777
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:04,349
exactly what I guess we would get in

778
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:09,119
this case because cosine if you think

779
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:11,039
about it right it starts at at 1 if it's

780
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,980
pointing in this direction and goes to 0

781
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:16,529
point when you get here so what we kind

782
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,190
of need to do is measure the other way

783
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,320
around

784
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:22,168
but that's exactly what our dot product

785
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,850
will actually do right dot product in

786
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:25,440
with the normal of the surface is

787
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:29,130
actually going to measure it in this

788
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,820
direction right so I think that's

789
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:35,309
exactly what we want to do anyway as far

790
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,440
as I can tell yeah so basically as this

791
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:40,279
angle goes down to zero this this will

792
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,639
clamp up to zero as well and it would be

793
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,870
increasing the as this kind of comes up

794
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,309
to 1 this would be 1 over 1 right I

795
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:54,659
would think and then it goes to 0 to get

796
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:56,250
it gets much higher what's weird about

797
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,899
that and which doesn't seem to make much

798
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,420
sense and maybe this is why I've messed

799
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,730
the map up here a little bit is we can't

800
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,079
if we have a divisor there but it feels

801
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,610
like we should have to have a divisor

802
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,309
there because again one of these two

803
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:10,380
things have to be a divisor

804
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:16,159
I would think since I don't see how they

805
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:18,960
could both be on the same side of it is

806
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:22,199
that that makes it so that these values

807
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,849
get very high eventually right which

808
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,699
doesn't make much sense like we want

809
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:29,429
these to be on top they make a lot more

810
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:31,109
sense right because if this is on top

811
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:33,809
and we have a very well-behaved equation

812
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,490
when this is on bottom we don't but I

813
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:38,449
don't see a lot of ways like I try to

814
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:40,799
think of exactly how we get around that

815
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:42,929
maybe I need to link these up in a

816
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,370
slightly different way right maybe I

817
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:46,980
can't string them in this particular

818
00:35:44,369 --> 00:35:55,440
fashion like for example if this was

819
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:57,539
cosine theta cosine Phi that is always

820
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,940
well behaved and it doesn't have weird

821
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:03,239
behavior like get it making this term

822
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,980
get very large as the as the view angle

823
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,629
decreases which is what would happen

824
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:11,550
here which doesn't really make any sense

825
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:13,500
right so just thinking about it I must

826
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:16,140
be thinking about that wrong in the way

827
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,389
that these things get related meaning

828
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,789
there must be some way to relate these

829
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:24,179
in a way that isn't talking about the

830
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:26,500
ratio of incoming versus outgoing in

831
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:29,578
that sense

832
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,579
[Music]

833
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:38,809
but I'm not sure exactly again what it

834
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,849
would be because it does seem like

835
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:44,690
that's still how you would think of it

836
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:45,949
right let me just do this one more time

837
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,880
and see if I can make a little bit

838
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:49,009
better sense of it

839
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,420
again I want to I always wanted to

840
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,710
understand this and I've never really

841
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,119
spent any time looking at it

842
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,840
rendering people have to do this all the

843
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:00,500
time so you know presumably they would

844
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,900
know how to do the right diagram here

845
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:06,170
for it for thinking about like micro

846
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,519
shaft of light but let's measure this

847
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:09,590
and let's measure it correctly the way

848
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:15,610
that we're going to measure it which is

849
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:21,019
like this so there's data there right

850
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:24,500
because we're going to be doing that as

851
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:25,699
the way to get our cosine so we kind of

852
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:31,789
want to measure it from the top down

853
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:35,029
does that make sense okay so if we were

854
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:37,009
to assume something like this where we

855
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:40,550
are pointing directly at the normal

856
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,590
right then a unit area a unit amount of

857
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,630
our light falls on a unit area and that

858
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:50,480
makes sense because the cosine of theta

859
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:55,280
in that case is the cosine of 0 which

860
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,869
equals 1 right and that means that 100%

861
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,130
of the light that hits the surface is

862
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:03,529
eligible for use right rather you know a

863
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,240
single amount of area is going to

864
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,050
reflect the complete amount of light

865
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:12,859
right that those photons all in you know

866
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:17,690
whatever unit width of light is are

867
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:22,030
going to hit the surface right now as we

868
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:28,159
move over here we're going to end up

869
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:31,340
looking more like this right and now for

870
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:37,670
the same amount of incident light there

871
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:41,329
it's going to fall on I guess I kind of

872
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:42,608
see how this is more logical so if this

873
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:50,578
remains the same

874
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:54,038
this got bigger right meaning as that

875
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:57,278
rotation goes down if we kept the same

876
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:59,950
size here right so we're that's probably

877
00:38:57,278 --> 00:39:01,539
where I messed up in my thinking so

878
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:09,639
let's say we're talking about the same

879
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:12,039
unit area always here right like so now

880
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:20,528
if I slant this over to the side like

881
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:25,480
this right as I go further to the side

882
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:31,650
that the size of that light gets smaller

883
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:34,239
and smaller right the the sort of that

884
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:37,778
gets smaller and smaller because before

885
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,909
it was equal to the whole size here same

886
00:39:37,778 --> 00:39:41,798
size of the surface but as it gets more

887
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:44,710
and more incident it gets equal to a

888
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:48,268
much lower amount right it gets equal to

889
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:53,220
a triangle that looks more like that

890
00:39:48,268 --> 00:40:01,798
right whereas this is theta out here

891
00:39:53,219 --> 00:40:05,318
right and if that's theta out here okay

892
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:08,588
if this is Zeta out here then I assume I

893
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:11,949
can do what I need to know is what's

894
00:40:08,588 --> 00:40:15,369
this in here so that's actually this

895
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:19,449
right here this angle is going to be 90

896
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:28,920
minus theta right and we would want the

897
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:32,739
cosine of 90 minus theta there I assume

898
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:36,579
right because this this value is not

899
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:39,068
really super relevant to us is it I mean

900
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:39,999
I can't see why it would be because it

901
00:40:39,068 --> 00:40:41,469
doesn't really have anything to do with

902
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:43,389
the shape of the light it's this one

903
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:49,449
over here so it's the cosine of the

904
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:53,108
theta on the inside there and that yeah

905
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:54,998
that really does seem to be like it

906
00:40:53,108 --> 00:40:56,529
would be the wrong way around

907
00:40:54,998 --> 00:41:01,029
what's interesting about that is

908
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:03,010
that's a sign if gonna which again

909
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,800
doesn't comport with what I would assume

910
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:12,790
to have happen with the lighting here

911
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:14,920
right so that's a little bit weird to me

912
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:17,829
if I want to know how much light source

913
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,809
was seen by this unit area the amount of

914
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:23,319
light source I'd see is going to be the

915
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:32,409
sine of theta I would think not the

916
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:40,289
cosine and furthermore it's actually the

917
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:40,289
negative sign right so that's peculiar

918
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:50,409
so that's a little bit closer to what I

919
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:53,730
would have expected but again it's a

920
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:56,769
little bit weird so I don't understand

921
00:41:53,730 --> 00:42:00,780
quite yet again how to draw that diagram

922
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:00,780
in a way that makes good sense to me I

923
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:06,579
do see that my mistake before was not I

924
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:09,429
need to think about a unit area on the

925
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:12,340
surface like a fixed area on the surface

926
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:19,119
and thinking about right the difference

927
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:22,960
between that and that and you can see

928
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,719
that this that same size of the surface

929
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,199
in terms of how much of the light area

930
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:31,839
it can see it can see much less because

931
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:34,449
here is the window of the view that this

932
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,740
unit area gets on the light source right

933
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:42,609
it's the same size as the surface area

934
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:44,469
so that's the 100% case 100 percent

935
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:47,530
transmission or 1 under separate

936
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:50,679
reception of of the light from that

937
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:53,620
surface but at the angle right we're

938
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:55,750
only going to see that much and that

939
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:57,489
makes really good sense to me and if

940
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,460
this were the angle we were measuring

941
00:42:57,489 --> 00:43:05,009
which is the angle from the her from the

942
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:10,039
surface out to the light source right

943
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:13,410
then it would make reasonable sense

944
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:20,579
because that is the value we're trying

945
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:21,839
to measure right and isn't that how we

946
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:23,909
would have to have measured it right

947
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,620
because but then against thinking about

948
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:28,170
it it actually works properly if it's

949
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,809
cosine theta because if this angle here

950
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:34,039
is zero cosine will be one if this angle

951
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:36,449
is 90 oh so am I miss thinking that

952
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:41,610
here's the right triangle that we're

953
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:47,909
trying to make and that's usually right

954
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:50,720
oh no no no I just got it turned around

955
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:53,519
so okay we're all good no need for panic

956
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:56,250
if I actually turn this around right

957
00:43:53,519 --> 00:44:00,599
this is cosine theta and that's sine

958
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:02,489
theta right so okay just the fact we've

959
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,690
dodged screams' upside down and me being

960
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:06,359
a little bit slow today that was the

961
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,940
problem so that does make good sense

962
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,620
then because cosine of this angle would

963
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,500
give us this and we don't want that

964
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:15,420
right we actually want the sine of that

965
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,909
angle but hey it turns out we're

966
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,619
measuring this angle so that's

967
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:21,809
absolutely perfect because since we're

968
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,940
measuring this angle this would be that

969
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:27,329
triangle right it's that triangle right

970
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,720
there and that is the cosine of that

971
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:33,389
angle right so that's pretty nice

972
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:37,980
actually okay

973
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:42,679
so that to me seems right so I would say

974
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:42,679
that the amount of light

975
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:52,750
so the amount of incident light is going

976
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:56,679
to be proportional to the cosine of the

977
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:58,449
angle right and I'm happy with that but

978
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:01,149
now let's ask the question what happens

979
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:04,049
on transmission right so now I want to

980
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:04,050
know okay

981
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:10,000
now I've got a viewer and if viewer is

982
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:11,619
going to look at this thing and it seems

983
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,699
to me that the same thing should happen

984
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:18,039
right so if I'm talking about this much

985
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:20,589
area that I'm viewing well if I'm

986
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:23,800
viewing it straight on then I should be

987
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:27,850
collecting all of that I should be

988
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:31,420
seeing all of that light that's getting

989
00:45:27,849 --> 00:45:33,190
well I guess hmm so this depends on how

990
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,630
we look at it so the light that comes in

991
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:37,000
how much you can see is the light source

992
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:43,030
how much you can see of the eye point is

993
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:47,380
a tougher question right because the

994
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:49,570
this stuff is getting evenly now but I

995
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,960
think that's probably true right if you

996
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:55,420
assume that every point on this surface

997
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:59,470
right is radiating equally in all

998
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:06,099
directions then in theory as long as you

999
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:08,139
have all of the light points in there it

1000
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:12,159
shouldn't really matter what the width

1001
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:14,650
is that you're viewing I don't think so

1002
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,619
it doesn't seem like the viewing angle

1003
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:21,250
would change it at all meaning the angle

1004
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:23,440
is the view in this case doesn't seem

1005
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:26,170
like it would apply so it seems like you

1006
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,420
only have the cosine theta term on the

1007
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,039
incident light because the incident

1008
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,750
light is how much of the light source

1009
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:33,099
you can actually see where you're

1010
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,920
talking about the viewer

1011
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:39,599
well the viewer I don't know that it

1012
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:42,159
would necessarily have that same effect

1013
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,829
because the viewer is collecting

1014
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,980
whatever gets thrown at them and I guess

1015
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:49,480
the collector size is changing in some

1016
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,110
sense there that's a really hard one to

1017
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,340
think through I'm not really sure how to

1018
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:58,680
think about that one from first

1019
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:58,680
principles very well but

1020
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:10,039
yeah I so I don't really know so in some

1021
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:11,840
sense I could see you multiplying by

1022
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:15,320
cosine fee because the same thing is

1023
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,550
true here is a size the the area on

1024
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,440
which you're sending that out to the

1025
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,480
viewer is going to be smaller but at the

1026
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,860
same time I think maybe there's an

1027
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,769
argument that you wouldn't do that

1028
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:26,150
because if this is actually uniform

1029
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:27,110
distribution function which is what

1030
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,030
we're starting with here because we're

1031
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,340
only talking we're not yet talking about

1032
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:34,040
the surfaces the surface properties

1033
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,630
we're assuming that the surface radiates

1034
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:37,429
light in all Direction uniformly it's

1035
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,250
perfectly diffuse because we could talk

1036
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:44,509
about later making it not the views

1037
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:47,809
right so if we think about that I'm just

1038
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:49,280
trying to gauge at that point if it's

1039
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:51,679
radiating equal in all directions as

1040
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,620
long as you're collecting everything

1041
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,210
from there from the same size it doesn't

1042
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:58,730
seem to matter that it's coming back in

1043
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:00,619
a smaller area no matter what the area

1044
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:05,690
is the total brightness is still the

1045
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:07,009
same coming back now I could see an

1046
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:09,769
argument being made that you would

1047
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,870
collect more because the same area on

1048
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:15,259
the collector is collecting more here

1049
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:17,839
than here right because let's say you

1050
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,880
took the same sized area that much well

1051
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,880
when it's looking straight down the same

1052
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,099
sized area back is looking at a lot less

1053
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,800
light than from the side which is

1054
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:31,579
collecting more light so it almost feels

1055
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:33,920
like it's an inverted scenario like the

1056
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:36,319
near the smaller it gets the brighter it

1057
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,320
should get because a smaller amount of

1058
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:44,870
looking at it is going to collect more

1059
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:47,240
light right so this is a bit of a

1060
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:49,549
puzzler I feel like this one really

1061
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:52,539
wants to be researched I feel like we

1062
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:56,030
should go read a physical rendering

1063
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:58,340
explanation of the reflection the

1064
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:00,560
differential reflections calculations

1065
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,870
here to get this right because I'm not

1066
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,369
sure I could really say I feel like

1067
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:07,819
that's a little bit above my paygrade

1068
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:11,079
in terms of rendering tech to say what

1069
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,330
should happen there but it feels like

1070
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,469
there

1071
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:18,360
is sort of a need to compensate for that

1072
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:24,719
and I feel like going back to thinking

1073
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:27,829
about photons bouncing around you know

1074
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:30,389
when we talk about the surface area a

1075
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:32,340
differential surface area you know

1076
00:49:30,389 --> 00:49:34,529
photons coming out of the light source

1077
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,720
well this band is going to collect a lot

1078
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:38,400
more photons than that band is so it

1079
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,139
makes a lot of sense to say that the

1080
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,900
amount of light incident on the same

1081
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:44,819
amount of area on a surface is going to

1082
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,410
be proportional with the cosine theta -

1083
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,059
the light source and the reason for that

1084
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:49,589
is just going to be that the cosine

1085
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:52,289
theta to the light source tells you how

1086
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:55,860
many wide the photon collecting band was

1087
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:59,070
for the same surface element right but

1088
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:00,720
for viewing we're talking about the fact

1089
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:03,120
that we're sort of viewing this whole

1090
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:05,069
surface right so we're talking about

1091
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,000
pixels that are collecting the light

1092
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:11,580
that's bouncing back at us here right

1093
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,480
and so when we talk about collecting

1094
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:18,420
from the surface it seems like what

1095
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,490
should be happening is that as you get

1096
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:26,450
more oblique to the surface it should be

1097
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:26,449
looking brighter to you right I mean

1098
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:42,098
I guess what I would say about that is

1099
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:00,109
I mean I'll be honest with you just for

1100
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:01,548
again I wanted to work with that from

1101
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:03,078
first principles rather than looking at

1102
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:05,059
somebody's explanation of it because I

1103
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:10,099
just wanted to like have that experience

1104
00:51:05,059 --> 00:51:11,239
I've never done it right I and I'll be

1105
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,528
honest with you just looking at it from

1106
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:13,789
first principles it just really feels

1107
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:16,219
like there's going to have to be an

1108
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:18,470
inverse relationship there and again I'm

1109
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:20,328
probably just wrong about that because

1110
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:22,879
I'm probably my intuition is probably

1111
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:24,650
missing something but here's my

1112
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,588
explanation for why I would think that's

1113
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:30,380
the case let's take a weird scenario

1114
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:33,558
where we're just saying here's some

1115
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:35,329
surface right and we've pre said how

1116
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:39,289
much light is emanating from this

1117
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:40,999
surface right and we're saying it's

1118
00:51:39,289 --> 00:51:43,278
uniformly scattering in all directions

1119
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:45,169
so the same amount of light is getting

1120
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:47,719
scattered in any direction you happen to

1121
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:49,818
choose to look at this thing right well

1122
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:51,618
if I was to put my collector directly

1123
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:55,338
above it and the collector is this size

1124
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:57,769
then I am going to get all of this

1125
00:51:55,338 --> 00:52:00,139
surfaces light that it has to contribute

1126
00:51:57,768 --> 00:52:01,308
in that direction right I'm missing all

1127
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:04,308
the light that's going in the other

1128
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:07,099
directions I'm going to have this much

1129
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:09,319
you know that big of a band worth the

1130
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:13,729
whole surface is worth is going to fall

1131
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:16,009
on my entire collector right so however

1132
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:18,139
much is falling on a particular part of

1133
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:19,998
this collector let's say however much

1134
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:23,598
this light is that it shines off in one

1135
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:25,278
direction if that's L then I'm going to

1136
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,278
get whatever the width of this thing is

1137
00:52:25,278 --> 00:52:32,119
I'm going to get L over W right as the

1138
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:35,869
amount of light per unit area on my

1139
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:39,380
collector right again really just being

1140
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:41,119
dumb being a dumb non graphics

1141
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:45,278
programmer that's just what I would

1142
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:48,680
think right and then if I take the same

1143
00:52:45,278 --> 00:52:52,219
collector and I move it over here right

1144
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:57,768
so now you know the collector looks like

1145
00:52:52,219 --> 00:53:00,349
this right well if I take a look at what

1146
00:52:57,768 --> 00:53:03,858
part of this I could see it's actually

1147
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:06,499
the same amount of light right is

1148
00:53:03,858 --> 00:53:07,630
falling on a much smaller part now

1149
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:08,989
remember this is supposed to reflect

1150
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:12,440
evenly in

1151
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:13,969
all directions so I seeing the same

1152
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:16,190
amount of surface and it should be

1153
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:19,719
reflecting the same amount of light out

1154
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:23,150
in all directions so in theory right

1155
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:24,679
shouldn't this now be you know maybe

1156
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:27,889
that's half the width or something

1157
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:33,919
shouldn't this be L over width over 2 or

1158
00:53:27,889 --> 00:53:36,199
2l over with so shouldn't this thing now

1159
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,590
appear to be brighter than it appeared

1160
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:40,969
before it seems like a dumb result so

1161
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:44,510
I'm guessing the answer must be no

1162
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:48,439
that's stupid and here is why but the

1163
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:58,310
here's why part I don't know what that

1164
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:59,450
here's why part is and I guess one way

1165
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:01,429
to think about it is these not

1166
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:03,829
collimated light so really you know

1167
00:54:01,429 --> 00:54:05,480
you're getting a cone of light and it's

1168
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:07,369
going to fall on the whole thing right

1169
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,500
and in both circumstances it's going to

1170
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:11,539
fall on the whole thing and maybe that's

1171
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,420
the answer is that since it's uniformly

1172
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:18,590
radiating out and not collimated like

1173
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:21,200
that that you always will pick up from

1174
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:23,510
any point on here you're always going to

1175
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:28,159
pick up that much of the light that's

1176
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:31,850
coming out right from any point on here

1177
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:34,599
so it's always uniform because no matter

1178
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:37,608
how big of the light source you are each

1179
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:40,579
infinitesimally on there is always

1180
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:43,608
projecting out towards someplace on here

1181
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:47,259
and you're always going to that integral

1182
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:47,259
will always work out to be the same

1183
00:54:47,858 --> 00:54:51,920
that's the best I can do to convince

1184
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:56,269
myself that there wouldn't be a term in

1185
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:59,358
there so I'm going to stick with just a

1186
00:54:56,269 --> 00:55:00,590
cosine for now since I'm relatively

1187
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,900
convinced that that's the correct term

1188
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:04,670
for the incident light I would like to

1189
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,300
look at the viewer operations I might

1190
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:10,849
take a gander this week in between

1191
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,650
episodes to take a look at a physics

1192
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,118
rendering text to see what their

1193
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:16,700
explanation is because I'm assuming that

1194
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:20,630
they have a good way of explaining why

1195
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:23,298
there presumably isn't a angular term to

1196
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:25,219
the reflection again prior

1197
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:27,528
- calculating any kind of surface

1198
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:28,938
property right obviously service

1199
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:31,219
properties introduced angular

1200
00:55:28,938 --> 00:55:32,958
coefficients but we're not talking about

1201
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:34,849
service properties yet we're talking

1202
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:37,038
about if you factor the surface out and

1203
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:38,239
you're only talking about the angle the

1204
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:44,569
direction of the light and the viewer

1205
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:47,298
right so anyway once we have this dot

1206
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:50,808
product of the light to the world like

1207
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:52,188
that at that point we know since we're

1208
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,929
going to light and we have the world

1209
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:55,219
number those four affections one of the

1210
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:58,068
things that we're going to have here is

1211
00:55:55,219 --> 00:56:01,938
this can be negative right so if this is

1212
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:05,478
my surface and the light is over here

1213
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:07,278
right it's coming from behind then when

1214
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:08,838
we compute the angle to the light and we

1215
00:56:07,278 --> 00:56:11,148
dot pack these together we're going to

1216
00:56:08,838 --> 00:56:12,978
get a negative value right this is going

1217
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:16,548
to be negative something you know like

1218
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:18,379
negative point six or something right so

1219
00:56:16,548 --> 00:56:20,389
what we need to do here is after we take

1220
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:22,039
that cosine we need to clamp it because

1221
00:56:20,389 --> 00:56:23,929
once the light gets behind the surface

1222
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:26,089
it can't shine on the surface anymore

1223
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:27,979
unless this surface was transmitted so

1224
00:56:26,088 --> 00:56:31,068
light coming from behind it passes

1225
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:33,379
through so it's got translucent we

1226
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:35,929
shouldn't see it right so what we want

1227
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,269
to do here is we want to use a clamp and

1228
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:42,709
there is a good clamping here

1229
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:45,379
OpenGL provides that by default so

1230
00:56:42,708 --> 00:56:47,898
here's our clamp right because they

1231
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,489
clamp this value to emit into max and

1232
00:56:47,898 --> 00:56:53,388
that's all we need to do so we can say

1233
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:56,028
cosine angle equals clamp of the cosine

1234
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:57,528
angle between zero and one and so if we

1235
00:56:56,028 --> 00:56:58,880
clamp it between zero and one now we

1236
00:56:57,528 --> 00:57:01,728
know that if we get behind the light

1237
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,229
source it won't contribute so now all we

1238
00:57:01,728 --> 00:57:06,858
need to do is take what we were

1239
00:57:03,228 --> 00:57:09,498
previously computing to be the light

1240
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:12,168
strength based on fall-off and now we

1241
00:57:09,498 --> 00:57:14,898
just use the cosine of the angle to

1242
00:57:12,168 --> 00:57:17,478
determine what the angular reflection

1243
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:19,308
should be of that light now if we've

1244
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:21,348
actually specified our normals correctly

1245
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:22,489
oh man that doesn't look like we

1246
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:23,449
specified our normal schedule looks like

1247
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:27,889
our nerville's are coming through as

1248
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:30,409
zero um if we actually specify our

1249
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:33,229
normals correctly we would have gotten a

1250
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:34,489
good result there I suspect but at the

1251
00:57:33,228 --> 00:57:36,879
moment it looks like our normals aren't

1252
00:57:34,489 --> 00:57:39,230
and so what you can see here is

1253
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,250
we did do two lights so this is

1254
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:45,559
direction from the world to the light

1255
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:48,559
right and here's the distance we

1256
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:50,119
normalize based on that distance so that

1257
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,250
should produce a unit length light

1258
00:57:50,119 --> 00:58:00,170
vector there we can also praise this

1259
00:57:52,250 --> 00:58:01,489
this way which is a little bit better it

1260
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,539
shouldn't change result at all but it's

1261
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:05,209
just a little bit better way of saying

1262
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:08,509
it in terms of normalization there so

1263
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:10,039
basically what happens is we multiply

1264
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,690
the vector by one over the like this and

1265
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:13,849
so we don't divide each component we

1266
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:20,480
multiply each one case multiply is

1267
00:58:13,849 --> 00:58:22,269
faster we then take the cosine of the

1268
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,269
angle between them by dot product in the

1269
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:31,369
pink the two light and the world oh you

1270
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:33,349
know what though no actually that's

1271
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:37,068
that's fine and then we take the cosine

1272
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:38,630
of angle and we claim that between zero

1273
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:41,058
and one right and I believe I put those

1274
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:46,640
parameters in correct order right it's X

1275
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:49,400
min max right yeah so X min Max and so

1276
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:51,348
after that we should end up with the

1277
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,480
correct value for cosine angle but we're

1278
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:58,400
obviously not getting a good result from

1279
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:00,679
it Jimmy and so the question is why not

1280
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,559
my first suspicion is that our normals

1281
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:05,629
are not coming in as correct values

1282
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:07,130
right so what I'm interested to see here

1283
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:10,309
is if I was to go ahead and say that

1284
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:12,530
everything points up directly up so

1285
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:16,339
world n is zero zero one I just want to

1286
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:17,900
see what happens there okay so it's the

1287
00:59:16,338 --> 00:59:20,058
rest of our equation that's busted it

1288
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:22,940
looks like so let me go ahead and debug

1289
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:24,920
why that is so let's say I set cosine

1290
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:27,559
angle here it's cosine angle if I

1291
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,420
overwrite it with one we should be in a

1292
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:31,819
situation where we get our lighting back

1293
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:34,760
right yeah so that's what we would

1294
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:36,619
expect and that is what we got

1295
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,510
so now let's say well if we take our

1296
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:40,280
cosine angle

1297
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,770
prior to clamping just to make sure the

1298
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,119
clamp isn't the problem if we tear

1299
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:47,929
across thing I'll probably clamping and

1300
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:48,880
set it to be 10.5 or rather even if I

1301
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:50,919
just said it

1302
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,500
I should get full lighting again it

1303
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:56,110
should just pasture as one it does so

1304
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,329
that's good so then I've got our job

1305
00:59:56,110 --> 01:00:08,980
practice of a to light with the world

1306
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:10,719
end so let me set both the world end so

1307
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,219
now we're assuming that the light if I

1308
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:14,259
wanted to actually make these both would

1309
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:19,509
be so now we're assuming that the light

1310
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:21,850
and the world normal are both pointing

1311
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,380
straight up so we should get one here as

1312
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:24,940
well and we show the same lighting and

1313
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:27,610
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going

1314
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,050
to knock out the normal part of that to

1315
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:33,970
see what happens if we just set the to

1316
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:36,519
light and so if I knock out the world in

1317
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:44,859
part I get zero if I knock out the to

1318
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:49,809
light part I get oh not quite zero but a

1319
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:51,220
very odd sort of behavior there one

1320
01:00:49,809 --> 01:00:53,079
thing that's true is our light probably

1321
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:55,209
needs to be up above us a little bit

1322
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:57,549
more so let me go ahead and make the

1323
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:59,889
light be a little bit higher up it might

1324
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:09,269
just be in geometry at the moment there

1325
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:13,118
we go okay okay

1326
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:13,119
[Applause]

1327
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:19,150
okay

1328
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:21,069
so now if I go ahead and and see what

1329
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:25,180
happens let me restore world normals to

1330
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:27,460
be pointing directly upwards so if I

1331
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:31,419
make world normals point directly upward

1332
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:34,119
we do collect light right and we get

1333
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,590
some fall-off of the light distance so

1334
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:37,450
we may have to up the light strength a

1335
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,800
little bit here just to still because I

1336
01:01:37,449 --> 01:01:39,549
put the light up a bit higher so I'm

1337
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,450
just going to make the light a bit

1338
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:45,880
stronger so there you can kind of see us

1339
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:48,429
lighting one thing that's a little weird

1340
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,710
about that is I'm not really sure why

1341
01:01:48,429 --> 01:01:52,598
the light amount changes so much based

1342
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:54,099
on the height because the height

1343
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:57,609
difference shouldn't have been that

1344
01:01:54,099 --> 01:02:00,880
great for these things I wouldn't have

1345
01:01:57,608 --> 01:02:03,909
expected it to quite be so dramatic

1346
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,559
in terms of like the distance should

1347
01:02:03,909 --> 01:02:08,379
have been smoother there I would have

1348
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:08,940
thought it doesn't make a lot of sense

1349
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:14,829
to me

1350
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:17,530
to be completely honest I think we've

1351
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:23,019
got think we've got other problems to

1352
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:26,830
say the least so a couple things here

1353
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:30,400
first of all yeah I was seeing in this

1354
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:32,049
situation a lot of color changes based

1355
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,570
on the distance to the I mean based on

1356
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,519
the viewing angle which I don't know I

1357
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:40,119
mean there could be fog effects involved

1358
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:41,920
there but I wasn't expecting to see that

1359
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:43,329
I guess that might be fog I don't know

1360
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:48,639
but like see how these are getting

1361
01:02:43,329 --> 01:02:50,108
darker as I get a bleak to them and I

1362
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:55,449
don't really feel like that should be

1363
01:02:50,108 --> 01:02:59,848
happening right that doesn't that should

1364
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:59,848
not be occurring out thing and

1365
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:09,880
with the radial fall-off you wouldn't

1366
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,590
expect the small height difference to

1367
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,070
make such a pronounced difference but

1368
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:16,930
it's not out of the question I suppose

1369
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:18,970
that it would but anyway let's take a

1370
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:23,829
look at what happens if I need both of

1371
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:24,969
these so the two light and the other one

1372
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:26,889
or both is saying do I still get that

1373
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:29,289
you can still see that even if those are

1374
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:32,049
even if we're just using the distance

1375
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:34,329
fall-off so let's let's see here if all

1376
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:36,580
we're doing is distance fall-off so

1377
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:44,110
cosine angle is always going to be 1 in

1378
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:46,420
this case in theory even in that case we

1379
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:49,570
get some interesting effects there so

1380
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:51,820
let's say let's let's just clamp total

1381
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:53,110
light to 1 so now there's no lighting at

1382
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:57,309
all right

1383
01:03:53,110 --> 01:04:00,849
it's just flat what happens if I do that

1384
01:03:57,309 --> 01:04:03,820
same behavior that I was doing does do I

1385
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:06,009
get darker here so you can see I get I

1386
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:08,289
don't get darker so something weird is

1387
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:12,420
happening because if I'm setting the

1388
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:16,590
cosine this light distance itself

1389
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:18,670
appears to be changing based on

1390
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:22,740
something that it shouldn't be changing

1391
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:26,470
based on right because this light P

1392
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:28,929
world P is supposed to be just passed

1393
01:04:26,469 --> 01:04:32,500
straight through it's not supposed to

1394
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:36,669
have any relationship to the transform

1395
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:44,199
of the camera at all right it should not

1396
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:46,950
be it should not be related in any way

1397
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:46,949
to the transform

1398
01:04:55,588 --> 01:05:01,779
so let's take a look at this shader one

1399
01:04:57,699 --> 01:05:06,789
more time so here we go we take our

1400
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:08,170
vertex right and we produce the proper

1401
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:09,550
homogeneous coordinate version of the

1402
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:12,280
vertex because remember the restore the

1403
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:15,579
Z bias in the W coordinate we pull the Z

1404
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:18,460
bias out and we set the set it to one in

1405
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:26,470
the W coordinate we then create a Z

1406
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:29,829
vertex which is our vertex that's just

1407
01:05:26,469 --> 01:05:31,299
our vertex biased up by the Z amount

1408
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:33,599
that we want to buy so we're pretending

1409
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:37,809
it's in a higher place than it is right

1410
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:39,490
we then transform both the vertex that

1411
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:41,410
we started with and this vertex that

1412
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:44,019
we've artificially bumped up with the

1413
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:46,719
bias we transfer in both of those and

1414
01:05:44,019 --> 01:05:48,309
that will transform them by the camera

1415
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:51,578
transform to view them where we're going

1416
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:56,019
to view them by we then go ahead and

1417
01:05:51,579 --> 01:05:57,700
take the modified Z as being our we do

1418
01:05:56,019 --> 01:06:03,068
basically the transform that we would

1419
01:05:57,699 --> 01:06:07,239
have done to produce a correct V value

1420
01:06:03,068 --> 01:06:08,650
for our result right for our you know

1421
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:11,439
synthetic result we're going to pass

1422
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:13,450
through but then we take just whatever

1423
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,599
the Z vertex was what we were initially

1424
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:20,949
fashion with its artificial Z value

1425
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:22,660
there right we take that and we pass

1426
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:24,489
that directly reader so that should not

1427
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:27,068
none of this work should affect that

1428
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:28,929
it's just got to be bias added to it and

1429
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:30,789
that's it and by the way the cubes which

1430
01:06:28,929 --> 01:06:33,879
you were seeing the weird sort of

1431
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:35,739
artifacts on those are not even in don't

1432
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,289
even have a Z bias so those are just 0

1433
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:39,639
all right we then pass that through to

1434
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:42,909
world P which is supposed to be

1435
01:06:39,639 --> 01:06:46,389
interpolated and presumably is being

1436
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:48,489
interpolated properly we set a fixed

1437
01:06:46,389 --> 01:06:50,889
location in world space for the lights

1438
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:57,449
which is just the center of world space

1439
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:57,449
0 0 4 right and then we take our

1440
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:03,070
[Applause]

1441
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:06,190
we take our light and we just look at

1442
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:08,110
what the distance was from where we are

1443
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:09,940
in the world that sort of what should be

1444
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:11,710
a normally interpolating value in world

1445
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:14,349
space linearly interpolated value in

1446
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:19,500
world space and we take whatever the

1447
01:07:14,349 --> 01:07:19,500
light location was and we subtract them

1448
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:38,510
so yeah I don't know if there's anything

1449
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,510
particularly strange doing it that way

1450
01:07:53,289 --> 01:07:58,719
I mean I can't think of anything strange

1451
01:07:56,289 --> 01:08:01,029
that would be going on there why the

1452
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:04,919
distance to the light source would be

1453
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:04,920
changing based on the view angle there

1454
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,000
I really can't so let's go back and just

1455
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,489
verify that that really is happening

1456
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,630
though so if cosine angle equals one so

1457
01:08:29,489 --> 01:08:32,399
basically we're just using light

1458
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:36,079
strength over light distance times like

1459
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,079
distance so the squared light distance

1460
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:43,250
if that's all we're doing then what I

1461
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:43,250
was deserving before

1462
01:08:55,449 --> 01:09:02,500
it just seems like that's getting darker

1463
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:04,470
as I rotate upwards is it possible that

1464
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:07,029
that's just an optical illusion I guess

1465
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:20,110
that's just because they're getting

1466
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:22,869
closer to other parts of the I guess I

1467
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:25,000
could just be an optical illusion let's

1468
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:26,649
see if it is that could be one of those

1469
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,699
optical illusions so here I'm going to

1470
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:42,819
do shift printscreen and I'm going to

1471
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:45,010
open up there's game and then I'm

1472
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:47,349
going to go ahead and do that rotation

1473
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:49,989
downwards and I'm going to do another

1474
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:54,250
ship print screen and then I'm going to

1475
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:56,819
paste that is the new layer then I'm

1476
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,819
going to crop it

1477
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:06,930
and I'm going to put these next to each

1478
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:09,770
other and I'm going to look at the

1479
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:09,770
values of them

1480
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:28,950
all right so here is like the edge of

1481
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:36,869
this cube the corner of this cube here

1482
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:40,470
and it's 38 60 39 right all right it's

1483
01:10:36,869 --> 01:10:49,019
just an optical illusion I guess wow

1484
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:53,699
that's crazy right oh I is in color they

1485
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:54,630
don't really work all right so maybe

1486
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:56,039
that's correct

1487
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:59,730
I'm willing to give it the benefit of

1488
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:02,550
the doubt for now so that's time man

1489
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:06,389
that's weird all right so let's get back

1490
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:07,470
to debugging now I can not I can you

1491
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,840
know not freak out that there's

1492
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:11,220
something wrong there so really we just

1493
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,750
have to figure out what's wrong with our

1494
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:15,810
cosine computation here because it's

1495
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:17,970
obviously not working quite correctly so

1496
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:19,590
the world normals it would be nice to

1497
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:23,010
verify what direction those were

1498
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:25,260
pointing in as well but for now let's

1499
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:27,600
just get back to the start so if I'm

1500
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:29,970
going to fix both of those normals to 20

1501
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:35,880
upwards I'll get the same result if I

1502
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:40,640
switch the world normal but not the the

1503
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:44,119
one that goes to the light source right

1504
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:47,550
what does that give me

1505
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:50,939
so that appears to give me some actual

1506
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:52,590
lighting correctly but the calculation

1507
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,899
of making the light go to the light

1508
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:56,819
source seems to I'm sorry the the

1509
01:11:54,899 --> 01:12:00,960
calculation of fixing that the normal

1510
01:11:56,819 --> 01:12:03,689
seems to be the to be good if I do that

1511
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:07,500
if I instead fix neither of them so if I

1512
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:09,509
don't fix the world normal then I get

1513
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,250
black so it suggests to me that my world

1514
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:17,850
normals are just not coming through

1515
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:23,579
correctly right so I'm wondering if

1516
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:26,240
invert up I never pass the fruit so of

1517
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:26,239
course there's zero

1518
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:32,979
so now I'm actually passing it to the

1519
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:36,369
fragment shader rather than leaving it

1520
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:38,799
set to zero okay so there we go so now

1521
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:42,279
our light source is reflecting more

1522
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,140
correctly right and hopefully you can

1523
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:47,019
see from that that now we get a lot more

1524
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:48,610
of a sense of lighting too as well and

1525
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,870
correctly is the wrong word here I don't

1526
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:53,139
actually mean to say it's correct

1527
01:12:49,869 --> 01:12:56,439
we're just probably more correct we

1528
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:57,970
haven't done testing so who knows but

1529
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:59,799
here you can kind of see if I look at it

1530
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:01,480
right the light source is directly above

1531
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,789
I get almost no lighting on those

1532
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:05,409
surfaces because they're totally oblique

1533
01:13:03,789 --> 01:13:06,819
to the light but I get plenty of

1534
01:13:05,409 --> 01:13:10,000
lighting on these other services over

1535
01:13:06,819 --> 01:13:12,819
here right so that's a more reasonable

1536
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,869
direct lighting calculation it's not the

1537
01:13:12,819 --> 01:13:15,369
lighting calculation we're going to

1538
01:13:13,869 --> 01:13:16,599
actually want to use and the reason for

1539
01:13:15,369 --> 01:13:18,550
that is because the main bit light we'll

1540
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,440
talk about that a little bit but we're

1541
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:25,570
starting to get more of a definition

1542
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:28,089
here to the surface right um now let's

1543
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:30,579
talk a little bit just for a second here

1544
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:33,010
I want to sort of add the ability to

1545
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:35,710
test this out more this is not what

1546
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:39,220
we're going to want to do at the end of

1547
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:41,319
the day so I don't want to make it sound

1548
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:44,079
like this was accident was going to stay

1549
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:45,369
in here but temporarily speaking I would

1550
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:47,109
like the ability to move the light

1551
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:49,420
around as well right

1552
01:13:47,109 --> 01:13:51,130
and we're going to want to do something

1553
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,539
a little bit more fancy for moving the

1554
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:55,029
light around in the future so this is

1555
01:13:52,539 --> 01:13:58,930
not a good example of how we would be

1556
01:13:55,029 --> 01:14:04,119
doing that going forwards but if I come

1557
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:07,210
in here and where's my my render group

1558
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:09,640
whereas my settings here so here's my

1559
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:15,550
render setup if temporarily speaking I

1560
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:17,200
just did like a v3 debug light P where

1561
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:21,159
you could set the location that the

1562
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:23,130
light was coming from for example if I

1563
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:26,529
wanted to add something like that I

1564
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:29,230
certainly could right and what I would

1565
01:14:26,529 --> 01:14:32,050
need to do there is go into the OpenGL

1566
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:35,169
stuff and take a look at where we set

1567
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:37,060
say for example fog color and so

1568
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,590
something in here we would just add

1569
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:41,039
another one at the end but we're just

1570
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:48,600
going to use just very temporarily

1571
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:50,698
debug light P and that is something that

1572
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,980
again is just now where we have this

1573
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:57,229
light P here I'm going to I'm going to

1574
01:14:52,979 --> 01:14:57,229
pull that out and say that the uniform

1575
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:03,179
[Applause]

1576
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:06,239
okay and so I'm just going to say that

1577
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:08,550
we've got a debug light P in there and

1578
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:12,869
that's for our Z bias program that's

1579
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:15,420
something's going to show up here and

1580
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:17,390
then whenever we use that uniform

1581
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:40,319
that's re whenever we use that program

1582
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:43,579
we can just cut it like so what is the

1583
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:45,779
problem connect avert cost GL float

1584
01:15:43,579 --> 01:15:48,179
start I don't know why this isn't

1585
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:50,369
wrapping anymore though it's wrapping it

1586
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:56,340
the wrong size I guess cannot convert

1587
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:59,880
argument three from v3 okay that you can

1588
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:04,500
now so now we have to do is actually set

1589
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:07,170
that in the render group so in the

1590
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:10,050
render group when we pass the sound set

1591
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:12,000
camera transform we're gonna need a way

1592
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:18,029
to control these things better but keep

1593
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,439
the light P do this and so now we run

1594
01:16:18,029 --> 01:16:22,079
the game you know we should get the same

1595
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:23,460
results with the light is kind of in the

1596
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:26,359
center of the world now what we want to

1597
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:31,170
do is put that somewhere reasonable so

1598
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:33,569
when we pop over to world mode where it

1599
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:38,010
sets like the near clip plane and stuff

1600
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:44,519
like that we can also set that divided

1601
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:51,548
by T and so in here where we set that

1602
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:51,549
[Applause]

1603
01:16:56,670 --> 01:17:02,680
and hey guess what if you want to set

1604
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:07,899
that you've got to actually set it to

1605
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:19,200
something as it turns out where should

1606
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:21,519
that get set probably just right here so

1607
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:23,289
yeah if you take a look at what's

1608
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,760
happening now we're back to the original

1609
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:27,850
and now we can move the light around

1610
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:29,920
anywhere that we want to move the light

1611
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:32,829
around I'm going to probably just attach

1612
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:37,390
it to the hero for now I guess and so we

1613
01:17:32,829 --> 01:17:41,890
know where the hero is standing in a in

1614
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:44,770
a sense I think probably maybe do I I

1615
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:47,700
don't really remember to what extent we

1616
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:47,700
actually know that

1617
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:03,460
once we do the simulation we do so

1618
01:18:00,488 --> 01:18:05,500
here's the camera entity here so if

1619
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:07,779
there's a camera entity I guess we can

1620
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:10,289
just say like hey whatever the camera

1621
01:18:07,779 --> 01:18:10,289
entity

1622
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:22,809
whatever the camera entities position is

1623
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:27,949
that's all we really wanted to know

1624
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:30,289
right so we want to set the the light

1625
01:18:27,949 --> 01:18:37,880
position to that so I'll just go ahead

1626
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:40,689
and put one in here and we'll just

1627
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,690
specify it that way

1628
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:46,550
[Applause]

1629
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:48,320
and we're probably going to want to bias

1630
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:49,909
it up a little bit from that because

1631
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:54,079
that'll be just where the person

1632
01:18:49,909 --> 01:18:56,559
standing I assume why am I not seeing

1633
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:56,559
that move

1634
01:18:57,729 --> 01:19:00,839
[Applause]

1635
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:14,630
[Applause]

1636
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:27,859
Oh camera entity is not what I guess I

1637
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:29,779
mean uh now that is what I mean

1638
01:19:27,859 --> 01:19:32,420
so camera entities should be correct

1639
01:19:29,779 --> 01:19:36,079
there I got to see oh right Comex that's

1640
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:38,119
problem there we go and so what we

1641
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,680
probably want to do here is also bias

1642
01:19:38,119 --> 01:19:42,769
this up so that it's kind of hovering

1643
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:44,060
above maybe that's a little bit too much

1644
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:45,410
that's probably not where the hero's

1645
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:49,280
head would be that's probably more where

1646
01:19:45,409 --> 01:19:50,599
the heroes head to be alright so there

1647
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:53,119
we go

1648
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,490
so now it's basically like the light is

1649
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:58,460
just on the hero's head as the hero

1650
01:19:55,489 --> 01:20:02,149
moves around and you can kind of see

1651
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:06,439
that light falling on the services more

1652
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:07,759
correctly now than it was before and you

1653
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:09,589
can actually see a lot of definition in

1654
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,350
those services - right like like I said

1655
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:15,590
before even just basic lighting that's

1656
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:18,829
not very good yet if it obeys some of

1657
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:22,550
the basic criteria for lighting produces

1658
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:26,000
relatively nice results right so that

1659
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:28,279
seems pretty good so far now there is

1660
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,869
some weirdness there doesn't make a lot

1661
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:34,579
of sense to me I asked to think about

1662
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:39,890
that so that is wrong we're going to

1663
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:44,750
think about why that's happening like

1664
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:48,610
those trees should be basically black I

1665
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:48,609
think because they should be pointing

1666
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:54,859
more away from the light than they are

1667
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:57,139
and I guess maybe the thing is the light

1668
01:20:54,859 --> 01:20:59,149
kind of now up high enough over them but

1669
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:01,970
it's not so I could maybe convince

1670
01:20:59,149 --> 01:21:03,259
myself that that was correct and I guess

1671
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:08,300
when you look at it like that you can

1672
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:10,880
see why and I don't know if that means

1673
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,500
we want to bias the lighting calculation

1674
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,850
using the Z bias in a different way as

1675
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,180
well to maybe make that a little bit

1676
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:19,700
different but you can kind of see that

1677
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:21,829
that's you know giving us some of that

1678
01:21:19,699 --> 01:21:24,649
first step to reasonable lighting that

1679
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:26,449
we would want right now one of the

1680
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:28,699
things that you'll note here is that

1681
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:31,760
this is giving us lighting from only one

1682
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:33,449
light source and we want to get lighting

1683
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,630
for more light sources than one

1684
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:38,010
and we also need some other at in order

1685
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:42,239
for our lighting to be reasonably we're

1686
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:45,510
going to need a little bit more sort of

1687
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:46,619
I don't want to say realism but softness

1688
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:48,119
to the lighting so I want to talk a

1689
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:49,470
little bit about that in a second here

1690
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:51,779
now that we've now that we've sort of

1691
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:53,460
established basic lighting and I've

1692
01:21:51,779 --> 01:21:54,809
gotten that to the point where I'm

1693
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,699
relatively happy with it right like this

1694
01:21:54,810 --> 01:22:00,960
is this is all you can really expect

1695
01:21:56,699 --> 01:22:06,359
from trivial you know trivial lighting

1696
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:11,250
that doesn't do anything beyond the

1697
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:12,509
standard diffuse lighting equation so

1698
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:14,279
let's talk a little bit about just what

1699
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:17,760
we need out of our lighting going

1700
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:19,109
forwards because this is probably the

1701
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:27,239
two things that we'll try to get over

1702
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:32,819
the next week or two so that our

1703
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:35,819
lighting so the two things that we

1704
01:22:32,819 --> 01:22:38,489
really want out of here is one and you

1705
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:40,799
know what I guess I'll I'll say that we

1706
01:22:38,489 --> 01:22:42,779
could get three things even one of them

1707
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,570
I don't know if we actually want slash

1708
01:22:42,779 --> 01:22:55,050
care about but we'll talk about them

1709
01:22:45,569 --> 01:22:55,949
anyway so one is we want more lights so

1710
01:22:55,050 --> 01:23:00,960
the way that we've done the lighting

1711
01:22:55,949 --> 01:23:03,510
right now our equations are good so you

1712
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,010
know we can throw more light at it but

1713
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:07,560
we're going to have this loop over all

1714
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:09,600
the lights that there are so we probably

1715
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,070
could get away with you know doing eight

1716
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,539
lights this way or something like that

1717
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,399
and it wouldn't be a problem but if we

1718
01:23:12,539 --> 01:23:16,500
wanted to scale up to like you know a

1719
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,569
hundred lights or 200 lights

1720
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,750
it wouldn't work because looping over

1721
01:23:18,569 --> 01:23:25,649
200 lights per pixel over for depth

1722
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:27,810
appeals is not going to be happening

1723
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:32,399
right that's that ain't that's not going

1724
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:34,230
to cut it so what we want to do there is

1725
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:36,059
think about ways we might get more

1726
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:40,409
lights into our system there's a lot of

1727
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:41,640
ways you can do that but we got to kind

1728
01:23:40,409 --> 01:23:43,380
of think about how we would want to

1729
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:47,480
handle situations where we would have

1730
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:47,480
lots of lights right

1731
01:23:59,529 --> 01:24:04,509
so the second thing we really want is we

1732
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:06,579
want to have life that isn't just direct

1733
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:08,949
because all we're simulating right now

1734
01:24:06,579 --> 01:24:11,739
is a particular light source shines

1735
01:24:08,949 --> 01:24:13,989
directly on an object and we see it now

1736
01:24:11,739 --> 01:24:16,809
as you can see from the results of that

1737
01:24:13,989 --> 01:24:19,300
it looks pretty convincing for something

1738
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:21,580
like you know a flashlight because

1739
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:24,340
something that's a very bright light

1740
01:24:21,579 --> 01:24:27,369
source in a very dark area that doesn't

1741
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:29,529
have questions to that what I really

1742
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:32,979
mean to say is a very dim light source

1743
01:24:29,529 --> 01:24:34,869
in a very dark area doesn't bounce a lot

1744
01:24:32,979 --> 01:24:36,459
of secondary light around so it kind of

1745
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:39,819
looks reasonable when you look at

1746
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:41,890
something like a flashlight effect this

1747
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:43,539
is more reasonable so you can see what

1748
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:45,789
our lighting looks like is exactly what

1749
01:24:43,539 --> 01:24:47,710
our lighting is zero bounce lighting so

1750
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:49,479
it's kind of the equivalent of shining a

1751
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:51,220
flashlight which is a very dim light

1752
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:55,809
right compared to the Sun or something

1753
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:59,770
very dim in a dark room and so you just

1754
01:24:55,810 --> 01:25:02,610
see these very harsh lighting effects

1755
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:06,460
and that's good for that particular

1756
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:08,649
situation but if you want a softer look

1757
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:11,109
more like a fun light where there's a

1758
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:13,089
lot of bounce light around so even

1759
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:15,069
things that are incomplete shadows still

1760
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:16,869
have a lot of illumination to them from

1761
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:21,579
the surroundings things that's what the

1762
01:25:16,869 --> 01:25:24,369
surrounding we're not getting that so

1763
01:25:21,579 --> 01:25:26,890
that was what we want out of number two

1764
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:29,619
is some way to get some ambient lighting

1765
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:31,119
in there right some lighting that's just

1766
01:25:29,619 --> 01:25:32,920
about light that bounces around the

1767
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:34,479
environment and lights things up instead

1768
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:37,659
of having to come directly from a light

1769
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:47,909
source that were computing and number

1770
01:25:37,659 --> 01:25:51,309
three would be surface variability okay

1771
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:55,769
so service variability is just a way of

1772
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:58,510
saying we would like some way to know

1773
01:25:55,770 --> 01:26:01,300
what a particular surfaces reflectance

1774
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:03,220
properties actually are and then we'd

1775
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:10,000
like to treat the light that bounces off

1776
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:11,840
that surface differently right now

1777
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,760
we haven't talked very much about

1778
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,679
reflective functions but we mentioned a

1779
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,630
little bit of it right a very diffuse

1780
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,609
reflector is one that takes light from

1781
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:22,400
any angle and scatters it to any angle

1782
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:24,488
it's like a chalky wall paint or

1783
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:27,859
something where there isn't a lot of

1784
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:30,589
reflection in it directly you don't see

1785
01:26:27,859 --> 01:26:33,559
whole shapes or images reflected in it

1786
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:34,909
not much gloss you just see light that

1787
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,070
is the general amount of light that's

1788
01:26:34,908 --> 01:26:40,519
hitting it is what you see very diffuse

1789
01:26:37,069 --> 01:26:41,719
very chalky all the way to the other end

1790
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,090
of the spectrum is like a mirror

1791
01:26:41,719 --> 01:26:47,090
something that literally scatters light

1792
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:48,230
only out the direction it comes in so

1793
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:49,760
like it comes in and it goes out the

1794
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:52,279
exact opposite bounce like a ball

1795
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,230
bouncing off the surface right and it

1796
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:56,619
doesn't scatter hardly at all so when

1797
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:59,419
you look at a mirror you don't see any

1798
01:26:56,619 --> 01:27:01,069
indication of how much light in general

1799
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:03,679
is falling on that part of the surface

1800
01:27:01,069 --> 01:27:05,769
instead you only see the light that was

1801
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,300
incoming from a very specific direction

1802
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:11,480
and that's what makes it a mirror right

1803
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:13,190
and so you know getting some surface

1804
01:27:11,479 --> 01:27:14,479
variability in there is what allows you

1805
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:16,158
to communicate to the player that

1806
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:17,899
surfaces are different types of

1807
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:20,988
materials so for example if you wants me

1808
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:23,029
to look wet or like water that's a very

1809
01:27:20,988 --> 01:27:25,279
highly reflective surface you want

1810
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:27,170
something to look choppy like a wall or

1811
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:30,259
a piece of stone that's not very

1812
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:31,908
reflective that is more toward to

1813
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:34,340
diffuse side so being able to vary

1814
01:27:31,908 --> 01:27:35,869
surfaces a little bit can add a lot of

1815
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:37,520
visual interest to the game I don't know

1816
01:27:35,869 --> 01:27:38,929
that we want that too much in Hammond

1817
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:42,889
here or need it too much in a material

1818
01:27:38,929 --> 01:27:45,109
but it's just worth noting and so we'll

1819
01:27:42,889 --> 01:27:47,000
talk about trying to upgrade to do some

1820
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:48,920
of those things next week but for the

1821
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,238
time being we could actually augment

1822
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,520
what we're doing right now to take a

1823
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:58,928
little bit that into account let's take

1824
01:27:52,520 --> 01:28:02,210
a look for example in our shader right

1825
01:27:58,929 --> 01:28:04,489
let's say that in our shader we wanted

1826
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:06,819
to start taking into account the viewing

1827
01:28:04,488 --> 01:28:09,408
direction right so where the viewer was

1828
01:28:06,819 --> 01:28:11,920
well we should know where the viewer was

1829
01:28:09,408 --> 01:28:15,289
generally speaking because our transform

1830
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:18,800
tells us where the viewer is right our

1831
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:21,639
transfer my believe I think should tell

1832
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,639
us where the viewer is

1833
01:28:22,729 --> 01:28:28,579
I mean it might be something we would

1834
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:30,079
kind of have to reconstruct so it might

1835
01:28:28,579 --> 01:28:33,739
be better to just pass it down because

1836
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:35,239
well here you can see I mean we already

1837
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:39,109
know what the answer is here so I'll

1838
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:43,460
just show it to you but so then we do

1839
01:28:39,109 --> 01:28:45,259
set camera transform right here is like

1840
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:48,380
our equations for the camera so we say

1841
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:51,800
oh here's the do rotation X rotation we

1842
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:55,060
take you know how we're viewing the

1843
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:57,560
world we take the camera translation and

1844
01:28:55,060 --> 01:29:00,470
we produce like this as I guess the

1845
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:04,820
debug right version of that and in order

1846
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:06,590
to produce the cameras final position we

1847
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:08,529
just say rotate it by whatever that

1848
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:12,260
rotation is and place it out there right

1849
01:29:08,529 --> 01:29:18,710
but then I think I'm not very much

1850
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:20,900
mistaken when we do such camera

1851
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:26,270
transform and you take in that camera

1852
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:27,589
position I think don't we do yet so when

1853
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:34,310
we actually specify the projection

1854
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:37,930
matrix right we have to multiply the we

1855
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:37,930
have to multiply the camera position

1856
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:49,699
happening we have to multiply the camera

1857
01:29:43,909 --> 01:29:51,949
position by the rotation itself right to

1858
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:55,729
sort of produce what will be the correct

1859
01:29:51,949 --> 01:29:59,359
effect after things are rotated and so

1860
01:29:55,729 --> 01:30:01,759
if we wanted to recover that out we

1861
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:05,329
would have to invert the transform to

1862
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:08,780
get it back so what we really need in

1863
01:30:05,329 --> 01:30:11,300
this case is for our camera to still

1864
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:13,130
preserve that piece of information so

1865
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:16,550
when we do render setup and we pass down

1866
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:18,949
that camera P I think what we want to do

1867
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:23,420
is just provide that to the vertex

1868
01:30:18,949 --> 01:30:26,000
shader or the row any shader really that

1869
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:29,630
wants it we would want to still set that

1870
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,640
up right no and it looks like we do

1871
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:34,430
right so there's that camera key so

1872
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:36,170
we're getting that camera P directly and

1873
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:40,010
that is really all we will need

1874
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:41,989
so in here we don't use it in the

1875
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:44,119
fragment shader yet we only use it I

1876
01:30:41,989 --> 01:30:46,519
guess in the vertex shader right here

1877
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:47,899
but if we want to use it we can also

1878
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,960
access it so it's already being

1879
01:30:47,899 --> 01:30:53,269
specified we can access it in here as

1880
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:56,359
well so we can just get the canopy and

1881
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:59,060
the light P that means producing this

1882
01:30:56,359 --> 01:31:02,479
vector that we want which is to camera

1883
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:07,170
is just as simple as what we were doing

1884
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:08,859
before right there's the camera distance

1885
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:11,239
[Applause]

1886
01:31:08,859 --> 01:31:18,439
which is what we want there and we can

1887
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:23,239
normalize that one as well and then we

1888
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:28,129
can have the Coast cam angle is dot two

1889
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:30,260
camera little N and now we know the

1890
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:38,840
angle to the camera as well as the angle

1891
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:42,409
to the as well as the angle to the light

1892
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:50,810
source now what we may want to do here

1893
01:31:42,409 --> 01:31:52,340
is then create sort of we can do a bunch

1894
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:53,990
of different things here right one of

1895
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:56,569
the things we can do here is we can now

1896
01:31:53,989 --> 01:31:58,309
start to make our reflectance be based

1897
01:31:56,569 --> 01:31:59,689
on the angle so if we wanted to create a

1898
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:02,570
mirror surface what we basically be

1899
01:31:59,689 --> 01:32:06,049
saying is we want the angle to the

1900
01:32:02,569 --> 01:32:07,609
camera and the angle to the light source

1901
01:32:06,050 --> 01:32:09,949
to be at 90 degrees to each other right

1902
01:32:07,609 --> 01:32:13,519
so what I could actually do here is say

1903
01:32:09,949 --> 01:32:17,210
something like okay this is like the

1904
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:19,880
cosine of the camera and the light right

1905
01:32:17,210 --> 01:32:24,350
so I could say take the camera take the

1906
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:29,659
light do the dot product there let's

1907
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:32,420
clamp that and now we could say well in

1908
01:32:29,659 --> 01:32:35,960
addition to modulating this with the

1909
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:37,970
incidence of the light we could say that

1910
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:40,250
well now what we're going to do actually

1911
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:43,280
is pretend this as a mirror we could use

1912
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:45,710
this entirely instead right so we said

1913
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:48,079
say we could say whatever is that angle

1914
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:50,809
is between these two that's what it's

1915
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:52,488
going to be now

1916
01:32:50,809 --> 01:32:53,569
you know let me do this completely

1917
01:32:52,488 --> 01:32:55,218
different way so that's not going to

1918
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:56,839
give us quite this is going to make it a

1919
01:32:55,219 --> 01:33:01,279
little bit too hard for us to do it so

1920
01:32:56,838 --> 01:33:02,748
let me do it slightly differently let's

1921
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:04,938
see I just want to do the reflection

1922
01:33:02,748 --> 01:33:09,738
right so what I want to do is I want to

1923
01:33:04,939 --> 01:33:13,088
say well we've got our diffuse light and

1924
01:33:09,738 --> 01:33:16,368
that's here so let's put the name these

1925
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:19,338
cues like so this is the light strength

1926
01:33:16,368 --> 01:33:21,408
this is this is the diffuse mount right

1927
01:33:19,338 --> 01:33:23,318
times this cosine angle so you could

1928
01:33:21,408 --> 01:33:27,648
think of this as saying a diffuse

1929
01:33:23,319 --> 01:33:29,119
coefficient right so let's say the

1930
01:33:27,649 --> 01:33:32,749
diffuse coefficient right now is one

1931
01:33:29,118 --> 01:33:35,719
point now and so that's any of us the

1932
01:33:32,748 --> 01:33:36,918
lighting that we already have then what

1933
01:33:35,719 --> 01:33:38,689
we want to do is we want to produce

1934
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:40,760
another thing here which is going to be

1935
01:33:38,689 --> 01:33:42,679
our specular coefficient right it's

1936
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:45,588
going to be the reflect that light that

1937
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:47,868
comes out in a mirror style again this

1938
01:33:45,588 --> 01:33:49,248
is a really basic way to do lighting but

1939
01:33:47,868 --> 01:33:51,889
let's say we have a specular light

1940
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:53,628
amount here so we do specular C times

1941
01:33:51,889 --> 01:33:56,239
you know whatever this thing is

1942
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:58,158
something times the light strength and

1943
01:33:56,238 --> 01:34:15,078
what I probably want to do is like make

1944
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:16,549
a term here for this and these may be

1945
01:34:15,078 --> 01:34:19,068
different things right we may want

1946
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:21,019
different colors for these for example

1947
01:34:19,069 --> 01:34:23,599
in the future and so on as well but for

1948
01:34:21,019 --> 01:34:24,769
right now we want something there and we

1949
01:34:23,599 --> 01:34:27,229
want that to multiply the light strength

1950
01:34:24,769 --> 01:34:28,849
as well and then what we'll do is we'll

1951
01:34:27,229 --> 01:34:30,769
sum up our life so the amount of light

1952
01:34:28,849 --> 01:34:33,469
we get here plus the amount of light we

1953
01:34:30,769 --> 01:34:34,699
get here and really if you think about

1954
01:34:33,469 --> 01:34:36,408
it these should not

1955
01:34:34,698 --> 01:34:38,598
these should always have to sum to one

1956
01:34:36,408 --> 01:34:40,429
if this is a realistic surface so we

1957
01:34:38,599 --> 01:34:43,578
could say that this is a half diffuse

1958
01:34:40,429 --> 01:34:45,378
half specular surface right because we

1959
01:34:43,578 --> 01:34:47,599
can't reflect out more light than we

1960
01:34:45,378 --> 01:34:49,760
took in so whatever the light strength

1961
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:53,208
is coming in we should expect to have

1962
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:57,079
that same amount at maximum bounce back

1963
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:58,099
right and we can come up with you know

1964
01:34:57,078 --> 01:34:59,868
basically coming up with real

1965
01:34:58,099 --> 01:35:01,510
reflectance functions is about tuning

1966
01:34:59,868 --> 01:35:03,699
these things to be more

1967
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:05,619
realistic curves and so on but well

1968
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:07,929
again move on from that we're going to

1969
01:35:05,619 --> 01:35:09,970
do a basic little reflection here so

1970
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:12,400
what I need to do do here is like a

1971
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:16,630
cosine reflected angle function and so

1972
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:19,839
what I want to do is say okay we've got

1973
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:21,489
the camera we've got our our diffuse

1974
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,079
light amount so then what I want to do

1975
01:35:21,489 --> 01:35:25,059
is I want to take another thing here

1976
01:35:23,079 --> 01:35:26,800
which is going to be like the the coast

1977
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:31,780
reflected angle which is going to be the

1978
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:34,480
dot product of the light with the

1979
01:35:31,779 --> 01:35:36,670
reflection which is the you know reflect

1980
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:38,289
vector reflection vector we'll talk

1981
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:39,940
about what that is in a second so what I

1982
01:35:38,289 --> 01:35:42,010
need here is some kind of reflection

1983
01:35:39,939 --> 01:35:47,469
vector this is going to give me that

1984
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:49,239
that thing that I I want and I'm going

1985
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:51,430
to clamp it again just like I did that

1986
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:54,219
will give me the amount of specular

1987
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:55,659
light contribution okay so what's a

1988
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:57,280
reflection vector well a reflection

1989
01:35:55,659 --> 01:36:07,449
vector what I want to do what I'm trying

1990
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:09,340
to set up here is I've got I've got my

1991
01:36:07,449 --> 01:36:12,880
two light vector right it goes out this

1992
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:15,130
way I've got my viewing direction right

1993
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,000
and what I want to do and I guess what I

1994
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:17,920
should say is you know the viewing

1995
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,590
direction looks like that right what I

1996
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:23,980
want to do is come up with if this was

1997
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:25,930
coming in at this angle and and maybe

1998
01:36:23,979 --> 01:36:27,609
you notice that I can emphasize the

1999
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:30,220
difference between the two maybe let's

2000
01:36:27,609 --> 01:36:32,529
say instead let's say this is the way

2001
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:36,550
I'm viewing it what I want to do is

2002
01:36:32,529 --> 01:36:39,939
reflect that vector out like so so I

2003
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:41,829
would get where where am I looking if

2004
01:36:39,939 --> 01:36:43,419
this were a perfect mirror what should

2005
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:45,970
it reflect if it was a perfect mirror

2006
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:48,010
and then I can dot these two together to

2007
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:50,260
see how close I am to my mirror

2008
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:51,820
reflection then that will give me how

2009
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:53,920
much of that mirror contribution I

2010
01:36:51,819 --> 01:36:58,509
should get right the specular light

2011
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:59,940
amount okay so if I wanted to do that

2012
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:02,170
how do I produce the reflection vector

2013
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:05,049
well I know I've got this vector which

2014
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:06,940
is the vector to the camera so let's say

2015
01:37:05,050 --> 01:37:08,470
I negated that vector to the camera I

2016
01:37:06,939 --> 01:37:10,629
would get the vector I wanted

2017
01:37:08,470 --> 01:37:13,150
essentially but it would be pointing

2018
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:13,900
down the ball it would be pointing you

2019
01:37:13,149 --> 01:37:15,250
know essentially the

2020
01:37:13,899 --> 01:37:17,439
wrong direction it's pointing downward

2021
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:20,590
and I want to be pointing upward right

2022
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:22,059
so how do I reflect that about this line

2023
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:24,130
well it just so happens that because I

2024
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:26,710
have the surface normal I'm in a really

2025
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:29,140
good position to compute exactly how to

2026
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:33,130
do that because the dot product of the

2027
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:36,699
normal with that vector right so n dot C

2028
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:38,020
is going to give me exactly the amount

2029
01:37:36,698 --> 01:37:40,089
that I wanted now if this looks familiar

2030
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:42,880
to you it should we did this for physics

2031
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:45,060
for bouncing right we computed this

2032
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:49,719
reflection for bouncing our particles

2033
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:52,000
and I don't remember if we'd also I

2034
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:55,000
think we may have done it for bouncing

2035
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,840
when we are moving objects around so I

2036
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,479
know that my and my n transpose C here

2037
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:04,150
will give me how far along the normal I

2038
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:06,698
am right and that's going to be a

2039
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:08,379
negative value because I'm under you

2040
01:38:06,698 --> 01:38:11,198
know I'm basically under the normal if

2041
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:14,770
you will so if I want to then move

2042
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:17,738
myself back up to where I would be what

2043
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:21,280
I can do is just subtract two of that

2044
01:38:17,738 --> 01:38:24,069
right to move myself up to pointing back

2045
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:26,920
as a reflected amount the first end

2046
01:38:24,069 --> 01:38:28,929
transpose C moves me to the horizon to

2047
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:31,179
the equivalent line so that gets rid of

2048
01:38:28,929 --> 01:38:33,279
any vertical displacement and the next

2049
01:38:31,179 --> 01:38:34,960
one gives me back that same vertical

2050
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:40,000
displacement in the opposite direction

2051
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:41,948
right now remember in transpose C is

2052
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,359
only if this were the C vector but I

2053
01:38:41,948 --> 01:38:43,960
actually computed the C vector going

2054
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,630
this way

2055
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:48,429
so it's really n transpose negative C

2056
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:50,319
which is negative n transpose C which

2057
01:38:48,429 --> 01:38:54,969
means this negative cancels out which

2058
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:57,779
means it's actually two ncc right if

2059
01:38:54,969 --> 01:38:57,779
that makes sense

2060
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:12,000
which is a little bit weird to say the

2061
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:17,659
least but anyway so let's work that out

2062
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,659
exactly so we can actually do it okay

2063
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:30,880
so here's our camera that's to camera

2064
01:39:26,739 --> 01:39:35,829
and it supposedly unit length right here

2065
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:37,359
is our normal normal vector and what we

2066
01:39:35,829 --> 01:39:41,710
want to do here is pretend we have

2067
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:45,880
negative C there's our negative C we

2068
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:49,359
want to know where on the N vector we

2069
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:53,079
are right so in order to do that we do n

2070
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:54,189
transpose negative C and the negative to

2071
01:39:53,079 --> 01:39:56,559
distribute there because it's a linear

2072
01:39:54,189 --> 01:40:00,869
operator so that should be negative n

2073
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:07,990
transpose C right so that's negative and

2074
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:10,390
transpose C which is negative n

2075
01:40:07,989 --> 01:40:15,760
transpose C is that that distance right

2076
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:20,110
there right so now if we take negative C

2077
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:25,119
and we now want to bring negative C up

2078
01:40:20,109 --> 01:40:26,529
to here right and then up to where it

2079
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:28,809
should be in order to produce the

2080
01:40:26,529 --> 01:40:38,559
reflected vector I need to add this

2081
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:42,880
twice right so I need to add to it well

2082
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:45,789
I need to add this to it twice and this

2083
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:48,039
is going in the wrong direction right so

2084
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:52,840
I really need to subtract it if that

2085
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:56,100
makes sense in order to in order to get

2086
01:40:52,840 --> 01:41:03,360
going the right direction so I need to

2087
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:09,340
subtract 2 times negative n transpose C

2088
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:11,289
like so in order to get my new you know

2089
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:14,199
reflected vector right so I start with

2090
01:41:11,289 --> 01:41:15,460
negative C I subtract 2 times that and I

2091
01:41:14,199 --> 01:41:17,590
need a direction because remember this

2092
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:21,039
is vector math so I can't take a vector

2093
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:22,510
and and this is a scalar right so what

2094
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:26,680
direction am I going along well I'm

2095
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:30,070
going along n right so this is this far

2096
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:33,340
along can so again start at negative C

2097
01:41:30,069 --> 01:41:36,979
figure out how far along in I am under

2098
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:40,159
the surface and then I just

2099
01:41:36,979 --> 01:41:42,109
subtract twice that along end to put me

2100
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:44,420
back over the surface and there's my

2101
01:41:42,109 --> 01:41:45,948
reflection back there and there's a lot

2102
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:47,750
of negatives in there so really I could

2103
01:41:45,948 --> 01:41:49,609
just say this is negative see this

2104
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:57,829
negative comes out so it's really just

2105
01:41:49,609 --> 01:42:02,149
plus two n transpose C N and that's all

2106
01:41:57,829 --> 01:42:04,309
there is to it I think so in theory we

2107
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:06,979
should be able to compute this the

2108
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:11,000
reflection vector here so we've got

2109
01:42:06,979 --> 01:42:21,079
negative C and that is our Q camera

2110
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:25,488
function we have plus two times the dot

2111
01:42:21,079 --> 01:42:32,960
product of the world normal and the

2112
01:42:25,488 --> 01:42:35,419
camera like so and that's times to the

2113
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:39,159
normal that should give us the

2114
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:41,149
reflection vector that reflection vector

2115
01:42:39,159 --> 01:42:43,399
gives us what we want to dot product

2116
01:42:41,149 --> 01:42:46,539
with in order to determine how much

2117
01:42:43,399 --> 01:42:50,149
we're looking directly at the light and

2118
01:42:46,539 --> 01:42:52,279
yet in theory that's the correct letting

2119
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:53,960
computation for a more specular surface

2120
01:42:52,279 --> 01:42:56,929
now it's hard to tell whether we did

2121
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:58,789
that correctly obviously but what we

2122
01:42:56,929 --> 01:43:01,159
should see now and that course I and I

2123
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:02,810
am seeing it is we should be able to see

2124
01:43:01,159 --> 01:43:05,659
I don't know if you can see this but as

2125
01:43:02,810 --> 01:43:09,050
I sort of look down I get the light

2126
01:43:05,659 --> 01:43:11,210
source there's a highlight on the light

2127
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:15,469
source right which kind of comes at me

2128
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:21,890
right you can see that right it didn't

2129
01:43:15,469 --> 01:43:24,560
use to and what we can see that's a

2130
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:27,410
little bit weird here right is this is

2131
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:29,960
feel a very glossy diffuse reflection

2132
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:32,809
the reason for that is that the

2133
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:34,189
reflected angle that we compute remember

2134
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:36,739
we're going to be adding some of that

2135
01:43:34,189 --> 01:43:38,569
specular contribution based on a very

2136
01:43:36,738 --> 01:43:40,639
wide angle because when we're right on

2137
01:43:38,569 --> 01:43:42,829
the cosine will be one but even as we

2138
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:45,050
spread out and start to look at wider

2139
01:43:42,829 --> 01:43:47,420
angles the cosine fall-off is not

2140
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:48,829
particularly sharp right it still falls

2141
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:51,020
off cosine angle so we're going to

2142
01:43:48,829 --> 01:43:53,359
collect a lot there so if we want a

2143
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:56,719
tighter more mirror-like surface we can

2144
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:58,880
choose to start up making that curve be

2145
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:01,219
more than cosine fall-off so for example

2146
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:04,190
once we produce cosine reflected angle

2147
01:44:01,219 --> 01:44:05,390
we could choose to square that and we

2148
01:44:04,189 --> 01:44:07,849
could choose the square that a couple

2149
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:10,760
times as we wanted to really crank down

2150
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:13,100
the sort of the tension of that

2151
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:16,850
highlight and what you can see if we do

2152
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:19,520
that is once we make that happen you can

2153
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:26,510
see our specular highlight gets much

2154
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:28,370
tighter right and what you can see too

2155
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:30,280
is that you know this again gets into

2156
01:44:28,369 --> 01:44:32,719
the non-physical aspect of our lighting

2157
01:44:30,279 --> 01:44:34,819
this is a conservative way of making

2158
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:37,219
sure the two things don't sum together

2159
01:44:34,819 --> 01:44:38,689
but what we could do what we end up

2160
01:44:37,219 --> 01:44:41,270
doing there is killing a lot more light

2161
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:42,829
than we should so what we really want to

2162
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:44,390
do there is actually figure out how to

2163
01:44:42,829 --> 01:44:46,340
make that a more fair distribution at

2164
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:48,350
the moment what we could say is let's

2165
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:51,920
make this particular very bright and

2166
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:53,900
very tight just totally fake right not

2167
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:58,640
correct lighting but it just accentuates

2168
01:44:53,899 --> 01:45:01,009
it so you can see it right so here's a

2169
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:03,199
pretty hoops here's a pretty high

2170
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:05,840
specular power right and now you can see

2171
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:07,609
that we've got that that shine on the

2172
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,800
light there and so you can see as it

2173
01:45:07,609 --> 01:45:11,389
goes right we're getting that sort of as

2174
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,850
I'm moving the hair around you see that

2175
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:15,260
very clear specular highlight moving

2176
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:16,730
with them and as the viewing Langille

2177
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:19,730
angle change as soon as that specular

2178
01:45:16,729 --> 01:45:25,009
highlight again power wise you can crank

2179
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:29,479
it as high as you want oh yeah I'm just

2180
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:31,880
squaring squaring squaring right so

2181
01:45:29,479 --> 01:45:34,609
there's a very tight specular highlight

2182
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:35,989
you can see again we're not putting any

2183
01:45:34,609 --> 01:45:40,039
shadows so you still get a specular

2184
01:45:35,988 --> 01:45:42,349
highlight down there right and so on and

2185
01:45:40,039 --> 01:45:44,659
that's just again just a really simple

2186
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:47,329
very very simple this is basically like

2187
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:49,698
kind of crappy Phong shading now right

2188
01:45:47,329 --> 01:45:50,809
do you ever heard of that which is

2189
01:45:49,698 --> 01:45:52,569
basically just saying we have one

2190
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:54,890
specular term we have one diffuse term

2191
01:45:52,569 --> 01:45:56,750
the specular term is raised to some

2192
01:45:54,890 --> 01:46:00,440
power and you know tweak as you wish

2193
01:45:56,750 --> 01:46:02,739
right but you can already see how that

2194
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:04,539
kind of gives you more of a sense the

2195
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:06,550
the surface has some shadowing is to it

2196
01:46:04,539 --> 01:46:08,859
and if we were to kill the disputes

2197
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:10,659
light more so let's say we were to take

2198
01:46:08,859 --> 01:46:12,849
this diffuse light down to a very low

2199
01:46:10,659 --> 01:46:14,949
level you can start to see how it starts

2200
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:17,380
to sort of look more mirror-like now

2201
01:46:14,949 --> 01:46:19,689
again the only thing we're reflecting is

2202
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:21,369
the light though so that's why it

2203
01:46:19,689 --> 01:46:22,899
doesn't look like a real mirror because

2204
01:46:21,369 --> 01:46:24,729
we're not reflecting all of this other

2205
01:46:22,899 --> 01:46:26,409
light that's bouncing upstairs again

2206
01:46:24,729 --> 01:46:29,109
that's the thing with direct light we're

2207
01:46:26,409 --> 01:46:31,000
only reflecting literally the light so

2208
01:46:29,109 --> 01:46:34,689
now we've got a three mirror like

2209
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:37,390
surface here in terms of how the light

2210
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:39,069
behaves and again the further you crank

2211
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:40,690
that power the more you will see that

2212
01:46:39,069 --> 01:46:43,299
happen right so if I just continue to

2213
01:46:40,689 --> 01:46:45,549
crank that power more and more that

2214
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:47,770
highlight would get tighten and tighten

2215
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:49,630
and tighten into what's more like a

2216
01:46:47,770 --> 01:46:52,360
direct reflection of the light source

2217
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:53,949
you can see there right um

2218
01:46:52,359 --> 01:46:55,839
alright so I think that's a good place

2219
01:46:53,949 --> 01:46:59,260
to end for today now that we've got the

2220
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:03,659
basics of like a Phong a you know kind

2221
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:03,659
of crappy Phong lighting in there

2222
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:15,250
that's it that's that's all I'm gonna do

2223
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:17,789
today so so next week we'll look a

2224
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:17,789
little bit more

2225
01:47:47,269 --> 01:47:51,829
the problem you could not find when you

2226
01:47:49,309 --> 01:47:53,809
thought about dividing by cosine Phi is

2227
01:47:51,828 --> 01:47:55,759
that the only reason diffused surfaces

2228
01:47:53,809 --> 01:47:57,288
can exist this best use just was trying

2229
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:01,340
to answer the questions I posed on the

2230
01:47:57,288 --> 01:48:03,018
stream can exist the surface roughness

2231
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:04,489
which invalidates the assumption that

2232
01:48:03,019 --> 01:48:06,679
you will collect photons from the entire

2233
01:48:04,488 --> 01:48:09,078
surface roughness blocks some photons

2234
01:48:06,679 --> 01:48:11,328
one trick is to check your model a

2235
01:48:09,078 --> 01:48:13,549
photon must have the same probability of

2236
01:48:11,328 --> 01:48:15,078
going one way as the opposite way all

2237
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:17,239
formulas were diffused light our

2238
01:48:15,078 --> 01:48:19,158
approximations and all diffuse surfaces

2239
01:48:17,238 --> 01:48:20,538
are different in order to render a

2240
01:48:19,158 --> 01:48:21,828
physically correct diffuse surface you'd

2241
01:48:20,538 --> 01:48:23,179
have to measure a four-dimensional data

2242
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:25,009
set of light distribution reflectance

2243
01:48:23,179 --> 01:48:27,380
depending on two angles of incidence ya

2244
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:30,409
which would be like the whole brdf for

2245
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:32,059
that surface or something I'm not sure

2246
01:48:30,408 --> 01:48:37,819
that still just answers my question in

2247
01:48:32,059 --> 01:48:39,889
terms of like I mean I still would like

2248
01:48:37,819 --> 01:48:42,198
to see it written out a little more

2249
01:48:39,889 --> 01:48:45,109
clearly as to how the light is bouncing

2250
01:48:42,198 --> 01:48:49,908
around just just to see a diagram you

2251
01:48:45,109 --> 01:48:52,908
know you're a sniper GLSL has a reflect

2252
01:48:49,908 --> 01:48:54,768
function yeah I don't tend to use the

2253
01:48:52,908 --> 01:48:56,839
GLSL reflect function though I always

2254
01:48:54,769 --> 01:48:58,610
write their flex lecture myself and the

2255
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,949
reason for that is just because I may

2256
01:48:58,609 --> 01:49:03,198
want to modify things in it I find if

2257
01:49:00,948 --> 01:49:04,969
that's a little bit too much kind of

2258
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:06,229
like how you know sometimes I use the

2259
01:49:04,969 --> 01:49:07,760
normalize function there but most the

2260
01:49:06,229 --> 01:49:09,169
time I write to normalize myself as well

2261
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:12,650
because I need to do something in

2262
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:14,420
between mts mocks should you normalize

2263
01:49:12,649 --> 01:49:16,848
the world end in the fragment shader I

2264
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:19,489
don't believe so as I discussed on the

2265
01:49:16,849 --> 01:49:21,920
stream earlier because all our services

2266
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:24,049
are flat there shouldn't be any

2267
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:26,599
situation where our world normals are

2268
01:49:24,050 --> 01:49:28,909
not normal because they're not actually

2269
01:49:26,599 --> 01:49:31,119
be interpolate 'add because that makes

2270
01:49:28,908 --> 01:49:31,118
sense

2271
01:49:35,668 --> 01:49:47,269
be a 6ix says ever done website dev work

2272
01:49:40,168 --> 01:49:47,269
well I did the our website Mali rocket

2273
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:52,159
if that's what you mean

2274
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:54,639
uplink coder can you take a quick shot

2275
01:50:51,579 --> 01:50:58,180
at reducing the banding no we can't

2276
01:50:54,640 --> 01:51:02,230
really do that quickly that is something

2277
01:50:58,180 --> 01:51:05,850
that is just about introducing differing

2278
01:51:02,229 --> 01:51:08,469
because there is no actual banding in

2279
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:09,910
color space there are actually colors

2280
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:11,320
that are exactly next to each other so

2281
01:51:09,909 --> 01:51:13,359
the fact that you can see banding is

2282
01:51:11,319 --> 01:51:17,889
just because the monitored resolution is

2283
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:19,539
only a bit color right so to get rid of

2284
01:51:17,890 --> 01:51:24,550
the banding what we have to do there is

2285
01:51:19,539 --> 01:51:27,699
we have to introduce a dither step which

2286
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:34,239
is not going to be quick I don't think

2287
01:51:27,699 --> 01:51:37,899
we have to just at the end when it goes

2288
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:51,729
to convert 16-bit color which we are now

2289
01:51:37,899 --> 01:51:54,489
storing to 8-bit color ill dither uplink

2290
01:51:51,729 --> 01:51:59,019
coder also I opened an issue where the

2291
01:51:54,489 --> 01:52:07,349
game crashes when you go backwards after

2292
01:51:59,020 --> 01:52:07,350
starting the game backwards

2293
01:52:14,139 --> 01:52:28,699
did you did you put that in here and a

2294
01:52:23,198 --> 01:52:33,019
are you talking about this one yeah that

2295
01:52:28,698 --> 01:52:34,698
I mean we can that's like in the game

2296
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:36,949
entity code which we have not really

2297
01:52:34,698 --> 01:52:44,509
done anything with so there's that stuff

2298
01:52:36,948 --> 01:52:48,908
is all totally placeholder right that

2299
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:50,929
reminds me this needs to get finished I

2300
01:52:48,908 --> 01:52:53,029
should just do this one this was a

2301
01:52:50,929 --> 01:52:57,319
someone wanted to change for their

2302
01:52:53,029 --> 01:52:59,118
compiling individual studio 2017 and I

2303
01:52:57,319 --> 01:53:00,738
tried to fix it for him but I messed up

2304
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:04,009
this thing they were asking for they

2305
01:53:00,738 --> 01:53:18,828
were asking for getting rid of make it

2306
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:26,090
resource I think in both places so I

2307
01:53:18,828 --> 01:53:42,439
believe that's what they wanted so we've

2308
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:43,550
removed make it resource in both so that

2309
01:53:42,439 --> 01:53:47,019
was just saying they wanted for

2310
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:47,020
compiling individuals through 2017

2311
01:53:56,899 --> 01:54:03,359
let's see

2312
01:54:00,019 --> 01:54:06,569
tt b JM would ACR turn mapping be worth

2313
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:11,280
implementing i yeah it's usually worth

2314
01:54:06,569 --> 01:54:13,349
implementing I don't know that we might

2315
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,748
be getting a little far from the scope

2316
01:54:13,349 --> 01:54:17,159
of handmade hero if we start doing HG

2317
01:54:15,748 --> 01:54:20,728
our enduring though so I don't know that

2318
01:54:17,158 --> 01:54:24,348
I really want to go down that route but

2319
01:54:20,729 --> 01:54:24,349
usually yet is worth worth it

2320
01:54:32,658 --> 01:54:35,948
so that's the kid is but mapping a

2321
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:39,920
future you're looking into implementing

2322
01:54:35,948 --> 01:54:43,638
so bump mapping is really an art problem

2323
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:48,710
not an engine problem it's it's trivial

2324
01:54:43,639 --> 01:54:51,199
to implement in the engine so in here

2325
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:54,139
where you get the world normal all you

2326
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:56,479
really have to do is instead of just

2327
01:54:54,139 --> 01:55:03,020
using the world normal you load the

2328
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:05,599
normal out of a texture that's it so

2329
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:08,389
there ain't a lot to it

2330
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:13,070
so really the problem is that the

2331
01:55:08,389 --> 01:55:14,960
sprites have to have normal maps and in

2332
01:55:13,069 --> 01:55:17,179
order to have them have normal maps you

2333
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:19,010
have to have some art profits that's

2334
01:55:17,179 --> 01:55:22,850
going to produce those like either they

2335
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:28,820
have to be painted with like bump you

2336
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:34,639
know like sort of diffuse maps by your

2337
01:55:28,819 --> 01:55:36,920
artist or they have to be post processed

2338
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:40,069
with a tool like sprite lamp or

2339
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:44,449
something and I don't really know if I

2340
01:55:40,069 --> 01:55:46,880
want to go down that road either but

2341
01:55:44,448 --> 01:55:50,419
there isn't a lot to it like you don't

2342
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:58,760
have to do a lot of work to add it there

2343
01:55:50,420 --> 01:56:04,489
is a modicum of work because you you

2344
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:07,789
depending on how you want to do it you

2345
01:56:04,488 --> 01:56:10,879
may want to send down more than just the

2346
01:56:07,789 --> 01:56:14,149
worldspace normal so right now we're

2347
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:16,460
sending down world n but if you think

2348
01:56:14,149 --> 01:56:17,988
about it world n is not enough to

2349
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:20,050
specify the facing direction of a

2350
01:56:17,988 --> 01:56:25,729
surface because it doesn't specify the

2351
01:56:20,050 --> 01:56:26,810
tilt so you if you depending what kind

2352
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:28,428
of lighting effects you want to do you

2353
01:56:26,810 --> 01:56:30,350
may want to send down a full

2354
01:56:28,429 --> 01:56:32,000
three-dimensional access system or a

2355
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:33,800
quaternion that can that you then

2356
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,840
convert to one if you want to say vertex

2357
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:41,600
bandwidth um so there's a debt because

2358
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:43,520
slightly more work has to be done to

2359
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:44,050
pass down a full reference frame instead

2360
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,270
of just a world

2361
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:48,309
normal and the other thing you have to

2362
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:52,409
do is every texture now have to have

2363
01:56:48,309 --> 01:56:55,360
about Matt right or a normal map

2364
01:56:52,408 --> 01:56:57,839
preferably a normal map a higher quality

2365
01:56:55,359 --> 01:56:57,839
than both map

2366
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:37,019
jazzy 23 says sim Dion CPUs are pretty

2367
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:38,310
cool however it sounds painful to make

2368
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:40,170
use of the newest and the best

2369
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:42,539
instructions while remaining compatible

2370
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,310
with old CPUs I don't see programs being

2371
01:57:42,539 --> 01:57:45,840
compiled separately for different SSE

2372
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:46,500
capabilities I assume program will just

2373
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,329
crash

2374
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:49,680
if the cpu encounters a non support

2375
01:57:48,329 --> 01:57:51,149
instruction would you dispatch at

2376
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,710
runtime for a different code path to

2377
01:57:51,149 --> 01:57:57,210
flex we use supports any instructions of

2378
01:57:52,710 --> 01:58:00,810
some dumb yes so that's not really the

2379
01:57:57,210 --> 01:58:05,699
problem the problem is actually somewhat

2380
01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:08,539
amusing if you want to optimize your

2381
01:58:05,699 --> 01:58:15,389
game for newer instruction sets like

2382
01:58:08,539 --> 01:58:17,039
avx-512 or a VX fix to whatever rather

2383
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:20,730
than at sassy 2 or something that's

2384
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:22,470
universe supportive sp2 sp3 this isn't

2385
01:58:20,729 --> 01:58:24,029
that hard to do you just pick a few the

2386
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:26,190
few functions that you probably because

2387
01:58:24,029 --> 01:58:30,509
you got to hand optimize that anyway

2388
01:58:26,189 --> 01:58:32,129
right because you've got to go make use

2389
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:33,510
of intrinsics usually if you're going to

2390
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:35,369
get any good performance on affinity

2391
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:37,739
most of the time or use a you know an

2392
01:58:35,369 --> 01:58:39,300
automatic thing like Intel IPC or

2393
01:58:37,738 --> 01:58:40,829
something sweet you've done some work to

2394
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:44,850
isolate what it is you're actually going

2395
01:58:40,829 --> 01:58:46,800
to compile via that path and once you do

2396
01:58:44,850 --> 01:58:48,480
that it's not that hard to just have one

2397
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,909
or two versions of that function that

2398
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:52,799
you just set the pointer to it start up

2399
01:58:50,909 --> 01:58:54,750
by checking the CPU capabilities and

2400
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:57,750
then setting the function pointer right

2401
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:59,369
so it's not it's not very hard it's kind

2402
01:58:57,750 --> 01:59:00,869
of exact like we do with OpenGL where we

2403
01:58:59,369 --> 01:59:02,640
check extensions and then set the

2404
01:59:00,869 --> 01:59:05,609
extension that's about all you've got to

2405
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:08,940
do right so that part's not particularly

2406
01:59:05,609 --> 01:59:10,829
hard here's the real problem and why

2407
01:59:08,939 --> 01:59:12,988
we're not doing it on handmade here and

2408
01:59:10,829 --> 01:59:15,210
why probably no one really ever does it

2409
01:59:12,988 --> 01:59:19,229
unless I get paid by Intel or AMD to do

2410
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:21,649
it and that is because you're optimizing

2411
01:59:19,229 --> 01:59:24,750
the case you don't need to optimize

2412
01:59:21,649 --> 01:59:28,049
right because if you think about what

2413
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:30,930
happens is your worst performing cpu is

2414
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:34,680
going to be the one that doesn't have

2415
01:59:30,930 --> 01:59:39,090
that instruction set so if the game runs

2416
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:41,430
on SSE to on an older CPU at all then

2417
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:43,569
it's going to run great on an avx-512

2418
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:46,239
supporting cpu it's going to run

2419
01:59:43,569 --> 01:59:49,118
gangbusters on that so you have no need

2420
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:51,578
to optimize it with avx-512 because it's

2421
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:54,420
already way faster than your minimum

2422
01:59:51,578 --> 01:59:58,960
spec computer that doesn't have avx-512

2423
01:59:54,420 --> 02:00:01,149
so paradoxically you end up never really

2424
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:04,179
caring about something like avx-512

2425
02:00:01,149 --> 02:00:07,238
until it's actually available on lots of

2426
02:00:04,179 --> 02:00:09,069
CPUs on your minimum spec because then

2427
02:00:07,238 --> 02:00:10,809
you can use it on the minimum spec to

2428
02:00:09,069 --> 02:00:13,118
make that minimum spec perform as well

2429
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:16,750
as your high spec machine which doesn't

2430
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:18,789
really need you to do it right but when

2431
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:22,029
avx-512 or something is only available

2432
02:00:18,789 --> 02:00:23,710
on your high spec machine forget it you

2433
02:00:22,029 --> 02:00:25,599
can't use worthless you can't use it for

2434
02:00:23,710 --> 02:00:28,270
anything the only way you can possibly

2435
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:31,900
use it is if you have some isolated

2436
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:35,920
effect that can be turned off on the

2437
02:00:31,899 --> 02:00:38,888
lower end CPU right so typically what

2438
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:40,960
actually happens in practice is that you

2439
02:00:38,889 --> 02:00:44,679
don't ever need to do two versions of

2440
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:47,050
the code one for the ADAC 512 and one

2441
02:00:44,679 --> 02:00:49,868
for s3 2 typically you only do the

2442
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:51,820
avx-512 version you check the CPU bit

2443
02:00:49,868 --> 02:00:54,130
and if it doesn't support evic 512 you

2444
02:00:51,819 --> 02:00:55,299
turn that feature off so you're never

2445
02:00:54,130 --> 02:00:57,460
even going to called you're not going to

2446
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:59,560
call an SSE 2 version of it it's over

2447
02:00:57,460 --> 02:01:02,710
write that feature is not there whatever

2448
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:06,070
that feature was realistic Defamation

2449
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:09,569
physics of blobby whatever is this off

2450
02:01:06,069 --> 02:01:17,469
it's gone forget it's not there right

2451
02:01:09,569 --> 02:01:21,939
and so basically you know you you really

2452
02:01:17,469 --> 02:01:25,149
don't have the use case that I at least

2453
02:01:21,939 --> 02:01:27,098
that I can think of of I'm trying to run

2454
02:01:25,149 --> 02:01:29,229
the exact same thing on something that

2455
02:01:27,099 --> 02:01:32,739
has avx-512 and saying that doesn't and

2456
02:01:29,229 --> 02:01:34,959
I need to optimize the a the X 512 part

2457
02:01:32,738 --> 02:01:37,029
I just I can't even think of a way that

2458
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,658
would happen you always have to have

2459
02:01:37,029 --> 02:01:43,448
some additional thing you're turning on

2460
02:01:39,658 --> 02:01:45,698
and and I mean maybe if it's just going

2461
02:01:43,448 --> 02:01:47,408
to pure quantity like how many particles

2462
02:01:45,698 --> 02:01:49,539
am i doing with this thing then maybe

2463
02:01:47,408 --> 02:01:51,460
that's why you optimized 512 because

2464
02:01:49,539 --> 02:01:55,238
then the higher machine can have 10

2465
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:57,010
times as many particles or something but

2466
02:01:55,238 --> 02:01:57,559
but you know you can see why I'm sort of

2467
02:01:57,010 --> 02:01:59,329
saying

2468
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:01,400
it's rare that you're running literally

2469
02:01:59,329 --> 02:02:04,340
exactly the same thing in both cases and

2470
02:02:01,399 --> 02:02:06,409
have to optimize the avx-512 one because

2471
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:08,989
typically that ship just doesn't need

2472
02:02:06,409 --> 02:02:11,479
any optimization it can run exactly the

2473
02:02:08,989 --> 02:02:12,920
same thing the sse2 version and it's way

2474
02:02:11,479 --> 02:02:15,079
faster already because it's a more

2475
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:17,630
modern cpu with more optimizations and

2476
02:02:15,079 --> 02:02:21,430
possibly higher clock sometimes who

2477
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:21,430
knows more cores certainly

2478
02:02:33,609 --> 02:02:38,289
and just yet what you just said about

2479
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:40,149
what if you have a deal with Intel to

2480
02:02:38,289 --> 02:02:42,010
benchmark higher on the newest hardware

2481
02:02:40,149 --> 02:02:43,689
like I said that's the case that why

2482
02:02:42,010 --> 02:02:45,789
remember I said if you have a deal with

2483
02:02:43,689 --> 02:02:48,849
Intel or AMD or some like that that's

2484
02:02:45,789 --> 02:02:52,449
that what I mean and that's fine right

2485
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:54,640
that's a totally that's a totally

2486
02:02:52,449 --> 02:02:55,929
worthwhile thing because optimizing for

2487
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:58,150
new instruction sets is usually pretty

2488
02:02:55,930 --> 02:03:01,000
fun programmers oftentimes enjoy doing

2489
02:02:58,149 --> 02:03:04,329
it so if you can get a hardware company

2490
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:06,909
to subsidize the cost for you then that

2491
02:03:04,329 --> 02:03:11,109
just lets you add a high-end feature to

2492
02:03:06,909 --> 02:03:13,510
your game that will only work on the X

2493
02:03:11,109 --> 02:03:15,159
512 let's say and everybody wins

2494
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:16,480
you've got to do some fancy feature that

2495
02:03:15,159 --> 02:03:17,470
you couldn't have justified otherwise

2496
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:19,389
because you know you're not going to

2497
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:22,180
sell more copies of the game to the

2498
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:23,619
10,000 people who have a B X 512 like

2499
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:25,030
they're not going to not buy the game

2500
02:03:23,619 --> 02:03:27,189
just because it didn't have an avi X 512

2501
02:03:25,029 --> 02:03:28,599
feature but now if Intel's willing to

2502
02:03:27,189 --> 02:03:29,949
subsidize that development cost you know

2503
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:33,340
if they're willing to pay you 50 grand

2504
02:03:29,949 --> 02:03:34,599
or something then you know that that's

2505
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:36,279
worth it because now you can add a

2506
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:38,170
feature to your game they paid for it

2507
02:03:36,279 --> 02:03:40,889
your players get the benefit of it if

2508
02:03:38,170 --> 02:03:43,359
they happen to have a big size 12 and

2509
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:45,190
you got to do a fun programming thing so

2510
02:03:43,359 --> 02:03:47,409
you know everyone wins in that scenario

2511
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:49,059
but that doesn't happen very often

2512
02:03:47,409 --> 02:03:51,579
you know not that many people have deals

2513
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:53,770
with Intel to optimize stuff on their

2514
02:03:51,579 --> 02:03:56,500
latest hardware or add features that can

2515
02:03:53,770 --> 02:04:00,010
only be exposed by having you know more

2516
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:01,329
cores more instructions whatever but if

2517
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:07,150
you do then that's that's a scenario

2518
02:04:01,329 --> 02:04:08,680
where you do that right Jim 0.o says any

2519
02:04:07,149 --> 02:04:10,449
plans to create different types of

2520
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:13,119
lighting as in room X is with like a

2521
02:04:10,449 --> 02:04:15,220
summer's day while room Y is contrasted

2522
02:04:13,119 --> 02:04:16,630
in dark like a film noir or would you

2523
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:19,360
have all the sudden the art assets maybe

2524
02:04:16,630 --> 02:04:23,880
yeah no I do think we will change the

2525
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:27,239
lighting the lights per area for sure

2526
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:30,460
some areas will like be lit mostly by

2527
02:04:27,239 --> 02:04:32,229
you know point lights like we've got now

2528
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:35,649
and others will have like a Sun or a

2529
02:04:32,229 --> 02:04:37,059
moon lighting kind of a thing I think so

2530
02:04:35,649 --> 02:04:39,189
I do suspect we'll do a little bit of

2531
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:41,200
that I don't think we'll get too crazy

2532
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:42,879
but you know we're going to do a little

2533
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:48,279
bit of that over the next

2534
02:04:42,880 --> 02:05:00,010
weeks all right let's go ahead and close

2535
02:04:48,279 --> 02:05:01,329
