1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,609
okay thank you everyone for joining me

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,979
it's time for handmade here we had a

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,500
relatively long question-and-answer

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,500
session today that's just how it goes

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,750
sometimes but we're all good now I

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,219
started the timer I restarted the timer

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,019
so hopefully we'll still get roughly two

8
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:25,320
hours of programming it anyway I here's

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:28,739
what we're doing today last weekend we

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,778
finished our font importing and so that

11
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,589
we could have everything flow through

12
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:36,210
the art pipeline and we we kind of have

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,520
everything working now but we've got

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,899
like here's what I would say we finished

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,820
everything but we haven't really

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,200
polished anything in the system and so

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,759
there's still a lot of persnickety nough

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,460
stew it and there's some things that we

19
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,899
probably want to fine-tune and there's

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,878
stuff we want to do right it's re cetera

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,549
so I think what we want to do now is we

22
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:59,549
want to kind of like put ourselves in a

23
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,468
good sort of incubating situation where

24
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,378
we can work with the code a little bit

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:08,329
improve it you know get to a point where

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,310
we're happy with it and so that we can

27
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:12,989
clean out the cobwebs of what we've

28
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,930
created now having to do a bunch of work

29
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:18,239
with this asset importing and there's

30
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,040
sort of two sides to that one is that I

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,959
think we need to improve just the

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,118
handling of the assets on the game side

33
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,579
and so for doing that what I want to do

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,379
is just like increase the load the

35
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,349
cognitive load on that part of the code

36
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,719
now and say what if we want to add our

37
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:37,349
ground cover that we wanted to add a

38
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:40,890
ground cover back in let's add furniture

39
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:43,140
in the orphanage let's try getting the

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,659
orphans correct so which orphans are

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,899
which and all that stuff let's put a hat

42
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,509
on the hero these sorts of things and so

43
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,670
that's going to be a pretty major push

44
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:56,759
and that'll clean up I think a couple

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,799
parts of the asset system one is that we

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,149
can decide like how we're gonna like

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,530
standardize on the different grid

48
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,430
importing methods and stuff like this

49
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,659
and then another is like how the

50
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,909
entities query which assets they're

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,310
using and stuff like that so you know

52
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,909
we've got we can really like now now

53
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,219
that we kind of have all the pieces

54
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:19,520
working together we could really push to

55
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:23,840
make it all work right and and see how

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,640
each each thing at each decision has

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,219
effects on the parts of the pipeline so

58
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:31,909
that we can actually make intelligent

59
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:34,819
choices therefore the final you know for

60
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,349
the final blessed version the other

61
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:38,750
thing that I think we want to do is just

62
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:41,900
clean up some of the asset system code

63
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:44,270
so what I've seen with the way that we

64
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,849
did things and I meant I put some - dues

65
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,010
in the code about this is I really don't

66
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:51,289
like the way that we do our updating

67
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:53,000
right now because I feel like we could

68
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,209
consolidate it right now we're doing a

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,060
lot of individual checking so we do an

70
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,590
import and then we look at all these

71
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,039
things say like did this change did that

72
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,009
change right and what I'd rather do I

73
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:10,310
think is I'd rather do something more

74
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:14,209
along the lines of when we do a tag

75
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:20,479
import we build a completely new data

76
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:23,990
block for the HHA file for each hij file

77
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,989
and then when we are done right so when

78
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:30,469
we when we finish the entire import all

79
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:33,770
we do is compare the data block to the

80
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:36,139
old data block and if it's different we

81
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:41,990
rewrite it if it's the same we don't

82
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:43,939
write I think that's a much cleaner way

83
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,260
to do this because like right now if you

84
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:48,560
look at the way the code is working

85
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:50,659
we're classically having to manually do

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,039
checks to see whether we need to update

87
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:56,509
something in the HHA and not only does

88
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,129
that produce just a lot of code we have

89
00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:01,699
to maintain but it's just it's just

90
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:04,009
error-prone right because it means that

91
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,959
in addition to the code that imports

92
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:09,109
things we also have the code that dips

93
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,170
things and both can fail whereas if we

94
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:15,470
just had it you know if we just did

95
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:17,358
something where we put here is the final

96
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:19,668
block this is exactly what it has to be

97
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,219
it's trivial for us to just run a mem

98
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:24,228
comp on that and the old block to know

99
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,360
if anything changed and it can never be

100
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:27,269
wrong right

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,580
so that

102
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:32,698
would offload a huge amount of that work

103
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,918
on to one centralized easy to make

104
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,098
correct function that doesn't have to be

105
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,139
maintained and then that way we only

106
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:42,478
ever have to focus on making sure that

107
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,939
we import correctly and that's it so I

108
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,740
think that's a much better way to go and

109
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,209
it's just like you know because of the

110
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,829
way the code evolved we didn't think

111
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:52,049
about that or didn't implement that way

112
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:54,959
that's a head end but there's no reason

113
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,728
we can't kind of extract that part out

114
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,709
and do it because it's not that

115
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:00,029
complicated right it's not that hard to

116
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,408
imagine that thing it's not like we have

117
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:02,698
to rewrite all the code we could do it

118
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:04,649
pretty straight it's more about just

119
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:10,288
removing code really and then pushing it

120
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:12,929
to the end so that's really what we want

121
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:16,949
to do here now which of those things

122
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,800
we're doing and why and when well who

123
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,939
knows but I don't really care which

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,658
order we do them in so I'm just gonna

125
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,978
just go and we have to let it happen I

126
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:28,139
suspect we will probably focus more on

127
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:29,728
the diffing part of things first and the

128
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,769
reason for that is because I think where

129
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:34,408
we left it last week was just realizing

130
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:36,089
that you know if we pull in fonts we

131
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:37,680
sometimes get in weird situations where

132
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:39,448
like you know we don't really even have

133
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,598
a way to delete a font right now and

134
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,620
stuff like that because deletion doesn't

135
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,000
really work in our system at the moment

136
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,709
we don't have things to check to see if

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,110
you never saw an asset remove it from

138
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:50,758
the HHA right right and again that's

139
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,080
something that would just work if we

140
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,300
were dipping the block because when you

141
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,859
imported that one would be missing so

142
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,538
when you dipped with the old block it'd

143
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,840
be like no these are different rewrite

144
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:02,639
it right it would still leave the data

145
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,288
in the old thing but that's okay we

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,908
don't care if we leave date extra data

147
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:08,788
in the H at J's cuz everything works

148
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:10,918
even if there's extra data right so and

149
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:12,329
then you always know that before you

150
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,978
ship the game you could do a rebuild

151
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,060
which would eliminate any text you know

152
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:18,149
extraneous data that was sitting around

153
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,250
in there so that would all work well and

154
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:23,189
I think it's just yeah that all seems

155
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,658
like good to me so I suspected that's

156
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:26,610
probably the first thing we should do

157
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:30,598
assuming that I'm remembering correctly

158
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,930
that we were currently having a problem

159
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,189
with specifically the the fact that we

160
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,050
couldn't delete or that the fonts

161
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,459
weren't being like recognized properly

162
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,879
or something like that I'm gonna go

163
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,560
ahead and make sure that I'm not wrong

164
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:44,199
about that so I'm gonna open up remedy

165
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,399
here and remind myself of where we

166
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,199
actually you know stopped because I

167
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,909
don't I don't remember but yet like

168
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,219
right we there was some kind of problem

169
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,140
where like the fonts you know tags we're

170
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,560
not working properly or stuff like this

171
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:02,439
right and so I think that that's a good

172
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,600
excuse to maybe make this stuff or

173
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,410
improve this stuff a little bit because

174
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,540
I've yeah I'm pretty sure that that that

175
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,820
the way we've got it now you know have

176
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,129
some issues there all right so let me go

177
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:18,250
ahead and open up the hand made here a

178
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:23,740
project I also want to open up for the

179
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,449
moment the there's the tags file the

180
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,730
tags that are in question here so we've

181
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:31,990
got two tags files there's liberation

182
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:34,540
mono this one was working just fine but

183
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,759
then we also had Segoe and if I remember

184
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,650
correctly this one wasn't so you know

185
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,930
they're both the same effectively they

186
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:43,719
both have the one hundred and six Tests

187
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,060
glyph set that we specified they're

188
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,800
largely the same you know one has

189
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,800
slightly different values here but

190
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,420
otherwise they're the same right I and

191
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,590
so you know it's different pings and one

192
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,360
than the other obviously but otherwise

193
00:07:53,589 --> 00:08:00,689
you know no real difference between

194
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:06,040
these two and then if I go over to the

195
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:07,569
hht file sorry I load the hht file out

196
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,060
of the text file for the base game which

197
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,339
is where this this is you can see that

198
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,009
we have a pound include for each of

199
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:16,959
these and in one case where pound

200
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,180
including Segoe UI no hhd in another

201
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,539
case we're paddling liberation mono dot

202
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,610
hht if I remember correctly liberation

203
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,420
melody she works just fine fonts ago

204
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:30,280
thht did not work fine that we didn't

205
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,680
really have any explanation for this

206
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,279
right there was nothing like we don't

207
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,500
know why that didn't work and so we kind

208
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,939
of have to figure out like what did we

209
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,330
screw up here so let's go down that road

210
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:49,240
a little bit and in so doing if we feel

211
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,889
like the need we maybe we'll start on

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,190
some of that cleanup that I was talking

213
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:56,259
about as well

214
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,140
so the first thing I'd like to do is I

215
00:08:56,259 --> 00:09:00,460
want to kind of see you know what was

216
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,949
happening in the code here I'm assuming

217
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,590
that we do go down this fonts to go down

218
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,470
hht path because if you know if I look

219
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,980
at the handmade source directory here up

220
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,800
sorry tags directory rather what we see

221
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,230
is that in the fonts directory there is

222
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,919
you know this file does exist right

223
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,450
Segoe UI dat hht so the fact that we're

224
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,269
not getting anything here I don't really

225
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,800
understand why that would be the case so

226
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:30,419
I kind of want to step through and find

227
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:33,740
out why obviously we know that there's

228
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,159
when we go in here to the watch window

229
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,990
[Music]

230
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:41,350
I'm assuming that the font ID just comes

231
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,419
back at zero right well no that's that's

232
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,330
odd oh well you know what this is not

233
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:48,099
debug mode though so we don't really

234
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,139
know to what extent those inspections

235
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,139
would be accurate so let me just go

236
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:54,639
ahead and do a debug build and then we

237
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:57,789
can we should be able to see more

238
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:00,429
explicitly what is happening so if I run

239
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:03,819
this here we should be able to see

240
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:07,059
what's going on inside get font info it

241
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:10,090
looks like when we pull the asset out I

242
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,079
don't actually know what the ID is here

243
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,720
but I'm guessing it's zero

244
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,400
yeah so the problem that we get is

245
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,230
exactly the problem that we expected to

246
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:20,559
get which is to say that when we call

247
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,200
get best match asset it cannot find the

248
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,349
font now I'm gonna go ahead and start

249
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,970
right in there and I want to verify that

250
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,460
the problem is that there are no fonts

251
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,350
or something similar right so here's us

252
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,629
trying to get this asset and you can see

253
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:39,250
that it basically says there's no assets

254
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:43,210
that are labeled as being a font right

255
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:46,990
so the you know the code that we use to

256
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:50,710
do that was itself busted if I go into

257
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:54,759
the import place the import and we

258
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:58,780
search for where the the font asset type

259
00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:03,039
is being specified you see here here it

260
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:07,028
is this is the location where the asset

261
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:12,399
HHA type is specified right here

262
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:14,289
and if we look I mean one of the things

263
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,438
you could you could see about this too

264
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:20,558
is it's really indirect right if I go to

265
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:23,259
update single asset metadata right here

266
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:24,999
and take a look at it what you can see

267
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:26,829
is there's this kind of roundabout

268
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:29,230
method that this is going through as

269
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:32,859
well where the tags type ID has to have

270
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:36,278
that in it and that import grid tag is

271
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:39,490
part of things is I think the extra tags

272
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,860
part that's getting set here right so

273
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,448
we've got two separate places that are

274
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,730
setting these sorts of data this one's

275
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:48,099
setting the data to say this is a font

276
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,188
as far as the type is concerned this is

277
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,259
the category it's a font again not

278
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:54,639
thrilled with how any of that stuff is

279
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,919
working there's like multiple ways that

280
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,938
so you can see why this like spending

281
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:02,139
some time to clean this up I feel like

282
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:04,088
it'd be worth it anyway assuming both of

283
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,698
those things are set properly this this

284
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:11,249
comes in here should set the asset type

285
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:15,428
at this time question is is that tag

286
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:16,808
actually added here or not because I

287
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:20,499
don't even know the answer to that

288
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:24,219
question so let me go ahead and jump to

289
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:26,439
end tags and see so it looks like it is

290
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,928
which means that this extra tags should

291
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:30,969
actually now contain the tag for the

292
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:33,490
font which means that when it's actually

293
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,620
written out at least in theory the font

294
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,600
should get the tags that it's supposed

295
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:46,089
to have for that type so if I go back

296
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,490
and look at that we do a tag count here

297
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,990
to see whether the tags differ again

298
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,350
this is code that I would prefer not to

299
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:57,490
have had right I would like the code to

300
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,230
be cleaner than that certainly and this

301
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,519
is why I want do kind of bulk testing so

302
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,550
we know this sort of thing isn't a

303
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,470
problem but anyway when we do a thing to

304
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,628
see if the tags differ then we run

305
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,569
through and we actually like combine all

306
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:13,028
of these tags you can see us combining

307
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:16,838
the the first tag set comes from this

308
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:20,029
right second tag set comes from this so

309
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,940
when we do that we in theory

310
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:25,529
[Music]

311
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,560
we in theory would just append these it

312
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,559
looks

313
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:42,050
looks pretty reasonable to me I don't

314
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,759
see anything particularly weird right

315
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:47,599
and then we just end up with the

316
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,460
combined tag set I don't really know

317
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,139
what we pass asset and then there well I

318
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,970
kind of do I guess we pass asset and

319
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:54,830
done there because we don't really want

320
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,620
this thing to add the tag again we've

321
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,180
already put in the type tag right so

322
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,460
then we end up in here and we're like

323
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:02,569
alright we'll store these tags out off

324
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,639
we go

325
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:08,000
everything should get saved and then

326
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,949
we're done right so I'll be honest I

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,840
don't really see why that wouldn't have

328
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,610
worked I suppose it could be that there

329
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,769
was some kind of a dip that occurred and

330
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,190
the diff didn't end up working that's

331
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:21,379
certainly possible what I would like to

332
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,260
do is check because since we have the

333
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:27,320
ability to see what's going on in our

334
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:29,659
data files let's just do that if I use

335
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,300
HHA edit what you can see is there's a

336
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:35,899
dump here right so I can do HHA edit

337
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:40,429
dump base game HHA and I can pipe that

338
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:46,179
to base game dot txt if I then do the

339
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:49,219
tab view of that here's what I get

340
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:51,649
looking at it if I just open up the

341
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,690
assets you can kind of see that like

342
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:57,289
alright the first thing that's packed is

343
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,670
the font these are all the bitmaps they

344
00:14:57,289 --> 00:15:01,730
don't have any types because they're

345
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:05,089
just looked up by name later by index

346
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:07,810
later so after all of this stuff is

347
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,920
ingested we should see the font itself

348
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:18,819
what's really interesting is I don't

349
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:22,899
actually see the font at all right right

350
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,900
like I don't see the font there

351
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:34,039
so I think that's excuse me that just

352
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,749
indicates a problem further up the

353
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:41,028
stream it seems like what's going on

354
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:43,879
here is this either this failed right so

355
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:45,619
we never entered in here but if that

356
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,778
happened we should have probably it

357
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:49,910
would have failed out entirely I think

358
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:52,548
but maybe that's not true because this

359
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:54,318
is a pound include right so it could be

360
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:59,808
that we failed out in here this is what

361
00:15:54,318 --> 00:16:03,438
one excuse me sort of not particularly

362
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:06,828
great aspect is that we can't really

363
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:09,498
view the errors if we never launch the

364
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:15,138
game right like I don't have a good way

365
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:16,459
of launching the errors here so it kind

366
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,879
of would have been nice to be able to

367
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:21,768
see errors that were happening in the

368
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,449
actual dump like maybe embedded in the

369
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,209
file or something like that which we

370
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:28,669
sort of have per asset but not as a more

371
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:30,859
global thing right so I wonder if we

372
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:34,539
should add to our HHA just a thing

373
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:37,730
that's like here's the last error dump

374
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:39,828
that might be a nice thing but for now

375
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:43,339
let's just assume hey something happened

376
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:47,628
bad here what happened exactly in terms

377
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,339
of writing the asset data we don't

378
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:51,619
really know what happened here when we

379
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:54,559
did update asset update single asset

380
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:55,999
metadata I mean I don't think we really

381
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:58,249
we really couldn't get through here

382
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:59,959
without reserving an asset so it sure

383
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:02,528
seems anyway because these are

384
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:05,168
contiguous just looking at these right

385
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:08,778
there's not like an empty space either

386
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:11,028
so it just seems to me like this must

387
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:13,130
have failed and we just didn't know so

388
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:15,199
like there's a parse error like in this

389
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,819
file or something right and we just

390
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,058
don't know about it or something like

391
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:22,519
that and I'm not sure what that error

392
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:26,808
would be but that seems like the case so

393
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:28,638
I'm just gonna step into it and see if I

394
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:31,369
can figure out what that is and again

395
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:33,769
like normally we can see errors in the

396
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:36,259
little log window but since we can't the

397
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:38,269
the debug foss the one thing that can't

398
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,778
fail because if the debug font fails to

399
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:41,460
pack we can't

400
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:43,739
the error because it's in that window

401
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,298
right which is why I say maybe we need

402
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:46,798
to back up away because there is one

403
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:52,589
thing that can fail that we can't print

404
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:56,009
out the errors for if I break on par

405
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:58,098
spot block I want to look and see what

406
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:02,759
actually happens here in terms of errors

407
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:07,558
if we go through and parse stuff let's

408
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:14,669
see that was a little bit weird what was

409
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:16,319
the first thing we passed there I'm

410
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:21,749
gonna start that again I didn't see what

411
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:24,058
that actually parsed let's double check

412
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:26,879
as we go to do we get the right glyph

413
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:28,319
count and everything yep 106 so we're

414
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:30,588
gonna get a token here let's just see

415
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,588
what it is

416
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:40,888
it's tags so it should get parsed in

417
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:43,168
here all right that should eat it up uh

418
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:44,998
then we get our next token we got a

419
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:49,619
sender height that should eat just fine

420
00:18:44,999 --> 00:19:00,329
to sender height external letting and

421
00:18:49,618 --> 00:19:04,798
then we should see glyphs right all

422
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:08,759
looks good so those cliffs look like

423
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,048
they're parsing just fine we can we can

424
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,588
set a breakpoint on the horizontal

425
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:17,819
advance table make sure that all works

426
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:20,729
ok looks like it's working ok and then

427
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:23,668
we'll jump down here here's our parsing

428
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:26,580
and so we did fail right like the

429
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:28,830
parsing did fail and the question is why

430
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:30,418
did the parsing fail so let's take a

431
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:33,088
look at the tokenizer is error stream

432
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:36,538
here and just see what what was the

433
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:40,499
problem I don't know if we can jump

434
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:42,179
right to this but we'll try here's the

435
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:44,490
last thing yeah unfortunate just like

436
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:48,030
you know just gonna be like a

437
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:53,910
pretty basic error let's see what the

438
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:59,809
contents are here tags font how can I

439
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:59,810
see the rest of this ago there's a -

440
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:10,199
okay interesting so if we go we're gonna

441
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:12,960
find a negative and it looks like we did

442
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:19,950
not support that so if I search for

443
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:24,059
negative first of all those values are

444
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:26,279
complete garbage so we've got some kind

445
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:29,269
of like an a bad like overflow printout

446
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:35,069
problem which we can go to bug but

447
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:39,660
negative kearns well they're not really

448
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:41,399
legal in our system to be honest because

449
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,050
that would mean you're going backwards

450
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,310
which you can't really do negative

451
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,990
currents would be fine if we were

452
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,000
talking about the difference between the

453
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,990
character width and how much the current

454
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,220
then you would have negative all the

455
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,549
time but this case you shouldn't really

456
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:58,380
so I don't know what's causing that but

457
00:20:53,549 --> 00:21:03,359
that that is bad right so what I'd like

458
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:06,930
to do there is go into just to just to

459
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:10,309
figure out what's happening with our hht

460
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:14,340
font like our age HT font why can I not

461
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:17,509
there is HH font sorry our HH font

462
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:21,599
program is totally crapping out on

463
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:23,579
trying to produce some floating-point

464
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,500
print out of these things we don't know

465
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:28,289
whether the actual value it's computing

466
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:32,279
is wrong or whether the thing that does

467
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:36,149
the printing is wrong now I think about

468
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,710
it h HT r HH font is used to see runtime

469
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:39,420
glabrous the chances the printouts wrong

470
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,640
are like zero because we didn't write it

471
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,890
it's something to tab times of testing

472
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,720
it's probably not that so that means

473
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,380
we're actually filling out this table

474
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,549
incorrectly somehow so we need to go

475
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,170
figure out why we're filling out the

476
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:54,589
table incorrectly so it's this

477
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,080
horizontal advance table is just wrong

478
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:59,970
so how is that the case if we look

479
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,889
how it's being filled out currently what

480
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:05,399
we could do is just search in the file

481
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:09,419
in general for we're horizontal advanced

482
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:13,319
is being being updated so you can see

483
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:17,190
here we allocate a square glyph count of

484
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:20,579
floats right and then we set the entire

485
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:23,759
thing to zero so in theory everything

486
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:27,329
should be a zero at the outset and then

487
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:31,679
we add in here information from these

488
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:36,480
pairs that we get back and I guess what

489
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:38,909
I don't really know is whether those

490
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:44,069
values can come back as some kind of

491
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:45,419
special I don't know thing like it could

492
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:53,308
be that those are coming back as

493
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:57,299
negative ones or something I'm gonna

494
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:58,528
search real quickly in Windows to make

495
00:22:57,298 --> 00:22:59,908
sure there isn't anything special when

496
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:01,349
you know they're but the real thing I

497
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:05,190
wanna do is step in there and see what

498
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:07,379
they are but I want to see if there is

499
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,570
there anything in particular that I

500
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,710
should know about in terms of what gets

501
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:16,019
returned here so this says hey we need

502
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,759
this many of those things that's what we

503
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:21,620
expect to be doing the kerning pair

504
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:25,789
comes back as as whatever that is

505
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:29,679
there's a first a second and an amount

506
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,680
[Music]

507
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:38,909
so if the value is negative is there

508
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:42,869
something we're doing that would cause

509
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:45,090
that to not cast properly I don't think

510
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:47,038
so because we're taking this is an

511
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:49,109
integer we're casting it directly to a

512
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,148
float so it's not like it's going

513
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:52,859
through some unsigned value or some

514
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:56,339
weird thing that might munge it plus we

515
00:23:52,859 --> 00:24:04,918
were seeing the negative so that

516
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:09,619
happened so I'm not really sure what

517
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,620
what's going on there

518
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,559
so I'm gonna step in here because I

519
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:22,200
really can't see what would be happening

520
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:24,829
there that would be odd and then when we

521
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,519
get down here and we sort of go through

522
00:24:24,829 --> 00:24:32,250
this process we add the kerning change

523
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:36,509
so I suppose one other thing that could

524
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:40,680
be true is it could be that the kerning

525
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:43,289
change is wrong what I don't really know

526
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,960
is why do we structure the if this way

527
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:47,220
did we mess this up because if you look

528
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,049
at what's happening here it's like we're

529
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,970
gonna add the character advance minus

530
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:52,710
the kerning change but then we're just

531
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,360
gonna add oh it's a different place

532
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,160
nevermind it's a different place that'll

533
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,409
make sense we add the crane change in

534
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,390
here if the current change was wrong

535
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,240
that's another way we could corrupt it

536
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,250
so maybe we should check that out too

537
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,630
the scale ratio is gonna be applied to

538
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,880
everything so if that was wrong

539
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,010
everything would be wrong not just some

540
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,910
of the kerning values so let's take a

541
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:19,920
look at what the kerning change is there

542
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:22,460
here's how that's computed right so

543
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:27,000
what's happening there

544
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:30,930
inside kerning change we have pre step X

545
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,980
and MINIX I wonder if what happened is

546
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:36,480
when we use well I guess we're not using

547
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,599
any scaling though so that shouldn't be

548
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,210
a problem but anyway let's let's just

549
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:46,649
think it through so if we look at min X

550
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:51,720
and free step where are those where are

551
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:58,350
those discussed so pre step is a is an

552
00:25:51,720 --> 00:26:00,240
int and min X is so you know I kind of

553
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,899
feel like this is one of those things

554
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,240
where this happened

555
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:09,540
when we're doing this doing this

556
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,730
subtraction in integer land is I'm sorry

557
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,200
in is going to happen in unsigned

558
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,630
integer land because integral promotion

559
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,940
will probably turn these into unsigned

560
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:21,680
int so this is an int and this is an

561
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,670
unsigned int I bet this is a problem of

562
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,580
things getting promoted

563
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:29,600
- from in unsigned and so I think what

564
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:33,089
we want to do instead maybe is this

565
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:36,000
let's just do this in float because we

566
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:38,399
want our float result anyway so rather

567
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,910
than doing these things in unsigned

568
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,250
integer space when we compute them let's

569
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,759
just compute everything in the target

570
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:51,180
space so the unsigned int regular int

571
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:55,019
problem won't rear its ugly head that's

572
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:57,960
my vote I'm gonna I'm gonna see there's

573
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:00,150
another issue with this I'm not whatever

574
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,470
isn't sure about pre stepping X I don't

575
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:07,170
know if that needs to be scaled

576
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:10,650
differently it may be that this value is

577
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:16,259
wrong in the scaling case because the

578
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:18,990
min X versus the pre step X I don't

579
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:21,109
think so though so anyway we'll give it

580
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,109
a shot

581
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:30,210
all right and now we can run our HH font

582
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:34,769
program again the HH font program was

583
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:40,950
being run on something i don't remember

584
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:44,220
what it was it's a go UI what did you do

585
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:50,819
- duze Segoe UI irregular at what font

586
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:53,420
size was it 20 I want to say anyway

587
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,419
let's give it a shot

588
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:04,659
I'm gonna go into base game fonts

589
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:06,699
there's all of our fonts so we're gonna

590
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,850
go ahead and dump this out and if I look

591
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,240
actually also at Segoe UI if I look at

592
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:15,730
this it's school UI regular and it's I

593
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:21,490
guess it was 2020 high right because 1

594
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:25,809
plus 19 is 20 so if I ask for a 20 - 4

595
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:27,910
Segoe UI regular here's the HH font I'm

596
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,289
gonna say that that's like I don't

597
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,700
actually know where this was but it's

598
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:39,069
probably like windows fonts Segoe UI

599
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:46,960
right so we're loading that it's Segoe

600
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:49,809
UI regular right and then we want 20 the

601
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,990
carrot set is test the destination hht

602
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:58,779
is going to be W handmade tags

603
00:28:52,990 --> 00:29:00,700
Segoe sorry fonts Segoe UI and the DEF

604
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:03,809
PNG dirt is gonna be where I am right

605
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:06,190
now so handmade sources based game fonts

606
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:10,289
and then I'm going to let that go

607
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:13,420
now in theory that means now this if I

608
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:14,529
whoops if I revert this buffer I don't

609
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,880
know if I can actually do that maybe I

610
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:24,309
can't so we'll kill the buffer and load

611
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,630
a new so now we shouldn't see those

612
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:27,369
negatives down there I don't think

613
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,440
because we fixed the place where they

614
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:31,359
were getting computed it correctly and

615
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,160
so that all looks much nicer now right

616
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,599
you can see that it so I think that was

617
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,900
just a case of like doing it in the

618
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:39,730
wrong space we're doing an unsigned and

619
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,960
we needed to not convert a signed value

620
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,779
to an unsigned value for that

621
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,579
computation for obvious reasons all

622
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:48,879
right so then if I want to put the tags

623
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:53,169
in here just to say that it's a debug

624
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:56,080
font that should get me into happy land

625
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:58,630
I think let's see if that's true

626
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,000
so here we are in our spot block yeah

627
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,690
and now we can properly parse it so I

628
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,670
think we're good to go now hopefully

629
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,980
anyway I don't actually know if that's

630
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,639
true but yeah ok so we found the font

631
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,209
that time

632
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:15,458
right so that's good uh all right so

633
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:16,839
yeah now that frees us up we don't have

634
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:18,308
to do what I said we're going to do then

635
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:19,358
we don't have to start working on

636
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:20,408
cleaning that part of the code up

637
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:22,718
because it looks like it wasn't an

638
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:27,129
update problem it was just a case of our

639
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:28,929
HH font program being busted but now if

640
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:33,569
I go ahead and run we should have a

641
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:33,570
fully running system here

642
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,839
and I think this was in the response to

643
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:39,909
a question is when we originally did

644
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,069
this it was to ask how to do those

645
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:44,860
ligatures and that's how you do those

646
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:46,298
ligatures right now looking at our fonts

647
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,709
it looks like our fonts are not

648
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:50,710
anti-aliasing properly it would be the

649
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,269
other thing I would say and or in there

650
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,620
there's just some issues you can see

651
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,970
with them like I'm gonna go ahead and

652
00:30:53,619 --> 00:31:01,028
zoom in just to show you I'm talking

653
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:02,470
about hopefully this works on the stream

654
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:05,169
actually I can look on me on the other

655
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:11,490
window and see if I turn the magnifier

656
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:11,490
on and I try to move around the screen

657
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:22,489
so what you can kind of see is like the

658
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:26,538
alpha blending on those is just not very

659
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:29,358
good right and part of that is they're

660
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:32,388
still going through the path of depth of

661
00:31:29,358 --> 00:31:36,739
doing def peels for n alpha sorting and

662
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:38,838
stuff like that so I guess there is a

663
00:31:36,739 --> 00:31:41,749
little bit of weirdness happening there

664
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:46,338
but just in terms of looking at them it

665
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:49,278
just looks it just looks a little odd to

666
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:51,168
me it might be that it's just too small

667
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,058
but just you know like that doesn't seem

668
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:56,809
it seems like the kerning is maybe just

669
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:59,028
too tight as well it's really hard to

670
00:31:56,808 --> 00:32:01,989
say I'm not sure I could really put my

671
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:04,299
finger on it but it just looks a little

672
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:06,720
busted and

673
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:11,549
[Music]

674
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,990
I guess one problem is I don't know if

675
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:17,669
this thing does can I make this thing

676
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:20,240
not filter this thing might filter for

677
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,240
all I know to

678
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,460
that

679
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,538
okay if with that off

680
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,509
[Music]

681
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:51,900
[Music]

682
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:54,869
so it's really hard to say but it just

683
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,960
it looks like the font kerning is off

684
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:59,879
sometimes I don't know I could be wrong

685
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:09,750
about that but it just looks a little

686
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:12,180
off like maybe it's just too a little

687
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:16,109
too tight like we're removing something

688
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,910
from the font that we shouldn't be or

689
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:20,429
something like that the other thing I

690
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:24,230
would say is we're doing currently I

691
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,230
don't know to what extent we're doing

692
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,470
when we're doing linear alpha blending

693
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,320
on these I don't know to what extent

694
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:36,660
we're properly doing like perceptive

695
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:38,099
alpha on the edges here but we may need

696
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,710
to tweak the alpha blending if we really

697
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:44,699
wanted small fonts to look correct as

698
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,319
well but suffice to say that's sort of

699
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,620
all stuff for a different time whether

700
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,779
we ever even care at all looking at it

701
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:54,329
in here you can you can tell regardless

702
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:57,119
that you know obviously the font stuff

703
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:59,429
is working properly now in terms of

704
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,139
loading and selecting and being the

705
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,509
right bitmaps and we even got ligatures

706
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,180
working just fine in there right so that

707
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:08,760
all seems good I want to undo that

708
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:13,170
change now of course because I don't

709
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:16,110
want a proportionally spaced font for my

710
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:18,869
debug display right that is not what I

711
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:21,180
want at all so I'm gonna go ahead and

712
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:22,829
kill this buffer and I'm gonna go back

713
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:28,769
to the base game and I'm gonna swap

714
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:31,440
which one of those I'm doing there and

715
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:34,110
then I'm just gonna save that and rerun

716
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,429
and I don't actually know because like I

717
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,630
said doesn't remove fonts so I'm not

718
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:38,929
sure about that but yeah it looks like

719
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,220
it picked the new font just fine right

720
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,690
and that allows us to still have our

721
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:44,459
properly because remember we were using

722
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,280
the the fixed width of the font to make

723
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,809
sure that stuff lined up properly right

724
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,809
[Music]

725
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:59,450
all right so we probably want to stop

726
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:01,130
the music test as well here well I don't

727
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:02,779
know maybe we don't but for the moment I

728
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,960
think we probably want to stop the music

729
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:09,050
test I don't really want that playing

730
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,230
all the times can drive me nuts so I'm

731
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:14,330
gonna go ahead and turn that guy down so

732
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:17,750
that's this code right here I'm just

733
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:19,699
gonna take that and if that out we can

734
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,789
if it back in if we need to test the

735
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:28,969
music some more but for now not so much

736
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:32,389
and now we can start to look at some

737
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:33,799
other aspects of things right so here's

738
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:36,199
some stuff that what I was trying to say

739
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,269
like the the first thing that I think we

740
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:41,000
want to look at is just be some basic

741
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:43,849
tag stuff so if I look at what's going

742
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,389
on in the game here you know and and the

743
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:49,489
dudes like walking around or whatever if

744
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:51,409
there's like there's two main things I

745
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:52,669
want to do right off the bat and then a

746
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:54,980
third one that we want to get to

747
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,500
eventually so all right I don't know

748
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,139
what why this room is stone when this is

749
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,789
in an outside room someone want to tell

750
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:03,109
me what's going on there I thought this

751
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:06,219
room was supposed to be like the garden

752
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:09,050
or something why is it a stone floor

753
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:12,379
does anyone know did we set that to a

754
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:14,110
stone floor for some unknown reason we

755
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,660
still have the grass in here right like

756
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:20,090
am I wrong about that all right so we've

757
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:25,879
got we have another bug here our stone

758
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:29,750
floor is our grass floor is not working

759
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:33,920
right we have stone only these this

760
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:35,780
should be grass here right some of these

761
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,150
rooms were supposed to be stone floor I

762
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:43,220
think like like these but the other one

763
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:46,190
says we grass so we've got some tag

764
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:48,259
problem that's happening in the base

765
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,340
game so that's the first thing I want to

766
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,080
find out because I don't know what's

767
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:58,010
going out that so here's our blocks that

768
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:02,139
are defined here we've got a forest

769
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:04,540
block so here's the stone block right

770
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:08,500
and here's the

771
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:12,000
the grass block and for some reason it

772
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:20,440
looks like we're not ever picking that

773
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:23,199
grass block right I mean that's that's

774
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,769
what it looks like to me so the forest

775
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:30,279
the Black Forest oh one bitmap is never

776
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:32,289
selected and I don't really know why so

777
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,170
so let's take a look at where that's

778
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:37,869
actually happening inside I think it's

779
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:40,960
inside the room Jen code when we want to

780
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:44,460
do like grass you can see here that we

781
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,900
do aspect like are we outdoors or not

782
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,740
this is working properly as far as you

783
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:54,369
can tell this is not so the grass tag

784
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:57,279
this thing for whatever reason is is

785
00:37:54,369 --> 00:38:00,789
just not actually being selected for I

786
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,460
guess unless something else is going

787
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:06,909
wrong there now the block forest oh one

788
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,289
dot PNG block orphanage o3 like that

789
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:12,339
stuff I'm assuming that's lined up

790
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:17,909
properly because we we are like we we in

791
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:20,530
theory well here's a question for you

792
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:23,559
we didn't look at the airs we probably

793
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:26,890
should write so I don't see any errors

794
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:28,750
in there right if I saw some errors in

795
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,920
there then I would say maybe we're

796
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,239
getting a problem with the errors but

797
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,570
we're not seeing any problems with the

798
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:37,509
errors right uh so if we look in here

799
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,570
and say what is actually happening with

800
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,830
our tagged grass why isn't that working

801
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,660
first thing I want to do is look at that

802
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:46,239
dump we already have one so I might as

803
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:48,549
well make use of it right if I look at

804
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,279
the assets and I just ignore the font

805
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,060
for now and we go down here to see like

806
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,900
what else we've got

807
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:57,639
so here's the forest block and here's

808
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,670
the orphanage block I'm going to look at

809
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,019
what tags are in here and also on the

810
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,789
one that we're actually picking which is

811
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:08,019
the stone one I think that's that this

812
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:09,789
one here right yeah so you can see they

813
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:11,289
both have the same basic category so

814
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:13,059
they shouldn't be preferred and they

815
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:15,909
should they should all be checked we

816
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:17,500
have both of them have a floor tag one

817
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:18,759
of them says it's man-made stone one of

818
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,780
them says it's grass

819
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:26,590
right I think that's exactly what they

820
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,769
should say so I'm not sure why we

821
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:31,539
wouldn't pick one or the other

822
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:34,090
I'm gonna go look at the env code and

823
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:36,130
see what is actually happening there

824
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,690
when we go to do the selection process

825
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,990
did we forget something

826
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:49,179
I don't know so what's gonna happen when

827
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:50,199
we do this inside here we are inside the

828
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,779
render group here's where we're

829
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:55,569
rendering the pieces when we go ahead

830
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:59,040
and try to access the best matched

831
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:01,990
bitmap we use match vector weight vector

832
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:06,219
you can see the way this is working is

833
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:09,608
we go through each of the the tags that

834
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:16,389
the entity has on it we set the weight

835
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:18,639
of that thing and off we go now hmm this

836
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:20,858
code looks a little oh no it has a tag

837
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,358
after month so for the entire tag count

838
00:40:20,858 --> 00:40:26,920
we go through setting these things here

839
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:28,840
is the tag series two tags value and we

840
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,230
set the weight of that thing to one that

841
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:36,608
should give us an appropriate match I

842
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:38,769
would think so I'm not sure why we're

843
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:44,619
not getting that let's go ahead and

844
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:46,139
check and see I'm gonna just to speed

845
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:49,420
things up a little here I'm gonna say

846
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:52,179
why don't we go ahead and look when we

847
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:59,108
pull out one of the tags I'm gonna see

848
00:40:52,179 --> 00:41:04,059
if it's tags grass and if it is I'm

849
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:05,380
gonna make this stop right trying to

850
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:07,769
give another way to do this oh you know

851
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,769
what I'll do

852
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,889
there you go so what am I do here is I'm

853
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,330
just making a synthetic line of code

854
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,859
that I can break on but I know the

855
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:30,889
optimizer can't really optimize out

856
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,329
particularly effectively I mean it still

857
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:35,389
kind of could use a conditional move or

858
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:40,610
something but I'm hoping it won't so let

859
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:42,139
me go into the entity code well I guess

860
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,190
I'll just set a breakpoint by name is

861
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:49,489
probably faster than hunting for the

862
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:53,659
file so update and render entities run

863
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:58,699
through so here we are let's go into the

864
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:59,329
code and set a breakpoint on that code

865
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:01,759
right there

866
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:04,429
when we get down here we should now be

867
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,200
in a situation where the ID is grass oh

868
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:07,669
and I should build in T bug mode because

869
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:10,460
again I don't really want us to ruggle

870
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:15,230
with trying to view all of our stuff in

871
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:16,099
debugging there so off we go oh I should

872
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,300
have thought of that I wouldn't have to

873
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:19,159
do this extra thing I could have just

874
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,100
put into y equals 5 or something because

875
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:24,230
we're in debug mode all right so anyway

876
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:27,250
if I look at the ID it's a it's a grass

877
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,929
tag so if I look at the match vector

878
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,099
right here's the match vector these have

879
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:32,750
to get shrunk they're huge

880
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:35,750
right this is this is not gonna be

881
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:39,739
sustainable but anyway here's the match

882
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:43,070
vector so we've got 18 19 and 20 are all

883
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:46,339
set so one is going to be the facing

884
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:51,620
Direction one is gonna be the idle and

885
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:54,579
and those are well to be honest I'm not

886
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:57,500
sure why idle get set every time but

887
00:42:54,579 --> 00:43:01,190
because it shouldn't that get onset

888
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:04,909
sometimes and that ones that's a little

889
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:06,320
confusing anyway it doesn't matter so

890
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:08,379
when we're actually matching those we've

891
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,850
got some here and those are fine

892
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,140
those'll those will do whatever their is

893
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:14,900
they're gonna do and then we're gonna

894
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:16,190
set the grass 1 the tag count here

895
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,099
really should just be there should only

896
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:23,950
be two tags so let's let's see it set

897
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:23,949
the grass up here it should be somewhere

898
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:33,579
there we go

899
00:43:34,889 --> 00:43:37,980
[Music]

900
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:44,460
so there's the grass and so these three

901
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:46,618
things are all set in the vector that we

902
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:54,190
want to match which are what exactly

903
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:55,579
actually let's take a look so those are

904
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,409
[Music]

905
00:43:55,579 --> 00:44:00,598
floor and idle idle is flying again

906
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:02,670
because nobody has that in floors anyway

907
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,109
so it doesn't matter so it's grass and

908
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,579
floor which exactly what should be get

909
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:10,500
set and then facing direction of course

910
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:12,569
was set so that's all fine and then here

911
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,130
we should presumably why don't you say

912
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:19,640
this oh you don't know what this idea is

913
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:19,640
what is this ID man-made

914
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,010
so this looks just like a bug in the

915
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:39,279
room generator are we setting the

916
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:45,310
man-made tag on everything because if it

917
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:59,560
ain't man-made that that's not a bug

918
00:44:45,309 --> 00:45:00,940
yeah all right so we don't really want

919
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:02,199
to say that these are man-made so that's

920
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,849
why I was picking it is because we were

921
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,469
saying it had to be man-made which it

922
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:07,719
doesn't have to be and of course there

923
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:10,419
is no man-made grass at the moment so

924
00:45:07,719 --> 00:45:12,549
there was nothing to pick so I think

925
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:14,559
that was the only problem we had there

926
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,630
and I don't know why that didn't show up

927
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,009
before but probably it had something to

928
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,410
do with the way that that we were

929
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:21,970
matching tags and had set them in order

930
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:24,429
or something weird like that

931
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,709
but that's just a general book generic

932
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:30,429
bug that we have in the actual room

933
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:34,659
gencode so in theory if I go back here

934
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:36,399
now I should see grass again yeah all

935
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:39,429
right so I'm glad we fixed that so our

936
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,500
current our current issues right like I

937
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:43,509
was saying before so if we take a look

938
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,670
at how all the stuff is is panning out

939
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,890
what we want to do here is we want

940
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:50,079
outdoor you know doesn't look like grass

941
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:51,699
right so we want to be able to put

942
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,309
ground cover on here so it looks more

943
00:45:51,699 --> 00:45:56,789
like an outdoorsy kind of a scene we

944
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:59,650
want to put some trees in here as well

945
00:45:56,789 --> 00:46:03,219
in addition we want to go ahead and in

946
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:07,750
here and add like furniture right and

947
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:10,419
then we also want to do like some

948
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:13,019
tagging of the of the orphans properly

949
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:15,159
which we can't do at the moment either

950
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:17,440
so we have a bunch of stuff we want to

951
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:19,269
do for pulling in assets and making it

952
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,450
easy to like place things around the

953
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:26,110
world that are based on which assets we

954
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:28,629
were trying to place there so that's

955
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:31,720
what I'd like to sort of focus on on now

956
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:33,430
and you know we sort of have like three

957
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:35,019
waves right we've got that I want to

958
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:37,029
clean up that asset system diffing of it

959
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:39,670
and then I think at that point we're

960
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:41,769
probably into lighting land where we've

961
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,900
got to sort of go in and simplify and

962
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:44,259
then more universalize lighting because

963
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,420
remember

964
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,920
the lighting is only sort of in there

965
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,440
temporarily now we can see sort of the

966
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,780
lighting region and it's good like I

967
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:57,039
like the look that it adds but it's just

968
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:58,810
not there yet it's too slow and we need

969
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,400
to start sampling on sprites as well

970
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:01,869
right now we don't sample the lighting

971
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,900
on sprite so it's kind of nonsensical

972
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:06,660
like you know if you look these are way

973
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,700
too bright right they should be dim

974
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:12,549
right now because you could see like how

975
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:16,149
that's working right so that's I think

976
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:18,250
where we're at I'll start off by sort of

977
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,829
looking at what we can sort of slowly

978
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:22,809
start to bring in here um you know maybe

979
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:24,519
furniture is a good start I don't know

980
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:28,230
but we've got a bunch of stuff we might

981
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:31,059
want to do so let's let's just just go

982
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:34,358
if I look at our sources and I go into

983
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:39,029
base game inside the art directory one

984
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:43,000
things that you can see here is that the

985
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:47,800
we've got like items right we've got

986
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:52,869
obstacles and I think we have covers

987
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:56,109
well in your somewhere I thought we did

988
00:47:52,869 --> 00:48:01,210
anyway yeah and cover so you can see

989
00:47:56,108 --> 00:48:03,809
here there's like ground cover on a

990
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,039
sprite sheet that we might want to

991
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:08,500
figure out how to use to like make the

992
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:10,000
grassy area that's gonna be a little

993
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,380
more complicated because we need to do

994
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,170
something that like scatters that around

995
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,940
and draws it and stuff a more simpler

996
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:19,570
version would be like we could add hats

997
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:23,619
right so this is a hat that can go on

998
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:27,519
some somebody same here's a Baker's hat

999
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:29,050
right and so if we wanted to put the hat

1000
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:30,369
in here's a flower right similar to a

1001
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:34,090
hat just the thing that can go on

1002
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:37,920
someone's head so if we wanted to start

1003
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:41,530
bringing like items in for that matter

1004
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,909
that would be kind of a good thing to

1005
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,740
start doing maybe could try putting

1006
00:48:42,909 --> 00:48:50,139
those on people and the other thing is

1007
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:51,429
is this we've got the obstacles these

1008
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:53,440
are things that could just get plopped

1009
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:56,409
down sort of just like scatter around

1010
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,559
the environment and can create like you

1011
00:48:56,409 --> 00:49:00,739
know you can't move on

1012
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:02,360
squared not all also isn't a great term

1013
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:05,419
potentially because like some of them

1014
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,700
like this rug you know there's no it's

1015
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:09,650
not an obstacle really like there's no

1016
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:11,869
reason you can't hop along the rug so

1017
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:16,010
it's not an obstacle it's more like

1018
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:18,980
decor make sense so it's hard to say but

1019
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:21,050
you know we can we can cross that bridge

1020
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,179
when we come to it so looking at this

1021
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,620
right and again it's windows does a

1022
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:28,399
really bad job at displaying these if I

1023
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:30,380
loaded up into to you can sort of

1024
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,420
get a better feel for what we're

1025
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:36,470
actually talking about here but here is

1026
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,119
here's what we actually so you know

1027
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:41,389
there's something like tables and you

1028
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:43,789
know a couch or whatever right and lamps

1029
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:48,139
or things like that floor lamp a table

1030
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:56,900
lamp whatever right chair uh and so

1031
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:59,420
those are those are things you want to

1032
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,910
be able to place individual instances of

1033
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:06,579
when we do a room Jen we want to like

1034
00:50:01,909 --> 00:50:09,589
scatter furniture around it right and so

1035
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:11,599
this seems like an interesting problem

1036
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:15,289
we have to figure out how we want to do

1037
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:19,250
it with our asset system the first thing

1038
00:50:15,289 --> 00:50:20,599
I would say is we probably when when

1039
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:23,269
these things are getting imported it's

1040
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:27,429
not clear to me that we don't just want

1041
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:29,329
to tag like every cell separately right

1042
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:31,639
because they're looking at this there's

1043
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:34,009
no like rhyme or reason to it I mean we

1044
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:37,779
could try to say like chairs go in one

1045
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:40,430
file or chairs or one thing and you know

1046
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:44,210
sofas or another pet who cares right it

1047
00:50:40,429 --> 00:50:45,889
doesn't really make a lot of sense as to

1048
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:49,190
how we would want these things to be

1049
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:51,049
broken up and so I don't know the other

1050
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,730
question I have is like do we want these

1051
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:56,030
to just be in their own files like

1052
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:59,329
should they just be split off and not be

1053
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:01,910
imported as a grid worth of things and

1054
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:06,730
again I don't really know we can

1055
00:51:01,909 --> 00:51:06,730
certainly extend our assets our assets

1056
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:11,519
sort of information if you will we can

1057
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:15,000
certainly

1058
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:23,400
that to say let allow me to tag each

1059
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:26,369
individual cell separately and maybe

1060
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,309
that's the best way to go but I don't

1061
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:31,849
have a lot of other I don't have much

1062
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:31,849
else to say

1063
00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:52,699
yeah I don't really have a whole lot

1064
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:55,670
else to say about that so I guess for

1065
00:51:52,699 --> 00:52:02,779
now what we'll do is we'll just make

1066
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:07,039
there be you know in here in the hht

1067
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:09,410
file if we look at one of these things I

1068
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,000
don't know we've got characters and junk

1069
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:13,509
like that if we were to start adding

1070
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,460
here's you know where we would add that

1071
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:18,260
so if I wanted to add like obstacles

1072
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:21,230
forests and obstacles Orphanage so let's

1073
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:23,150
just say that those were gonna be

1074
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,340
something we were gonna add and what I

1075
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:27,680
do is I'm gonna put them at the top of

1076
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,390
the file in fact I'm gonna put them like

1077
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:35,118
all the way at the top of the file for

1078
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:38,529
now and what I want to do here is I want

1079
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,460
to make it so well I you know what I

1080
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:42,609
guess I don't really have to because I

1081
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:49,519
can just set a breakpoint on that on

1082
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:51,139
obstacles as a type so you know if we

1083
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:53,599
look at obstacles at the moment there's

1084
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:55,909
really no difference I don't think for

1085
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,650
obstacles or cover or anything else

1086
00:52:55,909 --> 00:53:01,940
they're just gonna be straightforward

1087
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:04,789
grid imports you know and so the

1088
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:07,159
question is just if I want to do tags

1089
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:09,079
equals something I'm just thinking well

1090
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:13,039
you know I could do it this way where I

1091
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:17,000
just like talk about individual like

1092
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:19,279
places where the tags line up if I was

1093
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,030
to open this up so I say okay you know

1094
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,030
open this up

1095
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:34,590
I can like tag each individual one of

1096
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:37,170
these things based on like which grid

1097
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:41,180
cell it's in you know and I don't

1098
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:50,820
actually know if we've got any way of

1099
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:54,019
quantifying that exactly okay I don't

1100
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,019
see a template for that either

1101
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,720
so if I was to drag this over here and

1102
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:11,920
just do a couple of them so you know

1103
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:13,449
here's one of them so I can see which

1104
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,119
grid cell it's in right we could make a

1105
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:23,879
grid that would sort of align these

1106
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:23,880
things together I don't know

1107
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,230
I'm just not feeling it

1108
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:47,180
I don't think this is a good idea I

1109
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,409
think these should be separate files so

1110
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:51,799
I'm just gonna say that's what we're

1111
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:53,359
gonna do so if I wanted to make these

1112
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,550
separate files and what I'm gonna do is

1113
00:54:53,360 --> 00:55:01,070
say like we've got chairs or something

1114
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:03,110
right or furniture sets like these

1115
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:06,260
things should go together so that we

1116
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:10,070
have like you know for a particular set

1117
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:12,110
we know that you know this and this go

1118
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:13,670
together or something like that so if

1119
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:17,420
we're trying to make like a thing where

1120
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:19,309
they're the same textile or something we

1121
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:23,690
could do that and similarly like you

1122
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:25,340
know yeah like if we had like different

1123
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:27,889
styles of rug they would go together so

1124
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:30,800
you could pick like a variant but I

1125
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:32,539
don't really want one I don't I don't

1126
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,760
like that these are all together because

1127
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:36,440
it's just I'm not sure what advantage

1128
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,760
that would ever give us you don't need

1129
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:41,720
to edit them at the same time because

1130
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:44,480
they're not really related in any

1131
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:46,969
meaningful way you know what I mean so I

1132
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,809
just I don't I'm not feeling it I don't

1133
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:53,149
think we want to actually do that and

1134
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:54,650
the same is probably true for the ground

1135
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:56,450
cover to a certain extent like we

1136
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,820
probably want to just have it be that

1137
00:55:56,449 --> 00:56:01,699
each file for something like ground

1138
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:03,500
cover is just a bunch of random versions

1139
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:06,319
of the same ground cover so that you

1140
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,000
load it in and you just use that as any

1141
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,559
one of these is interchangeable or

1142
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,590
something right so I don't know that's

1143
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:19,369
my feeling on it and I would say that

1144
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:21,230
that means that if I was to open up one

1145
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:23,619
of the item templates so this thing

1146
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:27,139
right

1147
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:28,549
we've got like floor state and warring

1148
00:56:27,139 --> 00:56:31,670
and stuff like that

1149
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:33,980
so what I want to do is say look these

1150
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:36,710
directional things are still gonna be

1151
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:40,010
there and instead these are just

1152
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:41,269
variants going off the side right so you

1153
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,580
know if I want to load one of these

1154
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:45,440
things in what I would do is just say

1155
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:47,750
okay like give me this give me this

1156
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,619
thing and I'm gonna paste it in here

1157
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,619
right

1158
00:56:54,469 --> 00:57:02,129
and I'm gonna stick it up into there

1159
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:05,279
like so and so that's the chair facing

1160
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:07,980
that way and then you know maybe like

1161
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,080
someone can read could redraw this as

1162
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,400
well facing like all the directions so

1163
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,159
that we would have different ways of

1164
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,780
like placing those or whatever of course

1165
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:16,589
I can't see it cuz the is sort of

1166
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,560
there we go

1167
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:28,800
let me just duplicate this layer out a

1168
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:32,869
bit so if I wanted to make another one

1169
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:41,250
of these I could do like transform

1170
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:43,920
rotate ah wrong one right and and it's

1171
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:45,510
not correct but like so then Anna could

1172
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,380
go draw these so that there's they're

1173
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:50,850
probably properly facing all the

1174
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:55,590
different directions but this will at

1175
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:56,269
least let us test it for now why does it

1176
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,019
happen

1177
00:57:56,269 --> 00:58:00,019
alright this way

1178
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:22,330
all right uh so now we have all the

1179
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:24,310
different ones let turn off layer

1180
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:26,559
boundaries because I don't care what the

1181
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:28,989
layer boundaries are and I'm just going

1182
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:32,369
to place these inside the grid cells to

1183
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:32,368
which they are bound

1184
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:48,670
don't really know how to even that out

1185
00:58:41,429 --> 00:58:51,369
yeah I do fear that these are maybe not

1186
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,349
leaving enough empty space around them

1187
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:54,659
but that's okay

1188
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:56,949
we should really add that padding that

1189
00:58:54,659 --> 00:59:01,329
should have really been our problem not

1190
00:58:56,949 --> 00:59:04,989
not the artists all right

1191
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:07,329
so like if you imagine that's the state

1192
00:59:04,989 --> 00:59:10,149
of things what I'm also gonna do is say

1193
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:14,199
let's suppose there's a variance as well

1194
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:18,269
so let's just pretend and actually now

1195
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:18,269
that I got its merge these down right

1196
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:28,870
let's pretend that we want to have a

1197
00:59:24,579 --> 00:59:30,279
second set of these and I'm gonna I'm

1198
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:35,589
just gonna drag that over and this is

1199
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:38,050
just to make the variance of these that

1200
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:43,950
we again so that we can test you know

1201
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:43,950
what's going on there right so let's

1202
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:59,318
it seems good right and so let's test

1203
00:59:55,958 --> 01:00:00,969
this by saying suppose we made one of

1204
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:04,259
these other variants here

1205
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:09,400
what is hue chroma that's a new slider

1206
01:00:04,259 --> 01:00:12,068
interesting let's just change the color

1207
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:16,108
of these right so you know it's it's

1208
01:00:12,068 --> 01:00:19,989
like hey there's there's the red chairs

1209
01:00:16,108 --> 01:00:22,838
and there's the green chairs and that's

1210
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:27,249
just what there is so you know don't

1211
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:32,978
don't play me about it and then we'll

1212
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:42,838
save that off as that's like suppose I

1213
01:00:32,978 --> 01:00:42,838
should delete this underlying piece here

1214
01:00:42,929 --> 01:00:48,429
and then merge these alright so now

1215
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:51,188
we've got something that's effectively a

1216
01:00:48,429 --> 01:00:56,019
PNG for the chair and that would allow

1217
01:00:51,188 --> 01:00:59,199
us to test importing that as an item and

1218
01:00:56,018 --> 01:01:01,358
I think we don't really want to call it

1219
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:03,400
an item I think we want to call it like

1220
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:05,168
a decoration or something so I think

1221
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,869
what we want to do is is call this

1222
01:01:05,168 --> 01:01:09,400
something else so you know we've got

1223
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:12,130
items and those are things that you can

1224
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:15,068
like wear or pick up right and then so

1225
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:19,858
this is not an item with this more is is

1226
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:19,858
just a like a decoration so this is like

1227
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:27,219
I don't know something you place in the

1228
01:01:22,989 --> 01:01:29,858
world that you know has potentially and

1229
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:34,199
orientation to it and variant so it's

1230
01:01:29,858 --> 01:01:36,429
orientation invariant I would call it

1231
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:41,389
maybe

1232
01:01:36,429 --> 01:01:42,859
as a post you know obstacle is again a

1233
01:01:41,389 --> 01:01:44,750
little rough because we don't know that

1234
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:53,390
it's an obstacle so I don't know if it's

1235
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:56,420
maybe like just scenery let's say does

1236
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:59,750
that work for n does anyone care about

1237
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:07,150
that I don't know so I want to call it

1238
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:07,150
scenery chair I guess orphanage chair

1239
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:13,550
and I don't know like this is the the

1240
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:14,750
naming convention it looks like it

1241
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:17,000
wouldn't start at 1:00 it starts at 1:00

1242
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:21,559
that was being used so you know maybe

1243
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:27,230
that's maybe that's that right so let's

1244
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:29,469
export that out and we'll say that there

1245
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:32,000
is no such thing as obstacles anymore

1246
01:02:29,469 --> 01:02:33,289
looking at this you know maybe I want to

1247
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,380
create a couple more of these for

1248
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:39,590
testing purposes right I'm gonna have

1249
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:42,769
these get remade so you know we'll see

1250
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:47,230
but so let's suppose that we want to do

1251
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:51,170
like you know the area rug or something

1252
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:53,240
or the lamp so if I wanted to do one of

1253
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:55,010
those sorts of things I could say like

1254
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:57,319
alright let's let's grab the lamp out

1255
01:02:55,010 --> 01:03:00,020
there's only one of these right it's

1256
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:10,010
just the lamp there's nothing else to it

1257
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:16,849
so if I if I grab this one and paste it

1258
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:22,640
in here I'm gonna put it up in the

1259
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:25,849
corner like so and then we'll just save

1260
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:32,210
that out I'll get rid of this and say

1261
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:34,779
looks for that as a ping and that can be

1262
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,780
like a lamp

1263
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:43,059
and maybe you know I don't know maybe I

1264
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:48,429
should have said there was a variant but

1265
01:03:43,059 --> 01:03:51,309
I I don't know floor lamp versus table

1266
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:53,769
lamps seems different really this should

1267
01:03:51,309 --> 01:03:56,500
have been two things one it should have

1268
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:58,269
been like a lamp and then a table and we

1269
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:02,920
can use them both so we probably want to

1270
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:05,650
split those out eventually but who cares

1271
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,840
so anyway I'm gonna say that that's

1272
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:09,519
what's going on with that and then if I

1273
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,320
load up some of this other stuff here so

1274
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:14,380
let me load up like obstacles for us to

1275
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:16,059
see what's up with that so if we look at

1276
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:19,720
what's going on here what you can see is

1277
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:23,559
it's sort of like we have some seasonal

1278
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:27,209
things sort of happening here right and

1279
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:27,210
there's like different kinds of trees

1280
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:36,460
and I'm not sure how we want to I'm not

1281
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:39,150
sure how we want to characterize that

1282
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,150
really

1283
01:04:56,059 --> 01:05:01,019
we may just want this to be a generic

1284
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:02,608
kind of thing that's like foliage and it

1285
01:05:01,019 --> 01:05:16,130
has like two parameters like

1286
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:24,449
snow-covered right and snow-covered and

1287
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:28,380
bear in I don't know you can kind of see

1288
01:05:24,449 --> 01:05:37,139
like there's different things you may

1289
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:40,740
want drawn there and yeah I'm not really

1290
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:42,239
sure about that so you can see here

1291
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:46,229
we've got like snow covered as a

1292
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:49,799
parameter right and I don't really know

1293
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:53,309
exactly what this was like it's kind of

1294
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:57,869
gray and weird is it dead this might be

1295
01:05:53,309 --> 01:06:03,329
dead death possibly I'm not sure or

1296
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:04,920
burnt so we've got snow covered burnt

1297
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:06,960
and we've also got like the degree of

1298
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,550
foliage so there's a couple different

1299
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,840
variants for trees and they seem pretty

1300
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:15,619
specific to trees so it seems like we

1301
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:18,720
would want a specific tree thing right

1302
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:21,570
so I'm not sure about that that one

1303
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:23,909
seems harder let me take a look at the

1304
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:26,280
items I think they're just fine cuz

1305
01:06:23,909 --> 01:06:31,739
they're just already yeah this is like

1306
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:35,450
worn on the ground right I'm not sure

1307
01:06:31,739 --> 01:06:35,449
what that was else was in that template

1308
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:42,970
it's like two different on the floor

1309
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:46,320
versions I'm not sure why there are two

1310
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:46,319
on the floor versions

1311
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:59,460
I'm not sure what I had contemplated for

1312
01:06:56,519 --> 01:07:01,500
that but usually most things would just

1313
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,159
have one floor state and then a worn

1314
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,550
state

1315
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:09,899
that'd be my assumption I don't know

1316
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:12,840
what floor state to is about but I guess

1317
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,760
maybe I had something in mind so those

1318
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,940
will just load what else we got

1319
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,570
so let's go to ground cover and see

1320
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,570
what's up at that

1321
01:07:20,929 --> 01:07:25,379
so inside ground cover and I'm just so I

1322
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:29,190
can see it I'm gonna make a new layer

1323
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:33,630
here and I'm gonna make it just pure

1324
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:37,619
white for the moment so or I was gonna

1325
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:40,380
try to there we go and I'm just gonna go

1326
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:43,019
like this and so now we can look in here

1327
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:46,619
and see so if you look at what's going

1328
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:50,009
on here I feel like to a large extent

1329
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:52,799
there's sort of two separate types of

1330
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:56,250
thing in here and well three I guess

1331
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:58,830
pebbles is one two so I think we just

1332
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:02,519
really just need to separate these into

1333
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:05,309
two categories of the grass clump and

1334
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:09,119
like splotch right these are tiny and

1335
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:12,299
this is bigger and then we've got sort

1336
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:16,920
of a stones thing and I think those just

1337
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:19,829
want to be separated out right so I

1338
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:23,130
would say these are a sort of particle

1339
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:25,409
ish so my guess is these want to be just

1340
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:27,659
particles kind of like like we just have

1341
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:30,019
one thing for particle and that's it I

1342
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:33,689
don't think we need anything else

1343
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:43,940
probably for that so my assumption here

1344
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:43,939
is we would just do like okay take

1345
01:08:47,810 --> 01:09:11,759
the template like so grab us the stuff

1346
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:16,528
from here so like these four that did

1347
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:24,448
not work because that was on the wrong

1348
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:29,910
layer ah the Photoshop layer paradigm

1349
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:35,039
always never what you want so if I come

1350
01:09:29,909 --> 01:09:37,079
up here and line those up with the grid

1351
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:39,659
and then in here I just grab like one

1352
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:50,119
more of these right and I plopped that

1353
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:50,119
in here nope

1354
01:09:54,789 --> 01:10:00,698
then what I can do is it's pretty faint

1355
01:09:57,609 --> 01:10:05,380
but I can position that like in here

1356
01:10:00,698 --> 01:10:09,698
like so uh and now I've got you know a

1357
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:20,529
file that is let me go ahead and delete

1358
01:10:09,698 --> 01:10:30,908
these layers oops there we go I can just

1359
01:10:20,529 --> 01:10:33,238
export this as like particle something

1360
01:10:30,908 --> 01:10:33,238
like that

1361
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:47,630
sink and then after we got particle

1362
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:53,270
grass I can do one of the other ones

1363
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:57,710
here so whatever these like smaller ones

1364
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:59,270
are here like all of those look fine I

1365
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:02,630
don't know what that is

1366
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:04,280
it looks kind of dead so maybe that

1367
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,630
shouldn't maybe that should not be in

1368
01:11:04,279 --> 01:11:09,170
there that should be like a separate

1369
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:13,250
thing but I'm gonna grab like these

1370
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:16,399
other ones that look like stamps more

1371
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:18,829
like I'm gonna skip so I could also make

1372
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,420
a small grass one but I don't think I

1373
01:11:18,829 --> 01:11:23,840
need it like I don't know that we would

1374
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:26,359
need small grass ones if we have these

1375
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,770
because they're sort of just the same so

1376
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:29,359
I don't know we'll see this is something

1377
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:31,700
that could be worked out with the art a

1378
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:32,960
little bit later too so instead what I'm

1379
01:11:31,699 --> 01:11:35,449
going to do is I'm just gonna grab these

1380
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:39,260
ones that look like splotches to me so

1381
01:11:35,449 --> 01:11:41,960
like these oops

1382
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:45,460
these all look like splotches let me

1383
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,460
come over here and paste those in

1384
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:59,220
and then I'm gonna see about what else

1385
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,220
we got so these look like splotches

1386
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,690
and then we can

1387
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:25,810
get rid of this one and then I want to

1388
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:28,329
just grab like some of these other ones

1389
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:33,450
that look like splotches if there are

1390
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:33,449
any other ones so you know like

1391
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:47,500
I guess these are flowers so they should

1392
01:12:43,149 --> 01:12:52,469
probably be in their own thing so I'm

1393
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:57,239
going to say this is another export as

1394
01:12:52,470 --> 01:13:07,690
and that's gonna be particle like grass

1395
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:09,130
watch or something and all these were

1396
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:10,659
just made for testing so we don't really

1397
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:15,640
know if they're gonna look at alright

1398
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:17,680
but that's okay you know I'm saying it's

1399
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,300
really weird that it changes the size of

1400
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,829
these when you click on them that's just

1401
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:25,739
horrible

1402
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:30,250
anyway so if we now go to the flowers

1403
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:32,710
these are all flowers it looks like so I

1404
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:38,310
should be able to well I probably want

1405
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:38,310
to do just for here paste those in

1406
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:52,059
and then I'll grab the last flower here

1407
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:02,800
and so I'll just drag that over here and

1408
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:02,800
call it a day

1409
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:19,369
all right

1410
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:28,740
so that can be saved as our particle

1411
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:30,390
flowers oh one and again these are ones

1412
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:35,489
where nothing is differentiated it's

1413
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:42,390
just a series of different things you

1414
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:45,000
could use for flowers and that's it and

1415
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:47,420
I guess we've got stones too so we'll do

1416
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,420
that one

1417
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:56,078
as the last one

1418
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:20,869
all right so that gives us plenty of

1419
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:26,510
things to import now and I'm gonna go

1420
01:15:20,869 --> 01:15:28,430
back and say we're gonna we're not gonna

1421
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:32,239
do the trees just yet because I really

1422
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:34,190
don't know what to do with them so I'm

1423
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:36,170
gonna go back in here and make a slight

1424
01:15:34,189 --> 01:15:38,960
change to the way these are going so

1425
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:42,050
we've so we've got the blocks we've got

1426
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:46,789
the orphan bodies and heads and that

1427
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:50,600
stuff I'm gonna take this out of the mix

1428
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:52,100
now because I don't care about that we

1429
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,500
pulled those out into different

1430
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:56,720
particles and again this is gonna be

1431
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,550
someone else's job to make these files

1432
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,590
eventually anyway so we've got the

1433
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:02,630
ground cover separated out into particle

1434
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:04,220
files so I'm just gonna get rid of that

1435
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:07,909
I don't care about ones that I didn't

1436
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:11,840
quite grab so we're gonna get rid of

1437
01:16:07,909 --> 01:16:14,119
cover forests in obstacles forests we're

1438
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,489
gonna leave that and that because we

1439
01:16:14,119 --> 01:16:19,729
haven't pulled necessarily everything

1440
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:22,969
out that we want to try so we've got

1441
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:25,779
scenery as a thing we've got particle as

1442
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:30,800
a thing we've got item as a thing

1443
01:16:25,779 --> 01:16:33,109
obstacles and cover so cover I think we

1444
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,970
now don't have because I deleted the

1445
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:39,559
only thing that was covered right so

1446
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:42,350
cover is gone so obstacles is here but

1447
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:45,430
we don't want to parse it so just to

1448
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:48,440
signify that I'm gonna do that for now

1449
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:50,810
and put them up there just so you can

1450
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:52,969
see that like these are really probably

1451
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:56,300
just gonna get deleted we're not gonna

1452
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:58,730
ever use those and so this is really

1453
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:02,810
what we're gonna parse now is it really

1454
01:16:58,729 --> 01:17:07,250
this back half so items particles and

1455
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:10,490
scenery let's let's do that okay so

1456
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:16,060
moving in here we don't have these

1457
01:17:10,489 --> 01:17:18,979
anymore so these are just gone goodbye

1458
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:21,020
and now we've got these item files so

1459
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:25,189
we've got

1460
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:30,520
them hat a 1o 2o 3 then we've got these

1461
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:30,519
particles oops

1462
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:49,989
and this is going to be particle flowers

1463
01:17:36,039 --> 01:18:00,500
a 1 PNG and these are grass large and

1464
01:17:49,989 --> 01:18:05,269
grass watch I think yeah and then we've

1465
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:08,149
got stones right so we've got flowers

1466
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:10,750
grass large glass parts and stones we're

1467
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:15,339
going to tag these all with something

1468
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:15,340
and then we've got the scenery so

1469
01:18:17,829 --> 01:18:33,229
scenery

1470
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:37,880
Orphanage share and then scenery this is

1471
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:40,069
just a lamp right yeah so these are

1472
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,420
things we want to import here and again

1473
01:18:40,069 --> 01:18:46,099
now we need to like figure out how we

1474
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:49,190
want to tag these when they come in so

1475
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:50,600
when these get imported they're all

1476
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:52,460
gonna have to have some tags associated

1477
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,079
with them so we know what they are and

1478
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,710
that's the part that I'm not sure about

1479
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:58,670
yet

1480
01:18:54,710 --> 01:19:01,189
so off we go obviously these are easy

1481
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,489
they're all hats so we can start with

1482
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:06,619
that

1483
01:19:01,489 --> 01:19:08,809
at least we can also say that they're

1484
01:19:06,619 --> 01:19:10,430
worn might be I don't know if we need

1485
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:13,150
that tag really but you know because the

1486
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:15,800
hat is worn but yes we've got hats and

1487
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:20,479
then the three different hats we've got

1488
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:27,020
sort of like a Sun Hat and we had back

1489
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:29,599
in in our tags we sort of had some ideas

1490
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:32,120
of how these things go like right there

1491
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,250
was like the sort of stuff so I think we

1492
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:37,399
just want these to match so like

1493
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:39,109
this is a cooking hat obviously so I

1494
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:42,769
think this should just be like cook

1495
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:44,469
right and this is like a gardening hat

1496
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:47,600
right so it'd be like an earth hat

1497
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:51,500
probably if that makes sense so that

1498
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:54,110
that hat here right is that kind of hat

1499
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:56,479
and then we had a hat this is it's not

1500
01:19:54,109 --> 01:19:56,960
really a hat it's like a flower but it's

1501
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:01,699
okay

1502
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:07,659
and maybe that's like spring I don't

1503
01:20:01,699 --> 01:20:10,729
know so then if we're on flowers here

1504
01:20:07,659 --> 01:20:13,010
like we've got flowers grass I don't

1505
01:20:10,729 --> 01:20:17,329
know what we want to do with these

1506
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:20,750
exactly because it's a little bit harder

1507
01:20:17,329 --> 01:20:23,409
to say obviously the flowers I'm sorry

1508
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:28,159
the grass should get tagged with grass

1509
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:29,809
that's not hard to understand but

1510
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:33,439
there's like different sort of styles

1511
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:36,110
here of ways in which things are getting

1512
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:42,500
sort of plunked down and so I feel like

1513
01:20:36,109 --> 01:20:44,299
that and probably want to be some sort

1514
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:46,880
of there's gonna be some sort of

1515
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:48,739
differentiation there also grass

1516
01:20:46,880 --> 01:21:02,359
probably there should be flowers as a

1517
01:20:48,739 --> 01:21:05,929
thing as well I don't know how we want

1518
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:07,670
to do this or tag size so you can tag

1519
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:10,730
things like with a size like how big of

1520
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:15,680
a splotch type of thing or do you want

1521
01:21:10,729 --> 01:21:17,419
to put down maybe right so something

1522
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:20,960
like that so you know this is like a

1523
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:25,159
size two and you know or this is like a

1524
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:29,420
size one and this is like a size 0.5 you

1525
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:32,149
know what I mean just just something

1526
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:37,369
like that and so here this would be like

1527
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:38,719
flowers splotches right so there that's

1528
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:42,439
sort of a little bit different and then

1529
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:45,770
here we would have stone and these are

1530
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:50,210
splotches as well that seems reasonable

1531
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:52,010
I guess I don't have a lot of knowledge

1532
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:53,329
of how we're gonna really do this as we

1533
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:56,180
sort of moving forwards it's all just

1534
01:21:53,329 --> 01:21:59,319
kind of like well let's try this if I

1535
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:59,320
add those here

1536
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:14,810
yeah I don't think we had like any sort

1537
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:16,279
of thing for tag like for a sizing tag

1538
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:18,860
like something that sort of said the

1539
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:21,079
largeness of something but I think we do

1540
01:22:18,859 --> 01:22:23,389
want that so put that in there so we've

1541
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:25,399
got that and then we're down to some

1542
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:32,050
stuff here like the chair and the lamp

1543
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:34,689
I feel like do we have like orphan maybe

1544
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:39,800
like these go with the orphanage right

1545
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:47,479
it's man-made talking if there's

1546
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:49,100
anything else we want you here so I

1547
01:22:47,479 --> 01:22:56,269
think we just need like extra tags for

1548
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:57,620
these so this is chair and I feel like

1549
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:59,330
this should be specified as like an

1550
01:22:57,619 --> 01:23:02,510
orphanage because they specifically go

1551
01:22:59,329 --> 01:23:05,569
in this area I don't know that seems

1552
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:08,030
like a good plan but we'll see as we go

1553
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:11,679
forward right so in here I'm gonna go

1554
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:16,609
ahead and just grab these tags out and

1555
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:22,240
we will say that we've got chair and

1556
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:22,239
lamp I think that's it

1557
01:23:22,779 --> 01:23:29,979
that seems like everything at the moment

1558
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,979
anyway

1559
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:38,440
and so now what I really need to do is

1560
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:40,719
change up how we're ingesting these

1561
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:42,638
because what we want is now the

1562
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:44,859
previously you know we knew about item

1563
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,150
and previously we have like cover and

1564
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:48,009
obstacles we don't want that we want

1565
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:50,589
particle and scenery those are the two

1566
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:52,810
things that looks like we want so in the

1567
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:53,980
importer where those were stubbed out we

1568
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:56,020
just gonna change what we're actually

1569
01:23:53,979 --> 01:23:57,759
looking for you can see that happening

1570
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:00,460
right in here right you know it's item

1571
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,210
obstacles plate blah blah blah and so

1572
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:08,408
we're not actually gonna be doing this

1573
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:13,929
and these are wrong so we want like for

1574
01:24:08,408 --> 01:24:21,009
example particle like so and then

1575
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:25,658
scenery like so and we set ourselves up

1576
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:28,389
for success here I think maybe in that

1577
01:24:25,658 --> 01:24:30,039
these just work or should just work and

1578
01:24:28,389 --> 01:24:32,020
so this error is just going to tell us

1579
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:34,380
hey we changed what those tag types are

1580
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:37,119
so maybe you should go fix them right

1581
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:39,340
and let's go ahead and do that now so if

1582
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:41,439
we look at where these are coming in

1583
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:44,909
they're in the asset system or they're

1584
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:48,759
marked up I believe yeah right here

1585
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:50,469
so we want like the cover tags and like

1586
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:52,780
all that stuff this needs to change now

1587
01:24:50,469 --> 01:24:54,399
so that's particle tags and this needs

1588
01:24:52,779 --> 01:24:56,229
to change the scenery tags and then we

1589
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:58,448
need to actually specify them because

1590
01:24:56,229 --> 01:25:00,759
these were getting done when we

1591
01:24:58,448 --> 01:25:02,799
initialize the asset system right now I

1592
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:04,300
don't think anyone actually fills out

1593
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,610
any of those you can see right here

1594
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:08,590
we've got those sort of stubbed out as

1595
01:25:06,609 --> 01:25:10,599
functions I don't think they do anything

1596
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:14,100
at the moment so I want to be able to do

1597
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:19,239
like create particle tag grid and

1598
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:21,909
señorita grid and if I actually jump to

1599
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:24,879
one of those things like what does it

1600
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:27,759
create cover tag grid or arc cover tag

1601
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,529
grid there uh so we look in here we just

1602
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,630
got to do's right it's like hey you've

1603
01:25:29,529 --> 01:25:35,050
got to put in something into this tag

1604
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:37,440
grid so this one's pretty easy I think

1605
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:40,029
what we can do is just say alright if we

1606
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:45,009
you know create one of these things like

1607
01:25:40,029 --> 01:25:52,960
so by default we're gonna do with

1608
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:56,619
the with the particle tag grid is it's

1609
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:59,859
just four and four right we're just

1610
01:25:56,619 --> 01:26:01,960
we're not doing 8x8 so we're just doing

1611
01:25:59,859 --> 01:26:05,739
four and four they're smaller

1612
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:08,079
imports and what we want to do is just

1613
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:10,829
tag them as variants so there is no

1614
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:14,500
facing direction it's just a variance

1615
01:26:10,829 --> 01:26:21,159
right and this should be like an art

1616
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:25,119
part asset particle I think I want to

1617
01:26:21,159 --> 01:26:29,859
look and see where where coops where

1618
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:31,899
we're actually saying that so here's the

1619
01:26:29,859 --> 01:26:34,059
basic categories and you can see all

1620
01:26:31,899 --> 01:26:35,859
this stuff a lot of these we could

1621
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:38,920
collapse down they don't need to be here

1622
01:26:35,859 --> 01:26:42,039
anymore but I'm gonna go ahead and say

1623
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:43,630
there's a particle category scenerio

1624
01:26:42,039 --> 01:26:45,369
well and you know what I don't even have

1625
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:47,739
to do that and just do this because

1626
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:51,460
we're not using these so cover became

1627
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:53,679
particle obstacle became scenery and so

1628
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:56,109
asset particle is actually what it is

1629
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:58,990
it's gonna be a tag variant the variance

1630
01:26:56,109 --> 01:27:09,339
just gonna be whatever the variant is

1631
01:26:58,989 --> 01:27:14,710
right and that's it I don't think we

1632
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:17,289
actually need to do this it's just for

1633
01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:20,199
each one that's what it is right we

1634
01:27:17,289 --> 01:27:23,019
don't touch the other ones uh and I

1635
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:23,920
think that just works I think you know

1636
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:28,960
famous last words

1637
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:31,630
oh and we'll check this particle these

1638
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:35,289
could just be a nice look up later you

1639
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:36,880
can sort of see that happening you know

1640
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:39,460
probably not worth bothering at the

1641
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,020
moment but eventually we could collapse

1642
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:44,489
all these down and maybe we should do

1643
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:44,490
that sometime soon

1644
01:27:45,569 --> 01:27:55,779
alright so looking through here this is

1645
01:27:50,649 --> 01:27:58,569
art particle tags this is art scenery

1646
01:27:55,779 --> 01:28:03,069
tags we now need to do the ones for the

1647
01:27:58,569 --> 01:28:06,578
items and for the scenery let's go ahead

1648
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:15,578
and do those so if I jump back to in

1649
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:19,599
pork on the scenery tag grid and so both

1650
01:28:15,578 --> 01:28:24,099
the scenery tag and the item tag are

1651
01:28:19,599 --> 01:28:27,340
both directional so we do want to keep

1652
01:28:24,099 --> 01:28:30,310
this sort of the thing that we were

1653
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:34,199
using for hands that's the template we

1654
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:36,760
want to use for both of these right

1655
01:28:34,198 --> 01:28:39,669
because we do want to set that facing

1656
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:42,099
direction at the entire time now we

1657
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:47,199
don't need to do asset import grid max

1658
01:28:42,099 --> 01:28:53,860
we only do a 4x4 like so and so for each

1659
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:56,019
of these we also can just do this and so

1660
01:28:53,859 --> 01:28:59,500
the 4x4 to get set up with the facing

1661
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:01,570
direction as it should and for the item

1662
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:04,599
tag grid I believe we can just do asset

1663
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:06,849
item here and asset scenery here and

1664
01:29:04,599 --> 01:29:08,980
that takes care of itself but what we

1665
01:29:06,849 --> 01:29:11,289
need to do now is say alright when we're

1666
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:13,089
doing the facing direction we also need

1667
01:29:11,289 --> 01:29:14,979
to do something about the x coordinate

1668
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:17,760
because each of the x coordinates is

1669
01:29:14,979 --> 01:29:24,879
actually a little bit different right

1670
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:27,880
you know like we're gonna specify a

1671
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:29,469
different tag for each of these so in

1672
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:32,050
here we're gonna want to do a thing

1673
01:29:29,469 --> 01:29:35,289
where we say look if the X is 0 or if

1674
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:37,480
it's 1 or if it's 2 or if it's 3 we're

1675
01:29:35,289 --> 01:29:40,479
gonna add different things now we don't

1676
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:42,218
really want to use 3 because there isn't

1677
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:45,039
anything in the third row yet as far as

1678
01:29:42,219 --> 01:29:47,469
we know so we really just want to do

1679
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:52,979
something like this probably where we're

1680
01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:52,980
just adding a tag for these

1681
01:29:53,840 --> 01:30:00,600
and so in the first one this was like on

1682
01:29:56,819 --> 01:30:02,759
floor right you know I don't know what

1683
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:06,390
we want to tag that with this one is

1684
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:08,970
like worn and this one I guess we don't

1685
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:12,240
really know I don't know what that

1686
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:14,100
variant is but so I think I guess what

1687
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:17,809
we want to do is tag this with variant

1688
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:24,329
as well so you know I guess it's like

1689
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:32,039
hey case 0 case 1 is the same and falls

1690
01:30:24,329 --> 01:30:38,880
through I guess something like this

1691
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:51,050
should probably just actually do this so

1692
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:54,779
this one's like worn you know I'm saying

1693
01:30:51,050 --> 01:31:05,579
and here we're gonna add the it's on the

1694
01:30:54,779 --> 01:31:07,199
floor and here this is the variant one

1695
01:31:05,579 --> 01:31:10,979
as opposed to the variant 0

1696
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:13,559
I guess so not 100% sure like what that

1697
01:31:10,979 --> 01:31:15,659
was supposed to accomplish exactly so

1698
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:17,910
it's something like that for the scenery

1699
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:20,430
tag grid it's a little bit simpler it's

1700
01:31:17,909 --> 01:31:22,920
always the same stuff the facing

1701
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:27,230
direction is set off the Y the variant

1702
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,230
is set off the X so it's just like

1703
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:34,820
actually should just kept this

1704
01:31:31,949 --> 01:31:34,819
it's literally this

1705
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:47,910
right so I guess that seems good maybe

1706
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,279
you know I don't know you know now I

1707
01:31:47,909 --> 01:31:53,250
think about to this variant here really

1708
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:57,869
should just be it should be divided by

1709
01:31:53,250 --> 01:32:00,449
16 right so this should this should be

1710
01:31:57,869 --> 01:32:03,449
more like this because we want them to

1711
01:32:00,449 --> 01:32:05,010
be normalized to one just to make it

1712
01:32:03,449 --> 01:32:06,149
easier for us to randomly pick them we

1713
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:07,920
wouldn't have to know how many there are

1714
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:09,809
we can just pick things in the range of

1715
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,739
0 to 1 and it'll always work no matter

1716
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:12,810
how many there are right

1717
01:32:10,739 --> 01:32:17,309
so for variance I think we do want to do

1718
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:18,750
something more like this right and you

1719
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:24,120
know that way we always ensure that

1720
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:27,119
they're they're normalized that although

1721
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:28,979
that does put a slightly if you're using

1722
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:31,559
rounding that's not exactly what you

1723
01:32:28,979 --> 01:32:34,500
want you actually want it to be divided

1724
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:37,410
by the maximum you can get to if you

1725
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:40,199
want to end it one so mmm you know like

1726
01:32:37,409 --> 01:32:46,079
man I'm not sure how you want to strike

1727
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:51,119
those right you probably want to

1728
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:53,340
actually bucket them so in use

1729
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:55,199
truncation so I don't know we have to

1730
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:57,090
sort of think about that that variant

1731
01:32:55,199 --> 01:33:01,529
tagging is gonna have to get thought

1732
01:32:57,090 --> 01:33:05,010
about harder at some point you know but

1733
01:33:01,529 --> 01:33:07,139
point being that is the more like bucket

1734
01:33:05,010 --> 01:33:09,720
oriented variant if you assumed you were

1735
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:11,850
like truncating since we're taking

1736
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:13,260
distances not truncating currently you

1737
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:15,420
know it's not what you would actually

1738
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:17,159
want to do what you actually I do is

1739
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,329
space them out as like beacons

1740
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:21,059
throughout the space that have an equal

1741
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:23,729
slot thing amount on either side of them

1742
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:28,350
so you know 0 the first variant

1743
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:30,359
shouldn't be 0 right and so you know

1744
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:33,079
just to sort of sketch out what I'm

1745
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:33,079
talking about here

1746
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:40,310
in terms of making variants maybe work

1747
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:42,319
with distance a little bit better what

1748
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:44,840
you would want to do is say well one of

1749
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:47,689
them should be you know you kind of want

1750
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:50,000
to divide up into thirds right and one

1751
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:53,689
of them should be occupying the the

1752
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,369
range that's like you know from 0 to 0.5

1753
01:33:53,689 --> 01:33:57,710
it's right in the middle of that and the

1754
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:59,779
other one should be from from 0.5 to up

1755
01:33:57,710 --> 01:34:01,609
in the threatened mo of that right and

1756
01:33:59,779 --> 01:34:03,979
so yeah it's a little bit complicated

1757
01:34:01,609 --> 01:34:06,679
but so point being we probably would

1758
01:34:03,979 --> 01:34:10,069
want something looks more like this that

1759
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:12,409
way when you do what's closest from 0 to

1760
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:14,840
0.5 you're closest to this variant and

1761
01:34:12,409 --> 01:34:17,659
from 0.5 to 1 you're closest to this

1762
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,270
variant right and we don't really care

1763
01:34:17,659 --> 01:34:22,939
about breaking a tie so I don't know

1764
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:27,800
that seems like maybe the more correct

1765
01:34:22,939 --> 01:34:29,509
variant version so if I look at where we

1766
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:31,489
were setting those before so in here

1767
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:35,570
right same thing is going to be true

1768
01:34:31,488 --> 01:34:38,179
what you want to do here is say look we

1769
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:43,969
need to divide the space up so that we

1770
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:45,980
properly are shifted up by half of the

1771
01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:48,170
range and then we go up by the range

1772
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:49,519
each time so instead of something that

1773
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:53,960
looks like this what we really need to

1774
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:56,570
do is add in half of that total range so

1775
01:34:53,960 --> 01:35:05,199
if 1/16 is the amount that we go up each

1776
01:34:56,569 --> 01:35:08,599
time we want you know like a shift that

1777
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:11,329
produces that offset right so something

1778
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,100
like this and that just shifts the range

1779
01:35:11,329 --> 01:35:15,800
up so that everybody has the same amount

1780
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:17,360
of like ground they're covered again

1781
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:19,100
just sketching this in we don't have to

1782
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:20,869
do it we can look at this in more detail

1783
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:25,220
later we don't have to really think it

1784
01:35:20,869 --> 01:35:27,519
through particularly much here I could

1785
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:34,239
also just compute this off of the grid

1786
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:34,239
it's not necessary to do it

1787
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:38,550
right this is you can make this a

1788
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:42,960
completely parallelizable loop if you

1789
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:45,150
want to so anyway coming back down if

1790
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:50,279
you're looking at sort of like the the

1791
01:35:45,149 --> 01:35:53,849
other stuff we've got we are inside the

1792
01:35:50,279 --> 01:35:55,109
art item tag grid looks like

1793
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:56,760
everything's fine there except we

1794
01:35:55,109 --> 01:36:00,630
haven't defined one of these yet I don't

1795
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:03,619
think there is one already for clothes

1796
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:03,619
thing

1797
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:36,759
so I think we need to just add that in

1798
01:36:20,710 --> 01:36:36,760
right where's my array there it is

1799
01:36:40,359 --> 01:36:49,670
all right so Warren gets thrown in there

1800
01:36:47,109 --> 01:36:52,009
automatically for that one it's like if

1801
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:55,850
someone has put this on you know that

1802
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:57,770
tag you'll get get activated for scenery

1803
01:36:55,850 --> 01:37:01,490
we just have facing Direction invariant

1804
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:04,100
I think that's it and cover is just a

1805
01:37:01,489 --> 01:37:06,139
particle is just a set of variants I

1806
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:08,450
don't think there's anything else to it

1807
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:10,850
so I think those should now just import

1808
01:37:08,449 --> 01:37:13,010
all of those art assets correctly I

1809
01:37:10,850 --> 01:37:16,070
don't know that there's anything else we

1810
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:17,480
actually need to do to make them work we

1811
01:37:16,069 --> 01:37:20,449
can obviously see if that's true I could

1812
01:37:17,479 --> 01:37:22,819
be completely wrong about that let's go

1813
01:37:20,449 --> 01:37:26,359
ahead and and try it and then you know

1814
01:37:22,819 --> 01:37:28,039
if it rolls over and dies it does that

1815
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:30,559
kind of did look like it rolled over and

1816
01:37:28,039 --> 01:37:33,229
died because it didn't do anything yeah

1817
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:39,020
so unrecognized tag name hat and then

1818
01:37:33,229 --> 01:37:40,729
recognized well actually that major

1819
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:48,260
speakers not there so it looks like hat

1820
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:51,619
was never never specified so what would

1821
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:55,570
is that hat just goes I guess we just

1822
01:37:51,619 --> 01:37:55,569
need that here right it's just a tag

1823
01:38:00,539 --> 01:38:07,539
we'll see how that does probably no

1824
01:38:04,090 --> 01:38:11,260
better but hey we can Li see what the

1825
01:38:07,539 --> 01:38:15,279
era's are so if I run this

1826
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:19,539
oh well that did spent some time so it

1827
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:21,579
looks like it did actually update now so

1828
01:38:19,539 --> 01:38:24,130
hopefully now we've got those in here to

1829
01:38:21,579 --> 01:38:25,840
play with and you know if I do a dump

1830
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:26,680
just to see if that's the case missed I

1831
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,199
don't know I'm saying I don't think

1832
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:32,680
fifteen minutes left if I do a dump just

1833
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:34,449
to see what actually happened there so

1834
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:39,090
here's that same dump that I ran before

1835
01:38:34,449 --> 01:38:44,920
I'm do it again what just happened oh

1836
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:46,840
I'm in the wrong directory so if I redo

1837
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:51,119
that dump and then I look at it here I

1838
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:53,770
should see appended to the end of this I

1839
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:57,819
should have got some new assets in here

1840
01:38:53,770 --> 01:39:01,170
right uh let's see I don't really know

1841
01:38:57,819 --> 01:39:01,170
this doesn't look promising

1842
01:39:13,328 --> 01:39:17,529
I'm not sure why there are these sort of

1843
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:19,029
fonts sitting around in there maybe they

1844
01:39:17,529 --> 01:39:22,029
were just from being updated but that's

1845
01:39:19,029 --> 01:39:30,488
not great but looking at here these

1846
01:39:22,029 --> 01:39:33,399
actually do look somewhat great all of

1847
01:39:30,488 --> 01:39:37,289
this looks real nice so all of that

1848
01:39:33,399 --> 01:39:37,289
importing did seem pretty good

1849
01:39:47,838 --> 01:39:51,729
you know think these just kind of stack

1850
01:39:49,429 --> 01:39:53,599
up there unfortunately it's not great

1851
01:39:51,729 --> 01:39:55,189
again I think that's where we might want

1852
01:39:53,599 --> 01:40:05,119
to clean up some of that code so this

1853
01:39:55,189 --> 01:40:06,219
stuff looks fine right all that looks

1854
01:40:05,118 --> 01:40:15,139
fine to me

1855
01:40:06,219 --> 01:40:21,498
so that's all well and good no real

1856
01:40:15,139 --> 01:40:23,118
problem there let's go ahead and take a

1857
01:40:21,498 --> 01:40:26,418
look at what else you could do here that

1858
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:27,948
might make some sense so let's try if we

1859
01:40:26,418 --> 01:40:35,088
wanted to put one of these in the world

1860
01:40:27,948 --> 01:40:36,678
I don't really want to try the ground

1861
01:40:35,088 --> 01:40:38,479
cover yet because that sort of a

1862
01:40:36,679 --> 01:40:41,989
separate system will have to sort of put

1863
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:46,429
in there so what I'd rather do is if we

1864
01:40:41,988 --> 01:40:49,638
went to lava the most straightforward

1865
01:40:46,429 --> 01:40:52,038
thing we could do right is I guess when

1866
01:40:49,639 --> 01:40:57,139
you add a player you know that's gonna

1867
01:40:52,038 --> 01:41:04,458
construct this thing we could add a hat

1868
01:40:57,139 --> 01:41:09,439
on there right so that would be here

1869
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:13,158
actually I just want to see if we can

1870
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:17,510
load this thing up so the asset type

1871
01:41:13,158 --> 01:41:19,608
here is going to be an asset item we're

1872
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:22,519
gonna have to fuss with this stuff a

1873
01:41:19,609 --> 01:41:25,819
little bit I'm not sure how we want all

1874
01:41:22,519 --> 01:41:28,099
that to work but when we actually create

1875
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:30,919
that Hat piece we're gonna need an item

1876
01:41:28,099 --> 01:41:32,359
there and this actually brings up a nice

1877
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:34,760
thing that we can maybe this is what we

1878
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:38,629
can do tomorrow that I wanted to fix is

1879
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:40,248
that the tags are uniform so like you

1880
01:41:38,628 --> 01:41:42,198
can't set different tags and different

1881
01:41:40,248 --> 01:41:44,059
little pieces I have a plan of how I

1882
01:41:42,198 --> 01:41:45,078
wanted to fix some of that and do it a

1883
01:41:44,059 --> 01:41:48,529
little bit differently than it's being

1884
01:41:45,078 --> 01:41:50,088
done in a way that thinks better so we

1885
01:41:48,529 --> 01:41:51,618
can talk about that a little bit later

1886
01:41:50,088 --> 01:41:52,639
but well like we first to just say okay

1887
01:41:51,618 --> 01:41:55,518
when we add with these players how can

1888
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:57,618
we get like a hat on there right because

1889
01:41:55,519 --> 01:41:59,739
right now I'm not seeing one right let

1890
01:41:57,618 --> 01:41:59,738
me

1891
01:42:03,149 --> 01:42:08,920
so if you look like there's no it's just

1892
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:10,510
the those two pieces right so the

1893
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:14,279
question is like where what's the

1894
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:17,530
problem why can't we get an asset item

1895
01:42:14,279 --> 01:42:19,090
for that hat pulled in here right

1896
01:42:17,529 --> 01:42:23,559
because we should be able to find like

1897
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:26,349
something and and I don't know we could

1898
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,940
we could put tag worn in there as well

1899
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:29,440
but again we shouldn't really have to

1900
01:42:27,939 --> 01:42:34,000
because it should find something it

1901
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:36,269
should find a hat I would think so let's

1902
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:44,408
try to see why if I create some code

1903
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:47,170
really quickly just to make it easy for

1904
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:54,179
me to find when that happens right so

1905
01:42:47,170 --> 01:43:02,739
you know when we do oh wait I forgot

1906
01:42:54,179 --> 01:43:10,329
it's not attached so I want to attach

1907
01:43:02,738 --> 01:43:12,519
this to top of head right so that's

1908
01:43:10,329 --> 01:43:14,309
probably what I screwed up I didn't

1909
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:17,500
actually connect that piece to anything

1910
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:19,530
so I may not actually have to do the

1911
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:23,170
test that I thought I was going to do

1912
01:43:19,529 --> 01:43:26,559
but we'll see yeah I still do right it's

1913
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:28,599
not all right so let me go ahead and set

1914
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,250
a breakpoint in something convenient so

1915
01:43:28,599 --> 01:43:32,800
we can take a look at it

1916
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:34,689
I do or you know what it could be that

1917
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,190
top of head is also just not set so I

1918
01:43:34,689 --> 01:43:38,488
should I should just actually set these

1919
01:43:36,189 --> 01:43:41,259
alignment points first just to make sure

1920
01:43:38,488 --> 01:43:42,339
that that's not an issue it could be

1921
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:45,429
that it just can't find that alignment

1922
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:48,989
point right so let me just do due

1923
01:43:45,429 --> 01:43:54,578
diligence here we'll pick one of these

1924
01:43:48,988 --> 01:43:59,919
right here and I need to

1925
01:43:54,578 --> 01:44:01,988
add an alignment point for that so it

1926
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,059
would be called top-of-head okay and

1927
01:44:01,988 --> 01:44:05,888
look there it is

1928
01:44:04,059 --> 01:44:07,659
so it would be called top-of-head I

1929
01:44:05,889 --> 01:44:11,969
don't really know where it would go

1930
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:13,960
exactly it looks like it's sort of wrong

1931
01:44:11,969 --> 01:44:15,698
picking the wrong facing direction

1932
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:17,050
though so I don't know if maybe we've

1933
01:44:15,698 --> 01:44:18,279
got the facing directions a little bit

1934
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:22,389
wrong on those items or something like

1935
01:44:18,279 --> 01:44:28,179
that let's take a look but hey it does

1936
01:44:22,389 --> 01:44:31,480
work taking a look at at this that needs

1937
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:33,908
a default - to do alignment for it but

1938
01:44:31,479 --> 01:44:35,618
at the moment we don't really care if I

1939
01:44:33,908 --> 01:44:42,029
look at the facing directions on the

1940
01:44:35,618 --> 01:44:42,029
right so let me pick the other one here

1941
01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:55,690
there's that top of head

1942
01:45:04,029 --> 01:45:07,739
and finally

1943
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:22,619
there we go so each of these has a top

1944
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:25,470
of head now and I can save that so if I

1945
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:29,010
want to save the hhd in theory

1946
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:30,869
everything worked Hey look it didn't

1947
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:32,850
change these two which is great because

1948
01:45:30,869 --> 01:45:34,409
we didn't want it to but if we did

1949
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:37,530
change this one which is it should have

1950
01:45:34,409 --> 01:45:39,090
right and so now like again we're just

1951
01:45:37,529 --> 01:45:41,130
trying to figure out how well the system

1952
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:42,750
works at all it looks like it kind of

1953
01:45:41,130 --> 01:45:44,180
does there a little bit but it looks

1954
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:48,420
like the facing direction because that

1955
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:53,390
should have been one that flower but it

1956
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:55,710
wasn't and so I don't really know how to

1957
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:57,300
investigate that further without I

1958
01:45:55,710 --> 01:46:00,329
probably said some very much don't look

1959
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:05,300
at it but so if we look at the item

1960
01:46:00,329 --> 01:46:07,350
template here if I open this up and hmm

1961
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:09,800
well I'll be honest I can tell it's

1962
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:09,800
wrong already

1963
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:16,320
yeah these just aren't right so if we

1964
01:46:13,529 --> 01:46:19,619
look at the way this one works if I go

1965
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:21,960
to the template here you can see it's

1966
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:24,779
supposed to be going that way and it so

1967
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:27,470
totally definitely isn't right like it's

1968
01:46:24,779 --> 01:46:30,840
actually this direction that's this one

1969
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:32,699
so so it's just wrong so again I think

1970
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,710
we're fine I think it's the actual

1971
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:37,019
source aren't there that's wrong I will

1972
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:40,680
say one odd thing that I don't

1973
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:43,380
understand is why do we not get one for

1974
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:48,000
the downward Direction like what's going

1975
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:50,100
on there right that makes me a little

1976
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:54,569
uncomfortable I don't understand why

1977
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:56,310
we're not getting a downward right I

1978
01:46:54,569 --> 01:46:59,609
mean we've got there isn't at the top of

1979
01:46:56,310 --> 01:47:04,640
there is a top of head attachment point

1980
01:46:59,609 --> 01:47:08,839
there you know we're looking at it and

1981
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:13,320
yet for some reason that that one

1982
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:15,869
doesn't actually show up and the facing

1983
01:47:13,319 --> 01:47:18,630
Direction there right it is the only

1984
01:47:15,869 --> 01:47:23,609
difference each one of these the facing

1985
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:25,739
direction it does pick it out properly

1986
01:47:23,609 --> 01:47:31,920
right so I don't know

1987
01:47:25,738 --> 01:47:33,869
why we're not getting I don't know why

1988
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:36,989
we're not getting why we're not getting

1989
01:47:33,869 --> 01:47:42,210
any any data there that's that's weird

1990
01:47:36,988 --> 01:47:44,839
so I want to go look and see what did it

1991
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:48,300
actually say it was doing when it

1992
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:50,069
imported the that particular hat I think

1993
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:51,659
that one's the first one right or wait

1994
01:47:50,069 --> 01:47:54,929
which one is it no it's the third one so

1995
01:47:51,659 --> 01:47:56,729
it's it's the oh three and here are the

1996
01:47:54,930 --> 01:48:00,840
four things that got imported from oh

1997
01:47:56,729 --> 01:48:09,409
three so what's up with that if I look

1998
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:09,409
at the tags well there's your answer

1999
01:48:10,219 --> 01:48:17,279
so three three the facing direction for

2000
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:18,559
the item got imported the same in both

2001
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:21,559
cases

2002
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,560
why

2003
01:48:31,210 --> 01:48:34,310
[Music]

2004
01:48:39,369 --> 01:48:43,720
what's what's going on here

2005
01:48:49,880 --> 01:49:00,840
how how could it that possibly be true I

2006
01:48:53,550 --> 01:49:07,579
mean looking at this it looks like it's

2007
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:07,579
off by one in like a weird way right

2008
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:18,450
there's also like way too many of these

2009
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:51,039
2 0 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 like where is it

2010
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:53,280
getting that is there actually data in

2011
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:53,279
there

2012
01:50:07,229 --> 01:50:10,229
okay

2013
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:18,189
so I think there is some kind of a bug

2014
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:20,469
in the importing too right because there

2015
01:50:18,189 --> 01:50:26,500
should only have been one column

2016
01:50:20,469 --> 01:50:36,730
recorded and these fall well within the

2017
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:38,439
column right there's nothing it's not

2018
01:50:36,729 --> 01:50:42,158
like this is like overlapping or

2019
01:50:38,439 --> 01:50:44,379
something so for some reason when this

2020
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:47,679
got pulled in it thinks there's a lot

2021
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:50,159
more of them than there are now what's

2022
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:58,989
really weird about that is it's only

2023
01:50:50,158 --> 01:51:00,908
this one right this one has two zero

2024
01:50:58,988 --> 01:51:05,289
just like this one but then it has one

2025
01:51:00,908 --> 01:51:08,229
one two one two two two three

2026
01:51:05,289 --> 01:51:09,658
it's way more imports than there should

2027
01:51:08,229 --> 01:51:12,729
be

2028
01:51:09,658 --> 01:51:20,139
these all came in right so that's

2029
01:51:12,729 --> 01:51:21,549
correct that that's good right but this

2030
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:25,630
hat is totally borked

2031
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:27,190
it's got a total of six imports so it

2032
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:27,880
should have been to zero to one to two

2033
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:30,908
to three

2034
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:34,390
instead there is a three three and a one

2035
01:51:30,908 --> 01:51:36,689
one so the bottom corner had something

2036
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:36,690
in it

2037
01:51:43,609 --> 01:51:46,839
is that actually true

2038
01:52:05,529 --> 01:52:12,189
but I really don't see anything down

2039
01:52:07,810 --> 01:52:14,020
there so it thinks the bottom corner had

2040
01:52:12,189 --> 01:52:19,259
something in it and it also thinks that

2041
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:21,550
this had something in it right and that

2042
01:52:19,260 --> 01:52:24,430
explains why we're not getting one for

2043
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:26,770
this facing direction because you know

2044
01:52:24,430 --> 01:52:28,450
we it's picking this one because they're

2045
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:30,040
equivalent it thinks they're both fine

2046
01:52:28,449 --> 01:52:36,039
because they're both gonna be labelled

2047
01:52:30,039 --> 01:52:39,069
the same but they totally aren't so I

2048
01:52:36,039 --> 01:52:41,890
just that's really strange I don't know

2049
01:52:39,069 --> 01:52:47,549
how to actually ask if there are

2050
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:47,550
any pixels somewhere like I don't know I

2051
01:52:48,449 --> 01:52:54,539
think that's a pretty clear indication

2052
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:54,539
that there aren't I would assume

2053
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:07,020
cuz like it's entirely pegged at zero

2054
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:11,000
right so I mean I think that tells us

2055
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:13,680
what we need to know famous last words

2056
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,119
I'm gonna end it there and say that

2057
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:16,920
tomorrow that'll be our debugging to

2058
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:18,390
figure out what's going on with that

2059
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:22,590
import cuz something's something's

2060
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:25,289
busted I'm not sure what these two hat

2061
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:29,430
files seem to come in just fine and this

2062
01:53:25,289 --> 01:53:34,739
one can't and I have no idea why if I

2063
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:37,590
was to set the cook flag on us I assume

2064
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:44,189
we would then be okay so for example if

2065
01:53:37,590 --> 01:53:45,810
in here I did this I'm assuming we

2066
01:53:44,189 --> 01:53:49,710
wouldn't have this problem because the

2067
01:53:45,810 --> 01:53:51,860
cook hat seems like it works at least

2068
01:53:49,710 --> 01:53:59,369
from you know cursorily looking at the

2069
01:53:51,859 --> 01:54:02,099
import level right of course our our

2070
01:53:59,369 --> 01:54:04,640
whole body changes from here oh because

2071
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:07,470
we are now the cook instead of the hero

2072
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:09,720
but that's okay there's our our head

2073
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:11,190
piece we have to actually add the

2074
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:18,170
alignment points I'll do that really

2075
01:54:11,189 --> 01:54:29,189
quickly just for fun profit so let's add

2076
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:33,029
basis neck on there and we also want to

2077
01:54:29,189 --> 01:54:37,859
add a but we already have a top of head

2078
01:54:33,029 --> 01:54:40,399
I don't know how to really adjust this

2079
01:54:37,859 --> 01:54:40,399
particularly

2080
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:47,020
this is two-parent right

2081
01:54:48,779 --> 01:54:53,559
I'm not I need to like rethink about how

2082
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:55,839
I'm drawing this I don't really know how

2083
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:57,910
to do these quite right and as we know

2084
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:59,710
the hero head is on backwards we have to

2085
01:54:57,909 --> 01:55:01,119
we have to do an art drop to like clean

2086
01:54:59,710 --> 01:55:02,710
up all the art problems that we've had I

2087
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:05,619
should make it I should be making a list

2088
01:55:02,710 --> 01:55:09,060
but I'm not because these have to get

2089
01:55:05,619 --> 01:55:09,059
done off stream right

2090
01:55:31,869 --> 01:55:34,800
hmm

2091
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:03,980
so it's pretty straightforward yeah I

2092
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,960
mean I think all this just works okay I

2093
01:56:03,979 --> 01:56:07,339
mean you know it's a lot of our tests

2094
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:08,899
that clean up we have to do because of

2095
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:10,310
course like all this stuff we have to

2096
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:12,138
add like where they snap together and

2097
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:13,730
stuff which is you know just one of the

2098
01:56:12,139 --> 01:56:15,289
things that creates a lot of work for

2099
01:56:13,729 --> 01:56:18,579
game development always that's just how

2100
01:56:15,289 --> 01:56:18,579
it is but

2101
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:50,190
I don't even know why I'm bothering

2102
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:50,190
doing this right now but

2103
01:57:23,429 --> 01:57:28,199
you

2104
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,550
Oh duh so if I forgot to put it into

2105
01:57:28,199 --> 01:57:31,590
debug camera okay

2106
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:32,909
yeah that was stupid so that's why I

2107
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:34,770
couldn't see anything it's because you

2108
01:57:32,909 --> 01:57:37,349
have to be in debug camera mode before

2109
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:47,760
those things get good I forgot to put

2110
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:49,260
that there we go so yeah so it seems

2111
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,699
like all that stuff works just fine it's

2112
01:57:49,260 --> 01:57:52,440
just for some reason we have an import

2113
01:57:50,699 --> 01:57:53,970
problem on that so I guess that's our

2114
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:56,339
job for tomorrow I'm gonna go to Q&amp;A

2115
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:58,530
real quick here but that's gonna be

2116
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:04,010
that's gonna be our job for tomorrow is

2117
01:57:58,529 --> 01:58:06,509
to figure out why we don't why we don't

2118
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:09,170
properly only use the ones that are

2119
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:09,170
actually there

2120
01:58:23,609 --> 01:58:30,179
was Michael Abrash around during your

2121
01:58:26,429 --> 01:58:33,090
time at rad yes in fact I am one of the

2122
01:58:30,179 --> 01:58:41,940
people who talked him in like certain

2123
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:43,529
into coming to work there copypasta

2124
01:58:41,939 --> 01:58:45,328
Stephanie with the variant using Y index

2125
01:58:43,529 --> 01:58:51,448
instead of X index in the scenery tag

2126
01:58:45,328 --> 01:58:59,069
grid thank you let me let me go mark

2127
01:58:51,448 --> 01:59:06,210
that before we forget that is what I

2128
01:58:59,069 --> 01:59:09,058
meant or wanted should say how about

2129
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:14,309
ornaments for the oriented furniture

2130
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:20,340
instead of scenery um yeah I don't love

2131
01:59:14,309 --> 01:59:21,809
it I'm creating an OpenGL engine in

2132
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:23,099
c-sharp I really enjoy the language and

2133
01:59:21,809 --> 01:59:26,059
I'm enjoying the process but should I

2134
01:59:23,099 --> 01:59:32,099
just move go move to C++

2135
01:59:26,059 --> 01:59:34,469
um I don't think you have to do that

2136
01:59:32,099 --> 01:59:36,300
I mean c-sharp is reasonable I can't

2137
01:59:34,469 --> 01:59:39,328
stand garbage collection it just it

2138
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:41,820
drives me insane so you know I

2139
01:59:39,328 --> 01:59:46,769
personally wouldn't really want to use

2140
01:59:41,819 --> 01:59:49,769
c-sharp but you know that that's just my

2141
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:53,820
personal preference you know in how I

2142
01:59:49,770 --> 01:59:55,110
want to do with my code so I think

2143
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:56,969
there's any particular reason you know

2144
01:59:55,109 --> 01:59:59,279
it's not like PHP or something where I'd

2145
01:59:56,969 --> 02:00:00,868
be like oh my god no right c-sharp is

2146
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:04,819
reasonable I mean it's you know it's a

2147
02:00:00,868 --> 02:00:07,109
it's a real language it has you know

2148
02:00:04,819 --> 02:00:09,658
good trace compilation and stuff on it

2149
02:00:07,109 --> 02:00:10,979
as far as I know so it's n't it's not

2150
02:00:09,658 --> 02:00:12,238
it's not a complete pile it's gonna

2151
02:00:10,979 --> 02:00:19,859
always run really slow the garbage

2152
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:20,908
collection isn't great but you know that

2153
02:00:19,859 --> 02:00:23,908
just means that something you'll have to

2154
02:00:20,908 --> 02:00:25,348
work around in the future but you know

2155
02:00:23,908 --> 02:00:27,149
it's not the end of the world people

2156
02:00:25,349 --> 02:00:29,010
have shipped games in c-sharp it's not

2157
02:00:27,149 --> 02:00:31,109
in common and if you want to use unity

2158
02:00:29,010 --> 02:00:33,659
in the future if you know obviously that

2159
02:00:31,109 --> 02:00:36,149
uses C sharp as the main language you

2160
02:00:33,658 --> 02:00:37,379
use to program it so you you know you've

2161
02:00:36,149 --> 02:00:40,049
got a leg up there if you

2162
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:42,600
want to use unity you you know already

2163
02:00:40,050 --> 02:00:45,960
know how to program it well if you're

2164
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:46,920
aiming more Unreal Engine man that's not

2165
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:50,569
so good because I don't think people

2166
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:50,569
generally use c-sharp for that but

2167
02:01:00,139 --> 02:01:03,510
what's your learning method when faced

2168
02:01:02,069 --> 02:01:05,039
with a new topic how do you juggle

2169
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:08,329
figuring things out yourself versus

2170
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:11,219
reading a textbook so unless it's like a

2171
02:01:08,329 --> 02:01:13,319
really well studied branch of something

2172
02:01:11,219 --> 02:01:17,520
like you know I want to learn partial

2173
02:01:13,319 --> 02:01:19,529
differential equations or something then

2174
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,940
I might go to a textbook but in other

2175
02:01:19,529 --> 02:01:23,519
than that case I don't really read

2176
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:27,059
textbooks very often but what I do is I

2177
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:30,179
go surfing for papers so like let's say

2178
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:33,380
I want to implement like you know screen

2179
02:01:30,179 --> 02:01:36,179
space lighting or something right I

2180
02:01:33,380 --> 02:01:39,000
generally don't just start doing it

2181
02:01:36,179 --> 02:01:40,920
myself unless I'm like really sure that

2182
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,719
everyone's just an idiot in that domain

2183
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:44,039
and I don't need to write but with

2184
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:45,600
something like let's say screen space

2185
02:01:44,039 --> 02:01:47,189
lighting I know there's a lot of smart

2186
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:48,360
people who've done things in that area

2187
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:50,579
so what I tend to do is I just go

2188
02:01:48,359 --> 02:01:53,460
surfing for technical content I get a

2189
02:01:50,579 --> 02:01:56,488
big stack of papers in PDF form on my on

2190
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:58,679
the hard drive right and then I just

2191
02:01:56,488 --> 02:01:59,908
read them all and I don't try to like

2192
02:01:58,679 --> 02:02:01,319
understand every last thing because

2193
02:01:59,908 --> 02:02:03,000
technical papers are usually pretty bad

2194
02:02:01,319 --> 02:02:05,549
at explaining technical concepts

2195
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,350
amusingly enough but I just read them to

2196
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:09,449
see like generally what are people doing

2197
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:11,850
like what sorts of things have people

2198
02:02:09,448 --> 02:02:13,919
done what sounds good to me whatever and

2199
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:15,929
then I'll focus on like one or two and

2200
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,069
like really go in and learn like us okay

2201
02:02:15,929 --> 02:02:19,920
what do I think they were actually doing

2202
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:22,319
here right and then I'll go and start

2203
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:24,539
writing my own stuff but I really do

2204
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:28,619
tend to try to read technical papers

2205
02:02:24,539 --> 02:02:32,039
first because typically again unless

2206
02:02:28,619 --> 02:02:34,590
it's just like a really really some some

2207
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:38,479
areas are just nobody good ever goes

2208
02:02:34,590 --> 02:02:40,679
there right but other than like that

2209
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:42,388
fairly rare occurrence where you

2210
02:02:40,679 --> 02:02:45,690
literally have a place that you know is

2211
02:02:42,389 --> 02:02:47,819
just devoid of talent you're gonna find

2212
02:02:45,689 --> 02:02:50,039
some technical papers that at least will

2213
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:51,000
inform your thinking on it and give you

2214
02:02:50,039 --> 02:02:52,529
new ideas

2215
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,420
and so while I don't necessarily

2216
02:02:52,529 --> 02:02:56,729
recommend assuming that someone else has

2217
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:58,529
already solved the problem because

2218
02:02:56,729 --> 02:03:00,059
oftentimes when I go I do find that

2219
02:02:58,529 --> 02:03:01,769
there's like things I want to do that

2220
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:03,870
maybe weren't addressed or there's ideas

2221
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:06,930
I have that weren't tried by other

2222
02:03:03,869 --> 02:03:09,479
people it's rare that I don't get ideas

2223
02:03:06,930 --> 02:03:10,680
from tech papers at least some even if

2224
02:03:09,479 --> 02:03:11,819
it's just because you have an idea about

2225
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:14,400
how do something better than what they

2226
02:03:11,819 --> 02:03:18,389
did that idea came from reading the

2227
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:22,049
paper right so I really do recommend

2228
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:23,670
learning to do that if you can there's a

2229
02:03:22,050 --> 02:03:26,010
lot of good stuff in techno papers and

2230
02:03:23,670 --> 02:03:27,300
even if the technical papers don't

2231
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:30,840
actually have the answer you're looking

2232
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:33,090
for they may inspire the answer right

2233
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:37,159
they may provide context that allows you

2234
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:37,159
to get to the answer quicker and that's

2235
02:03:37,220 --> 02:03:42,810
that's equally important to have an

2236
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:45,210
official code style guide anywhere yes

2237
02:03:42,810 --> 02:03:46,680
my code style guide is if someone tries

2238
02:03:45,210 --> 02:03:49,579
to tell you to use a code style guide

2239
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:49,579
fire them

2240
02:03:55,890 --> 02:03:59,920
hi from Hungary hello I don't know that

2241
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:01,659
I've ever had anyone write in from

2242
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:03,100
Hungary before that's someone from

2243
02:04:01,659 --> 02:04:04,989
Serbia today and now some from Hungary

2244
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:07,090
these are new people places for people

2245
02:04:04,989 --> 02:04:08,260
for people writing in we also had

2246
02:04:07,090 --> 02:04:10,319
someone from France but I think I had

2247
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:12,730
someone from France writing before I

2248
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:14,170
took your advice you gave me last week I

2249
02:04:12,729 --> 02:04:15,759
started to blog to get involved gay

2250
02:04:14,170 --> 02:04:16,869
ministry it contains a few posts already

2251
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:18,449
and some descriptions of my earlier

2252
02:04:16,869 --> 02:04:27,309
projects may be worth reading sometime

2253
02:04:18,449 --> 02:04:32,189
sandor de the home blog um oops I mean

2254
02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:32,190
to delete that let's take a look ah

2255
02:04:35,430 --> 02:04:38,430
typing

2256
02:04:42,039 --> 02:04:49,149
all right cool let's take a look

2257
02:05:32,590 --> 02:05:38,650
wait I thought there was one up here

2258
02:05:34,329 --> 02:05:40,539
that said something how come how does

2259
02:05:38,649 --> 02:05:45,849
this work so how come it just kind of

2260
02:05:40,539 --> 02:05:46,569
ended here but there was more I'm

2261
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:52,289
confused

2262
02:05:46,569 --> 02:05:52,289
so these are like different ah I see

2263
02:06:07,659 --> 02:06:11,760
yeah that's us we have to also check

2264
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:11,760
this out

2265
02:06:25,010 --> 02:06:30,430
what why is video unavailable

2266
02:06:32,770 --> 02:06:35,780
looks like these videos need to be

2267
02:06:34,909 --> 02:06:39,369
updated

2268
02:06:35,779 --> 02:06:39,369
there's my only piece of feedback so far

2269
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:43,420
video needs to be updated

2270
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:44,289
so this does seem like good start to me

2271
02:07:35,859 --> 02:07:45,159
I don't know like I've spent a little

2272
02:07:44,289 --> 02:07:47,470
bit more time reading through it

2273
02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:49,720
obviously but I would I would say you

2274
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:51,550
got to fix the videos too I want to

2275
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:55,300
watch this whatever it is enhanced with

2276
02:07:51,550 --> 02:08:00,190
my personal project yeah like I like

2277
02:07:55,300 --> 02:08:03,570
this is this like a is this like

2278
02:08:00,189 --> 02:08:03,569
substrate for scattering kind of thing

2279
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:17,690
because I like this this is interesting

2280
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:32,350
I would like to see more about this you

2281
02:08:17,689 --> 02:08:35,479
should expand this part hi from Bulgaria

2282
02:08:32,350 --> 02:08:36,860
wow I'm starting an internship in July

2283
02:08:35,479 --> 02:08:38,449
the games today I'm super excited and I

2284
02:08:36,859 --> 02:08:39,799
feel I owe you a lot of gratitude for

2285
02:08:38,449 --> 02:08:46,010
keeping me excited about game day well

2286
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:48,220
I'm very glad to hear that I've seen

2287
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:53,810
your name a lot on here frosty ninja

2288
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:56,510
he's a frosty ninja a ninja that gets

2289
02:08:53,810 --> 02:08:59,960
like a frosty like the ice cream treat

2290
02:08:56,510 --> 02:09:02,510
and like unwraps they're like masks and

2291
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:06,409
like eats it or as a frosty ninja one

2292
02:09:02,510 --> 02:09:09,970
that's like a snowman who's also a ninja

2293
02:09:06,409 --> 02:09:09,970
like Frosty the Snowman or something

2294
02:09:26,619 --> 02:09:30,760
Brian was asking if a distinct coding

2295
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:32,470
style and though I realized he may have

2296
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:33,699
evolved into it over the years so I was

2297
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:37,230
wondering if there was something

2298
02:09:33,699 --> 02:09:42,069
specific that directed you yeah

2299
02:09:37,229 --> 02:09:49,409
two things really I would say one is

2300
02:09:42,069 --> 02:09:49,409
that I think I want to say that my dad

2301
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:54,430
originally used the like some people use

2302
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:56,430
the squash brace the squash tray style

2303
02:09:54,430 --> 02:09:59,079
where you move the brace up to here I

2304
02:09:56,430 --> 02:10:00,880
think my dad did it this way it may be

2305
02:09:59,079 --> 02:10:02,500
because I was a Pascal programmer it

2306
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:09,159
could have been cuz of him I can't

2307
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:12,069
remember why I use that brace style but

2308
02:10:09,159 --> 02:10:14,829
so I don't remember but that's one thing

2309
02:10:12,069 --> 02:10:17,380
the next thing is Chris hacker was the

2310
02:10:14,829 --> 02:10:20,800
person who I picked up the lowercase

2311
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:26,230
type names uppercase functions and

2312
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:28,000
variable names and that's sort of

2313
02:10:26,229 --> 02:10:30,909
arbitrary that's where I picked it up

2314
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:33,130
from but the sort of arbitrary but I've

2315
02:10:30,909 --> 02:10:36,460
recently come to think that maybe it's

2316
02:10:33,130 --> 02:10:43,329
not so arbitrary because assuming that

2317
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:47,619
you use the assuming that you use the

2318
02:10:43,329 --> 02:10:49,300
rule anything that is lowercase is a

2319
02:10:47,619 --> 02:10:53,529
type and anything that starts with

2320
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:56,909
uppercase is not a type that means you

2321
02:10:53,529 --> 02:10:59,710
can always automatically complete the

2322
02:10:56,909 --> 02:11:02,680
capitalization of anything knowing only

2323
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:03,699
the first letter if you do it the other

2324
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:09,659
way around

2325
02:11:03,699 --> 02:11:11,439
you can't and the reason for that is C

2326
02:11:09,659 --> 02:11:17,920
by default

2327
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:19,750
define its types as lowercase and even

2328
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:21,430
though you can just easily avoid not

2329
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:24,789
using any of C runtime libraries

2330
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:28,630
functions you cannot avoid using C's

2331
02:11:24,789 --> 02:11:31,000
types because they are required right

2332
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:33,579
you have to use int care if there's no

2333
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,439
other way to do that right whereas you

2334
02:11:33,579 --> 02:11:36,109
can easily just choose to only have your

2335
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:40,868
own function

2336
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:45,289
which can all be capitalized right so

2337
02:11:40,868 --> 02:11:49,189
hard to say but you know there may be

2338
02:11:45,289 --> 02:11:50,618
some reasons to do it this way finally

2339
02:11:49,189 --> 02:11:53,599
the reason there's a there's a return

2340
02:11:50,618 --> 02:11:54,920
between here and here is I just like to

2341
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:59,510
put the function name on a line by

2342
02:11:54,920 --> 02:12:01,639
itself especially when I used to program

2343
02:11:59,510 --> 02:12:03,170
so you close Plus these lines could get

2344
02:12:01,639 --> 02:12:06,800
really long like if you have like a

2345
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:09,649
template and crap on here you can just

2346
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:12,020
and so I like to split those out return

2347
02:12:09,649 --> 02:12:17,138
type versus function name just was

2348
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:17,139
easier to find the function name right

2349
02:12:28,729 --> 02:12:34,250
are you 32x32 aliases yeah they are the

2350
02:12:32,329 --> 02:12:35,988
they're not the language doesn't know

2351
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:41,359
what are you 32 is the language just

2352
02:12:35,988 --> 02:12:44,259
knows what like an unsigned is all right

2353
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:44,259
we're all good

2354
02:12:58,550 --> 02:13:03,449
by the way I forgot to thank George if

2355
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:06,179
you remember but we were having some

2356
02:13:03,448 --> 02:13:07,769
crashes in remedy when we used it on the

2357
02:13:06,179 --> 02:13:11,429
stream the other day he actually fixed

2358
02:13:07,770 --> 02:13:12,929
it like overnight for us that's why we

2359
02:13:11,429 --> 02:13:17,730
had you know we didn't have any troubles

2360
02:13:12,929 --> 02:13:20,760
today so I meant to thank X 13 pixels on

2361
02:13:17,729 --> 02:13:24,109
the chat and if he's here today but he

2362
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:27,929
like he fixes bugs in this thing like

2363
02:13:24,109 --> 02:13:29,849
like at so fast it reminds me of just

2364
02:13:27,929 --> 02:13:31,199
how slow it takes Microsoft to ever fix

2365
02:13:29,850 --> 02:13:34,520
any bugs and their stuff it's just like

2366
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:38,279
yeah it's like I had a problem on

2367
02:13:34,520 --> 02:13:40,830
Saturday and he fixed it by Sunday

2368
02:13:38,279 --> 02:13:43,139
morning we didn't end up using it on

2369
02:13:40,829 --> 02:13:45,539
Sunday morning I felt bad because we

2370
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:48,090
went down the rat hole someone had asked

2371
02:13:45,539 --> 02:13:51,269
about how to draw the circle right but

2372
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:53,279
it was fixed yes like last weekend on

2373
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:55,650
Sunday morning it was ready for us right

2374
02:13:53,279 --> 02:13:57,210
so that's why I didn't crash at all this

2375
02:13:55,649 --> 02:14:02,609
weekend is cuz he just he fixed it look

2376
02:13:57,210 --> 02:14:04,948
right away and so just thought I'd say

2377
02:14:02,609 --> 02:14:07,859
thanks for being so fast on the bug

2378
02:14:04,948 --> 02:14:09,779
reports it's pretty nice to have some

2379
02:14:07,859 --> 02:14:11,698
confidence that when your debugger

2380
02:14:09,779 --> 02:14:13,738
crashes you can actually send the crash

2381
02:14:11,698 --> 02:14:16,319
to somebody and then it gets fixed like

2382
02:14:13,738 --> 02:14:17,908
I mean that's actually a feeling that I

2383
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:18,658
don't have a sufferer pretty much ever

2384
02:14:17,908 --> 02:14:21,389
anymore

2385
02:14:18,658 --> 02:14:24,059
I mean like we get Photoshop crashes

2386
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:25,380
every day they'll never get fixed I mean

2387
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:26,730
I don't think they'll ever get fixed I

2388
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:28,590
don't even know how to really report

2389
02:14:26,729 --> 02:14:31,619
them correctly but they never get fixed

2390
02:14:28,590 --> 02:14:33,270
I mean they they're bugs that a far as I

2391
02:14:31,619 --> 02:14:34,559
can tell I've been in there for years

2392
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:36,090
right

2393
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,650
and if they do fix them then they just

2394
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:40,079
add new ones so you never really know

2395
02:14:37,649 --> 02:14:43,589
but it's weird but you never get them

2396
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:48,420
fixed like even confirm that you fix

2397
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:50,429
them right this never happens it's you

2398
02:14:48,420 --> 02:14:52,050
know or like web stuff I use you know

2399
02:14:50,429 --> 02:14:54,539
Gmail has the same bugs in it that it's

2400
02:14:52,050 --> 02:14:55,980
had for years the Wacom driver has the

2401
02:14:54,539 --> 02:15:00,439
same bugs and if that's had for years I

2402
02:14:55,979 --> 02:15:00,439
just you know it's just just rot really

2403
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:23,910
when porting to other platforms do you

2404
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:26,300
have to rewrite all your shooters in

2405
02:15:23,909 --> 02:15:31,109
hlsl on metal s l's are a way to

2406
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:35,220
transpile GLSL yeah that's just a

2407
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:39,179
shaders are a gigantic failure the fact

2408
02:15:35,220 --> 02:15:45,060
that the fact that they couldn't have

2409
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:47,760
one stupid language is absurd especially

2410
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:49,680
because they're all the same like the K

2411
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,960
it's not like they all do the same thing

2412
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:56,070
right they all compile down the same

2413
02:15:51,960 --> 02:16:01,980
crap on the on the different cards and

2414
02:15:56,069 --> 02:16:06,329
it's just it's a just a disaster just a

2415
02:16:01,979 --> 02:16:08,339
huge disaster I don't know of any great

2416
02:16:06,329 --> 02:16:10,738
thing to suggest they're all I would say

2417
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:15,270
is that you know some people use trance

2418
02:16:10,738 --> 02:16:17,729
trance compilers or trans translators I

2419
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:21,540
guess what you'd call them vagues they

2420
02:16:17,729 --> 02:16:23,819
do exist so there's a couple like open

2421
02:16:21,539 --> 02:16:26,369
source ones that are just like look this

2422
02:16:23,819 --> 02:16:28,859
is the thing that that compete that that

2423
02:16:26,369 --> 02:16:31,260
takes hlsl and dumps metal out or things

2424
02:16:28,859 --> 02:16:37,138
like that like they do exist I forget

2425
02:16:31,260 --> 02:16:38,969
the names of them but but yeah it's just

2426
02:16:37,138 --> 02:16:40,799
it's ridiculous that there's I don't

2427
02:16:38,968 --> 02:16:42,869
even know what to say it's not like

2428
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:44,789
these cards do they're just computing

2429
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:49,139
generic math stuff I guess I don't even

2430
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:51,630
know it they don't even have branching

2431
02:16:49,138 --> 02:16:53,609
right they just have masking even so

2432
02:16:51,629 --> 02:16:55,679
it's I don't I don't I don't know I

2433
02:16:53,610 --> 02:16:58,980
guess they do have branching now they've

2434
02:16:55,679 --> 02:17:02,579
got loops so I shouldn't say that I

2435
02:16:58,979 --> 02:17:06,170
think they can do loops now so that's

2436
02:17:02,579 --> 02:17:06,170
not true they do have branching

2437
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:12,760
but anyway it's just it's it's absurd

2438
02:17:10,149 --> 02:17:18,100
I'm gonna go ahead and and close it down

2439
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:27,520
here I also should mention before we go

2440
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:31,739
anywhere for the day I think this is

2441
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:34,301
working now I think you don't know and

2442
02:17:31,739 --> 02:17:36,190
then when it came to giving a talk it's

2443
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:38,260
made me think about some things that

2444
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:44,010
transpired between boast of are both of

2445
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:47,200
our societies some Dec so there is now a

2446
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:50,770
English only version of John's talk he

2447
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:52,030
gave in blocks like I said it is

2448
02:17:50,770 --> 02:17:54,341
somewhere in Russia but I don't actually

2449
02:17:52,030 --> 02:17:55,810
know where that where Russia is a big

2450
02:17:54,341 --> 02:17:56,890
country so that's kind of not narrowing

2451
02:17:55,809 --> 02:18:00,609
it dad

2452
02:17:56,889 --> 02:18:03,671
okay so it's in Moscow I guess so here's

2453
02:18:00,610 --> 02:18:06,671
the talk he gave in Moscow just like a

2454
02:18:03,671 --> 02:18:09,040
day or two ago and there is now a

2455
02:18:06,671 --> 02:18:10,360
version supposedly English only I

2456
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,801
haven't listened the whole thing in

2457
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:14,591
English yet I had to listen to the one

2458
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:16,000
with the Russian simultaneous

2459
02:18:14,591 --> 02:18:19,600
translation which was kind of brain

2460
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:22,091
bending so if you're interested in Jon's

2461
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:24,100
talk which if you watch Han Mahiro you

2462
02:18:22,091 --> 02:18:27,579
probably are cuz you know it's it's very

2463
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:29,350
much about the kinds of stuff we always

2464
02:18:27,579 --> 02:18:33,819
talk about in handmade hero I would

2465
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:35,171
recommend giving this a watch it's on my

2466
02:18:33,819 --> 02:18:37,239
Twitter feed if this is annoying you can

2467
02:18:35,171 --> 02:18:38,829
go to Twitter / senior comma slash

2468
02:18:37,239 --> 02:18:46,091
territory maybe we'll get the link in

2469
02:18:38,829 --> 02:18:50,921
here on the on the annotations as well

2470
02:18:46,091 --> 02:18:54,040
but basically John just consolidated

2471
02:18:50,921 --> 02:18:56,500
into a talk a pretty clean set of things

2472
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:58,390
it's like here's why things are pretty

2473
02:18:56,500 --> 02:19:00,460
bad right now with some you know

2474
02:18:58,389 --> 02:19:03,189
specific evidence that I call it that

2475
02:19:00,460 --> 02:19:05,949
you know what not i but he collected and

2476
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:08,980
then like why you should care about it

2477
02:19:05,950 --> 02:19:15,700
it contains an important point that I

2478
02:19:08,979 --> 02:19:18,039
think is not it's not articulated often

2479
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:21,159
and I don't think I ever really thought

2480
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:23,380
about it much beyond

2481
02:19:21,159 --> 02:19:25,929
just a my feeling like it was a

2482
02:19:23,379 --> 02:19:28,989
self-evident fact to me but I never

2483
02:19:25,929 --> 02:19:33,189
thought to to really say it out loud and

2484
02:19:28,989 --> 02:19:35,289
when you say it out loud it would like

2485
02:19:33,189 --> 02:19:37,719
that John did and he was actually he

2486
02:19:35,290 --> 02:19:42,010
more steadily Elon Musk said it out loud

2487
02:19:37,718 --> 02:19:43,449
and John was quoting him but when you

2488
02:19:42,010 --> 02:19:45,728
say that you realize that people don't

2489
02:19:43,450 --> 02:19:50,890
ever say it out loud which is weird and

2490
02:19:45,728 --> 02:19:53,679
that fact is that technology left to its

2491
02:19:50,889 --> 02:19:56,199
own devices degrades over time and it is

2492
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:59,110
only through effort that it actually

2493
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:02,680
gets better and so it's really important

2494
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:04,989
to point this out that people think that

2495
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:07,329
science and technology improve over time

2496
02:20:04,989 --> 02:20:09,879
but they don't they degrade over time

2497
02:20:07,329 --> 02:20:13,898
and it's only through a lot of human

2498
02:20:09,879 --> 02:20:16,059
effort that you actually get continual

2499
02:20:13,898 --> 02:20:18,519
incremental improvement and that effort

2500
02:20:16,059 --> 02:20:20,228
is communication it's communication

2501
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:22,180
between people who know how to do things

2502
02:20:20,228 --> 02:20:24,549
and people who don't to try and spread

2503
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:26,290
that knowledge and keep it maintained so

2504
02:20:24,549 --> 02:20:28,719
that it so that people new people can

2505
02:20:26,290 --> 02:20:33,189
add to it in advance rather than having

2506
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:35,920
to start over and degrade right and it's

2507
02:20:33,189 --> 02:20:38,079
just worth saying that because nobody

2508
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:41,219
ever says that but it's 100% the case

2509
02:20:38,079 --> 02:20:43,478
and the institutions that are generally

2510
02:20:41,219 --> 02:20:46,029
responsible for preserving this

2511
02:20:43,478 --> 02:20:48,779
knowledge are bad at it universities are

2512
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:53,229
terrible at at preserving knowledge

2513
02:20:48,780 --> 02:20:56,290
especially in technical fields and like

2514
02:20:53,228 --> 02:21:01,769
textbooks are horrible at it very very

2515
02:20:56,290 --> 02:21:05,760
bad so the act of actually like

2516
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:11,140
preserving what we do know how to do is

2517
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:12,520
tenuous and this talk should hopefully

2518
02:21:11,139 --> 02:21:15,010
provide you with some evidence that

2519
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:17,110
that's true that you do need to do work

2520
02:21:15,010 --> 02:21:21,010
to prevent backslide

2521
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:23,140
but also show some examples of why we

2522
02:21:21,010 --> 02:21:26,079
are probably in a backsliding period

2523
02:21:23,139 --> 02:21:28,269
right now meaning we have already

2524
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:29,860
entered a time when software is

2525
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:33,510
backsliding because of poor

2526
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:35,829
communication and poor training and

2527
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:37,930
knowledge transfer

2528
02:21:35,829 --> 02:21:39,850
so it's not like something that we have

2529
02:21:37,930 --> 02:21:41,680
to be afraid will happen in the future

2530
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:45,460
it's something we should be afraid is

2531
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:47,260
already happening now and something

2532
02:21:45,459 --> 02:21:48,969
probably should be done about it if we

2533
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:53,290
can figure out what that something would

2534
02:21:48,969 --> 02:21:55,719
be unfortunately the talk it doesn't

2535
02:21:53,290 --> 02:21:56,979
have an obvious easy answer I don't

2536
02:21:55,719 --> 02:21:59,198
think that's the stalks fault I think

2537
02:21:56,978 --> 02:22:00,818
that's just the fact that there isn't an

2538
02:21:59,199 --> 02:22:03,510
obvious easy answer to something like

2539
02:22:00,818 --> 02:22:08,889
this it's it's a very complicated issue

2540
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:12,100
and so it's more talked about trying to

2541
02:22:08,889 --> 02:22:14,469
get people to stop being so self

2542
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:16,689
congratulatory and start realizing just

2543
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:20,559
how dangerous the situation where you

2544
02:22:16,689 --> 02:22:22,270
found ourselves in and maybe try to

2545
02:22:20,559 --> 02:22:23,799
motivate people to try and work a little

2546
02:22:22,270 --> 02:22:26,880
harder to figure out how to fix this

2547
02:22:23,799 --> 02:22:29,228
problem that we actually have hopefully

2548
02:22:26,879 --> 02:22:31,629
it will do a good job of mystery of that

2549
02:22:29,228 --> 02:22:34,629
if it doesn't oh well but I would really

2550
02:22:31,629 --> 02:22:36,068
recommend giving it a listen and it will

2551
02:22:34,629 --> 02:22:41,228
be a lot easier for you to listen than

2552
02:22:36,068 --> 02:22:43,948
me because hopefully now it is it's just

2553
02:22:41,228 --> 02:22:48,488
English if that makes sense

2554
02:22:43,949 --> 02:22:50,859
so hopefully that'll work out please

2555
02:22:48,488 --> 02:22:52,658
check that out I will be back here

2556
02:22:50,859 --> 02:22:55,300
tomorrow when I want to go look at why

2557
02:22:52,658 --> 02:22:57,369
we're having some bugs in why that

2558
02:22:55,299 --> 02:23:00,879
flower hat was getting extracted as

2559
02:22:57,370 --> 02:23:02,680
multiple bitmap regions that though I

2560
02:23:00,879 --> 02:23:04,148
don't think had anything in them maybe

2561
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:05,620
they did have something in them and

2562
02:23:04,148 --> 02:23:09,430
actually there's some noise pixels in

2563
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:12,640
there either way we have a any issue if

2564
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:13,720
it's extracting grid squares that don't

2565
02:23:12,639 --> 02:23:16,269
have anything in them that's an obvious

2566
02:23:13,719 --> 02:23:17,590
bug that needs fixing if it's extracting

2567
02:23:16,270 --> 02:23:18,579
grid squares because it grid squares

2568
02:23:17,590 --> 02:23:20,889
because they actually do have something

2569
02:23:18,579 --> 02:23:21,850
in them well we still have a problem

2570
02:23:20,889 --> 02:23:24,340
which is that that needs to be

2571
02:23:21,850 --> 02:23:26,229
articulated more clearly so that we can

2572
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:27,908
see what the actual error is and fix it

2573
02:23:26,228 --> 02:23:29,648
in the art assets so either way we need

2574
02:23:27,908 --> 02:23:32,709
to do something about it we'll take a

2575
02:23:29,648 --> 02:23:33,670
look at that a little bit later on and

2576
02:23:32,709 --> 02:23:35,948
stream tomorrow for sure

2577
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:37,148
so please come back for that and I'll

2578
02:23:35,949 --> 02:23:39,100
see you here tomorrow same time same

2579
02:23:37,148 --> 02:23:41,500
place until then have fun programming

2580
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:42,850
and I'll see you on the air net I guess

2581
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:44,889
I should also say as I say every time in

2582
02:23:42,850 --> 02:23:46,210
case you didn't know already if you do

2583
02:23:44,889 --> 02:23:48,340
want to work with source code directly

2584
02:23:46,209 --> 02:23:48,849
it is available if you preorder the game

2585
02:23:48,340 --> 02:23:49,779
it

2586
02:23:48,850 --> 02:23:52,090
comes in the source code so you can

2587
02:23:49,779 --> 02:23:54,850
follow that at home that's on hand me

2588
02:23:52,090 --> 02:23:57,189
here org and of course the schedule is

2589
02:23:54,850 --> 02:23:58,960
always under the watch tab as is the

2590
02:23:57,189 --> 02:23:59,979
searchable episode guide if you're

2591
02:23:58,959 --> 02:24:01,269
looking for something

2592
02:23:59,978 --> 02:24:02,858
check out that watch now it's got a lot

2593
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:05,500
of good stuff on it that's it for today

2594
02:24:02,859 --> 02:24:06,460
until tomorrow have fun programming I'll

2595
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:09,478
see everyone on the Internet

2596
02:24:06,459 --> 02:24:09,478
take it easy everybody
