1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,339
all righty hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,699
handmade Hero show recode a complete

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,500
game live on stream today I want to take

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:16,769
a look we started playing around with

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,490
room layout last weekend and I would

6
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:23,250
like to try to do a couple things to

7
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,159
that code now that we're just informed

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,868
by us playing around with it

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,910
specifically I feel like just from

10
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,589
playing around a little bit the sense

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,799
that I got in trying to make a fairly

12
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:39,439
simple routine was that it was too

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:44,189
cumbersome to talk about the layout of

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:47,009
rooms in ways that was error-free right

15
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,718
and so there was a lot of like problems

16
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,640
with thinking about how to do things

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,808
without having off-by-one errors when

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,759
you're doing like sort of tile based

19
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:57,869
layouts and things like this and so I

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,299
think what I gained from doing that

21
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,968
playing around with it last weekend was

22
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:07,438
that I would like to maybe make

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:11,780
something make some code that manually

24
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:17,639
lays out some rooms in a known pattern

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:20,490
and figure out what how to make the sort

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,890
of the API the the the way in which we

27
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,349
talk about where rooms are and how

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,780
they're placed I'd like to get that

29
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,640
right before I try to write anything

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,280
more complicated like the code we were

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,209
playing with so because like I said when

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,070
you start playing around sit like this

33
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,109
and you're opening up a new section of

34
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,359
the code a section that is brand new

35
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,909
where we haven't really done anything

36
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:44,328
with anything like it previously it's

37
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,729
important to kind of feel it out and go

38
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:49,500
how is coding here gonna go and what do

39
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,810
I need to be effective here like what

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,368
what am I look how can I do it so that

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,228
I'm not spinning my wheels and wasting

42
00:01:53,368 --> 00:02:00,420
my time what do I need right and so what

43
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,368
I would like to do here is I would like

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,228
to start pushing that forward right I'd

45
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:11,068
like to figure out how I can I sort of

46
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:13,439
get a good I guess we're looking for is

47
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:16,709
a good semantics in place for

48
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,189
talking about where rooms can go where

49
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,280
they did go and how I want them placed

50
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:26,939
and I don't think what I picked at first

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,460
was good I think it was bad and I'll

52
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:35,280
explain why in a second so if you

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:37,680
remember we sort of had this this

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,199
concept in here of a of a volume where a

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,270
room could be placed and this was just

56
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,069
some integers that said the meaning the

57
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,250
max right it's a pretty straightforward

58
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:50,849
idea uh and I don't think there's

59
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,810
anything I obviously wrong with this

60
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:57,960
right I don't think there's some kind of

61
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,800
horrible design decision here but I do

62
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,330
think there was a problem with the

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,650
interpretation of it and you remember I

64
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,880
actually said I'm not sure if this is

65
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,069
the right way when I did it and I think

66
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,990
when I did it when I actually you went

67
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:11,729
to use it I think that confirmed that it

68
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,370
was in fact not the right way and I like

69
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,829
to do a little bit differently

70
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,810
specifically what I chose to do was say

71
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,969
that the min and the max were actually

72
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,159
exclusive sorry the min was inclusive in

73
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:28,859
the max is exclusive so this is a fairly

74
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,629
standard interval technique it's

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,010
basically saying that and it's a tense

76
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,389
it's like how triangle fill and stuff

77
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,810
like that tends to work those kinds of

78
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:42,479
fill rules and the reason for it is if

79
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,550
you have a an understanding of how

80
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,169
something is laid out and you put two

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,630
rectangles next to each other starts

82
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:52,500
that one's min is the other one's max

83
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:55,530
you don't want them both to fill the

84
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,989
same column and so let me draw this out

85
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,789
for you we've talked about this a little

86
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,159
bit when we talked about fill rules and

87
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:08,340
I just want to kind of cement the reason

88
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,139
why these sorts of things exist and then

89
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,810
talk about the problem that I had with

90
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,809
it that prevented it from being good

91
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:27,889
so specifically the problem is as

92
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:32,389
follows

93
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:34,550
we are on a tile map grid and so when we

94
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,919
talk about the tile map grid what we end

95
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,720
up talking about or what we were talking

96
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,129
about anyway and maybe we don't want to

97
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,530
still talk about it this way which is

98
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:45,889
why I'm bringing it up but what we were

99
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:48,859
talking about is imagining that we have

100
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:53,300
a set of integers mapped to effectively

101
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:57,110
the tiles okay so what that means is

102
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,290
that if I was to say take integer 3 that

103
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,819
is this column let's say an integer 7 is

104
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,819
this row or something like this so it

105
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:07,990
would be 8 9 10 11 whatever so this is

106
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:10,969
just some a random section of the grid

107
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,759
and so what I now have to do is say well

108
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,920
I want to talk about a room and a room

109
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,930
is a collection of these tiles that

110
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,819
happens to be rectangular at the moment

111
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,290
right now we don't really care if it's

112
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,670
rectangular at the end of the day but

113
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,290
we'll probably build it up out of

114
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,240
rectangles even if it's not rectangular

115
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,460
so we do want a convenient way of

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,310
talking about more than one tile because

117
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:33,019
talking about each individual tile that

118
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,339
comprises a room especially when most of

119
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,599
these rooms are going to be rectangular

120
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:38,269
because the screens rectangular and we

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,950
want to fill it with a room I it's just

122
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,329
very cumbersome and unnecessary right it

123
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,279
would not be a smart way to do it to

124
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:45,159
pass like a list of all of the tiles

125
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,779
because there'd be like you know a

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,130
hundred tiles in this room and we'd be

127
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:51,649
passing a list of a hundred integer

128
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:53,180
pairs instead of just passing two

129
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,759
integer pairs than men in the max right

130
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,680
so you can see why this makes some sense

131
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,810
why we want to do rectangle based

132
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,329
referencing of regions for all kinds of

133
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,870
purposes and so what we're gonna end up

134
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:08,419
here with some way of saying look let's

135
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,180
suppose that this is the region I'm

136
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,790
talking about now we all know what that

137
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,350
region is I colored it in its the region

138
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:23,300
that includes you know 4 8 4 I'm sorry

139
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:26,570
four nine five eight five nine six eight

140
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,280
six nine that's the region we're talking

141
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:31,629
about so there's no ambiguity in what

142
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,629
I'm trying to say

143
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:41,789
but there's plenty of ambiguity you know

144
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,639
how I want to encode that so one way of

145
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,010
encoding that is by using intervals

146
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,810
right a min and a max by saying this is

147
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,349
the range that I'm going to do and

148
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:55,620
there's very there's a lot of different

149
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:59,729
ways that I could imagine talking about

150
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:07,550
these things for example I could encode

151
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:14,038
this as 4 through 6 comma 8 through 9

152
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:17,189
right and this is effectively a interval

153
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:19,228
that says everything including the

154
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:22,680
number specified is included in the

155
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:26,788
region right so when I say 4 I mean

156
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,100
everything to the right of 4 and 4 and

157
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:35,610
when I say 6 I mean everything to the

158
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:38,810
left of 6 and 6 in mathematics shorthand

159
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:42,330
notation oftentimes they will use

160
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:45,180
brackets or parentheses to indicate

161
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:47,668
which of these they mean so oftentimes

162
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,639
in mathematics literature you will see

163
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:55,680
something to represent this as brackets

164
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:58,590
4 comma 6 and that means I want the

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,038
interval 4 through 6 including 4 and

166
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:05,638
including 6 on the other hand if I

167
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:13,620
wanted to instead represent this as 3

168
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:17,310
through 7 7 through 10 that suggests the

169
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:21,060
boundary right so now I am telling you

170
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,848
the numbers that bound the region but

171
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:29,639
which do not themselves include in that

172
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:32,879
region so I don't include 3 or 7 they

173
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,180
are not actually in the interval they

174
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:40,049
are on the just just outside their one

175
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,029
passed it right and in mathematics you

176
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,649
would often write that and again I want

177
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:45,480
to put a little kavion this because

178
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,089
I don't quite mean you would often write

179
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,139
that but parentheses are usually used to

180
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,180
talk about excluding that one digit

181
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:57,688
that's actually on the end so you might

182
00:08:54,179 --> 00:09:00,269
say three comma seven not brackets three

183
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:02,159
seven which would have hoops which would

184
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,078
have included three two seven now the

185
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,058
reason I say not quite is because this

186
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,088
presumes that we're talking about

187
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:13,379
discrete things only not that kind of

188
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:15,660
discrete at that kind of screen when you

189
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,759
write this kind of an interval in

190
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:20,129
mathematics more generally you're

191
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,159
actually just talking about literally

192
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:26,249
the position on the number line that is

193
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:32,360
three is it included or not but two I'm

194
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:36,329
sorry 3.0 oo-oo-oo-oo one for example

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,919
would still be included so in our case

196
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,659
we're talking about the first thing that

197
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,889
would be included if three is not

198
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:46,078
included is four in real math not real

199
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:49,470
as an actual math or not fake math but

200
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,859
real as in real numbers when you write

201
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,480
intervals you're talking about the

202
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,850
infinity of numbers not just the

203
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,829
discrete ones but if we're only talking

204
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,899
about those sweet ones then again maybe

205
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:02,128
that makes more sense either way doesn't

206
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,528
matter to us we're never going to use

207
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:06,449
this notation I just wanted to point out

208
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:10,769
that you've seen this before if you've

209
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:12,990
taken high school math classes I would

210
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,370
think at least would have had a part

211
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,629
where they mentioned something like this

212
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,659
or had a little bit of something like

213
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:21,688
this so again the concept that you need

214
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:24,528
to talk about whether or not the

215
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:27,480
bounding value is in or out is not

216
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:29,548
specific to tile maps it's not specific

217
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,438
to fill rules it's not specific to

218
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:33,058
computing it's actually something that

219
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:35,909
even mathematicians have to deal with

220
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:37,499
all the way back to the time when

221
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:40,528
computers were not even a thing that

222
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:42,119
anyone thought about they still had to

223
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:46,379
think about whether or not when they

224
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:48,480
talked about a particular number as the

225
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,879
bounds of a region did they mean greater

226
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,959
than or greater than or equal to right

227
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,730
because that's we're really talking

228
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,229
about here right in this case we're

229
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,129
talking about greater than in this case

230
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,519
we're talking about greater than or

231
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:58,519
equal to

232
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,319
and so that's a very common thing it's

233
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,929
not unique to us it's it's common in

234
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,490
math in general but again just wanted to

235
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,899
put that as a side it doesn't matter

236
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,430
that's common to math because whether or

237
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,929
not it is common to math or not we still

238
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:15,659
have to deal with it here so what we do

239
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,889
know is this common to us and so what I

240
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:18,000
want to talk about here is how we're

241
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:20,610
actually storing this and the

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,740
consequence is that we end up having

243
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:37,050
when we when we work with these things

244
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:38,690
okay so the problems that that I want to

245
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:40,679
make sure that we handle properly and

246
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,180
the things that I want to look at more

247
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,620
carefully and maybe we're doing fine but

248
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,329
I just want to look at them and pull

249
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,649
them out in two reliable things that we

250
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,100
can count on so I don't have to think

251
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:53,250
about anymore is we have to pick some

252
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,250
rule for how these things are talked

253
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,879
about and not only do we have these two

254
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,039
options

255
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,769
meaning include or exclude the two

256
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:03,599
bounds we have the option of doing it

257
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:07,350
heterogeneous ability heterogeneously

258
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,830
such as include the three well in this

259
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:15,180
case it would be include the four don't

260
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:20,240
include the seven right similarly don't

261
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:20,239
include the three do include the six

262
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:27,360
right so we actually have in this case

263
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,429
four viable options here for how we

264
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,720
might want to include this include

265
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:36,389
encode this one is exclusive of both one

266
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,129
is inclusive of both one is exclusive on

267
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:42,000
one inclusive on the other and the other

268
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:43,049
one is the opposite right and again that

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,639
just corresponds to all the

270
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:50,299
possibilities there are there's two

271
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:53,490
possibilities right include exclude and

272
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:54,839
so and we have two things we can include

273
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,970
or exclude so it's two times two equals

274
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:04,920
four possibilities right so the one I

275
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:07,740
chose was actually this one and that is

276
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,409
the the convention that's often used for

277
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,278
fill rules generally which is that the

278
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:13,438
min is included in the

279
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,870
Max is not included now why would you

280
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:17,490
want to do that the reason that you'd

281
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,350
want to do that is because it allows you

282
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:25,560
to set the min and the max to the same

283
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:27,899
value and not overlap so if for example

284
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,789
I know that I want two rooms to line up

285
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,409
I set their min to one value and their

286
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:36,748
max to the same value and I know that

287
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:39,808
they're touching right so that's what I

288
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:41,720
did I'm just not sure that's the way

289
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:45,120
that makes it the easiest to talk about

290
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,579
and so what I'd like to do today is I'd

291
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,019
like to go in and start to look at what

292
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,120
were the sorts of things we were trying

293
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:53,039
to do just in that one simple routine

294
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,139
that was like looking at how it would

295
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,360
have to bound a room in order to touch

296
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,370
all the things that was supposed to like

297
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,800
a but all of the rooms that was supposed

298
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,360
to a but I wasn't a very complicated

299
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,399
routine but it was kind of complicated

300
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,039
to get right just because of all the

301
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,899
like off-by-one confusing miss of it

302
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:14,669
right and so I would like to figure out

303
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,889
how to sort of talk about those things a

304
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:19,828
little bit more conveniently in a way

305
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:21,360
that's semantically easy to remember so

306
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:23,938
that we don't have to worry as much

307
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,620
about that as we're programming okay I

308
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:27,299
don't because it's gonna be too slow

309
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,919
we're gonna get bogged down if we're

310
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,620
constantly having to like think through

311
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,208
and debug these sort of twiki like does

312
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,480
this thing actually line up where we

313
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:40,859
think it does kinds of stuff so I just

314
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,129
want to look at that and see if that is

315
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,470
doing what it should be doing and that's

316
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:51,808
what we really want to look at right so

317
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:54,829
here is the code in question and what

318
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:57,120
you can see is we have some pretty

319
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:58,708
straightforward kinds of stuff for the

320
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,659
connection just like hey could I go in

321
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:04,409
this direction or couldn't I that seems

322
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:06,360
reasonable just mean and then I start to

323
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:08,278
look at well which side was I gonna do

324
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,050
am i doing the min side or the Mac side

325
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:13,860
of this thing which you know Mike which

326
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:16,649
way am I trying to go out and what we

327
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,649
find here is we find that we call like

328
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,720
clipped min or clipped Max and we say

329
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:24,539
stuff like well okay I need to clip the

330
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,899
minimum to whatever the maximum was and

331
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:27,328
I need to

332
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:34,919
at the maximum to whatever the maximum

333
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:40,229
was like plus one right um and it's just

334
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:43,618
like I guess that that's not that big of

335
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,869
a deal that's just saying II there has

336
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:47,220
to be some volume to the room so really

337
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:49,110
you know I could have done it that way

338
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,970
which seems still symmetric so that's

339
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,499
pretty reasonable then when I'm going to

340
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:57,869
clip the minimum I'm flipping that to

341
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:59,249
the the minimum of the maximum I should

342
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:01,410
say to the air with all units that's all

343
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:04,259
right so these actually don't look as

344
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:05,519
bad as I as I as I thought they might be

345
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,928
and we can make this a little more

346
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:15,149
standard let's take a look at these guys

347
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:17,178
here so you can see there's a bit of a

348
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:24,269
of an asymmetry here though that I don't

349
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:28,588
necessarily love right this part is not

350
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:32,698
great we would like these to look

351
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:36,470
symmetric I think like we really I just

352
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,469
don't think fundamentally want to have

353
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:43,139
these kinds of lines like asymmetric if

354
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:46,318
I want to shrink the thing in by the

355
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,730
interior apron I think you would want it

356
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:50,278
to look symmetric now the reason it

357
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,139
doesn't look symmetric at the moment is

358
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:54,659
because if we're going to clip the

359
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,970
maximum to something in order to overlap

360
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:58,409
by one I've got to make sure that I add

361
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,660
one to it because it's not going to

362
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:02,428
include where it is whereas on the other

363
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:08,338
hand on the inside I don't have to do

364
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:11,269
that right now let's make sure that's

365
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:11,269
actually correct

366
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:28,289
but I'm pretty sure it is look if I go

367
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:32,240
ahead and run this by the way it should

368
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,240
just produce a bunch of connected rims I

369
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,069
don't know why that didn't load my

370
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:42,629
project yeah

371
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:47,069
must've like closed the project last

372
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,810
time or something um so these rooms are

373
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:54,000
lined up the way that I think that they

374
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:58,529
should be right let me go ahead and undo

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:08,269
this and I should verify that they are

376
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:08,269
not yeah

377
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:23,960
so that's kind of an example of an

378
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:26,599
asymmetry that I don't love and you know

379
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,710
again I say what I'm looking for it

380
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:33,909
curious I want ways to talk about these

381
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,289
things that don't accumulate off by ones

382
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,850
because if you accumulate off by ones

383
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:40,159
then the programmer always has to be

384
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,689
thinking about whether there's an off by

385
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,040
one in there and if there is they have

386
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,730
to manually correct for it and that's

387
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:56,809
what I did here but that's not really

388
00:18:46,730 --> 00:19:01,660
good and so for me I think looking at

389
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:11,329
this if I was to say that the maximum

390
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:16,220
included where it was then I think this

391
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:19,339
maybe becomes more symmetric I think so

392
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,880
let's suppose that the max did include

393
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:25,329
where it was what would this look like

394
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:36,530
well if the max included where it was

395
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:37,819
then the minimum volumes so let me talk

396
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:39,889
about one of the things going on here if

397
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:42,139
it's not obvious one other thing that's

398
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,960
a little bit of an issue is that when we

399
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,300
talk about mins and maxes we're actually

400
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,039
we have two layers of that going on

401
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:50,720
right now not only do we have the min

402
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,490
and Max of the region we're talking

403
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,860
about but this is actually talking about

404
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,930
a minute a max of those men and maxes

405
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:59,419
right because we're talking about a

406
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,850
region where we can place them in and a

407
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,610
region where we can place the max so we

408
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:07,849
have a volume for minimums and a volume

409
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:08,929
for maximums and so I think that's also

410
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:12,769
what's causing the trip repair because

411
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:16,160
for example let's suppose I wanted to

412
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:18,980
have the max include its own line well

413
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,860
at that point we still sort of have a

414
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,210
problem the reason for that is that when

415
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:26,089
we're clipping the

416
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,450
minimum volumes maximum location it can

417
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:35,720
be we need to make sure that that

418
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:38,149
doesn't ever go below a legal limit so

419
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,829
if I were to switch that I think I would

420
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:48,408
just have to I'd have to end up

421
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:51,619
basically doing that right it would move

422
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:55,880
where the plus one was in this case the

423
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:59,808
max of the minimum so the furthest the

424
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,490
minimum can be in terms of where the

425
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:13,129
other room compared to where the other

426
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:17,808
rooms maximum is yeah obviously that

427
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:20,028
can't be any less than the maximum of

428
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:22,190
that room right it has to all be to the

429
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:25,009
other side of it so both the min and the

430
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:28,909
max have to be to the other side of the

431
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:31,429
maximum so now I guess I'm I guess I'm

432
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:33,320
not I'm mistaken since everything is

433
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:34,340
inclusive and the min and the max could

434
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:56,658
be the same value

435
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:58,788
it really looks more like this right so

436
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:01,730
if the min and the max are actually

437
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:03,710
included bounds I think that regularizes

438
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,829
the handling a little bit it basically

439
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:10,069
says look the minimum has to move to

440
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:16,609
this line the maximum has to move to

441
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:28,730
this other line right and I think that's

442
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:30,949
just it so I'm gonna go ahead and

443
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,929
experiment with that a little bit but

444
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,639
that seems better to me just looking at

445
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,200
this routine and looking at what will

446
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:38,269
happen if I change the definition of

447
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,870
what happens there it starts to get rid

448
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,220
of some of those like okay this one has

449
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,319
to have a plus one this one asset like

450
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,329
now it's like everyone gets the same

451
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:49,278
modifier and that's what I'm looking for

452
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:51,230
I want to wait a uniformly think about

453
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:53,500
that and it seems like that's just

454
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,500
better

455
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:13,250
again there's obvious reasons not to use

456
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:15,409
that sort of a rule in other context in

457
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,410
this context it's just really looking to

458
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,810
me like I want to do it that way so I'm

459
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,779
gonna try doing it that way and then

460
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:27,409
we'll see what happens as we go forwards

461
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:28,970
so when we have like the infinity volume

462
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:33,230
in the inverted infinity volume those

463
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,200
are both not gonna change because we

464
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:39,470
don't care whether the like those are

465
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,690
initial like giant things or completely

466
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,150
impossible things and they don't really

467
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,660
change one way or the other so that part

468
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,400
is not relevant so the only parts we

469
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,870
really care about are these things here

470
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,100
where we've got sort of like mini

471
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:57,199
dimensions for rooms and that sort of

472
00:23:52,099 --> 00:24:00,019
stuff so when we subtract these here we

473
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,480
need to take a look at what the results

474
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:04,460
will be in this case if we have a Max

475
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,259
and a min that are the same they'll

476
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,150
subtract to one if there's yeah so so

477
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:16,210
really what we want here is is I think

478
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:23,210
the same thing that we have it I think

479
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:27,380
to be honest sorry if we have the same

480
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:29,180
they'll subtract to zero so we need to

481
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:33,680
sort of say that the dimension of the

482
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:36,980
room is goo is one more than whatever we

483
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:40,430
would have computed right so I think

484
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,930
what I'd like to do here is just you

485
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,930
know have some sort of

486
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:15,110
so I can talk about them either way and

487
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:16,460
we could actually make these be points

488
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:18,439
as well if we wanted to don't know that

489
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,720
we really care about that one way or the

490
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:32,528
other but but we could right we could

491
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:34,009
call this destruct of of Jen points

492
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:36,648
maybe I will

493
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:38,960
we'll do that a second so if we want to

494
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:43,129
have a thing here which base says like

495
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:52,308
you know and maybe this is more like a

496
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:57,679
Gen B 3 if I want to be able to say get

497
00:25:52,308 --> 00:26:05,329
dim on one of these Jen Williams this

498
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:08,890
allows me to say give me the the

499
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:08,889
computation we would have done here and

500
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,110
I just want to make this expand by one

501
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:26,869
so that allows me to get this sort of

502
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:28,549
understanding of the dimensions of the

503
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:30,229
thing that's got our assumptions about

504
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:31,569
the fill rule baked into it so that

505
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,910
other people don't have to constantly

506
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:36,769
think about what that fill rule is the

507
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,090
fill rule will just automatically sort

508
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:41,119
of be taken into account when you look

509
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:58,129
at the fat fill so then here this

510
00:26:41,119 --> 00:27:00,079
routine can now use that and the same

511
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,060
check will now work because the fill

512
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,159
rule has been baked into here so you do

513
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:08,569
get back the number of tiles that are

514
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,910
included so that seems fine the maximum

515
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:12,470
volume stuff will still work because we

516
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:14,210
just use the mins in the Max's that

517
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,650
there are so that doesn't really affect

518
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,410
get affected by the fill rule because

519
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,990
the fill rule is consistent on both the

520
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:23,509
inner and outer volumes so it just

521
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,150
carries through and the rest of this

522
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:30,200
stuff pretty much just works exactly how

523
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:32,630
you would expect creating the Union and

524
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:41,480
the intersection again still the same

525
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:43,310
although for the intersection I have to

526
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,599
think about whether there's any special

527
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:50,769
considerations I don't think there are I

528
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,769
think it's still fine

529
00:27:51,099 --> 00:28:00,069
all right so let's keep on going here so

530
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:03,650
now when we get to this part for example

531
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:06,619
the min and the max is don't overlap

532
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:09,560
anymore this is particularly important

533
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:14,179
because in the previous version the min

534
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:16,250
the max did so when we say door at we're

535
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:20,000
actually going to get one of the values

536
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,279
as the one we actually want and you can

537
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
see here when we're getting it we we get

538
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:32,509
the min of the door we get the the min

539
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,640
line so wherever the door at is we can

540
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:36,230
just use that column as the map

541
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,170
and the mean is just the column before

542
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:42,798
it so this is now the correct way to

543
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:45,650
place the door in there now we could do

544
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:49,730
this another way which is to do use

545
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:51,590
one's men and one's max which I suppose

546
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,990
is kind of a more interesting way to do

547
00:28:51,589 --> 00:29:00,409
it potentially which would be to do

548
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:06,470
something like this oh you know I don't

549
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:08,750
care we'll just call it that so so

550
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,429
that's fine and I don't mind about the

551
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:13,009
asymmetry here because this is the kind

552
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:15,200
of asymmetry I actually coded myself

553
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:17,599
right I basically said look I'm gonna

554
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,759
start on the min and I know that like 1

555
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,639
back for me is the max so this is all

556
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:25,099
the right thought process this to me is

557
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,630
not a concern these up here were because

558
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:28,009
the thought process was the same on

559
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,380
either side but I was getting two

560
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,329
different equations that's the thing

561
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,790
that flagged it for me as like I should

562
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:39,558
look at this more carefully this is not

563
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:41,389
one of those that is totally fine all

564
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:43,069
right so I think all of this is probably

565
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:47,990
final though we may have to look at it

566
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:53,808
again yeah so so there is one aspect of

567
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:58,808
it which is that this part here it's I

568
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:58,808
think this is a greater than right

569
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:04,569
because you include the max

570
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
right

571
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,038
I'll have to think about how I want

572
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,039
these to work

573
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,779
I think these technically also are a

574
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,339
little bit off right I think it's this

575
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:39,339
because the maximum allowed dimensions

576
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:46,819
for a room are if you were to add that

577
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:51,289
to a min you would get one more than

578
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:53,240
what you actually wanted right now maybe

579
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:55,579
you could argue what we really want to

580
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,009
do here is just talk about dimensions in

581
00:30:55,579 --> 00:31:02,149
a different way like we could talk about

582
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:07,730
a room like if we chose we could say

583
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:11,390
that the dimension of a room is one

584
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:15,440
tiles worth is zero that's a size zero

585
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:17,600
room two tiles is a size one room right

586
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,000
and if you did that you wouldn't need to

587
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,679
put any of these in there because then

588
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,799
the max allowed dim would just already

589
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,049
have the negative one in it so the max

590
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,829
allowed dim for a 16 tile room would be

591
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:41,210
a 15 right I don't know that I want to

592
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:42,589
cross that bridge I maybe that that

593
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,000
would actually be the right thing to do

594
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:45,859
and the code would be simpler everywhere

595
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,579
I just don't know if it's the right

596
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,589
thing to do

597
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:50,240
I I just want to point it out because

598
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:53,529
you can see it right you see it

599
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,980
hopefully what I'm talking about

600
00:31:53,529 --> 00:32:01,670
but I don't know if that's what you

601
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:04,660
would want think that sort of one thing

602
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,660
is that remains to be seen

603
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,359
yeah

604
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:36,419
all right so let's move on I just want

605
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:41,398
to get this old code working and with

606
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:44,700
with the new sort of rule now when we go

607
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:48,868
to room Jen we can actually sort of just

608
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:53,220
quickly fix that the part of this code

609
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:54,778
that actually requires the room vol is

610
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,788
minimal you can see it really only

611
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:58,440
happens at the top here so when we

612
00:32:56,788 --> 00:33:00,450
actually go to generate the room we can

613
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,340
obey the new fill rule pretty trivially

614
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,739
when we look at the X count and we

615
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:08,608
subtract these two things here all we

616
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:09,778
really have to do is that right now if

617
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,308
we want to make it a little simpler

618
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:13,739
ourselves we don't really even have to

619
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:17,239
do that what we can do instead here is

620
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:20,129
talk about one of these Jen VIII's right

621
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:22,829
and just say all right look get me the

622
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,480
dim of the room volume we know that that

623
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:25,918
will automatically compute all these for

624
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,389
us and it'll compute it with the fill

625
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,759
rule so we don't have to know if the

626
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:31,469
fill rate changed we would just work

627
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:36,419
which is kind of nice as well so we can

628
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:39,210
just do that and then this thing keeps

629
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:41,580
on going just fine this is a standing

630
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,739
room stand-in generator anyway this is

631
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:44,939
code we don't care about so we don't

632
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:46,798
have to worry about this part too much

633
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,759
but we will be looking at this code

634
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,089
later on and seeing what we think of it

635
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,878
all right

636
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:55,138
so is in volume also has to be changed

637
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:57,599
here and now that we're sort of getting

638
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:58,769
these bought these Jen Williams things

639
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,079
that we could probably pull those out

640
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,669
into a separate file that has what we

641
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:05,668
want in it so we could see all of the

642
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:08,668
Jen volume stuff and in kind of nicely

643
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:13,108
compacted form so let's see here all

644
00:34:08,668 --> 00:34:15,118
right so we're not quite there yet as

645
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:17,730
far as placing rooms is concerned but

646
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,230
that's basically what we need to do so

647
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:26,639
let me go ahead and pull this out I

648
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:30,059
would like handmade Jen volume or I

649
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,179
don't know if Jen v3 Jen math I don't

650
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:32,179
know

651
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,789
and again these are like just

652
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,990
special-purpose routines that that

653
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:48,150
happen to work however we want them to

654
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:51,029
for just this particular case so they're

655
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:55,430
you know they're not real math routines

656
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,430
they're special kinds of math routines

657
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,180
so let me just go ahead and take a look

658
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:15,920
at everywhere that we're using these

659
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:15,919
sorts of things there we go

660
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:34,199
here's some of our initializers and

661
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:39,150
again all I'm really doing here is just

662
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:44,329
pulling these out so that you can see

663
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,329
them in one place relatively easily

664
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:59,539
there was a little bit more down here

665
00:35:55,748 --> 00:36:00,738
all right so now we can kind of go

666
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:03,829
through and make sure that that stuff

667
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:05,749
works just debug it and then start to

668
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,039
use it which I think hopefully it's a

669
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:09,018
little bit better than what I had before

670
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:12,200
in terms of just the reliability of

671
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:24,498
being able to think it through I hope

672
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:28,509
will increase and who knows maybe it

673
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:28,509
won't maybe that was a waste of time

674
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:39,248
cannot open include file handmade gen

675
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,249
math really

676
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:55,110
Oh whoops they got put in the wrong

677
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:59,490
place my dad so these two actually want

678
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:08,250
to be in code not sure what happened

679
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:12,979
there no big deal though all right so

680
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:17,929
now I think we can go ahead and what

681
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,929
what was that what was that

682
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:24,650
why would what what was that does

683
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:27,180
someone want to tell me what that was

684
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:28,980
why did dividuals - he decided to take a

685
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:33,569
few seconds to do whatever it was gonna

686
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:36,590
do it doesn't always all right so now I

687
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:39,660
think we can go ahead and step through

688
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:42,990
or take a look more closely perhaps I

689
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:46,139
should first just actually make sure

690
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:48,229
this stuff makes senses at face value

691
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:50,699
but then we can go in step two and see

692
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:55,230
how to make sure that we we get this

693
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:56,489
stuff right so as for its in volume like

694
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,659
I said I think that's right now because

695
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,629
we're saying the min and the max are

696
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:02,670
both included for our infinity volumes

697
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,050
and inverted infinity volumes those are

698
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,380
again both what you'd expect they're

699
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:09,500
just setting large inclusive or soar

700
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,210
opposite bounds one of the other

701
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,710
forgetting things like testing minimum

702
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,679
dimensions of the room we just need to

703
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,659
get the dimensions of the rim which we

704
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:20,129
do here and I think we do correctly here

705
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,589
which is one more than whatever the

706
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:25,110
difference is we then just say look if

707
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,590
we're greater than 4 or 4/1 then we're

708
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,599
good to go for get maximum volume for

709
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,090
again still just taking them in the max

710
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:35,339
and the two inputs that's the same for

711
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,840
clipping we just always clip to the

712
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,950
actual value that we're given which is

713
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:44,850
exactly what we think should happen the

714
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:47,669
Union and the intersect are not changed

715
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:50,159
they should just be the same and so all

716
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,349
that looks fine so we must have

717
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,969
something in the actual usage code or I

718
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:55,739
just like skipped over something there

719
00:38:53,969 --> 00:38:56,189
accidentally but we should have

720
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,939
something in the

721
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:03,619
usage code that I busted and did an

722
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:07,530
update because that all looks fine

723
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:09,539
alright and that actually makes sense

724
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,920
because I guess we got to go

725
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,869
double-check that we're clipping

726
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,950
properly to that we're clipping to the

727
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:19,318
things we actually want to clip you uh

728
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:21,689
so yeah the minimum has to be clipped to

729
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:30,659
the max plus one that makes sense the

730
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:35,789
max has to be clipped to the max I feel

731
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:37,618
like this is also I feel like doesn't

732
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:39,858
everything just have to be clipped to

733
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,858
here

734
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:51,980
maybe I'm wrong about that but I this

735
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:56,030
shouldn't really affect anything I think

736
00:39:51,980 --> 00:40:00,289
but I believe when we're clipping

737
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:02,660
basically what we want to say is the min

738
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:05,480
and the max of the minimum can now not

739
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:07,818
go past that bound and of course the

740
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:12,740
maximum also can't go past it on the

741
00:40:07,818 --> 00:40:15,380
minimum side it's basically saying hey

742
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:20,929
look I need to set the minimum needs to

743
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:23,690
lie on this line right but the the

744
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:29,000
maximum just can't go past it and the

745
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:34,220
same is true here it's basically just

746
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:38,210
saying the maximum value of the minimum

747
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:40,368
now can't go past this line and the min

748
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,530
and the max of the Maxwell are set to

749
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:47,390
that line so it has to be there so that

750
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:57,500
seems right to me that doesn't seem at

751
00:40:47,389 --> 00:41:01,818
all odd or unusual here where we're

752
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:05,289
clipping the min in the max to the

753
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:05,288
interior apron that seems fine

754
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,769
so that all seems good so I would say

755
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,019
it's probably this code down here that's

756
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:17,780
a little bit borked because all that

757
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:19,579
looks fine to me in here we've got the

758
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:23,620
dimensions we're iterating through the

759
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,619
min of the max just our with minimax our

760
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:31,130
we take a look at whether we exceed the

761
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:34,539
maximum allowed dimensions for that

762
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:37,070
particular dimension in question

763
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:40,579
assuming that we do exceed the maximum

764
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:43,220
dimension in question we want to just

765
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:45,440
set the max equal to wherever the

766
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:54,669
minimum is plus whatever the allowed

767
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:54,670
dimension is minus 1 that seems fine

768
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,170
I don't see a problem with that so then

769
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:13,730
we say okay if the max as a result of

770
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:18,920
setting it that way would have exceeded

771
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:21,619
wherever its minimum location could have

772
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,809
been we need to move it to that minimum

773
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:26,710
location and then we need to set the

774
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:28,970
minimum to be whatever the maximum is -

775
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:34,159
yeah so we're setting it off of the

776
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:36,469
other direction now again that seems

777
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:41,358
fine then we look to see okay if the min

778
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:43,129
volume is greater than whatever its

779
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,078
maximum was allowed to be then we can't

780
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,900
actually fill it and then we go ahead

781
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:51,109
and do a place room so yeah I don't know

782
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:54,139
I don't see a lot of error there but

783
00:42:51,108 --> 00:42:57,108
then again you never do do you place

784
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:58,909
room in volume I'm gonna see if we ever

785
00:42:57,108 --> 00:43:05,719
get there just so I know who's at fault

786
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:07,578
here so it looks like that routine at

787
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:09,669
least thinks it succeeds not only let's

788
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:13,339
see what the volume it actually gives is

789
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:15,680
negative 4 to 4 day to 4 to 4 mins Eid

790
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:19,608
and Maxie so it actually created a room

791
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:26,778
it's to two things high which was not

792
00:43:19,608 --> 00:43:30,068
really my intention now I think about it

793
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:30,068
that's because this is the initial room

794
00:43:32,498 --> 00:43:35,949
let's try in here

795
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:43,800
kind of item to get here negative 20

796
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,780
negative 8 0 2 negative 5 0 0 again a

797
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,400
perfectly legal room so it looks like

798
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,180
that code is actually working probably

799
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,539
let me just fix one slight problem here

800
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:58,799
which is the initial room placement

801
00:43:53,539 --> 00:44:04,110
actually should look more you know like

802
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,130
let's say that because it'd be negative

803
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:08,670
for name of 3 and negative 2 and

804
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:12,570
negative 1 or the first for 0 1 2 3 or

805
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:17,809
the next 4 and that's what it should be

806
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:17,809
set to so assuming we look at that oops

807
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:26,340
what we should see now is we should be

808
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:30,990
able to see in the the actual thing that

809
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:33,720
generates the room data right I don't

810
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:36,299
know where that went off to it's this

811
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:40,439
code but it just didn't end up on the

812
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:42,030
tabs there so in this code we should be

813
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,099
able to see now why we're not actually

814
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:47,490
placing a room here so what's our

815
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:51,659
dimensions it's 8 8 1 that seems very

816
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:56,969
reasonable X count why count

817
00:44:51,659 --> 00:45:01,079
Z count negative 4 negative 4 0 it seems

818
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:04,709
like that should be producing a valid

819
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:10,409
you know region so I'm not sure why we

820
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:15,420
weren't seeing anything hmm I guess I

821
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:17,940
must have done something weird there may

822
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,820
be an initial height of 2 created some

823
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,550
kind of a confusion I don't know why we

824
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,200
have to oh maybe that's why vigils to

825
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,640
excite because I had another visual

826
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,259
studio running maybe if you try to run a

827
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,639
visual studio on top of another visual

828
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,530
studio it takes longer to load or

829
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:40,259
something I don't know I don't know why

830
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:42,930
it would so yeah just looking at just

831
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,410
looking at what that did that seems

832
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:47,879
pretty pretty straightforward now we're

833
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:51,039
not quite there yet because we should

834
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,539
have placed well I guess I don't know we

835
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:57,460
may only be placing two rooms right now

836
00:45:52,539 --> 00:46:00,130
I'm not sure but but either way that

837
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:02,619
seems a little bit more saying to me I'm

838
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:05,289
I'm much more okay with that

839
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:13,839
then I was with the other way round so

840
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:17,650
let's try to let's try to make something

841
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,680
with with this understanding of what a

842
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:24,269
volume is let's try to make some code

843
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:31,029
that like lays out a particular

844
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:34,630
organization for what we want right so

845
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:37,330
how hard is it to manually code a

846
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:45,250
particular layout so let's say we've got

847
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:47,949
the orphanage here and we know exactly

848
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:49,750
how we want it it's just it's a fixed

849
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:52,689
layout right we're not going to let the

850
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,860
generation code do anything when it sees

851
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:57,579
orphanage it's got to layout exactly

852
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:59,440
this thing right so how would we go

853
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:02,049
about like coding something that looked

854
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,170
did a particular layout so let's let's

855
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:14,140
actually make how I want that to happen

856
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:19,180
so let's say there's like let's say

857
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:27,359
there's a hallway here and I want to

858
00:47:19,179 --> 00:47:27,359
have bedrooms off of it

859
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:39,739
something like that and maybe there's a

860
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:45,528
hallway here maybe this is the same room

861
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:45,528
probably not say these are both hallways

862
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:54,469
so you got rooms off the hallway and

863
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:56,608
then maybe you've got the kitchen I

864
00:47:54,469 --> 00:48:00,389
don't really know I don't study

865
00:47:56,608 --> 00:48:06,920
orphanages I don't know how they would

866
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:10,409
be laid out this is the main room and

867
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,470
then maybe there's the backdoor area

868
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:25,739
look maybe this is actually the side

869
00:48:13,469 --> 00:48:32,480
alley and this is the forest path in the

870
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:34,469
forest entrance and this is the garden

871
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:40,889
hello wait for a sense for the garden to

872
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:43,250
be in the back wouldn't it maybe take

873
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:43,250
everything

874
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:52,199
I guess technically there was a

875
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,200
tailoring room here

876
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:05,679
I know that seems reasonable alright so

877
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:11,568
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna do two

878
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:12,739
different steps the first step is I'm

879
00:49:11,568 --> 00:49:14,208
gonna make something that basically

880
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:18,199
looks like this horrible diagram here

881
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:19,848
and tries to lay out exactly this the

882
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:22,639
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going

883
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:26,838
to try to make something that uses its

884
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:29,298
effectively a an unlocked able to make

885
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:32,509
the orphanage expand based on what the

886
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:34,038
player has you know unlocked right and

887
00:49:32,509 --> 00:49:35,690
we don't actually care about unlocking

888
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:37,729
at this point it's not relevant to us

889
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:40,219
what we care about is whether it makes

890
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:42,139
it easy for the code again to talk about

891
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:44,269
stuff like does this room exist or

892
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:47,118
doesn't it exist does this hallway need

893
00:49:44,268 --> 00:49:48,919
to be here or not that sort of stuff

894
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:54,259
and again the reason I'm doing this is

895
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:57,409
because I want to get I want to convince

896
00:49:54,259 --> 00:50:00,048
myself remaining skeptical I want to

897
00:49:57,409 --> 00:50:06,739
convince myself that talking about

898
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:09,548
inclusive on their bounds volumes I want

899
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:11,900
to convince myself that that's the most

900
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:15,920
error-free there or the least

901
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:21,528
error-prone way of discussing what tiles

902
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:23,568
a room encloses because I'm still not

903
00:50:21,528 --> 00:50:26,568
sure that's what I want I just suspect

904
00:50:23,568 --> 00:50:29,119
that it's what I want and until I

905
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:31,308
actually see more evidence though I

906
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,289
don't want to commit to it so we're just

907
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:34,759
gonna do those two steps again they're

908
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:36,170
fairly straightforward but they were

909
00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:38,958
gonna require me to do a bunch of

910
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:40,940
thinking about how to specify room

911
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:42,379
bounds and that's exactly what I want to

912
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,139
be doing because I want to see how many

913
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:47,778
mistakes I make and if those mistakes

914
00:50:45,139 --> 00:50:50,358
are related to that part of the code

915
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:53,088
that I'm talking about right that should

916
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:55,548
give me a litmus test as to whether or

917
00:50:53,088 --> 00:51:00,469
not this is a sane way of describing

918
00:50:55,548 --> 00:51:03,409
what I'm describing okay so what I'm

919
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:06,048
going to do here is I'm going to start

920
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:08,088
to talk about these rooms a little bit

921
00:51:06,048 --> 00:51:09,679
differently I'm gonna do the same thing

922
00:51:08,088 --> 00:51:10,730
that I did before where I just generated

923
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,998
all the rooms

924
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:21,969
in question and

925
00:51:13,998 --> 00:51:24,198
I don't know if the backdoor path I

926
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:26,778
think what we're really talking about

927
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:28,969
here is there's like two hallways those

928
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:31,458
hallways at the moment are not

929
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:35,599
represented so we need those two

930
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:52,188
we need the like front hall and the back

931
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:55,459
hall and these are actually gonna be

932
00:51:52,188 --> 00:51:57,558
more up in here with I guess will a

933
00:51:55,458 --> 00:52:05,239
basic hall spec kind of thing these are

934
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:12,229
hallways I don't know if that's always

935
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:13,668
spec so these are just gonna be and

936
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:15,618
again we're not carrying about the spec

937
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:17,838
stuff yet that's just a placeholder to

938
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:19,489
sort of say hey look somehow we're gonna

939
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,409
have to talk about what's in a hallway

940
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:24,378
in addition to the fact that it is a

941
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:26,389
hallway and so that'll be where that

942
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:29,808
stuff starts getting expanded on when

943
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:31,219
we're ready but not yet so once I have

944
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:33,829
these rooms now I want to be able to

945
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:39,289
place these rooms and in some in some

946
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:41,749
way that makes sense and so what I want

947
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:44,889
to do is say all right let's put on hold

948
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:47,148
this notion of connections that are

949
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:50,889
nonspecific and let's start talking

950
00:52:47,148 --> 00:52:54,648
about connections that are specific I

951
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:57,378
want to tell you where I expect these

952
00:52:54,648 --> 00:52:59,389
things to be placed and then from then

953
00:52:57,378 --> 00:53:00,860
from there on we can

954
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:06,869
[Music]

955
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:09,660
get a little bit more fancy right so

956
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:12,920
looking at the diagram here what I want

957
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:18,299
to do is start to talk about how

958
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:20,369
connections can be placed around around

959
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,490
a room I guess would be the way to say

960
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:26,789
it and so I need some way of

961
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:28,829
articulating that and I don't know what

962
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:30,750
the right way to do it would be but I

963
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:42,329
suspect that it might be something like

964
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:47,400
this so a connection is a side plus an

965
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:49,860
ordinal and then what I will do is say

966
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:54,269
that as I say what side you're connected

967
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:57,539
on I can effectively give you an ordinal

968
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:59,940
that says where you are so the zeroth

969
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:05,179
connection is here the first is here the

970
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:05,179
second is here the third is here right

971
00:54:06,769 --> 00:54:12,000
and that'll give me a way of just

972
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:15,450
placing things along the sides of rooms

973
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:20,489
and then I can just iterate over them

974
00:54:15,449 --> 00:54:22,889
and put them there and so in here I can

975
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:24,629
just say look when we're doing this

976
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:26,460
connection let's say now there's an

977
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:29,610
extended version of the connection call

978
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:36,570
which actually specifies what side

979
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:40,200
we're on I believe we have a what was it

980
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:42,600
called box I believe we have surface

981
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:44,849
indices that can help us here we can use

982
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:47,519
this to talk about what side of the

983
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:48,900
thing you're on in a consistent way that

984
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:52,739
we already built like a bunch of

985
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:54,660
information about so what I should be

986
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:56,609
able to say here is I want this

987
00:54:54,659 --> 00:55:01,739
connection to go in this specific

988
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:04,260
location and let's let's do that so

989
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:06,479
going from the main room to the bedroom

990
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,190
that's not what that is anymore let's

991
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,690
say that this is let me let me actually

992
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,769
lay these out specifically on the

993
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,050
diagram so we know we're talking about

994
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:16,250
here a B C and D as well

995
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:18,660
hero so let's just say that's like

996
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:24,929
here's the hero's bedroom

997
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:28,980
here's a B C and D looks like there

998
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:31,859
might be an e here across that bridge

999
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:34,079
when we come to it also maybe the maybe

1000
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:35,820
we want this to be you know what let's

1001
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:41,340
let's let's make a slight change let's

1002
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:49,170
make this a little bit more sane let me

1003
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:54,390
redraw this so if this is the main room

1004
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:55,829
let's say that we've got kitchen and the

1005
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:57,869
tailor here

1006
00:55:55,829 --> 00:56:00,139
let's say that the hallway runs like

1007
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:00,139
this

1008
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:09,099
[Music]

1009
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:17,099
right so we got the ABCD bedrooms here

1010
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:21,120
and then let's say that the hero bedroom

1011
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:23,099
is like right here and I feel like I

1012
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:28,980
kind of want this because I want these

1013
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:29,880
other bedrooms here to kind of be

1014
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,559
available

1015
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,539
the reason is like if we wanted to have

1016
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:35,579
some save slots I was thinking that

1017
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:38,460
maybe the save slops slots just mapped

1018
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:44,130
to a bedroom so basically like you know

1019
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:47,070
this is slot a slot B and slot C for

1020
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:50,220
save games and so maybe the way that you

1021
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:51,870
start your game is you pick which one of

1022
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:58,889
these you want to start in and then you

1023
00:56:51,869 --> 00:57:00,239
hop out into the hall and go right maybe

1024
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:04,799
that's how you saved your game - you hop

1025
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:06,539
back in right so I don't know I'm just

1026
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,740
throwing that out there but let's just

1027
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:10,469
leave it like that because I feel like

1028
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:12,299
that's how I want to do it and so then

1029
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:15,709
we would just have out here here is the

1030
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:24,060
forest path area

1031
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:30,590
here's that side alley and here's the

1032
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:30,590
garden yep

1033
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,170
so that seems reasonable so let's go

1034
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:39,460
ahead and and just make that happen

1035
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:40,750
right so here we have the main room and

1036
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,369
we know there's a bunch of stuff

1037
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,289
connected to the main room so I'm just

1038
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:47,619
going to go ahead I'm gonna just nuke

1039
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:49,329
this stuff because I need to kind of

1040
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:51,700
rewrite it from a diagram which is a bit

1041
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:53,890
different than it was before so I'm

1042
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:55,588
gonna go ahead and try to make that

1043
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:59,409
happen

1044
00:57:55,588 --> 00:58:01,538
so from the main room I'm gonna say that

1045
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:06,940
we can go like that's the westward

1046
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:09,299
direction right so I'm going to say for

1047
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:16,179
the main room we could go to the kitchen

1048
00:58:09,298 --> 00:58:19,179
and we can go to the tailor and I'm just

1049
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:21,190
gonna say just a priority like I was

1050
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:25,058
saying before that these will just be

1051
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:27,068
ordinal based so that will just say that

1052
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:31,559
the kitchen comes first and the tailor

1053
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:33,880
comes next in that order for now right

1054
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,230
as we start to play this a little bit

1055
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,349
more I might have stronger feelings

1056
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:39,909
about how that should work but for now

1057
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:42,130
I'm just gonna do it that way because I

1058
00:58:39,909 --> 00:58:44,230
don't have a particular other way in

1059
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,829
mind that I think is somehow really

1060
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:50,469
awesome or you know whatever so then I'm

1061
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:53,339
gonna go ahead and say all right we know

1062
00:58:50,469 --> 00:59:02,048
that we've got to the south

1063
00:58:53,338 --> 00:59:06,489
we've got the front hall let me do these

1064
00:59:02,048 --> 00:59:07,568
in in counterclockwise order like a like

1065
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:11,608
a good boy

1066
00:59:07,568 --> 00:59:14,440
so blocks index North is the forest path

1067
00:59:11,608 --> 00:59:16,630
so now I'm seeing right like how those

1068
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,400
are connected there but not saying

1069
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:23,700
exactly where they are yet we'll get to

1070
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,700
that in a second so I want to have those

1071
00:59:24,059 --> 00:59:28,298
that's all the connections for the main

1072
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:31,180
room there are no other connections from

1073
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:34,480
the main room for the back sorry the

1074
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:35,528
front hall let's do the same thing so

1075
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:41,278
starting on the east

1076
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:41,278
we've got bedroom B and ND

1077
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:46,389
I don't really care what order they go

1078
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:48,039
in but if we wanted to be the same as

1079
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:51,609
this diagram we would have D first then

1080
00:59:48,039 --> 00:59:55,329
B it's going again counterclockwise

1081
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:57,340
around the ring and and then I need to

1082
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:58,949
connect myself to the main room that's

1083
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,420
already taken care of it's right here

1084
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:17,649
and I need to connect myself to the back

1085
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:19,539
hall and a and C so there we go now one

1086
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:22,750
thing that I suppose is a little bit

1087
01:00:19,539 --> 01:00:26,710
tricky here is it's hard to say for a

1088
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:30,099
given connection the order in which the

1089
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:33,210
things get added is different depending

1090
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:33,210
on which room you're talking about

1091
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:48,230
so I suppose now that I think about it

1092
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:50,269
it kind of needs to be not that right

1093
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:52,579
counterclockwise is not sufficient

1094
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:54,920
actually the reason it's not sufficient

1095
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:58,489
is because let's suppose I'm talking

1096
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:04,789
about a connection between these two

1097
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:19,759
rooms furthermore let me do something a

1098
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:21,590
little bit more specific sooo given what

1099
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,000
I was talking about before the order in

1100
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:25,000
which these things connect

1101
01:01:36,929 --> 01:01:44,730
I guess yeah all right so I'll be honest

1102
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,380
maybe it's not true maybe you could

1103
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:48,179
always add them in the order that makes

1104
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:50,068
it so that it's correct order for both

1105
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:52,108
rooms but the point that I was going to

1106
01:01:50,068 --> 01:01:54,150
get to was just that it becomes a little

1107
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,949
bit finicky because you're like well the

1108
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:57,720
order in which I add these maybe the

1109
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:59,460
order should just be strictly in

1110
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:01,199
ascending and I think I wanted that

1111
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,280
anyway it's just easier if I just do

1112
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:04,259
strictly ascending or strictly

1113
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,369
descending order on a connection that

1114
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,050
makes it easier because doesn't matter

1115
01:02:05,369 --> 01:02:08,220
what side you're talking about if I'm

1116
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,780
talking about this side and I want to

1117
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:11,519
know the connections here I know they

1118
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:16,230
just go from like smallest to greatest

1119
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:17,670
or whatever right in order and vice

1120
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:19,409
versa

1121
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:26,068
no matter which side you're on that

1122
01:02:19,409 --> 01:02:27,929
seems like just the more sane thing so I

1123
01:02:26,068 --> 01:02:30,480
don't know it may not matter but I think

1124
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:32,969
I may do it that way so I think I may

1125
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,920
say look let's just make it so that we

1126
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:38,549
say we always go from smallest to

1127
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:42,050
greatest so coming back here Taylor

1128
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:42,050
would be first kitchen would be second

1129
01:02:46,489 --> 01:02:53,639
forest path and Hall are the only things

1130
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:56,039
on their side so those don't matter so

1131
01:02:53,639 --> 01:03:05,429
then coming in here we've got it would

1132
01:02:56,039 --> 01:03:07,969
be d B and C a and then we need to check

1133
01:03:05,429 --> 01:03:07,969
to the back hall

1134
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:22,739
so now that we've got that connection in

1135
01:03:17,518 --> 01:03:33,889
place we can connect up the the bedrooms

1136
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:37,499
in the garden right now we only have one

1137
01:03:33,889 --> 01:03:57,239
let's let's call these let's actually

1138
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:58,649
just do what I said I mean why not and

1139
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:00,329
so here I'm just going to say all of

1140
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:06,568
those are connected and then of course

1141
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:12,859
also you can get out to the east is the

1142
01:04:06,568 --> 01:04:16,670
garden and then this is just a chain

1143
01:04:12,858 --> 01:04:16,670
these have very few

1144
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:40,190
this is just like garden goes the alley

1145
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:46,849
alley goes to the path path goes to the

1146
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:49,820
entrance and that's it so that creates

1147
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:55,279
all of the connections and says what

1148
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:57,920
side those connections have to be on and

1149
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,500
from there actually we could imagine our

1150
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,960
layout routine as we get further into it

1151
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,969
just taking it from there

1152
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,970
what I want to do here though is

1153
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:10,549
actually just be a little more

1154
01:05:07,969 --> 01:05:15,799
prescriptive than that which is to say

1155
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:17,630
that I may want to just specify the

1156
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,519
sizes of the rooms because the thing so

1157
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:21,920
once it knows all of this information

1158
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:25,789
the only really thing it has to figure

1159
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,980
out is how big each room is right so

1160
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:30,440
that's the like parameter if you will

1161
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:32,809
that needs to get solved for for lack of

1162
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,190
a better term how big is each room they

1163
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:37,460
said it that's that's the space of

1164
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:39,230
parameters because whether or not a

1165
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:41,690
particular layout will succeed or fail

1166
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,769
is just how big is each room and to like

1167
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:44,929
make that a little bit more concrete

1168
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:46,940
when it went to lay these things out if

1169
01:05:44,929 --> 01:05:50,539
for example it didn't make the hallway

1170
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:53,000
long like that it wouldn't be able to

1171
01:05:50,539 --> 01:05:58,130
fit all of the room connections on it

1172
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,110
without overlapping some of these okay

1173
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:04,849
but I want to be a little bit more

1174
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:07,370
specific than that what I want to do

1175
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:10,549
here is actually sort of say how big the

1176
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:12,109
rooms are and then have all the only

1177
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:16,190
thing that layout routine actually is

1178
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:19,430
responsible for is just making sure that

1179
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:21,170
it places the things on the connections

1180
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:26,299
that are that it's supposed to place

1181
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:30,039
them on right and that's it so let me go

1182
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:30,039
ahead and prescribe some of that stuff

1183
01:06:32,619 --> 01:07:22,469
so I want to set the size of all of this

1184
01:06:36,909 --> 01:07:25,779
stuff all right take a catacomb there

1185
01:07:22,469 --> 01:07:28,299
main room save slots the front all the

1186
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:30,100
backhaul the bedrooms the tailor room

1187
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:35,500
the kitchen the garden the fourth path

1188
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:39,750
the floor suicidality okay so I do want

1189
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:43,510
to do one thing and that's nurse this

1190
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:49,690
why don't if this if I don't have the

1191
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:52,570
side alley then I don't have a cycle in

1192
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:54,750
my graph and if I set the sizes of any

1193
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:57,220
of everything and don't have a cycle

1194
01:07:54,750 --> 01:08:00,190
then I think the route the room should

1195
01:07:57,219 --> 01:08:01,839
pretty much be always fairly easy for

1196
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:03,360
the routine to lay out and like I said

1197
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:09,519
we don't actually need to solve anything

1198
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:11,559
yet to have them be laid out so what I

1199
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:14,259
would like to do is set these sizes

1200
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:17,500
reasonably so the main room is going to

1201
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:25,420
be like a larger room maybe something

1202
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:25,810
like a 16 by 16 the tailor room and the

1203
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:30,449
kitchen

1204
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:30,450
maybe those are like eight

1205
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:42,600
sixes something like that

1206
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:44,039
I don't know if six wide is quite long

1207
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,600
enough for a kitchen in a tailor room

1208
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:52,189
but I don't know let's say that it is

1209
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:52,190
for now then we've got the hallway

1210
01:08:53,810 --> 01:09:03,000
that's just gonna be like a narrow room

1211
01:08:57,829 --> 01:09:07,318
maybe five wide let's say and it will be

1212
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:13,409
fairly long though then we've got the

1213
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:15,660
bedrooms those bedrooms should be like

1214
01:09:13,409 --> 01:09:20,068
pretty small

1215
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:25,139
I guess that will just make 8 by 6 be

1216
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:26,460
our standard size for now all right so

1217
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,350
then we want a backhaul this is going to

1218
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:30,529
be opposite of the other one this is

1219
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:36,690
gonna be more like a sixteen by five

1220
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:37,440
right the save slots maybe your rooms

1221
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:43,409
pretty tiny

1222
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:46,619
sorry Hiro and there's three across the

1223
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:52,170
bottom so this actually wouldn't quite

1224
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:56,579
fit along the bottom so you know maybe

1225
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:58,260
more like that again sorry sorry Hiro

1226
01:09:56,579 --> 01:10:05,189
you're so tiny maybe we'll expand those

1227
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:12,989
out so the garden that should be pretty

1228
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:17,599
big I think as well and then there's no

1229
01:10:12,988 --> 01:10:17,599
alley at the moment the forest path

1230
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:24,630
again should be probably a pretty big

1231
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:28,969
area the forest entrance can be a more

1232
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:28,970
narrow and then the side alley

1233
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:39,269
just as an involved um I'm gonna go

1234
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:41,250
ahead and pass the generator here

1235
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:43,860
because generally speaking we just

1236
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:45,779
passed generator as the first parameter

1237
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:47,369
to things because it's sort of the

1238
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:49,079
context the things operate in and we

1239
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:51,390
don't know if we may need it to look up

1240
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:54,000
parameters and stuff like that

1241
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:56,400
get memory or do other sorts of things

1242
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,340
so it would be nice if those things were

1243
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,379
available alright so now we have to

1244
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:04,079
actually add these informational

1245
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:08,609
functions that we've created in so that

1246
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:11,569
we can specify specifically more

1247
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:15,198
information about these rooms and so on

1248
01:11:11,569 --> 01:11:18,658
alright so when we do actual connect

1249
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:21,059
there's this other version of the call

1250
01:11:18,658 --> 01:11:22,859
that I wanted now you might ask why I

1251
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:25,409
didn't just use the direction mask from

1252
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:30,269
a the reason was I didn't like it being

1253
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:33,509
specified at the end and the reason I

1254
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:35,070
didn't like it being specify at the end

1255
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:37,829
I guess this isn't a mass this is just

1256
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:40,500
the direction I wanted to say let going

1257
01:11:37,829 --> 01:11:42,479
from from A to B put the direction in

1258
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,210
the middle right and so this is just

1259
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:48,059
another way of talking about one of

1260
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:50,960
these and it can just be turned into a

1261
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:56,310
regular connect call and we can actually

1262
01:11:50,960 --> 01:12:00,000
have this be a call directly to connect

1263
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:04,320
that all it does is create the mask from

1264
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,469
the from the index right and we have

1265
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:10,649
that get surface mask here we don't have

1266
01:12:07,469 --> 01:12:14,390
one from a box index I don't think but

1267
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:14,389
we should we should add one

1268
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:37,219
so get surface max mask from one of

1269
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:38,420
these again very straightforward but I'm

1270
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,948
just gonna leave it that way so you can

1271
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,719
see what's happening you have to wonder

1272
01:12:39,948 --> 01:12:46,309
why I'm doing this weird shift up thing

1273
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:48,560
right and furthermore I guess since this

1274
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:49,969
is only ever one direction here I can

1275
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,620
just make this a surface index so that

1276
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:53,659
the compiler will type check that and

1277
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:56,238
make sure that someone doesn't pass more

1278
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:57,889
than just one direction there and when I

1279
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:02,000
say more than one direction I mean like

1280
01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:05,810
more than the band One Direction so let

1281
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:09,710
me let me just call that our connect

1282
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:14,780
call Co and an ECT not the defunct

1283
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:19,340
peripheral ki an ECT let's go ahead and

1284
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:22,769
build I've got some typos

1285
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,770
[Music]

1286
01:13:26,899 --> 01:13:33,619
there we go I don't know what these are

1287
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:38,210
here what did we call that as a tailor

1288
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:42,380
room yes tailor room here a bedroom is

1289
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:44,569
not a real thing anymore Hiro bedroom is

1290
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:49,069
just gonna be like let's say hero save

1291
01:13:44,569 --> 01:13:51,619
slot a so now we just need this ability

1292
01:13:49,069 --> 01:13:54,649
to set the size of a room so that we can

1293
01:13:51,619 --> 01:13:57,349
pre say how big we want it to actually

1294
01:13:54,649 --> 01:14:00,109
be and again this is very similar to a

1295
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:03,289
Kinect call in the sense that it's it's

1296
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:05,239
adding sort of information to the layout

1297
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:07,519
that says I'm constraining where these

1298
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:10,279
rooms can be this is saying I'm

1299
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:14,030
constraining the room to be specifically

1300
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:16,090
this big so there's some DMX maybe I'll

1301
01:14:14,029 --> 01:14:19,460
sleep in this because there's a dim X

1302
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:22,010
and a gym why there's probably also

1303
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:23,630
technically a dim Z but we can just

1304
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:26,210
assume that it's one most of the time

1305
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:28,880
because we don't really use height a lot

1306
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:33,409
our engine supports rooms that are fat

1307
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:35,180
in that way hmm and maybe someday we

1308
01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:39,050
will find use for them but you know it's

1309
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:41,240
really just not like we typically will

1310
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:42,680
expect to have rooms stacked on top of

1311
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:46,369
each other we will not expect to have

1312
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:48,050
rooms that are too tall maybe there'll

1313
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:51,019
be a reason to have it at some point I

1314
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:52,760
don't know what that reason would be so

1315
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:55,270
it's good that the engine supports it

1316
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,500
but I don't actually know that we care

1317
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:01,160
so anyway when we go in to set the size

1318
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:03,949
here what we want to do is talk about in

1319
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:06,109
the sort of world Jen descriptions where

1320
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:08,899
we talk about what the room has and what

1321
01:15:06,109 --> 01:15:11,539
its spec is what I want to do is say

1322
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:15,889
look in in here we know that this is

1323
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:19,850
what the volume of the room is we want

1324
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:23,960
to set that and we can do one of two

1325
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:27,230
things either we could just say that if

1326
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:31,000
the volume of the room is set to

1327
01:15:27,229 --> 01:15:34,549
something on entry we need to use it or

1328
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,960
we can have something in here which sort

1329
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:40,750
of additionally specifies that there was

1330
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,920
a volume constraint

1331
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:55,029
the room and so for example what we

1332
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:57,090
could do is say here is a volume which

1333
01:15:55,029 --> 01:16:02,529
says what the minimum maximum volume is

1334
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:06,190
right I and we could set that by default

1335
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:08,739
to the infinity rectangle there which

1336
01:16:06,189 --> 01:16:12,789
says what the minimum maximum volume can

1337
01:16:08,739 --> 01:16:13,420
be anything you please I and then we go

1338
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:17,409
from there

1339
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:19,230
so I don't know how we want to set that

1340
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:22,319
at the moment

1341
01:16:19,229 --> 01:16:22,319
[Music]

1342
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:52,090
I am unsure about that so part of me

1343
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,800
like that generality the other part of

1344
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:54,850
me goes well really that's not what's

1345
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:59,230
going on here

1346
01:16:54,850 --> 01:17:01,780
like I think most of the time if we care

1347
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:05,409
this what what a room looks like it's

1348
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:06,729
probably going to be specific right so

1349
01:17:05,409 --> 01:17:11,010
I'm guessing that we really have

1350
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:11,009
something that's a little bit more like

1351
01:17:18,869 --> 01:17:28,300
or something like this so you know we

1352
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:30,760
set a required dimension and if the

1353
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:34,360
required dimension is not like zero zero

1354
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:37,750
zero then we know that we've like said

1355
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:40,500
it has to be this size like it has to be

1356
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:42,640
this many rooms big you know I'm saying

1357
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,850
so I'm thinking that we've got something

1358
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:58,770
more like okay this room's required dim

1359
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:58,770
I don't know why I made four of those

1360
01:18:04,988 --> 01:18:19,089
so I guess that would technically I mean

1361
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:20,948
Einstein taught us there were four

1362
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:23,050
dimensions right and the time is one of

1363
01:18:20,948 --> 01:18:26,339
them so I mean who are we to disagree

1364
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:30,039
with Einstein he is you know a

1365
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:31,300
historical figure to be reckoned with

1366
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,829
and I certainly don't want to have to

1367
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:34,989
argue with him that there aren't four

1368
01:18:32,829 --> 01:18:37,119
dimensions because he will probably

1369
01:18:34,988 --> 01:18:43,179
prevail in that argument and where would

1370
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:46,750
that leave me anyway the the required

1371
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:48,730
dimensions if we set those then when we

1372
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,779
go to place a room we know that we don't

1373
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:52,750
really have to think about the

1374
01:18:49,779 --> 01:18:55,479
dimensions much anymore we can just sort

1375
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:58,149
of place rooms with the dimensions that

1376
01:18:55,479 --> 01:19:00,849
we encounter and so then we can sort of

1377
01:18:58,149 --> 01:19:03,429
simplify that routine that we were

1378
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:08,590
looking at or I don't know that I want

1379
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:12,640
to actually get rid of it here but you

1380
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:17,289
know I guess basically saying this

1381
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:21,270
placement code as it stands is not

1382
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:21,269
something we're going to use right

1383
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:36,550
in fact we just don't need that

1384
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:39,150
particular place room call so in here

1385
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:43,650
when we kind of scoot through things so

1386
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:48,369
I'm gonna go ahead and and do sort of a

1387
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:49,629
an excision on this and say that we're

1388
01:19:48,369 --> 01:20:00,309
just going to assume the volume is

1389
01:19:49,630 --> 01:20:02,680
they're trying to think of how I want to

1390
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:10,300
do this so I think what I want to do is

1391
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:11,829
sort of rewrite this loop this part I

1392
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:22,329
don't care about anymore we don't need

1393
01:20:11,829 --> 01:20:25,439
it and so what I want to do I think is

1394
01:20:22,329 --> 01:20:25,439
try another one of these

1395
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:42,010
uh so I want to do basically what I was

1396
01:20:38,738 --> 01:20:57,279
doing before or at least something

1397
01:20:42,010 --> 01:21:00,579
similar but what I want to do here is

1398
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:06,609
say okay if I don't know where this room

1399
01:21:00,578 --> 01:21:14,769
should be yet then I sort of place it

1400
01:21:06,609 --> 01:21:16,658
based on I mean mmm I want to rewrite

1401
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:19,389
this routine so that I always know where

1402
01:21:16,658 --> 01:21:23,649
the room is before I start to visit it

1403
01:21:19,389 --> 01:21:26,949
right so when I pop a room off

1404
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:29,649
I expect to already know where it is and

1405
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:34,589
all I'm gonna do is place the rooms that

1406
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:39,638
are next to that room and push them on

1407
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:45,119
the sack I think that's what I want to

1408
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:45,118
do you notice my hesitancy here

1409
01:21:56,539 --> 01:22:01,079
but I think that's what I'm gonna do so

1410
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:03,090
I'm just gonna try and stamp that so

1411
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:06,090
hereís my much time do I have by the way

1412
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:08,400
I've got 15 minutes left right yeah

1413
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:22,039
which I think it's good

1414
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:22,039
a second here let's see here okay

1415
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:40,079
so I'm gonna take a room and I want to

1416
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:46,829
sort of loop over the things that are in

1417
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:52,409
that room the one thing I do have a

1418
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:54,300
little bit of concern about I'm just

1419
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:56,340
trying to get how to to structure this

1420
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:04,020
so what I think I want to do is say okay

1421
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:06,140
the first room I I know where it's gonna

1422
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,140
go

1423
01:23:19,739 --> 01:23:32,139
it's gonna go inside its prescribed

1424
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:33,670
volume like so and you can see here like

1425
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,619
I feel like this is starting to argue

1426
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:36,760
for actually allowing those VIII's to be

1427
01:23:35,619 --> 01:23:38,140
like added together and stuff because

1428
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:42,880
you can see that we would save some time

1429
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:43,660
by just doing this right so that would

1430
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,720
probably be okay

1431
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:54,279
so I'm gonna take the first room I'm

1432
01:23:46,720 --> 01:24:06,250
gonna place the room and then what I

1433
01:23:54,279 --> 01:24:08,469
want to do is I want to loop over all of

1434
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:11,560
the connections to the room and place

1435
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:13,650
them now what I can probably do here

1436
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:19,590
just say all right let's push this room

1437
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:27,969
and that'll be our loop we grab a room

1438
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:30,300
we we assume it's generation index has

1439
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:33,300
not been set

1440
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:37,800
[Music]

1441
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:37,800
well that's not quite right either is it

1442
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:45,150
no that's fine

1443
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:45,149
so we do set its generation index

1444
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:55,359
we push it on assuming its generation

1445
01:24:51,930 --> 01:25:05,800
index has not been set we visit its

1446
01:24:55,359 --> 01:25:16,149
neighbors and place them assuming if we

1447
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:18,100
don't we don't I'm not sure if that's

1448
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:18,699
quite right in that case you'll just

1449
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,230
look like this

1450
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:21,819
so you'd push the room on the stack if

1451
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:23,619
you if you don't match the narration

1452
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:32,289
actually you place all of its neighbor

1453
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:38,890
rooms who haven't been placed yet I just

1454
01:25:32,289 --> 01:25:41,170
don't like the way that feels it does

1455
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:43,180
kind of strike me as I think about it

1456
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:44,859
although I want to be centric on a room

1457
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,780
and spinning it that way it seems like

1458
01:25:44,859 --> 01:25:50,949
it doesn't want to be backwards the way

1459
01:25:46,779 --> 01:25:51,429
the other one was so maybe I just leave

1460
01:25:50,949 --> 01:25:53,710
it that way

1461
01:25:51,430 --> 01:26:01,030
I don't know maybe that is the better

1462
01:25:53,710 --> 01:26:04,510
way to do it it's not quite sure so

1463
01:26:01,029 --> 01:26:06,639
anyway if we assume that then we would

1464
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:10,090
do it this other way where we just push

1465
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:10,600
the connected rooms on like so and they

1466
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:11,980
stay the same

1467
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:16,150
and then so really all we're doing here

1468
01:26:11,979 --> 01:26:19,769
is we're just gonna say there's rooms

1469
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:19,769
the room is placed by rote

1470
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:30,289
so we look through all of our

1471
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:33,170
connections till we find a room that has

1472
01:26:30,289 --> 01:26:37,880
already been placed we know where along

1473
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:42,828
the line of rooms we should be and we

1474
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:44,389
put ourselves there right the thing

1475
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:46,099
that's a little annoying is it just

1476
01:26:44,389 --> 01:26:50,029
feels like this is going to do the same

1477
01:26:46,099 --> 01:26:52,909
placement like multiple times although I

1478
01:26:50,029 --> 01:27:00,380
suppose to be fair what I can do is

1479
01:26:52,908 --> 01:27:02,920
place everything along one edge at the

1480
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,920
same time

1481
01:27:12,679 --> 01:27:16,519
that actually doesn't seem so bad

1482
01:27:17,488 --> 01:27:23,629
so yeah inside here where we say let's

1483
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:26,038
loop over the connections to this thing

1484
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:30,380
and you kind of see how that goes here

1485
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:30,380
in fact it looks like this sort of thing

1486
01:27:36,828 --> 01:27:40,799
we don't really need the push connected

1487
01:27:39,328 --> 01:27:43,859
rooms call anymore because it's just

1488
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,800
gonna do exactly this thing but that's I

1489
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:48,719
suppose neither here nor there in fact

1490
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,699
yeah you can sort of see what's going on

1491
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,918
here if we actually did this if we loop

1492
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:55,678
over these what we would say is let's

1493
01:27:52,918 --> 01:27:57,958
get the connection if we haven't placed

1494
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,179
that room make sure we put that room on

1495
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:02,309
the stack you have to visit it but more

1496
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:03,868
importantly we want the other case now

1497
01:28:02,309 --> 01:28:06,659
as well so we're actually gonna do

1498
01:28:03,868 --> 01:28:09,988
something on both in the case where we

1499
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:12,679
find a room that has been placed then

1500
01:28:09,988 --> 01:28:19,918
what we want to do is place ourselves

1501
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:22,199
relative to that room right so here is

1502
01:28:19,918 --> 01:28:31,139
the actual call this would be like you

1503
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:33,538
know and then when we're done we assume

1504
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:35,159
that the room has been placed now the

1505
01:28:33,538 --> 01:28:37,800
confusing part is if we've already

1506
01:28:35,158 --> 01:28:40,768
placed the room we don't want to place

1507
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:42,389
the room again so in a sense what we

1508
01:28:40,769 --> 01:28:49,909
really want to do here as well is just

1509
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:49,909
double check ourselves I suppose

1510
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:03,569
and only make sure we place ourselves

1511
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,570
once

1512
01:29:05,559 --> 01:29:11,199
and that seems reasonable so when we go

1513
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,809
to place ourselves really all we're

1514
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:17,589
asking for is what's the min X min Y min

1515
01:29:13,809 --> 01:29:19,210
Z but because we know do you know what

1516
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:22,599
our volume is since all the volumes have

1517
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:24,639
been prescribed so far but that's not

1518
01:29:22,599 --> 01:29:25,569
exactly what we want to do here quite

1519
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:28,929
yet

1520
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:38,019
and the reason for that is because we

1521
01:29:28,929 --> 01:29:40,960
don't actually know how many things have

1522
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:42,940
to be placed along this edge right so we

1523
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,739
want to do is say all right for this

1524
01:29:42,939 --> 01:29:51,428
particular connection we want to like

1525
01:29:44,738 --> 01:29:56,049
place the connection right so we want to

1526
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:59,170
sort of say for for whatever this

1527
01:29:56,050 --> 01:30:01,929
connection is or a long edge I guess we

1528
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:05,288
want to basically say the other room is

1529
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:06,819
a known good room like we know that it

1530
01:30:05,288 --> 01:30:10,719
goes in a particular place and we're not

1531
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:14,469
confused about its location or size so

1532
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:17,948
we're gonna say from there using the

1533
01:30:14,469 --> 01:30:20,889
direction that we the the edge of that

1534
01:30:17,948 --> 01:30:24,038
room that is what we connect to we want

1535
01:30:20,889 --> 01:30:25,989
to place ourselves and all the other

1536
01:30:24,038 --> 01:30:31,479
people who also share the same

1537
01:30:25,988 --> 01:30:38,348
connection so in order to do that we

1538
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:41,229
need to and I guess that could set the

1539
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:43,420
generation index itself I suppose so

1540
01:30:41,229 --> 01:30:45,598
maybe let's say that and maybe we'll do

1541
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:45,599
this

1542
01:30:51,789 --> 01:30:57,550
so we need to figure out what direction

1543
01:30:53,800 --> 01:31:03,480
we use the connection in so like what

1544
01:30:57,550 --> 01:31:08,710
direction we're talking about there and

1545
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:10,629
I don't quite remember how that worked

1546
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:11,980
but I thought we had actually talked

1547
01:31:10,630 --> 01:31:14,289
about that before there's like an

1548
01:31:11,979 --> 01:31:18,279
inversion version of this area yeah but

1549
01:31:14,289 --> 01:31:20,199
get box mass compliment right um so what

1550
01:31:18,279 --> 01:31:22,389
I want to do here is just say I want to

1551
01:31:20,199 --> 01:31:25,210
know what direction I use this

1552
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:30,070
connection in so I kind of want to call

1553
01:31:25,210 --> 01:31:33,210
that's like for me what direction does

1554
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:33,210
this connection go in

1555
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:48,630
for the time being I kind of want to

1556
01:31:46,649 --> 01:31:56,519
assert that it's just only got one bit

1557
01:31:48,630 --> 01:32:01,710
set I don't think we have his character

1558
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:03,180
doing for the time being I would want to

1559
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:04,710
make sure that no one was trying to do a

1560
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,240
fancier placement with this particular

1561
01:32:04,710 --> 01:32:11,189
connection because obviously we're only

1562
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:15,090
whole we're only going to do ones in

1563
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:17,759
this situation where we are talking

1564
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:26,340
about a single direction for the time

1565
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:29,760
being right but I yeah I'll just ignore

1566
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:35,010
that for a moment so miss a direction

1567
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:37,380
equals get direction or room and I'm

1568
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:39,320
just gonna say for this connection what

1569
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:42,150
direction I guess it's it's this room

1570
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:46,939
from the other room to me what direction

1571
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:51,769
is it going right and then we'll say hey

1572
01:32:46,939 --> 01:32:51,769
that's the edge we're talking about here

1573
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:22,159
so I want to figure out what the bounds

1574
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:25,279
are of that edge and we'll do that in a

1575
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:27,409
second but that's I think this sketch of

1576
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:29,090
the routine right we're just going to go

1577
01:33:27,409 --> 01:33:30,920
through and place rims along the edge

1578
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:44,779
and then when we're done we assume that

1579
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:47,510
we did place that room so in this case

1580
01:33:44,779 --> 01:33:51,949
this it's it's really we've already done

1581
01:33:47,510 --> 01:34:00,710
this this call it's this right and so we

1582
01:33:51,949 --> 01:34:02,449
can sort of leverage that up here by

1583
01:34:00,710 --> 01:34:10,239
saying well we're just this is what

1584
01:34:02,449 --> 01:34:12,769
we're doing so the direction mask for

1585
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,389
whichever room we're coming from it's

1586
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:15,710
either gonna be the compliment or the

1587
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:17,119
thing that was stored there depending on

1588
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:18,079
which room we're talking about because

1589
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:19,849
the connection can go either direction

1590
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,710
so when we talk about getting the

1591
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:23,810
direction for the room it's really the

1592
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:26,289
fur it's the preamble to the could go

1593
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:31,100
direction which just tests it after that

1594
01:34:26,289 --> 01:34:34,130
right so what we want to do is is

1595
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:37,610
probably just reuse this code I could

1596
01:34:34,130 --> 01:34:40,029
probably just do this and say okay the

1597
01:34:37,609 --> 01:34:46,479
dirt mask is actually just get direction

1598
01:34:40,029 --> 01:34:46,479
for room like so on and so forth

1599
01:34:51,529 --> 01:34:56,118
maybe we call that Gator mask from room

1600
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:09,959
and I think that's mostly what we're

1601
01:35:04,559 --> 01:35:11,900
talking about now in the case where yeah

1602
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,880
like you can see where we don't know

1603
01:35:11,899 --> 01:35:15,868
whether we're we have not placed the

1604
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,920
room that's on the other side then

1605
01:35:15,868 --> 01:35:18,569
that's just something we want to revisit

1606
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:21,328
later in their routine so this is just

1607
01:35:18,569 --> 01:35:24,179
crawling out and placing anything it

1608
01:35:21,328 --> 01:35:25,710
thinks it can please rooms along edge

1609
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:27,029
will be much simpler than what we did

1610
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:28,349
before it'll just start at the min and

1611
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:29,759
lay the rooms out according to their

1612
01:35:28,349 --> 01:35:37,199
height if it runs out of room it'll just

1613
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:39,420
be an error right and that's it so to do

1614
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:41,368
that we need to do first is say okay

1615
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:46,980
let's loop along everything that matches

1616
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:50,698
that derp mask we really kind of want to

1617
01:35:46,979 --> 01:35:53,939
assert the derp mask here so I kind of

1618
01:35:50,698 --> 01:35:56,428
want to do a bit scan to figure out what

1619
01:35:53,939 --> 01:36:03,538
the index is and I want that bit scan to

1620
01:35:56,429 --> 01:36:05,130
be a single value right because we're

1621
01:36:03,538 --> 01:36:06,809
sort of saying this is a special purpose

1622
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:08,429
routine that only works if you know the

1623
01:36:06,809 --> 01:36:10,590
data looks a specific way because it can

1624
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:12,090
we're sort of crawling where we're

1625
01:36:10,590 --> 01:36:14,219
learning to crawl before we can walk

1626
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:15,920
here so we're we don't want this mask to

1627
01:36:14,219 --> 01:36:17,819
have anything other than one direction

1628
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:21,029
specified and when I say one direction

1629
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:26,130
specified I mean the band One Direction

1630
01:36:21,029 --> 01:36:29,729
so if I if I come into a replace rooms

1631
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:32,420
long edge I want to sort of get a an

1632
01:36:29,729 --> 01:36:32,419
index

1633
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:43,039
where I can sort of say look give me the

1634
01:36:41,449 --> 01:36:45,529
box and next to corresponds to this

1635
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:47,750
direction mask and it's just an error if

1636
01:36:45,529 --> 01:36:49,519
it doesn't right I just want you to

1637
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,989
assert if it doesn't that means we're

1638
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,890
outside the bounds of what we're playing

1639
01:36:50,989 --> 01:37:08,179
with right now and off we go so that

1640
01:36:54,890 --> 01:37:10,660
would be something like okay here's the

1641
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:10,659
derp mask

1642
01:37:10,989 --> 01:37:15,579
let's bit scan it which I believe we

1643
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:15,579
actually have

1644
01:37:29,078 --> 01:37:57,469
and so let's just use the the least

1645
01:37:34,760 --> 01:38:03,199
significant bit set and we'll just do

1646
01:37:57,469 --> 01:38:16,458
that will assert that there was one will

1647
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:24,609
assert care that it found one that's

1648
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:24,609
actually reasonable right so it can't be

1649
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:42,760
it can't be outside the bounds of the

1650
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:46,998
legal indices that we claim to have and

1651
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:51,498
finally it has to be equal to the

1652
01:38:46,998 --> 01:38:58,099
original if we reconvert it right so the

1653
01:38:51,498 --> 01:39:01,788
dur mask has to be equal to what we

1654
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:04,670
would get if we then tried to convert it

1655
01:39:01,788 --> 01:39:08,809
back to a mask now why am i doing that

1656
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:10,519
part that's to ensure that you can't

1657
01:39:08,809 --> 01:39:13,729
pass something with more than one bit

1658
01:39:10,519 --> 01:39:16,039
set so I'm going to ensure that you set

1659
01:39:13,729 --> 01:39:17,869
a bit I'm going to ensure that that bit

1660
01:39:16,038 --> 01:39:19,698
was within the range of bits we allow

1661
01:39:17,868 --> 01:39:22,578
and then finally I'm gonna ensure that

1662
01:39:19,698 --> 01:39:24,859
you only had one set because if you had

1663
01:39:22,578 --> 01:39:26,929
more than one set if you turn this back

1664
01:39:24,859 --> 01:39:29,299
into a mask it will only have one set

1665
01:39:26,929 --> 01:39:31,399
and this will have multiple set and you

1666
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:38,229
will get an assertion failure because

1667
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:40,879
you won't actually match all right

1668
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:41,989
so moving back to the generation code

1669
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,670
now that we know that we actually

1670
01:39:41,988 --> 01:39:46,868
haven't in next then what we want to do

1671
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:50,179
is just step over the room connections

1672
01:39:46,868 --> 01:39:54,319
that we have here so this this same code

1673
01:39:50,179 --> 01:39:58,368
here is what we're going to to operate

1674
01:39:54,319 --> 01:40:01,038
with so if I if I opt to iterate over my

1675
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:03,288
room's connections what I want to do is

1676
01:40:01,038 --> 01:40:07,429
say alright if the other room that we're

1677
01:40:03,288 --> 01:40:09,259
talking about here is a room that has

1678
01:40:07,429 --> 01:40:11,149
not been placed yet which would look

1679
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:17,769
like this then we're gonna place that

1680
01:40:11,149 --> 01:40:20,029
room it's gonna be the sort of room

1681
01:40:17,769 --> 01:40:21,320
everything calls that when you climb out

1682
01:40:20,029 --> 01:40:22,670
like lots of different rooms I think it

1683
01:40:21,319 --> 01:40:28,639
helps to name them once you get down in

1684
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:30,949
here so I don't know what we want to

1685
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:33,859
call this like the original room or the

1686
01:40:30,948 --> 01:40:35,779
the base room let's say so I'm gonna

1687
01:40:33,859 --> 01:40:37,458
call this the base room and say that the

1688
01:40:35,779 --> 01:40:41,868
base room is like a different thing

1689
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:45,349
right and so that maybe then we can say

1690
01:40:41,868 --> 01:40:48,259
all right then there's the the other one

1691
01:40:45,349 --> 01:40:51,260
will be the one called the room by Tommy

1692
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:52,909
Wiseau and that way we're just talking

1693
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:54,559
about the room is the one we're

1694
01:40:52,908 --> 01:40:55,698
operating on and the base room is this

1695
01:40:54,559 --> 01:40:58,329
other thing that we don't really care

1696
01:40:55,698 --> 01:41:00,529
about anymore right

1697
01:40:58,328 --> 01:41:01,698
so this would place all those rooms we

1698
01:41:00,529 --> 01:41:04,309
have to figure out how we want that to

1699
01:41:01,698 --> 01:41:06,498
work again we're only talking about ones

1700
01:41:04,309 --> 01:41:10,130
that share this particular directional

1701
01:41:06,498 --> 01:41:14,510
mask however so I want to go ahead and

1702
01:41:10,130 --> 01:41:18,229
make sure that the directional mask

1703
01:41:14,510 --> 01:41:24,199
ann's properly so the connections der

1704
01:41:18,229 --> 01:41:26,150
mask and I guess I have to make sure

1705
01:41:24,198 --> 01:41:28,089
that I know could where's the could go

1706
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:34,098
direction call that's the I actually

1707
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:35,420
just want to make that call I want to

1708
01:41:34,099 --> 01:41:38,989
make sure we're only gonna do it for

1709
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:42,920
connections that actually match right so

1710
01:41:38,988 --> 01:41:46,908
from the base room I want to make sure

1711
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:49,929
that if I pass this dur mask that I

1712
01:41:46,908 --> 01:41:49,929
could go that direction

1713
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:09,888
so I think that's all good I need to

1714
01:42:08,569 --> 01:42:12,518
actually have a version of the function

1715
01:42:09,889 --> 01:42:12,519
that works that way

1716
01:42:13,069 --> 01:42:19,630
so one that doesn't have the dim side

1717
01:42:15,828 --> 01:42:19,630
thing one that just has the test mask

1718
01:42:35,769 --> 01:42:42,679
right so that way I have the test masses

1719
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:44,328
being passed in and I just want to know

1720
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:47,510
if I could go that direction from the

1721
01:42:44,328 --> 01:42:49,998
base room is is this is this actually a

1722
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:50,989
is this connection actually legal to go

1723
01:42:49,998 --> 01:42:52,340
in the direction that I'm trying to

1724
01:42:50,988 --> 01:42:54,468
place it in it's not them don't want to

1725
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:58,159
do it because it's not one of the ones

1726
01:42:54,469 --> 01:43:01,189
getting placed in this slight in this

1727
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,478
edge cycle so when I'm going to be

1728
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:10,340
placing the rooms along the edge here

1729
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:11,780
what I want to do is say as I place each

1730
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:14,630
individual room I'm gonna kind of move

1731
01:43:11,779 --> 01:43:17,118
myself down I know what the dimensions

1732
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:20,800
of the room have to be but I need to be

1733
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:22,698
able to place them off of an edge right

1734
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:25,489
so here's the part that actually

1735
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:27,918
requires a little bit of finesse what I

1736
01:43:25,488 --> 01:43:30,918
need to be able to do is I need at this

1737
01:43:27,918 --> 01:43:35,418
point when I actually place it I need to

1738
01:43:30,918 --> 01:43:38,109
be able to use some knowledge of of how

1739
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:42,529
big this room has to be so the room

1740
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:44,688
required dim right I need to be able to

1741
01:43:42,529 --> 01:43:46,399
take that required dim in line up the

1742
01:43:44,689 --> 01:43:52,400
room so that it lines up with the edge

1743
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:55,208
that I'm actually placing it on and has

1744
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,208
that size

1745
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:03,420
so in order to do that I think we want

1746
01:44:00,989 --> 01:44:06,840
to go from min to max generally speaking

1747
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:08,220
like I said along the edge so I want to

1748
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:15,810
do something where I'm basically saying

1749
01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:19,619
like my min edge P is gonna be starting

1750
01:44:15,810 --> 01:44:22,200
out getting using the der mask I want to

1751
01:44:19,619 --> 01:44:24,659
be able to get what that minimum is and

1752
01:44:22,199 --> 01:44:27,179
so if I look at what my boxed s-- value

1753
01:44:24,659 --> 01:44:33,599
stuff lets me do here I should be able

1754
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:35,970
to say using those surface params like X

1755
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:39,750
and s and positive I should be able to

1756
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:43,470
use that to decrypt essentially what I'm

1757
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:47,909
being asked to do so if I use the

1758
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:50,670
surface index here that I got out of my

1759
01:44:47,909 --> 01:44:58,109
term asked then when I get the surface

1760
01:44:50,670 --> 01:45:01,609
params I can look at the axis index and

1761
01:44:58,109 --> 01:45:05,579
say that whatever the room that I'm in I

1762
01:45:01,609 --> 01:45:10,199
can now ask what its minimum value is

1763
01:45:05,579 --> 01:45:12,090
for that axis so now I know what the

1764
01:45:10,199 --> 01:45:14,519
minimum and maximum values are that I

1765
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:20,190
could place along my edge right

1766
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:22,620
I know what those are so as I place

1767
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:25,919
things I know how to place a long

1768
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:29,220
Vantage actually quite well right what I

1769
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:33,960
need to do is take the room by Tommy was

1770
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:40,100
oh and I need to put its volume for that

1771
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:40,100
axis index and and you know I'll just

1772
01:45:40,729 --> 01:45:50,909
grab that out into an easier to talk

1773
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:52,529
about Fang so I grab out which axis I'm

1774
01:45:50,909 --> 01:45:54,840
talking out that is the edge that's the

1775
01:45:52,529 --> 01:45:57,119
placement edge then as I go through each

1776
01:45:54,840 --> 01:46:00,000
individual room I'm going to say for

1777
01:45:57,119 --> 01:46:05,269
this volume I want to place the minimum

1778
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:07,890
at wherever I'm currently residing so

1779
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:11,159
again just talk about the maximal number

1780
01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:17,070
of things here so we can see them all

1781
01:46:11,158 --> 01:46:20,670
I want to start there right I know that

1782
01:46:17,069 --> 01:46:27,090
I need to place the maximum of that room

1783
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:29,279
at whatever the required dimension would

1784
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:34,050
be minus one again because we're always

1785
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:37,979
we don't talk about fill there and then

1786
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:41,219
I need to advance at edge P to be

1787
01:46:37,979 --> 01:46:43,559
effectively this value now I can shorten

1788
01:46:41,219 --> 01:46:45,989
this a little bit just to be if I want

1789
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:47,730
to be cheeky by essentially doing that

1790
01:46:45,988 --> 01:46:51,238
because that's what we're actually doing

1791
01:46:47,729 --> 01:46:53,579
here and then using at HP minus one to

1792
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:56,609
set where I want to be now when I'm done

1793
01:46:53,579 --> 01:46:58,529
with this I want to see that at edge P

1794
01:46:56,609 --> 01:47:01,349
is less than or equal to the max HP

1795
01:46:58,529 --> 01:47:02,789
otherwise we overflowed this the size if

1796
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:05,039
we actually want to keep those rooms all

1797
01:47:02,789 --> 01:47:06,149
placed along the edge this is what we

1798
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,189
would need to do so I'm just gonna

1799
01:47:06,149 --> 01:47:11,009
assert that again this is a very simple

1800
01:47:08,189 --> 01:47:14,099
version of the edge placement routine

1801
01:47:11,010 --> 01:47:17,179
now are we done no the reason that we're

1802
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:21,300
not done is that just places the edge

1803
01:47:17,179 --> 01:47:23,760
information right what we haven't done

1804
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:26,760
now is lined up these rooms with the

1805
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,679
other axes that we care about and so

1806
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:31,079
what we need to do is based on the

1807
01:47:28,679 --> 01:47:32,760
directional mask that we're talking

1808
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:34,670
about here we need to figure out how

1809
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,980
everything else would have been aligned

1810
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:39,569
based on that particular mask so we know

1811
01:47:37,979 --> 01:47:41,609
a particular Exynos and we know a

1812
01:47:39,569 --> 01:47:44,039
direction the question is what happens

1813
01:47:41,609 --> 01:47:47,819
to everything else right what happens to

1814
01:47:44,039 --> 01:47:50,929
everything that isn't talked about in

1815
01:47:47,819 --> 01:47:54,960
the edge axis we have two off axes right

1816
01:47:50,929 --> 01:47:56,520
and so we have one case we probably have

1817
01:47:54,960 --> 01:48:02,670
two different ways we might want to talk

1818
01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:07,170
about this and and specifically that's

1819
01:48:02,670 --> 01:48:08,940
like if the connection was along Z or

1820
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:11,989
not like is it an up-down connection or

1821
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:14,549
is it not an up-down connection right

1822
01:48:11,988 --> 01:48:17,939
would be one way to talk about that and

1823
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:20,760
and those are you know different

1824
01:48:17,939 --> 01:48:22,678
depending on on how we want to think

1825
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,270
about them right

1826
01:48:22,679 --> 01:48:25,680
but this connects the the thing

1827
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:27,000
is most of the way that we want and so

1828
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:28,560
what we're trying to figure out now is

1829
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:39,239
how we would talk about these other

1830
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:42,000
things right and what we need to do here

1831
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:43,979
is we need to set up the mins and maxes

1832
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,170
so that they align properly and let's

1833
01:48:43,979 --> 01:48:48,959
take a look at what that would entail

1834
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:52,039
diagrammatically speaking right so I got

1835
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,039
a ghost and I'm running out of time

1836
01:49:02,109 --> 01:49:07,679
so what I want to do here is say all

1837
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:07,680
right in the case where I've got

1838
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:13,059
something happening like this we know

1839
01:49:10,869 --> 01:49:15,519
that this part of the layout the part

1840
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:17,830
that did that and that is now taken care

1841
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:21,550
of what hasn't gotten taken care of is

1842
01:49:17,829 --> 01:49:23,109
this part right so what we want to do is

1843
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:25,150
we want to figure out are we setting the

1844
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:28,269
max or are we setting them in of the

1845
01:49:25,149 --> 01:49:33,069
other directions that are involved and

1846
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:34,660
then we can sort of push those we can we

1847
01:49:33,069 --> 01:49:39,159
can set those up the way that they

1848
01:49:34,659 --> 01:49:41,979
should be set up right and to a certain

1849
01:49:39,159 --> 01:49:44,639
extent I think that's just going to look

1850
01:49:41,979 --> 01:49:44,639
something like this

1851
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:57,449
we need sort of the other axis

1852
01:50:09,029 --> 01:50:12,869
and you can see how this is something we

1853
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:15,900
could actually pull out into other code

1854
01:50:12,869 --> 01:50:17,699
as well so we want to say like look do

1855
01:50:15,899 --> 01:50:21,869
we align these things to the min or the

1856
01:50:17,699 --> 01:50:24,059
max so if we align them to the min then

1857
01:50:21,869 --> 01:50:28,890
what we want to do is we want to set the

1858
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:30,660
maximum in this case is the first thing

1859
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:36,480
we want to set and we want to set the

1860
01:50:30,659 --> 01:50:39,000
min to be equal to the maximum -

1861
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,109
whatever the dimension is right and then

1862
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,319
there's that plus 1 because the

1863
01:50:40,109 --> 01:51:03,479
dimension is always slightly different

1864
01:50:43,319 --> 01:51:06,619
right so you can see there we've kind of

1865
01:51:03,479 --> 01:51:09,299
got like alright we're replacing the the

1866
01:51:06,619 --> 01:51:13,710
room along the edge then we need to know

1867
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:15,239
what we're going to place here and in

1868
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:23,039
this case we know that this is going to

1869
01:51:15,239 --> 01:51:24,929
be whatever the base room had I just

1870
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:26,489
want to start one prior to that so

1871
01:51:24,930 --> 01:51:31,020
that's where this room would have but

1872
01:51:26,489 --> 01:51:34,079
right and then furthermore the opposite

1873
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:35,610
version of this would be true we know

1874
01:51:34,079 --> 01:51:38,369
that if we were going to align to the

1875
01:51:35,609 --> 01:51:41,069
max then what we would do is take

1876
01:51:38,369 --> 01:51:44,369
whatever the max was move one out from

1877
01:51:41,069 --> 01:51:50,299
that and then you know do the exactly

1878
01:51:44,369 --> 01:51:50,300
symmetric process here right

1879
01:51:56,550 --> 01:52:05,130
and that's it that again is gonna happen

1880
01:52:01,710 --> 01:52:07,649
for the other two axes right the other

1881
01:52:05,130 --> 01:52:09,239
two I'm sorry the other axe

1882
01:52:07,649 --> 01:52:11,848
it's gonna happen for both axes that we

1883
01:52:09,238 --> 01:52:15,539
care about again we can can we can

1884
01:52:11,849 --> 01:52:19,590
consolidate this a little bit in a

1885
01:52:15,539 --> 01:52:28,079
second here or probably you next week

1886
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:30,179
but that's all we're talking about and

1887
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:33,029
so what we want to know in this case is

1888
01:52:30,179 --> 01:52:36,179
once we get the surface index we want to

1889
01:52:33,029 --> 01:52:39,859
know you know what the other axes that

1890
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:42,029
we're setting actually are I'm not gonna

1891
01:52:39,859 --> 01:52:43,799
belabor that point too much we're gonna

1892
01:52:42,029 --> 01:52:46,618
probably again pull that out into

1893
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:53,789
something a little bit more usable so

1894
01:52:46,618 --> 01:53:03,839
what I'm gonna do here is just say we'll

1895
01:52:53,789 --> 01:53:08,670
set these up by just doing a pretty

1896
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:10,380
simple switch statement here so we know

1897
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:12,420
we've got the surface index and I'm just

1898
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:13,770
going to decrypt it manually and then I

1899
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:15,319
think like I said this is something we

1900
01:53:13,770 --> 01:53:17,369
can make a little bit more programmatic

1901
01:53:15,319 --> 01:53:19,408
in a second but I just want to leave

1902
01:53:17,368 --> 01:53:25,429
this ploy sketched out and then we'll

1903
01:53:19,408 --> 01:53:25,429
come back to it next week

1904
01:53:48,510 --> 01:53:53,980
alright so in the case where we're doing

1905
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:58,270
west and east then axis a is one axis B

1906
01:53:53,979 --> 01:54:00,279
is two right in the case where we're

1907
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:09,220
doing south and north then axis a is

1908
01:54:00,279 --> 01:54:10,329
zero and axis B is two and then if it's

1909
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:14,340
up and down it's the other ones right

1910
01:54:10,329 --> 01:54:20,409
then in terms of other amen other be men

1911
01:54:14,340 --> 01:54:26,980
if we're going to the west then be lines

1912
01:54:20,409 --> 01:54:32,460
up with the men and a lines up with the

1913
01:54:26,979 --> 01:54:32,459
man I guess

1914
01:54:40,529 --> 01:54:49,019
that's not actually quite true right

1915
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:59,760
so B actually wants to just be equal to

1916
01:54:49,020 --> 01:55:04,980
it in this case right look I think we

1917
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:11,730
actually just want instance we don't

1918
01:55:04,979 --> 01:55:27,139
have up and down connections yet let me

1919
01:55:11,729 --> 01:55:29,729
just do this because we actually don't

1920
01:55:27,140 --> 01:55:32,900
need to do that at all now I think about

1921
01:55:29,729 --> 01:55:36,448
it you can just have it be equal to that

1922
01:55:32,899 --> 01:55:47,819
so the other a is really the only one we

1923
01:55:36,448 --> 01:55:50,149
actually need there and this is not

1924
01:55:47,819 --> 01:55:50,149
necessary

1925
01:55:57,970 --> 01:56:01,670
so right now we're just gonna do those

1926
01:55:59,989 --> 01:56:03,859
and we'll do it slightly differently

1927
01:56:01,670 --> 01:56:04,880
when we get when we start supporting me

1928
01:56:03,859 --> 01:56:14,869
up and downs as well

1929
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:16,909
hips so South it lines up with the men

1930
01:56:14,869 --> 01:56:18,260
yes and North Atlanta with the max so

1931
01:56:16,909 --> 01:56:21,529
that's fine

1932
01:56:18,260 --> 01:56:25,460
and I think that sets up the volume

1933
01:56:21,529 --> 01:56:27,979
properly I think notice note we are not

1934
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:29,659
setting up the doors right now so we

1935
01:56:27,979 --> 01:56:32,689
actually still would need to set up the

1936
01:56:29,659 --> 01:56:34,130
doors but other than that I think we've

1937
01:56:32,689 --> 01:56:35,989
got everything sketched in here if the

1938
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:37,430
doors are pretty easy to set up they

1939
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:40,550
just get set up in the middle of these

1940
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:43,010
things so it's not particularly hard for

1941
01:56:40,550 --> 01:56:46,460
us to do it but that's what we want to

1942
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:48,320
do right so I'm gonna leave it there I

1943
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:49,880
think and we'll come back because I

1944
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:53,149
don't have I can't really go any later

1945
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:54,739
than this today so I'm gonna leave it

1946
01:56:53,149 --> 01:56:58,920
there and go to quick Q&amp;A but the

1947
01:56:54,739 --> 01:56:58,920
[Music]

1948
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:06,130
interesting

1949
01:57:08,079 --> 01:57:11,960
so from this room it's got some kind of

1950
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:13,489
a non-symmetric connection so that'll be

1951
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:19,430
interesting to look at I'm gonna leave

1952
01:57:13,489 --> 01:57:21,609
it there and I will come back to it come

1953
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:23,930
back to it next week I don't necessarily

1954
01:57:21,609 --> 01:57:25,069
not want to leave it running though I'm

1955
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:31,400
tempted to just look at it really

1956
01:57:25,069 --> 01:57:34,090
quickly push connected rooms from the

1957
01:57:31,399 --> 01:57:34,089
first room

1958
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:46,080
you

1959
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:54,640
Orphanage for its entrance whoa but

1960
01:58:00,109 --> 01:58:15,018
what did I do did I miss up something in

1961
01:58:11,639 --> 01:58:15,019
the Kinect call

1962
01:58:24,529 --> 01:58:32,689
okay so that's not great to say the

1963
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:32,689
least

1964
01:58:39,859 --> 01:58:47,670
okay so I think that's fine potentially

1965
01:58:44,579 --> 01:58:52,979
I should go and check that maybe because

1966
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:59,609
I did something stupid but let's find

1967
01:58:52,979 --> 01:59:16,469
out what room it's on if that's from the

1968
01:58:59,609 --> 01:59:18,449
orphanage forest entrance so that when

1969
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:21,380
the orphanage forest entrance should

1970
01:59:18,449 --> 01:59:21,380
only have

1971
01:59:25,479 --> 01:59:31,509
that's north it should only have a North

1972
01:59:28,029 --> 01:59:34,239
from the main room yeah to the forest

1973
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:43,510
path forth to the yeah so that should be

1974
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:44,979
that one should really not have so you

1975
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:46,930
know now I think about it this assertion

1976
01:59:44,979 --> 01:59:48,579
really isn't valid because you do have

1977
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:52,210
bigger rooms connected to smaller rooms

1978
01:59:48,579 --> 01:59:54,340
so I it's really we really can't assert

1979
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:55,989
until we have we just need to assert

1980
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:57,279
that the rooms don't overlap that's the

1981
01:59:55,989 --> 01:59:58,630
only thing that we can really assert

1982
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:03,489
there so that at that assertion is

1983
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:06,789
actually bogus so yeah all right so at

1984
02:00:03,489 --> 02:00:11,949
least things are running properly now so

1985
02:00:06,789 --> 02:00:13,630
I I just need to debug everything and

1986
02:00:11,949 --> 02:00:15,970
we'll do that next week because I just

1987
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:23,619
want to go to brief brief Q&amp;A before I

1988
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:27,150
have to go I and yeah you can watch next

1989
02:00:23,619 --> 02:00:27,149
week when we go debug it

1990
02:00:53,809 --> 02:00:58,010
Viterbo said the edge axis is wrong

1991
02:00:56,179 --> 02:01:00,168
gives a direction of the connection not

1992
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:09,079
the axis the connected room should align

1993
02:01:00,168 --> 02:01:11,979
- I'm sorry I'm just not sure which part

1994
02:01:09,078 --> 02:01:11,978
of the code you're talking about

1995
02:01:24,409 --> 02:01:28,329
which part of the code are you talking

1996
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:28,329
about

1997
02:01:37,469 --> 02:01:42,890
oh I su think yes okay okay okay I see

1998
02:01:41,010 --> 02:01:49,829
what you're saying these are inverted

1999
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:55,410
right so the edge axis is actually this

2000
02:01:49,829 --> 02:01:58,710
one and the surface axis is actually the

2001
02:01:55,409 --> 02:02:00,359
other one right because we're talking

2002
02:01:58,710 --> 02:02:02,189
about the direction we're connecting

2003
02:02:00,359 --> 02:02:25,979
along

2004
02:02:02,189 --> 02:02:28,429
I suppose while we're here I mean I can

2005
02:02:25,979 --> 02:02:28,429
just do

2006
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:48,229
right so basically if we're traveling

2007
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:50,899
west then the edge axis is actually

2008
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:52,969
going to be the y-axis and the alignment

2009
02:02:50,899 --> 02:02:57,259
axis is going to be the one that we

2010
02:02:52,970 --> 02:03:03,860
actually are using right I don't really

2011
02:02:57,260 --> 02:03:11,600
need this at the moment so yeah so

2012
02:03:03,859 --> 02:03:14,238
that's actually more like it but I don't

2013
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:15,350
think that really necessarily will help

2014
02:03:14,238 --> 02:03:17,149
us yet

2015
02:03:15,350 --> 02:03:18,890
I think that's not quite sufficient yeah

2016
02:03:17,149 --> 02:03:22,009
because that should have just made

2017
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:24,280
everything be mirrored look at this

2018
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:24,280
again

2019
02:03:28,238 --> 02:03:32,418
can the next thing be fashion is such a

2020
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:34,578
way to form a long empty corridor or a

2021
02:03:32,418 --> 02:03:36,880
stairway up and down to connect two

2022
02:03:34,578 --> 02:03:36,880
rooms

2023
02:03:36,939 --> 02:03:42,709
well connection is not doesn't really

2024
02:03:39,559 --> 02:03:46,038
mean that connection means to abutting

2025
02:03:42,708 --> 02:03:48,198
regions so that's actually not you would

2026
02:03:46,038 --> 02:03:55,099
create a room that was the shape you're

2027
02:03:48,198 --> 02:03:56,629
talking about you mentioned a few

2028
02:03:55,099 --> 02:03:58,248
schemes to go that the Xbox 360

2029
02:03:56,630 --> 02:03:59,208
controller has a crap potentiometer do

2030
02:03:58,248 --> 02:04:01,519
you have an example controller with a

2031
02:03:59,208 --> 02:04:04,958
good one not really I haven't played

2032
02:04:01,519 --> 02:04:07,579
around with them that much to look I

2033
02:04:04,958 --> 02:04:09,198
suspect most consumer controllers have

2034
02:04:07,578 --> 02:04:11,658
poor potentiometers because they're

2035
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:15,379
trying to be inexpensive and people

2036
02:04:11,658 --> 02:04:20,418
can't tell that well the game developer

2037
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:22,248
just has to kind of like hide it all I'm

2038
02:04:20,418 --> 02:04:24,889
only going to take on topic questions at

2039
02:04:22,248 --> 02:04:26,059
the moment have you think to use a

2040
02:04:24,889 --> 02:04:28,038
constraint solver algorithm for room

2041
02:04:26,059 --> 02:04:29,840
lighting I guess I'm taking it you

2042
02:04:28,038 --> 02:04:31,340
weren't here last weekend that's that's

2043
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:33,319
what we started talking about originally

2044
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:35,328
but we want to we have to get there kind

2045
02:04:33,319 --> 02:04:42,049
of slowly right you can't just start

2046
02:04:35,328 --> 02:04:43,668
with a constraint solver can the hero

2047
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:44,779
have the ability to dig the ground and

2048
02:04:43,668 --> 02:04:48,078
fall through to the floor of the room

2049
02:04:44,779 --> 02:04:50,748
below it yes if we restrict that to only

2050
02:04:48,078 --> 02:04:51,948
diggable surfaces because we need to

2051
02:04:50,748 --> 02:04:53,478
wait and make it so that you can't dig

2052
02:04:51,948 --> 02:04:56,359
in places because we'd fall out of the

2053
02:04:53,479 --> 02:04:58,880
world if there was nothing below you so

2054
02:04:56,359 --> 02:05:00,049
you could make digging sure but it would

2055
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,918
have to be specific to a particular

2056
02:05:00,050 --> 02:05:02,918
ground tile type

2057
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:16,930
if you want to you can raid a bug on

2058
02:05:11,869 --> 02:05:16,930
that as a future request in the github

2059
02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:37,550
alright I'm gonna wrap it up thank you

2060
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:38,659
everyone for joining me for the set a

2061
02:05:37,550 --> 02:05:41,449
hand made here oh it's been a pleasure

2062
02:05:38,659 --> 02:05:43,099
coding with you as always if you would

2063
02:05:41,449 --> 02:05:44,899
like to follow along with the code at

2064
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:46,940
home you could always pre-order the game

2065
02:05:44,899 --> 02:05:48,920
on hand mahir org and it comes with a

2066
02:05:46,939 --> 02:05:51,859
source code so as it gets developed you

2067
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:53,899
can play around with it yourself that's

2068
02:05:51,859 --> 02:05:56,479
it for this weekend I will be back here

2069
02:05:53,899 --> 02:05:58,099
next weekend to get all that stuff to

2070
02:05:56,479 --> 02:06:00,139
bugged and then we should have our sort

2071
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:02,329
of ability to play around with some

2072
02:06:00,140 --> 02:06:03,890
basic room designs and moving around and

2073
02:06:02,329 --> 02:06:06,439
things and then we can start to look at

2074
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:09,500
stuff about how we want to actually go

2075
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:12,079
about doing some of the more generative

2076
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:14,420
stuff where we don't completely specify

2077
02:06:12,079 --> 02:06:17,059
say the sizes of rooms and we let it try

2078
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:18,829
to solve for how big they would be or

2079
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:19,850
should be or where they should be in the

2080
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:23,630
case where they could be in multiple

2081
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:27,020
places that's about it until next time

2082
02:06:23,630 --> 02:06:30,039
thanks for joining and I'll see you all

2083
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:30,040
on the Internet take it easy everybody
