1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:11,569
for reasons I do not 100% understand

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:16,850
publishers seem to be absolutely

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:19,800
borderline unethically like against

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:24,210
giving printers any credit and I don't

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:30,448
know why in the video game industry in

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:36,270
the movie industry we would not be like

7
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:40,620
we would not accept it if a primary part

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,000
of the process the people involved in

9
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:45,119
that did not get their names in the

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,509
credits like that there have been issues

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:55,488
of that and they have caused serious

12
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:58,349
like concern and and complaint right

13
00:00:55,488 --> 00:01:02,000
major players in the production of a

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:06,420
thing typically get some credit right

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,670
and it may not literally appear in the

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,409
the printed volume or the game or the

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,060
whatever it is I'm not necess a the

18
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,439
credit has to be in a certain place but

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,600
you know like people can find out who

20
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,228
did what and we take it for granted that

21
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,618
that's true

22
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:24,688
modern publishers seem to go way out of

23
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,659
their way to not tell you who printed

24
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:29,969
something and it's sort of like a trade

25
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,939
secret thing with them but I find that

26
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,009
really off-putting if someone did a good

27
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:36,899
job printing a book their name should go

28
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,438
in the book and in fact one of the first

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,810
things that I made sure to write down

30
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,798
and I recently just asked our printer

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,728
for this is I was like when we print our

32
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:49,470
graphic novel at the end of this

33
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:52,530
Kickstarter and we submit the materials

34
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:55,019
I'm like our frontmatter page will have

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,570
a credit to the printer and it will be

36
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,780
the credit as the printer gives it to us

37
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:01,889
so I'm gonna be demanding that that line

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,989
go in there and I send it to them and

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,739
they sent it back and they said oh that

40
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:06,718
would be great

41
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:07,679
here you know here's what we would like

42
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,269
you to print in there and I was like

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,390
done I wish people were more upset about

44
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,219
this

45
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:19,269
and the reason for that is very simple

46
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:20,919
printers deserve credit if you see a

47
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,959
book you think was printed well you

48
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:26,129
should be able to give that person your

49
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,050
business I mean it's their livelihood

50
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:32,049
what do you think the benefit is of

51
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:35,020
hiding that right you want them all to

52
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,959
yourself or something but presses are

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,909
not like running away with all the money

54
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,770
right now I mean a lot of presses are

55
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:45,068
struggling to survive especially in

56
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,989
these days give them credit it should be

57
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:48,159
easy for anyone who has a graphic novel

58
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,110
on their shelf who's an artist

59
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,699
themselves who wants to print a comic to

60
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,220
find out we were printed and call them

61
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:57,810
on the phone who is being hurt by that

62
00:02:54,219 --> 00:03:01,840
right and so I really don't like that

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,860
trade secrecy element and I think again

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,150
it wouldn't really be a case from

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,739
without a rant I think publishers should

66
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,099
be absolutely ashamed of themselves for

67
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:11,259
this practice of deliberately obscuring

68
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,669
that so we are not going to do that you

69
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,310
will be able to find out who printed our

70
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:16,449
book and if you like the quality of it

71
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,129
you'll be able to call them and have

72
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:21,399
them print your book if you want to and

73
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:23,169
I hope that anyone who happens to listen

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,209
to this will do exactly the same thing

75
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,919
for anything that they print because I

76
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,959
believe the printers deserve the credit

77
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,208
and furthermore I think it leads to a

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,289
healthier more thriving industry if

79
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,079
people just know who printed stuff

80
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:37,030
because that means presses that do good

81
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,530
work will get more business and that's

82
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,069
what you want I mean what do you think's

83
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,079
gonna happen

84
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,578
they're not gonna stop taking your print

85
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,459
jobs are gonna expand if they get lots

86
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,379
of print work right so I think that

87
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:51,789
should change it should change and we

88
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:55,079
will change that for us and and I and I

89
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:55,078
hope that other people do too
