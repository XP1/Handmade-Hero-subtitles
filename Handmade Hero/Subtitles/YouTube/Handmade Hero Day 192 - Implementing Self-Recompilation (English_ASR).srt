00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:05,399
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,189
Shira the show where we code a complete

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,599
game live on Twitch we are coding some

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,230
interface code right now we're coding

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,000
some UI some user interface only this is

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,910
actually not user interface for the game

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,460
it's user interface for the developer we

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,768
are trying to make a few little UI

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,719
elements that we can use when we are

10
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:26,009
running the game in sort of our

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,929
development mode so that we can do

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,390
things like you know if we want to edit

13
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:33,058
values or we want to toggle things on

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,159
and off work be able to select what we

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:37,619
are trying to view in our profiler was

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:39,569
kind of one of the things that you know

17
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:42,419
motivated us to do this particular thing

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,270
that we're doing with the UI elements

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,359
and so we implemented a simple radial

20
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,950
control yesterday and got most of the

21
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,570
way through actually doing it I mean

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,359
it's it's it's functional it's just not

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,219
particularly pretty and so today what

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,679
I'd like to do is kind of build out that

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,379
build that out a little bit more kind of

26
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,479
like look at maybe doing in addition to

27
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:04,948
a radial sort of pick style thing also

28
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:11,009
maybe some listing and those sorts of

29
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:12,629
things so again I'm kind of just gonna

30
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,500
go for a little bit I'm just gonna like

31
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:19,319
make some more UI stuff as we go and

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,909
then you know at some point and I may do

33
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:22,408
some of it today I mean not again this

34
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,840
is it's entirely flexible it's just

35
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,680
based on taste sort of as I come through

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,540
different parts of the program what I

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,329
feel like should be the next logical

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,310
step based on what I'm looking at we may

39
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:37,919
start to sort of pull out the radial

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,100
control stuff into something that's

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,899
that's a little cleaner and more useable

42
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,179
because right now it's just kind of a

43
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,399
hard-coded thing that we did to just see

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,810
how to code it in general I may start

45
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,159
pulling that out or I may leave that for

46
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,740
a little bit later I may hard-code a

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,689
bunch of different UI element things and

48
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,750
then see them kind of operating together

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,959
and then start to pull them out into a

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,030
more reasonably architected thing so I

51
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,949
don't know we'll see when I feel when I

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,390
am feeling comfortable as I look at it

53
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,060
when when I'm feeling comfortable that

54
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,780
enough is there to start doing that kind

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,990
of piecing

56
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,840
out that is when I'll start so we're

57
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:19,300
here on day one 92 if you want to follow

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,950
along at home and you have pre-ordered

59
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,810
the game on Hamid org

60
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:27,869
you can unpack day 191 a source code

61
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:32,310
that's what I'm starting with

62
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:35,170
that is what I am starting with so

63
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,120
here's where we were at when we stopped

64
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:39,159
yesterday you can see that there's

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,459
actually sort of this radio-control

66
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,900
thing here and it's it's like I said we

67
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,580
did all the basic work teams a minute

68
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,189
but it's still kind of ugly like that

69
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,110
you know the things can can kind of

70
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,120
overlap each other and there's no way to

71
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,160
not pick something right now right so we

72
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,659
just whichever one the cursor is closest

73
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,060
to that's the one I picked so this would

74
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:00,099
not be like a particularly great control

75
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,769
we also haven't lined these things up in

76
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,180
any way that's particularly intelligent

77
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,469
so you know like I said there's plenty

78
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,810
of stuff that we would want to do here

79
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,340
but it's already working so if I want to

80
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,500
I could just do kind of a nice right

81
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,530
swipe there does the toggle profile

82
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,989
graph write a diagonal up swipe right

83
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,459
and you can see I don't even have to

84
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,319
think about it to pick it's just a nice

85
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,599
muscle memory thing so that's kind of

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,129
just like it's nice to have radial menus

87
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,319
for that very reason because they're

88
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,299
very fast to use and it's kind of just a

89
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,549
nice little user interface element to

90
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,870
have again real simple I mean you saw me

91
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,370
implement it and I don't know maybe 40

92
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,409
minutes I'm not sure what total extreme

93
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,599
time we spent out of yesterday's stream

94
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:38,829
doing it but again 40 minutes to

95
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,969
implement a basic thing and we could

96
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,530
clean this up a little bit more in

97
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,969
another 20-30 minutes to make it look a

98
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,379
little nicer and behave a little nicer

99
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:45,969
so you know you're talking about an hour

100
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,349
and a half of total dev time or

101
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:49,090
something like that even if you're

102
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,858
starting from almost nothing as long as

103
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,129
you have a way to just output some text

104
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:57,280
you can make one of these and again

105
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:59,049
they're pretty handy so I'm gonna go

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,750
ahead and start thinking about this up

107
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,519
through a little bit more just trying to

108
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,329
think about what we're kind of going to

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,829
need here in terms of other UI things

110
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:12,129
just so I can kind of put some of that

111
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:14,140
out there and like I said before I don't

112
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,358
really like to try and anticipate what

113
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,129
I'm gonna need for stuff so what I might

114
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,120
do what I think might be kind of a smart

115
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:21,120
way to approach this problem

116
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:30,240
is to kind of go back in look at the

117
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,589
debug code we've already done because

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,780
we've already had a plenty of times

119
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:35,879
where we if zero things out and we add

120
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,229
little debug overlays and stuff on to

121
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,449
things that we just kind of did in the

122
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,670
code in fact if you look we've got a

123
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:43,860
we've got this yellow border right

124
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,080
there's a yellow border running around

125
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,120
the screen and that yellow border all

126
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,159
that is is a thing to let us know that

127
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,899
we've lined everything up exactly it's a

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,150
thing that says where this where the the

129
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,159
screen should be and we also had a thing

130
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,709
that let us like zoom the camera out so

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,760
we've had like tons of debug things that

132
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:04,589
we've written as part of getting all of

133
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,319
the engine stuff done to the point where

134
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:09,989
we wanted it to be right we've done all

135
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:13,560
that stuff and so the question is how

136
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,199
can we go ahead and make that be a more

137
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,600
sort of fundamental fundamentally

138
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,209
accessible kind of a thing where all of

139
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,980
those options are going to be kind of

140
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:25,109
easy to for us to get to what I you know

141
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,759
my my kind of dream scenario it's like

142
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,939
you just click the right mouse button or

143
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,029
something right and you get access to

144
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:36,660
all that debugging but there's gonna be

145
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:38,909
way more there than could possibly just

146
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,380
be listed flat on the screen certainly

147
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,840
more that can be in a radial menu but

148
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,089
even if we had you know sort of stuff

149
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,859
all over the screen it's probably gonna

150
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,779
take a little bit of thought so what I

151
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,930
think I might do in fact now that I'm

152
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:53,519
even talking it through I think that

153
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,500
kind of sets the stage even maybe even

154
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,479
before I implement any more of the

155
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,310
actual UI stuff maybe I'm gonna go

156
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,189
through and figure out what is a good

157
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,709
way to make those things turn on and off

158
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:06,930
and let me pull that out because I was

159
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:08,189
thinking about that the other day I was

160
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,319
kind of thinking on how me here I was

161
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:12,269
like we should tie into the debug system

162
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,879
a way to kind of turn off and on these

163
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:16,829
sort of debug system so you know maybe

164
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,459
I've changed my mind maybe I want to do

165
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:19,109
that first

166
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,239
and start to pull those things out into

167
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,800
the debug system proper so that we can

168
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,750
kind of see how that that's gonna work

169
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,199
right I think that's that that would be

170
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,199
my preference okay

171
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,439
so let's take the most simple example

172
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,709
that I can think of so far which is that

173
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,709
in handmade render group right we had

174
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:45,949
this concept that the camera could be

175
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:47,659
pulled back in sort of a debug way if I

176
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:53,209
remember correctly there was sort of

177
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:54,650
this this concept of a debug camera and

178
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,810
so the way that this worked is

179
00:06:54,649 --> 00:07:00,799
everything still used the camera

180
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,350
entirely consistently right so it was

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,000
exactly the same as it used to be there

182
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,750
was nothing there's nothing that changed

183
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,100
the only difference was that if I if I

184
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:16,250
let came in here you know and I changed

185
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:20,710
this guy to an if one it would like

186
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:27,949
bring everything out oops that's no good

187
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:30,139
translation unit ah so this is kind of a

188
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:34,360
little annoying I wonder how much this

189
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:38,740
will affect our loop live code editing

190
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:42,259
if we have stuff that changes when we

191
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,960
when we do the reload I wonder if we're

192
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:47,180
going to get problems here where it

193
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,829
can't use the I wonder I guess I'm

194
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,600
saying is I wonder if when we do the the

195
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,359
reload we're going to have to do

196
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:58,370
something where we flush because I am

197
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,990
assuming that what happens here is that

198
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:07,220
if we look at what actually is going on

199
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:12,470
so we've got opening event opening event

200
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,240
is garbage there well you know what that

201
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,790
does seem this just looks like maybe

202
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,980
regular a straight-up bug just a regular

203
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:23,200
old bug does it not

204
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:26,620
how would that why would that have

205
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,620
caused a problem

206
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:36,870
that's a little tricky because I want to

207
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,930
say like oh well yeah we probably should

208
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,389
whenever we reset the debug system

209
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,489
whenever we do a reload of the code

210
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:47,279
since all of our marker points all of

211
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,560
our counter places might change

212
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,779
we should flush all of the debug events

213
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,779
right that should be a reset that seems

214
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:59,009
pretty logical to me however the one

215
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:01,259
thing I don't want to do is do that and

216
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:05,460
have that mask a sort of different bug

217
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:09,269
that we might actually have in here so

218
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:12,300
it kind of feels like we have some kind

219
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:14,850
of a different problem so I just want to

220
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:18,120
take a second to investigate that a

221
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,300
little bit just so I can see and make

222
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,100
sure that there isn't something kind of

223
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:25,129
more wrong there so you can see like

224
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,700
this first open block is just nonsense

225
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:35,909
right it's just total totally garbage

226
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:40,370
from the reload and I guess you know if

227
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,370
you think about to how that's gonna go

228
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:46,349
since we have incremental frame

229
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:50,009
processing it does mean that when we do

230
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:53,250
a code reload it means that the like

231
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:55,200
these pointers to that that debug memory

232
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,799
are going to kind of get vacated right

233
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,900
because that is a static variable that

234
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,459
lives in there it's also you know again

235
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,980
that's another reason why the counters

236
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,019
are less good because the counters need

237
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:13,830
to look up into that static variable in

238
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:15,600
this kind of annoying way so I feel like

239
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:19,259
it's probably safe at least for the time

240
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,779
being to go ahead and flush that buffer

241
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,838
I feel like that's probably okay and

242
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,759
that's really easy for us to do because

243
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,470
we know when the executable is reloaded

244
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:33,990
right so when we come in and we've kind

245
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,950
of have our debug frame end happening

246
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:40,269
here we can if we want to go ahead and

247
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:48,910
just sort of reset all of the variable

248
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:50,799
that's really easy to do all we would

249
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:54,370
really have to do there is is vaporize

250
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:57,759
the array invent it like our whole array

251
00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:01,810
event index structure like all of those

252
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:06,208
cat all of the all of accounts right so

253
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:13,989
if we if we were to look at the handmade

254
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:18,069
platform dot H where we have the event

255
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:21,909
array so the event count if all of those

256
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,278
just got vaporized right that would be

257
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:27,370
sufficient to do the reset I would

258
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:31,149
assume so if we want to we can just go

259
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,830
ahead and say all right everything if we

260
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,009
need to do a deep you know we'll just do

261
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:47,200
one here something like this debug reset

262
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:48,700
or debug event reset set so what we need

263
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:58,690
to do here is say all of the event

264
00:11:48,700 --> 00:12:05,250
counts in the entire system however many

265
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,250
there are in the global debug table

266
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:13,449
however many of those there are they all

267
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,620
need to get reset to zero right however

268
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,028
well you know what now I'm thinking

269
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,899
about two though wouldn't why wouldn't

270
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:23,980
they automatically get set to zero

271
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:25,929
because since they're in the DLL I feel

272
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,899
like they should already get set to zero

273
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:33,039
so now that I think about it probably

274
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:35,379
really we only have to reset we only

275
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:40,088
have to reset the the incremental frame

276
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:42,129
processing that's it because yeah so I

277
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:45,459
think really actually the only thing we

278
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:48,899
need to do is reset this stuff right we

279
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:55,409
just need to do restart collation

280
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:56,938
on that yeah that's all we need to do so

281
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:01,708
I suppose all we really need to do is

282
00:12:56,938 --> 00:13:05,068
say okay you know in the event after

283
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:06,328
after we kind of set this stuff up we

284
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:11,159
can just go ahead and restart the

285
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:20,028
collation oops just our collation debug

286
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:23,969
state it's like so so we must do if

287
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:26,970
we're in the situation where we have

288
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,240
have done a debug reset which I'm

289
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:36,089
assuming I guess we probably want to put

290
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,379
it in there I am assuming that that's

291
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:41,129
something that we should just get past

292
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:44,188
in here right so if we take a look at

293
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:48,600
platform when we get to game frame end

294
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:51,120
oops all we're getting right now is the

295
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,278
game memory and I don't know if that

296
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,629
passes it doesn't right so the game

297
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,850
memory doesn't pass whether the

298
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:58,589
executable was reset whether the

299
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,750
executable was reset is actually passed

300
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:03,360
in the input right now so I'm gonna go

301
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,528
ahead and move that I think because I

302
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,000
feel like that's something that I

303
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:07,620
probably want in the memory because

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,299
that's the people who would normally

305
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,698
deal with it are probably gonna deal

306
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:15,058
with it there a little bit more so I'm

307
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:19,109
just gonna do it here and say okay if

308
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:21,990
the memory executable reloaded is true

309
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,789
then I restart the coalition so then all

310
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,680
I have to do is I have to go in through

311
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:31,519
here and make sure that this is going to

312
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:36,870
be the game memory that gets this set

313
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:39,500
and I assume game memory yeah okay it's

314
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,500
game memory

315
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:47,800
and that should do it see how that goes

316
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,940
okay

317
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,379
look at our little handmade hero there

318
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,350
it's awfully cute alright so I'm going

319
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:06,019
to test this out again and see let's go

320
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,519
ahead Dan happen there's our little

321
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:10,730
handmade hero kind of running around in

322
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,759
there he's super happy and everything's

323
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:19,430
fine if I come in here to our render

324
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:21,860
let's see also about this guy here there

325
00:15:19,429 --> 00:15:26,179
we go consume him in see if we can zoom

326
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,820
back out okay so now we clear that

327
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:30,319
collation so hopefully and that may be a

328
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,330
bug that you kind of have to catch at

329
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,850
just the right time but hopefully you

330
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,870
can kind of see that we can you know

331
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,769
kind of make that happen

332
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,049
relatively reliably now so what I want

333
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:46,850
to do is say okay I like the way that's

334
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:49,250
working right I like more or less how

335
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,649
that's happening and I don't necessarily

336
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:58,460
know that I want a super change the way

337
00:15:51,649 --> 00:16:01,490
that code works but but one problem I

338
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:04,340
have is I just don't like having to go

339
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,419
find it right so what I want to be able

340
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:16,280
to do here is say something you know

341
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:18,669
like you know if debug UI and then in

342
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,669
here

343
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:29,168
I put some name so I don't know what the

344
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:33,699
name exactly would be but you know if

345
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:36,458
debug you I use debug camera or

346
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:38,438
something like this so let's say I did

347
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:41,738
something like that what I'd really like

348
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:46,328
to do is make it so that actually you

349
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:49,629
know what happens is when I access the

350
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:52,899
UI it actually just compiles that code

351
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:54,729
in or out right so it actually it like

352
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:57,578
changes the vow that whatever that value

353
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:59,649
is and then like recompile the code or

354
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:01,658
something so that it actually so I can

355
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:05,528
do stuff that actually might be really

356
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:07,898
expensive and it will just actually

357
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:10,148
recompile the code did you know what I

358
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:13,750
mean it won't like leave it in there

359
00:17:10,148 --> 00:17:21,818
necessarily that's kind of what I

360
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:24,548
actually want to have happen I mean do

361
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:26,648
you think that's ridiculous do you think

362
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:29,048
that's too much to ask cuz you have to

363
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:33,089
admit it's a little tricky it would be a

364
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,089
little tricky to make that work right

365
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,808
but let's see

366
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:51,589
let's start right let's just start by

367
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:54,850
making things relatively simple for

368
00:17:51,589 --> 00:18:00,918
ourselves let's say so suppose I have

369
00:17:54,849 --> 00:18:05,168
handmade debug switches or something

370
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:09,559
like this right or handmade config dot H

371
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:11,840
maybe right just totally making this up

372
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:18,230
I've never done this before

373
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:21,048
I'm just full-on playing around so let's

374
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:28,220
suppose I were to do that and in this

375
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:32,500
file I am going to make that equals zero

376
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:36,649
so now if I were to compile this file

377
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:39,048
yeah it's going to know that this is is

378
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,339
not going to be used of course it's

379
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:42,440
knowing that because it hasn't actually

380
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:44,298
ever seen the config so I need to put

381
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,820
the config probably I probably even want

382
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:48,679
the config at the top in fact I probably

383
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:51,769
want it in have a platform so that

384
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:55,490
everyone sees it right it probably wants

385
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:58,940
to be the very most like like like the

386
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:02,450
primal the most primal thing that anyone

387
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,960
actually gets right so handmade config

388
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:08,169
is like everyone sees it always platform

389
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,679
layer everywhere right

390
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:15,528
so in handmade config you know it's got

391
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,649
these variables and that's the one for

392
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:20,929
using the debug camera so now right like

393
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:22,879
I can go to the handmade config file if

394
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,700
I want to right

395
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:30,230
and inside here I can make it so that I

396
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:32,690
just switch you know that on and off and

397
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,720
that works fine right so no problems

398
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,669
there it's all good but the question is

399
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,110
how would I get that out into a UI

400
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:41,990
element so for example if I wanted to

401
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:44,439
attach that to the radial menu right how

402
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,440
would I do it

403
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:56,029
right it's a tough question and and I

404
00:19:52,940 --> 00:20:05,600
guess I would say you know it probably

405
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:07,309
requires a little bit of finesse I'm

406
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,319
trying to decide whether I should do

407
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:13,240
this because I think I know the answer

408
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:15,470
and it's kind of a little banana cakes

409
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,299
but sometimes you got to be banana cakes

410
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,890
on handmade hero I would say so let's

411
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,269
just go ahead and do it let's just go

412
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,840
ahead and say we wanted that to be part

413
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,029
of the UI

414
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:25,849
well the UI is gonna need to know one

415
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:28,609
other thing I think probably right just

416
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:30,409
if we're being realistic the UI is gonna

417
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:32,599
need to know one other thing and that's

418
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,750
the fact that this was a boolean right

419
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,129
so that's like a b32 you know what I

420
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,019
mean

421
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,870
so it's probably gonna need to know that

422
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:44,059
this is you know either a 0 or a 1 right

423
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:45,679
something like this as opposed to some

424
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:47,659
other defined value which could be

425
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,960
something else entirely if that makes

426
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:57,200
sense so I feel like I feel like that's

427
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,049
a fairly reasonable thing to do so now

428
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,850
if I wanted to present a UI that had the

429
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,940
thing you know things in it like use

430
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:07,969
debug camera the only way I could do

431
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:17,539
that automatically is I would have to

432
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:21,980
make some way for our game to edit this

433
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:23,509
file right the game if the UI wanted to

434
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,549
actually do the whole process to produce

435
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:28,279
they actually change the code at runtime

436
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,710
it would have to edit this file and then

437
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:35,089
it would have to recompile right that's

438
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:42,559
just what it would have to do and so in

439
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:45,829
order to do that I'm pretty sure yeah it

440
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,970
has to kind of rewrite the file now

441
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:51,769
that's not that big a deal probably if

442
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,529
it would just look like this because

443
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,970
rewriting this file is pretty

444
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:58,038
straightforward right there's nothing

445
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:02,308
all that weird

446
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:06,598
happening there I would think so let's

447
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:08,700
see if we can just get our our debug

448
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:11,968
code as it stands right now two

449
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,090
hard-coded rewrite that file for us

450
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:17,330
right just rewrite that file in its

451
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:20,939
entirety okay

452
00:22:17,329 --> 00:22:24,418
so if I wanted to do that what I would

453
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:28,169
do is I would say okay maybe there is a

454
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:33,538
function here called right hand made

455
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:37,589
config yeah something like this and it

456
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:40,888
takes the debug state I don't know

457
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:43,278
again just guessing and then it's going

458
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:47,038
to go ahead and use the platform layer

459
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:50,999
to write the entire file so if I go into

460
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:53,960
a hand-made platform and I come down

461
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:57,710
here we have debug right entire file

462
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,710
debug right entire file

463
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:11,368
where is oops debug write debug platform

464
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:14,778
write entire file is going to take this

465
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:16,888
stuff so it's going to take a filename

466
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:18,358
which we don't really know what that is

467
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:20,638
yet and then it's going to take the

468
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:23,989
total size of whatever it is that we're

469
00:23:20,638 --> 00:23:23,988
trying to write yeah

470
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:32,638
well that shouldn't be too difficult I

471
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:34,979
suppose at the end of the day let's just

472
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:36,358
do the most straightforward thing and

473
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:38,519
you know what this actually dovetails

474
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:41,519
nicely because we're gonna have to

475
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,819
replace the stuff that does print effing

476
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,440
in standard i/o because we still are

477
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:49,019
using that so this will be another

478
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,499
reason for that because we would need to

479
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,729
use it here as well so again if we can

480
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:55,019
just tie everything to just one thing

481
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:57,330
where we're like we need to replace a

482
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:58,558
little printf thing then that's kind of

483
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:00,749
a good impetus to do it so we're not

484
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,098
replacing something just for the one

485
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:03,960
debug output it actually feels like

486
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:07,229
maybe there's a little bit more that

487
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,489
we're using there right so what I'm

488
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:12,470
going to do is I'm going to take the

489
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:12,470
debug state debug arena

490
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,150
and I'm gonna say that we just have some

491
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:22,720
room there for writing this file I guess

492
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,370
I don't actually know maybe I'll even do

493
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,880
it a little bit simpler so maybe I'll

494
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:31,089
just do something like you know temp

495
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,040
here I'm just gonna do the most basic

496
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:35,889
thing for the moment so if I have

497
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,230
something like that literally if I just

498
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:42,030
called what we have in this in the what

499
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:47,048
we were already calling in here right

500
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:50,289
where is that guy right we've got this

501
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:53,079
guy here so if I'm already calling that

502
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:55,480
then I know that as long as I play stat

503
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,819
function then both of these guys will

504
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,279
work so I won't have to worry about

505
00:24:57,819 --> 00:25:03,909
doing extra stuff when I go to replace

506
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:06,389
that stare and IO dot H include so if I

507
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,779
go ahead and print out to this guy I

508
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:12,250
know what I would need to print for

509
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:15,329
replacing this config file I would just

510
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,160
need to print debug you I use camera

511
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:20,199
like so right and then I would need to

512
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,759
print whatever that value of it was and

513
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,410
I would need to print this be 32

514
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,579
whatever that is and I need to print the

515
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,890
pound to find in front of it

516
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:30,308
but that would right that would reprint

517
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,750
out what's in that file you know and it

518
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:34,058
would print it out to this buffer and

519
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,190
then this would tell me how big it was

520
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:38,589
so this is how this is how much because

521
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,630
this function returns how many things

522
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:43,539
that output so I could just say write

523
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,790
that whatever you stuck in the temp

524
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:50,019
write it out to whatever the config file

525
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:52,389
is and so can made config file name or

526
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:54,220
something I don't know who knows right

527
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:59,740
whatever the config file name actually

528
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:01,919
is so if that's what we're gonna do go

529
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,919
ahead

530
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,880
take a drink there so that what we're

531
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,200
gonna do all we need to do know then is

532
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,929
what the actual state of this thing's

533
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,569
gonna pay for just for the moment I'll

534
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:23,330
go ahead and take in something that's

535
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:25,769
like you know use debug camera like so

536
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:28,019
and now this will print you know either

537
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,279
0 1 depending on what that was set to

538
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,679
and so that will change that

539
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,019
automatically and then we'll write that

540
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,700
and for the moment I'll just our code

541
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,410
this string so that we don't have to

542
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,759
deal with that at the moment but we'll

543
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,019
have to change this just to make sure

544
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:42,119
that it works on everyone else's machine

545
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:45,539
although I guess if our bill directory

546
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:47,819
is relative right if builds if we're

547
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,950
running in handmade data then all we

548
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:52,200
need to do is go back 1 for code so I

549
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,660
guess all we really have to do is say we

550
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,220
go back 1 go in the code directory and

551
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:04,919
we rewrite handmade config dot H right

552
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:06,660
so if I was to do that I guess that

553
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,650
would probably just always work would it

554
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,808
not so we just need our platform here

555
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,548
and I don't remember what the name of

556
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:18,539
that actually was it so it's just

557
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:20,789
platform so if I do that that rewrites

558
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,970
the config file right it rewrites the C

559
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,769
file for us so in here if I was to go

560
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,169
through and every time we were to

561
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:31,200
execute one of these guys right where we

562
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:33,360
do this sort of nonsense if I were to go

563
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:39,240
ahead and actually rewrite the config

564
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:41,009
file here like so for now I'll just

565
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:44,279
hard-coded to setting it to true that

566
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:46,919
means every time we do a gesture it'll

567
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:49,470
rewrite the config file does that make

568
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:51,929
sense so we can see this in action

569
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,529
presumably already there's handmade duct

570
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:56,669
config and here I go running I'm gonna

571
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:59,730
go in here I'm just gonna execute

572
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:01,500
anything and then I'm gonna close and in

573
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,058
theory now when I reload this you can

574
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,240
see it changed the config file from a 0

575
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:08,879
to a 1 right so now we've got our

576
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,970
receipt program is writing out its own

577
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,410
self so that it can modify itself

578
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,319
without us having to do anything

579
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:19,040
complicated like write our own compiler

580
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:21,159
right so now the only question is how

581
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,750
would we get ourselves to recompile

582
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,450
right because we want to be able to

583
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,920
recompile so let me go ahead and set

584
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,230
that back to zero so we're not using the

585
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,730
debug camera and so what I want to do is

586
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,529
be able to make it so that I execute

587
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:36,680
that and then it just recompiles itself

588
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:37,490
right so if I was going to do that how

589
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,259
would I do that

590
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,940
well if I want to do that really what I

591
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:44,029
need is I need the platform layer to do

592
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,820
something here which I assume is

593
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:51,230
something like you know execute debug

594
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:53,179
execute system command right something

595
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,220
like that and presumably what I want to

596
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:59,720
say is well where is the build normally

597
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:02,779
run from well all we normally do is in

598
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,769
handmade code we run the build dot bat

599
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:08,509
right we just run that thing so in that

600
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:12,170
same way I could say go to this

601
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:13,759
directory run build duck bat except it's

602
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,740
a little bit trickier than that because

603
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,779
technically it's not build not bat that

604
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,670
we're running because build up at is a

605
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:22,759
batch file right technically what we're

606
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:25,670
doing is we're running CMD write CMD is

607
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:32,809
the command-line interpreter I did see

608
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:34,660
windows write system 32 probably right

609
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:37,849
that's what we're actually running and

610
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,740
so if I wanted to run that I could tell

611
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,869
that hey I need you to execute that

612
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,519
build dot bat and presumably it would oh

613
00:29:41,869 --> 00:29:46,309
I think you need a command-line switch

614
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,160
there right like minus K something like

615
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:53,539
that I don't remember

616
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,470
is there a switch let's see curiously

617
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:59,539
the commands for the string and then

618
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:03,559
terminates so /c is what it is looks

619
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:08,329
like let's try that so if I did /c build

620
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:10,190
bat so there it is right that built and

621
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:12,019
then if we were to execute oh and it

622
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,950
sorry it auto execute so I didn't need

623
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:17,779
to exit right so just /c build that bat

624
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,360
is really the only thing that we need to

625
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:24,559
do right we can just run command deck

626
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:27,349
dot exe and tell it hey I need you to

627
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,428
run build that bat so if we had a way of

628
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:30,498
saying

629
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:34,460
I need you to execute this system

630
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:37,249
command in this directory please that

631
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,769
would make our stuff work and so the

632
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:41,659
question is can we do that and of course

633
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:43,368
obviously if things can execute system

634
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:45,649
commands there must be a way to do it

635
00:30:43,368 --> 00:30:48,439
and of course in win32 there actually is

636
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:50,178
I mean you know right so if I wanted to

637
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,308
go ahead and expand our platform layer

638
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:54,259
slightly here to say that there's going

639
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,668
to be some kind of a debug think you're

640
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:58,639
we're in addition to all these other

641
00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:03,259
things we have debug platform you know

642
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:10,278
execute system command something like

643
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:12,710
that debug platform execute system

644
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:18,048
command and again that's going to take

645
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:24,649
sort of the the path the command and the

646
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:25,970
command line right and presumably I

647
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:27,378
guess if we return to bool through -

648
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,788
that's like whether well you know what

649
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:31,609
it could I think most system commands

650
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:34,158
typically return like like an S 32 like

651
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:36,949
an int error code so maybe maybe we'll

652
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,019
get that back I don't really know but so

653
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,639
we'll try that and then what I'll do is

654
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:43,609
I'll say okay that debug platform

655
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:47,449
execute system command thing I'm just

656
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:48,979
gonna go ahead and and inside like one

657
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,720
of these guys here so I don't know like

658
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,460
a platform API where we have all the

659
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,798
rest of stuff and it's gonna say debug

660
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:57,649
execute system command is gonna be in

661
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:01,759
there so at that point everything would

662
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:04,248
work if we had this magical thing that

663
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,960
actually would do debug execute system

664
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:09,319
command so we just have to figure out

665
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:12,079
some way to do that yeah in win32 right

666
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:20,139
so there's our texture system and

667
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:22,849
platform right entire file like that

668
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:26,360
so debug execute system command here we

669
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:31,039
are and I don't even remember how to do

670
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:35,869
this in Windows win32 execute system

671
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:38,240
command let's see how we do that system

672
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:45,189
function shell execute is not really

673
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:47,900
what we want see if they got this here

674
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:52,390
create process is probably what we want

675
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,390
actually I know that I think about it

676
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,880
yeah I think create process is probably

677
00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:00,259
what we want I don't think she'll

678
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,090
execute is what we want because she'll

679
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:04,309
execute goes to the shell and that's

680
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:07,369
more for like I want to open a file you

681
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:09,619
know the way Explorer would open a file

682
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:12,289
which doesn't seem particularly useful

683
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:14,299
to me so I think we probably just want

684
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:16,879
to do create process that seems like the

685
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:19,909
better thing to do mmm that's what I

686
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,370
would say so if we're gonna do create

687
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,410
process that's gonna return us the

688
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:27,919
success or the failure there so here we

689
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:29,450
go we've got application name we've got

690
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,700
all this stuff here so the application

691
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,580
name we know what that is right that's

692
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:38,210
gonna be one of the things that we got

693
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:41,119
passed in here right so let's take a

694
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:44,029
look that's gonna be command of the

695
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,769
command line we have it's this process

696
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:47,569
attributes I have no idea what that even

697
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:49,160
means those are security attributes so

698
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,389
let's just say that that's null for now

699
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,890
cuz I don't really know what it should

700
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,840
be

701
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,130
thread attributes again these are just

702
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,529
security attributes we don't probably

703
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,880
care about those inherit handles is

704
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:00,769
whether it will inherit are like

705
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,320
printing and that's rest up I don't

706
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:05,359
think I want to do that yet if we do it

707
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:09,409
at all right

708
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:12,170
we have DW creation flags what are the

709
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,730
creation flags this friend let's see

710
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:16,909
creation flags screen also controls the

711
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,110
new processes priority class for a list

712
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,000
of values if another protocol says the

713
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,170
process normal that's what we want I

714
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,670
don't think we need anything besides

715
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:28,099
normal so let's see here do we care

716
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:30,680
about any of these separating suspended

717
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,389
debug process I don't think we need any

718
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:33,230
of these so I think that's probably just

719
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,489
a zero

720
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,990
I don't think we have any flags that

721
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:40,309
could be wrong I don't think so we don't

722
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:42,428
need to change the environment it can

723
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:46,820
just use the calling processes

724
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:49,389
environment yes I would think I guess

725
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:52,329
I'd have to yeah I think that's fine

726
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:55,760
yeah

727
00:34:52,329 --> 00:35:00,430
current directory we know what that is

728
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,920
that's this path here the startup info

729
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:06,368
let's see can this be no important just

730
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,200
startup info or a startup info e^x is

731
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:10,519
there anything in so we do need one of

732
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,219
these guys it looks like and then

733
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:15,079
process information receives a handle

734
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:19,419
about the new process so we need a

735
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,420
startup info let's see what's in there

736
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:40,460
and a process information ok it seems to

737
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,659
be off by one here that's a bit of a

738
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,858
mistake

739
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:48,049
so startup info do I really can't I just

740
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:49,400
get this from somewhere do I really need

741
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,289
to fill all that out that seems like a

742
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,160
lot

743
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:58,460
response we're ensuring the standard

744
00:35:52,159 --> 00:36:02,210
handle feels these fields yeah I don't

745
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:05,179
know create process they're a good

746
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,800
example creating processes I want to see

747
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:11,868
what they say if I actually have to do

748
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:15,318
all that startup info oh it looks like

749
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:16,940
it's going to take care of it for me if

750
00:36:15,318 --> 00:36:20,750
I just pass all zeros it looks like it's

751
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:23,630
fine that's what they're doing here so

752
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,239
that should be pretty easy looks like if

753
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,500
I just initialize those two to nothing

754
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:29,419
and then I need to make sure I set the

755
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,619
startup info I think it had a size one

756
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,530
of those things we have to set the size

757
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:37,250
as Windows loves to do one of the

758
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:39,829
dumbest API decisions so stupid but yeah

759
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,590
so the Seabee structure has to be set to

760
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:44,260
the size of

761
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,059
info and I don't know if process info

762
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,810
also has that but I suspect that it does

763
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:51,279
not but let's take a look yes oh that's

764
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:54,130
fine

765
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,800
so there we go we're just going to call

766
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:00,180
create process there and for now I'm

767
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,560
just going to return the result of zero

768
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:04,750
because we're not even going to wait for

769
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,299
the process to finish but we'll probably

770
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,619
add that so we'll just do something here

771
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,530
where we have liked it if so we know

772
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:16,679
that we will do something to do wait for

773
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:21,190
completion and get return code probably

774
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:22,839
but let's take a look I think we had 15

775
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,960
minutes left on the clock so we probably

776
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,700
have about 20 minutes left right now

777
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:32,130
so d-box might actually commands too few

778
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:37,179
arguments for call is that really true

779
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:40,570
really I think there are three there so

780
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:46,750
I must have typed made a typo down here

781
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:49,030
and let's take a look d boobs go away

782
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,280
you next thing I can't see I'm not you

783
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:55,530
next thing handmaid hear a thing I can't

784
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:58,740
see my mini buffer fade away fade away

785
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:02,080
five-minute warning needs to fade away

786
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:03,549
alright it's not fading away execute

787
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,849
system command debug askew system

788
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:13,230
command debug platform boots platform

789
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:13,230
execute system

790
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:26,209
oh I was just missing a comma that's all

791
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:28,070
alright um so this needs to be that was

792
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,670
a typo that needs to be executed system

793
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,920
command okay so I don't know what this

794
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:36,490
is gonna do they're probably not quite

795
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,470
ready yet but I'll go ahead and test it

796
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:41,809
so here we are and we go ahead and

797
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:43,338
toggle something and it does not appear

798
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:45,409
to have actually we compiled anything

799
00:38:43,338 --> 00:38:48,230
right at least I don't I don't see

800
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:49,868
anything so we probably did rewrite the

801
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:52,369
file because that was working just fine

802
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,140
that's in config so I'm guessing that

803
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:55,670
got changed right but we didn't

804
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:59,299
recompile and so what I want to do is

805
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:04,730
see why we didn't compile right so debug

806
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:06,440
execute system command I want to go

807
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:10,369
ahead and see what happens if I step in

808
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,530
there here we go right and I've got the

809
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:14,660
command as command eggsy I've got the

810
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,160
command line C build up bat I've got all

811
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:18,230
this stuff set to nothing start up in

812
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,239
fair process info I'm gonna go ahead and

813
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,849
run I want to see if anything happened

814
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,459
so we got back false so that didn't work

815
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:27,170
and so basically we just have a bug in

816
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,309
the way we're calling this we're

817
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,829
probably not specifying something

818
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:32,088
correctly so what I'm gonna do is see if

819
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:34,969
I can get a little bit more error

820
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:39,170
information from Windows in the case

821
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:42,769
where it goes wrong right and so get

822
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:46,159
last error is the way Windows does their

823
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:48,619
reporting it's super janky and not

824
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,969
particularly fantastic but you go in

825
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:53,420
here and you say get last error and it

826
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:56,989
returns you a D word that tells you what

827
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:59,539
the error was so if we do this we can

828
00:39:56,989 --> 00:40:02,509
then you know look at what the error

829
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:04,190
actually is just I yeah you know I'm

830
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,720
gonna have to put so it doesn't go out

831
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,179
of scope because the visual studio

832
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,739
debugger is so awful I gotta just kind

833
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:13,368
of do something with it there so that we

834
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:16,579
can actually see it but if I set this

835
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:20,210
breakpoint and we run the game I should

836
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:21,588
be able to step in there and and see

837
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,720
what happens so there we go

838
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:26,690
here is the error code the error code is

839
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,699
two and there's a little convenient

840
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,309
tool I think usually here error lookup

841
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:34,039
you can put in the two and hit lookup

842
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:36,079
cannot find the file specified so I'm

843
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:42,289
guessing that it's just not in the path

844
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:44,210
for some reason I'm not sure but if

845
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:47,719
that's the case that's pretty easy to

846
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:53,119
solve right if that's the case we can

847
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:56,809
just do something like this right and

848
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,059
say could you go run that please right

849
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:01,340
now the other thing too that I don't

850
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:06,440
actually know is I don't know whether

851
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:07,880
this needs to be back slashed as well so

852
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:15,740
maybe I'll just try that for us just to

853
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:17,030
make sure yeah all right so let's see

854
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:22,759
what happens if I give it a more

855
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:26,650
explicit path to the file the

856
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,650
interpreter and we'll see if that works

857
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:35,329
so it actually does appear to work right

858
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,349
that seems like it is running our build

859
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:38,349
just fine

860
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:46,489
would you agree so given the fats the

861
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:48,610
case now that we have that compiling

862
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:50,899
what I'll probably do is just say okay

863
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:53,150
let's go ahead and actually make that

864
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,340
feature work because why not

865
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,590
so if I come in here and I do something

866
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,450
like again I'm just sort of showing give

867
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,180
getting the sort of basic stuff out

868
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:03,679
there so if I have something in here

869
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:06,559
that's going to track what this variable

870
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,839
actually should be I guess now I think

871
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,610
about it all I really have to do I don't

872
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,590
even really need a variable all I really

873
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:15,920
need to do is just say hey whenever you

874
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:19,070
go to write this thing out right and

875
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,289
hand-made debug that cpp just write out

876
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,080
whatever you had in your config file

877
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,789
right just write out the opposite of

878
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,880
that

879
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:31,550
so that'll do a toggle right so now

880
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,099
every time that I want to switch I

881
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,920
should be able to switch and it will

882
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:39,029
compile right like this and you can see

883
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:43,289
now we can actually switch between them

884
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:47,640
so now we basically have sort of like

885
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:50,250
uber uber debug UI in the sense that now

886
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:52,349
we actually don't even have to have any

887
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,210
runtime cost for our debug stuff at all

888
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,630
they can literally be compiled out

889
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:59,789
completely and we can still toggle them

890
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,490
at runtime while the game is running and

891
00:42:59,789 --> 00:43:04,860
not have to actually do anything at all

892
00:43:02,489 --> 00:43:06,359
right it's the it's the perfect it's

893
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,300
like you get the perfect everything

894
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,740
right now one thing that's a little

895
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,960
annoying there that's you know that's

896
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:19,469
not probably not the best thing in the

897
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:22,710
world is that annoying kind of pop-up

898
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:26,250
that sort of happens there so what I

899
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:28,679
would like to do instead I think is

900
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:32,460
maybe manage that process a little bit

901
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:34,289
more what I'd like to know is can I just

902
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,449
go ahead and make it so that that thing

903
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:38,759
doesn't actually pop up an actual window

904
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:40,500
so I'm gonna I don't know very much

905
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,000
about calling CMD like this like I said

906
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,820
I've never done this before what I'm

907
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,380
doing I'm totally making this up as I go

908
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:50,180
so if I go in here and I say for CMD

909
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:57,119
what do you do

910
00:43:50,179 --> 00:43:58,799
let's see so it looks like a hyper file

911
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,299
to be antsy causes the output of

912
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,130
internal transfer of high profile to be

913
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,130
unicode blah blah blah blah blah

914
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:13,260
none of this stuff looks interesting at

915
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:14,490
all yeah so what I want to do is I want

916
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,740
to have a little bit more control over

917
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,929
that window so I'm just wondering I

918
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:20,819
wondering if the startup info stuff

919
00:44:18,929 --> 00:44:24,659
would allow me to do that so if I went

920
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:27,240
did the startup info thing I wonder if I

921
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:32,339
can pass something in the startup info

922
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:35,219
right that would make that not happen so

923
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:37,620
say for example wmw show window which is

924
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:39,929
the show window code in Windows I wonder

925
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:42,239
if I just straight up set that to say

926
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:44,159
like hi you know like don't show right

927
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,509
don't show the window if it would

928
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,949
prevent the window from pop you would

929
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:50,520
just leave it minimized which I'd be

930
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:54,088
fine with right so if we if we did show

931
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:57,190
window let's see here

932
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:58,690
right it can be whatever we want this

933
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:02,190
member can be any of the values that can

934
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:05,200
be specified in show window so SW hide

935
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:08,530
should be one of them right so I feel

936
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:11,379
like that might be a good way just to

937
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:13,150
start cleaning that up a little bit so

938
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,329
let's go ahead and and look it winds

939
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:18,010
pretty - handmade let's go in here and

940
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:24,849
say all right

941
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:28,920
we we've got the got the startup info so

942
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:36,329
I'm gonna go ahead and set that value

943
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,329
doo doo doo where'd you go W show window

944
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:43,108
and I'm just gonna see if that helps us

945
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:46,529
at all avoid that kind of annoying

946
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:49,150
window nonsense so it's still showing it

947
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:52,869
right that is not hiding a window I

948
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:57,430
don't see that as being a hide at all so

949
00:45:52,869 --> 00:46:05,789
that's kind of annoying why is that the

950
00:45:57,429 --> 00:46:12,429
case why did you not hide the window why

951
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:16,509
why I asked you oh it's if DW flags so I

952
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:22,960
have to all sorry I have to also set you

953
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:26,560
show window okay so I have to also set

954
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,108
you show window in DW flags that seems

955
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,750
easy enough to do let's go ahead and do

956
00:46:29,108 --> 00:46:35,348
that

957
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:38,889
startup info W flags equals start a few

958
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:45,119
show window so now will you hide the

959
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:45,118
window please nice

960
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:55,599
it's lovely right good how nice that is

961
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:57,040
okay so what I'd like to do now is since

962
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,719
we're not showing the window we don't

963
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,250
really know if it compiles in progress

964
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,449
or exactly what's happening and we don't

965
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,579
know if there were errors in the compile

966
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:05,379
or any of that stuff so it might be nice

967
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:08,079
to kind of make that a little bit just a

968
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,730
little bit better when we actually do

969
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,119
this create process right we're gonna

970
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:14,559
get back this process info that process

971
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,449
info thing is going to come back to us

972
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:21,699
so if I look here at process information

973
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:23,559
we're actually going to get back this

974
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:25,119
this sort of handle information here

975
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:27,460
right a handle to the newly created

976
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,779
process this handle is yousef s4 the

977
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,090
process in all functions that perform

978
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:34,330
operations on the process object right

979
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:37,240
and IDs and stuff like this so what I

980
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:41,619
could do after that process information

981
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:43,299
thing happens is I could look and see if

982
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:46,659
there's some way to just say hey is this

983
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:49,450
process still active right like what's

984
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:51,849
the state of this process because there

985
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:56,259
should be something on here which allows

986
00:47:51,849 --> 00:48:03,089
me to do that right I don't know what it

987
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:06,090
is get process maybe there's an is is

988
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:06,090
process

989
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:16,940
and maybe query process query I don't

990
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:19,009
really know I could wait on the process

991
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,980
but I don't really want to do that I

992
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:25,640
just want something that tells me what

993
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:30,170
the state of the process is and I'm not

994
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:33,828
really sure what that would be now maybe

995
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:36,139
I could do a wait for single object on

996
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:38,390
the process like we saw before we have

997
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:40,009
the ability to wait on things so it's

998
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:44,059
possible that I could do a wait for

999
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:47,030
single object on a process and then just

1000
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:55,159
give it a timeout of zero seconds right

1001
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:58,780
Oh or is signaled whatever it was there

1002
00:48:55,159 --> 00:49:00,889
is one for is signaled right Bank

1003
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,960
because again I have a handle of the

1004
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:04,338
process which is itself a windows handle

1005
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,710
that I can do checking on just like we

1006
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:08,000
saw when we were working on this before

1007
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:09,500
where it's got this concept of being in

1008
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,539
a single state much like the seven-four

1009
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,550
isn't that sort of thing so I should be

1010
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:16,449
able to do something like wait on it or

1011
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:18,950
check to see what its state actually is

1012
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:23,088
so is there an azure also is there any

1013
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:24,348
way to just query that guy this is

1014
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:28,009
something I probably should know but

1015
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:29,109
have forgotten actually sorry to say so

1016
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,000
if I do

1017
00:49:29,108 --> 00:49:34,219
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah reset events at

1018
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,420
events bum

1019
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:39,000
unregister wait wait for multiple

1020
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,059
objects so wait for single object is

1021
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,860
probably all I would really need so if I

1022
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:45,449
did wait for single object it would

1023
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:50,340
return to me whether that object was

1024
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:53,219
signal signaled right so what I could do

1025
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,050
is just pass the handle and and then see

1026
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:55,799
so I'm gonna I'm just gonna see what

1027
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,750
happens here

1028
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,660
if I do wait for single object so I'm

1029
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:04,349
gonna do wait for single object I'm

1030
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:06,779
gonna pass the object that I got so that

1031
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:08,219
is gonna be in my process info and I

1032
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,930
think it just called H process for

1033
00:50:08,219 --> 00:50:11,489
americlean and I'm safe for the

1034
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:14,460
millisecond i'ma say infinite so I'm

1035
00:50:11,489 --> 00:50:16,559
just gonna have the game lock up until

1036
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,909
the compile is done that's what I'm

1037
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,989
hoping will happen here I don't really

1038
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:25,549
know right so here we go that's a good

1039
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:28,259
sign perfect okay so if that's the case

1040
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:30,630
that means I should be able to check to

1041
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,130
see if it's actually true let's see what

1042
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:35,010
the what does the D word supposed to

1043
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:38,010
return to me let's see here remarks

1044
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:39,390
where's return value if it succeeds I'm

1045
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:41,130
going to the event that caused the

1046
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:44,129
function return it can be one of the

1047
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:46,920
following values weight object zero okay

1048
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:49,110
so what we want to do is we want to say

1049
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:52,320
if weight person's about object equals

1050
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:55,410
weight object zero then and we can also

1051
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:58,559
pass zero here then we know that this

1052
00:50:55,409 --> 00:51:00,599
thing finished right so what I'm gonna

1053
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,299
do is I'm gonna give the debug system a

1054
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,789
way of actually managing that process

1055
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,440
sort of saying is the compiled like

1056
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:08,759
what's the status of the compile right

1057
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,400
like what's happening what's happening

1058
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,580
down there in that compile in that

1059
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:18,059
compiled so what I want to do is I want

1060
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:20,730
to say that there's some other thing

1061
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:25,489
happening here which is like a debug you

1062
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:28,110
know process something like that a debug

1063
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:30,479
executing process something like that

1064
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:32,370
and it's gonna have a return code and

1065
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,769
it's you know it's gonna have like a

1066
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,779
bool like is it running you know I'm

1067
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:39,989
saying

1068
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:43,140
and so what that'll do and and and I

1069
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:45,259
guess what we'll say is and did it did

1070
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:45,259
it

1071
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:53,309
started successfully you know like was

1072
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,880
it able to actually start the process is

1073
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:57,960
is it running now and then when it's not

1074
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,140
running anymore you could check the

1075
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,970
return code something like that and so

1076
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:04,889
when you actually do this execute system

1077
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:07,799
command it will return you one of these

1078
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:17,909
and so what I can do is I can say here

1079
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:20,280
is that process to me and we can also

1080
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:22,199
stick in here something like an OS

1081
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,330
handle thing because everyone's going to

1082
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:26,039
be either in a 64-bit integer and ensure

1083
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:27,509
of something like that so we should be

1084
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:28,739
able to also just make sure that we can

1085
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:31,500
always just stuff it in there so we

1086
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:32,819
don't have to do anything fancier like a

1087
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,019
pointer where we'd have to allocate

1088
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:38,730
memory for no real good reason right

1089
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:40,230
okay so if I have one of these now I've

1090
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,840
got a different kind of result it's

1091
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:45,300
coming back so in here what we do is

1092
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,880
we'd say if we got in here then we

1093
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,519
started it successfully so that's true

1094
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:54,360
and then we have the result is running

1095
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:56,940
it's also going to be equal to true you

1096
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:59,300
know now that I think about it if this

1097
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,460
is gonna be a query sort of a situation

1098
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,980
that's not actually what I would do I

1099
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:07,199
guess it's really more like this type

1100
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:12,000
def struct debug executing process

1101
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:16,829
actually is just a handle probably and

1102
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,050
this is a debug process State and it

1103
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:23,250
returns these sorts of things I would

1104
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:26,580
assume is more the situation right and

1105
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:29,159
so this OS handle will just be set to

1106
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:33,079
like an invalid handle value if things

1107
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:36,539
don't work that be my Debbie my guess

1108
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:39,630
right and so what we do is say debug

1109
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:45,139
platform get system command state or

1110
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:45,140
something or get process state

1111
00:53:46,608 --> 00:53:59,190
and you just pass this executing process

1112
00:53:51,389 --> 00:54:01,230
handle back that's what I think so yeah

1113
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:03,720
in here you would get a debug process

1114
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:08,099
state back and you'd pass debug

1115
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:13,098
executing process in like so and then

1116
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:15,930
when you do get the process state form

1117
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:18,300
process state you can find out you know

1118
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:24,210
if it's still running or what's going on

1119
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:29,789
right that seems reasonable for now

1120
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:33,690
that's the basic the basic okay so debug

1121
00:54:29,789 --> 00:54:35,400
executing process pure if you get in

1122
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,650
cure to the starting successfully bit

1123
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,019
and all that kind of stuff I'm gonna go

1124
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,490
ahead and actually just make this stuff

1125
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:42,809
happen as well because we kind of know

1126
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:44,399
exactly what this is gonna do now I

1127
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:49,619
already just said exactly what's gonna

1128
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:53,550
do so we've got debug get process state

1129
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:56,220
so so what I want to do is that's going

1130
00:54:53,550 --> 00:55:03,650
to go in here like this

1131
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:06,750
and what's going to happen is right here

1132
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:09,240
when we call create process that's when

1133
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:12,059
we would know that we can set the OS

1134
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:14,669
handle equal to whatever the process

1135
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:25,039
info each process is so we can store it

1136
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:29,338
for later right something like that so I

1137
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:31,980
guess we actually so I don't really know

1138
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:33,328
how to maybe convert I guess what we

1139
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,980
would probably want to do is do this the

1140
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:39,060
other direction so we probably want to

1141
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:41,699
just assert that whatever size our OS

1142
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:43,619
handle is it's greater than or equal to

1143
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:45,328
whatever the size of this thing is so we

1144
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:46,980
know we can store it properly and then

1145
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:49,859
we probably want to do it actually like

1146
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:52,230
this right we're just gonna say like

1147
00:55:49,858 --> 00:55:54,210
romp into that memory whatever the H

1148
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,309
process is we don't care how big it is

1149
00:55:54,210 --> 00:56:00,039
as long as it fits just fit it in

1150
00:55:57,309 --> 00:56:02,619
and that'll be fine if that doesn't

1151
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:05,130
happen then what we'll do is set result

1152
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:08,608
OS handle equal to invalid handle value

1153
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:11,559
and so then I think we're all good

1154
00:56:08,608 --> 00:56:13,900
at least I think okay say the reason why

1155
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:16,569
we wouldn't be so then when we come in

1156
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:20,639
here we would know that this thing that

1157
00:56:16,568 --> 00:56:22,778
we need to do do by process State result

1158
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:28,868
all we would need to do there is say

1159
00:56:22,778 --> 00:56:32,980
okay first of all if if the OS handle

1160
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:35,559
that we'd get so if the process OS

1161
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:37,480
handle if that equals invalid handle

1162
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:40,180
value then we know that the result

1163
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,099
started successfully is false

1164
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:44,078
in fact old we know all that stuff is

1165
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:46,119
zero so we just leave it as it is so

1166
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,430
basically it's only if it's not people

1167
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:50,019
to enhance invalid handle value that we

1168
00:56:48,429 --> 00:56:51,879
would go through with it and assuming

1169
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:57,159
that it's not we can then look and say

1170
00:56:51,880 --> 00:57:03,460
okay if we if we go ahead and say the

1171
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:05,500
process to me OS handle pass that back

1172
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,139
to Windows say is this still running

1173
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,969
if Windows says it's not running then we

1174
00:57:08,139 --> 00:57:11,019
can close the handle here because we

1175
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,759
don't need to deal with the handle

1176
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:17,500
anymore right we could just get rid of

1177
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:20,010
it and and waste I think that seems

1178
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,010
reasonable

1179
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:27,250
I don't know if we want to do that we

1180
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:31,800
may want to release the handle in sort

1181
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:36,250
of a different way that's that's a tough

1182
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:41,650
call it's a tough call I'm gonna do it

1183
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:50,250
this way for now but to do do we want a

1184
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:50,250
formal release mechanism here probably

1185
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:58,360
debug code doesn't really matter but so

1186
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:00,970
anyway we'll go ahead and close this up

1187
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:05,610
effect I'll I'll go ahead and and do get

1188
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:09,669
the H process back bear more explicitly

1189
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:11,610
there it is so assuming that we get back

1190
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:14,110
with the fact that it's been signaled

1191
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:17,710
then we kind of know what happened here

1192
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:22,960
we know that it well we know in either

1193
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:27,159
case it started successfully and we also

1194
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:31,329
know that it's running now or I should

1195
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:33,549
say it's running if we don't lock on it

1196
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:35,650
in this case we know that it has stopped

1197
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:38,200
running it's completed so we want the

1198
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:39,430
return code I don't know if we can do I

1199
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:40,869
think there's something like get exit

1200
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:44,319
code or something like that that we can

1201
00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:45,670
do like get process exit code there

1202
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:55,350
should be some way we can get the exit

1203
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:55,349
code so get-get-get where is it

1204
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:08,289
hello no rush there okay so if we pass

1205
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,778
the process it'll give us back the exit

1206
00:59:08,289 --> 00:59:14,049
code so that's cool

1207
00:59:10,778 --> 00:59:16,568
I think that's what we want so basically

1208
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:19,380
we say is here's the exit code actually

1209
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:19,380
I guess we just do this

1210
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:34,348
code zero turn code and then we'll just

1211
00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:37,798
assume that that goes okay what it's

1212
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:40,630
it's fine don't worry about it

1213
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:43,028
all right so if that's where we're at I

1214
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:46,778
think that's mostly implemented for the

1215
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:49,358
most part for the most part oops we need

1216
00:59:46,778 --> 00:59:54,639
a debug executing process and debug

1217
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:57,670
process State and so I'm almost that

1218
00:59:54,639 --> 01:00:00,308
time I am out of time I got a stop codon

1219
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:03,099
it's too bad this kind of fun thing to

1220
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:05,230
do and wanted to kind of finish but you

1221
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:08,410
know what are you gonna do all right so

1222
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:10,028
let's go ahead here and make that work

1223
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:12,159
that way as well so that it doesn't

1224
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:14,409
complain about my little shuffle

1225
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:18,969
typecasting doing my little thing and

1226
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:20,980
dancing around and so on and here we can

1227
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:28,568
do the same thing so we just go each

1228
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:32,170
process and that is that so now what we

1229
01:00:28,568 --> 01:00:36,400
can do is we can do something like in

1230
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:39,068
the debug system we can have we can keep

1231
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,440
one of these so we hand may platform we

1232
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:44,650
have the debug process state we can have

1233
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,269
the compiler you know or something is

1234
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,710
there

1235
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:52,268
oops I didn't mean that I mean give a

1236
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:55,619
executing process like so and what I can

1237
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:59,649
do is I can say initialize this maybe

1238
01:00:55,619 --> 01:01:01,750
we'll just say compiling as a thing and

1239
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:03,730
there's the handle of the compiler so

1240
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,349
then what I'll do is when we launch one

1241
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:07,750
of those we know the compiling is

1242
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:11,940
normally set to false when we go ahead

1243
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:11,940
and set that up

1244
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:21,960
when we do a right hand made config and

1245
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:24,559
we do our execute debug command what

1246
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:27,750
we'll do is we'll say debug state

1247
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:30,199
compiling equals true I'm also gonna do

1248
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:35,880
it here where I say if debug state

1249
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:38,939
compiling it's not equal to true

1250
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,250
or I should say if not compiling I don't

1251
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:43,679
want to launch two compilers then we set

1252
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:48,780
it equal to true we step set the

1253
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:50,009
compiler we put a platform debug system

1254
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,070
okay

1255
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:55,950
and so in theory now what should happen

1256
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:58,140
is when I do this it will only let us

1257
01:01:55,949 --> 01:02:00,779
compile once right because we set it and

1258
01:01:58,139 --> 01:02:02,339
we never clear it so now it did one

1259
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,200
compile and now if I do another compile

1260
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:06,840
it should not do anything and that's

1261
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,429
what it does right so what I want to do

1262
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,840
now is I just want to take one more step

1263
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:11,309
like I said coming into this so I sorry

1264
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,099
I went if I'm going like three or four

1265
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:16,980
minutes over here but now when I've got

1266
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:18,960
that and I know it's compiling what I

1267
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:22,500
can do is when I when I'm printing out

1268
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,780
debug text here write this this sort of

1269
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,250
thing debug text align what I can do is

1270
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,690
at the top of this right I can do

1271
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:33,170
something where I sort of say like oh

1272
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:33,170
hey you know if a debug state compiling

1273
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:40,500
then I want to in here get the status of

1274
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:42,930
that I want to do I want to find out the

1275
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,639
process state so I want to I want to

1276
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:48,989
figure out what that state is so I want

1277
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:53,368
to do a platform debug process state and

1278
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:56,358
I want to pass it the compiler and if

1279
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,358
the state is running

1280
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:04,929
then I'm just gonna print out a debug

1281
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:08,200
text sign this just says compiling you

1282
01:03:04,929 --> 01:03:10,000
know me if it's not then that's done so

1283
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:12,899
we're done with the process and I can I

1284
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:16,269
can set compiling to false

1285
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:19,869
you know I mean seems pretty reasonable

1286
01:03:16,269 --> 01:03:25,269
to me nothing too bizarre going down

1287
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:27,609
there a platform API doesn't have that

1288
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:31,409
oh man it doesn't totes

1289
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:33,120
right man you are totes right about that

1290
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:37,889
let's fix that

1291
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,889
where am i platform API OTT where it at

1292
01:03:38,429 --> 01:03:46,259
sorry used slang there that's not good

1293
01:03:42,929 --> 01:03:51,809
kids you should talk in regular English

1294
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:55,020
okay so debug get processed state groups

1295
01:03:51,809 --> 01:04:00,820
so debug get process states happening

1296
01:03:55,019 --> 01:04:06,030
and I'm gonna go ahead and where is that

1297
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:06,030
stuff API it is

1298
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:12,849
get process state so now I should be

1299
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:15,519
able to actually compile and in theory

1300
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:17,920
now the compiler runs as a subset of our

1301
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:24,179
game and there it is compiling and now

1302
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:29,550
it's done compiling done beautiful

1303
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:32,169
beautiful so that's pretty awesome I

1304
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:33,820
would say because the stuff that we are

1305
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:36,460
about to be able to do with that is

1306
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:40,120
gonna be kind of off the chain if I

1307
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:44,289
don't mind saying I have never done that

1308
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:45,989
before I don't know why but this is

1309
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:48,340
about to get pretty real here

1310
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:50,609
tomorrow's gonna be a pretty crazy day I

1311
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:52,600
have a feeling but I'm gonna stop there

1312
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:54,960
so we can take a few minutes of

1313
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:54,960
questions

1314
01:04:55,829 --> 01:05:08,179
all right folks let's do this

1315
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:08,179
send me your questions Q : please

1316
01:05:31,068 --> 01:05:38,068
powers c9k why be able to compile from

1317
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:41,130
the game if we can do it from the editor

1318
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:43,018
is it just to be cool well being cool is

1319
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:45,150
definitely a good idea I I wouldn't

1320
01:05:43,018 --> 01:05:47,488
necessarily knock that as a reason but

1321
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:49,528
it's so that we can just not have to tab

1322
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:53,278
back and forth right it's like if I'm

1323
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:56,728
running the game and I'm trying to work

1324
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:59,849
on something here right and I want to do

1325
01:05:56,728 --> 01:06:01,259
some UI thing it's cut you know and I

1326
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:03,929
want to turn something on and off I'd

1327
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:07,289
rather not have to then tab you know go

1328
01:06:03,929 --> 01:06:08,969
like this recompile tab back and then

1329
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:10,409
finish what I was doing right I want to

1330
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:12,989
be able to just do stuff and have an

1331
01:06:10,409 --> 01:06:14,519
update now like I said I've never really

1332
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:16,438
done it before so maybe it turns out to

1333
01:06:14,518 --> 01:06:17,608
not be that useful or something but I

1334
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:20,158
just feel like that's kind of a cool way

1335
01:06:17,608 --> 01:06:21,989
to do a debug switch instead of actually

1336
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,390
having the debug switches always be

1337
01:06:21,989 --> 01:06:26,489
actually all compiled in and actually

1338
01:06:24,389 --> 01:06:27,658
doing branches all over the place to

1339
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:32,608
decide whether or not they're going to

1340
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:34,019
execute CRO hell dragon compile and mr.

1341
01:06:32,608 --> 01:06:36,568
fourths editor and do all the game

1342
01:06:34,018 --> 01:06:40,438
development work from in-game yeah I

1343
01:06:36,568 --> 01:06:42,088
would love it if if mr. forest editor

1344
01:06:40,438 --> 01:06:44,188
was a thing that you could just kind of

1345
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:45,509
compile in to your stuffer or there's

1346
01:06:44,188 --> 01:06:47,808
like a deal all you just call that would

1347
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:47,809
be pretty awesome

1348
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:55,019
and I see I like how it started info and

1349
01:06:53,769 --> 01:06:56,949
process underscore information

1350
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:58,389
inconsistency even in a single small

1351
01:06:56,949 --> 01:07:03,699
part of the one API do such things

1352
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:05,799
annoying you in a professional API you

1353
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:06,909
know those things might annoy me if it

1354
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,680
weren't for the fact that there's so

1355
01:07:06,909 --> 01:07:10,299
much other busted stuff you know that is

1356
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:11,919
a pretty small thing if that was the

1357
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:16,269
worst thing I would actually be really

1358
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,130
happy so so that sort of stuff you know

1359
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:19,179
it would it would only annoy me if we

1360
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:21,430
got rid of all the things that are

1361
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:24,129
absolutely horrifically bad that are

1362
01:07:21,429 --> 01:07:26,879
separate from that it's a pretty

1363
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:26,880
low-hanging thing

1364
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:38,068
mr. fourth-dimension why are we writing

1365
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:39,659
to a code file instead of just passing -

1366
01:07:38,068 --> 01:07:40,619
D - the build line seems like it would

1367
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:44,338
be a little easier although I have to

1368
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:48,059
admit you made that look pretty easy the

1369
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:49,920
reason is because it's about to get a

1370
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:52,170
lot more complicated than that and

1371
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,420
they'll probably be like 200 of those

1372
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:56,249
and they probably will have all things

1373
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:58,979
like strings in them or expressions and

1374
01:07:56,248 --> 01:08:00,778
stuff that might be annoying to try to

1375
01:07:58,978 --> 01:08:03,389
quote properly for passing to the shell

1376
01:08:00,778 --> 01:08:05,460
and might overflow size buffers or who

1377
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:09,150
knows what right so a code file I know I

1378
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:14,130
can do anything with and also it means

1379
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:16,859
that I they get remembered for like the

1380
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:18,960
next build that happens outside you know

1381
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:21,420
what I mean because like those settings

1382
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,658
I want to potentially persist if that

1383
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,658
makes sense

1384
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:31,649
zebra Caleb why not use system instead

1385
01:08:26,429 --> 01:08:36,440
of create process so system if I'm not

1386
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:36,439
mistaken is in the C runtime library

1387
01:08:36,588 --> 01:08:41,210
probably I don't actually know

1388
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:48,179
yeah systems in the C runtime library

1389
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,069
and so like I said I don't really want

1390
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:52,529
to use any libraries on handmade here

1391
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:54,480
like the final game I'd like to ship no

1392
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:56,400
libraries at all and right now the only

1393
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,439
thing that prevents us from saying we're

1394
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,348
already there is the C runtime library

1395
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:05,428
so I feel like I want to remove it and

1396
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:07,048
so if I want to minimize the number of

1397
01:09:05,429 --> 01:09:08,548
things that we call in there so that

1398
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:10,198
it's as easy as possible to remove it

1399
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:13,229
and so it was since it was free for me

1400
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:16,948
to use create process I didn't use

1401
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:18,388
system because it wouldn't take me any

1402
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:19,798
it didn't really take me any longer I

1403
01:09:18,389 --> 01:09:22,618
mean it maybe it would have saved five

1404
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:24,060
or ten minutes but it makes it so I

1405
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:26,130
don't have to use the C runtime library

1406
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:28,020
because like I said the end goal frame

1407
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:30,480
made here we already really only don't

1408
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:32,040
use any libraries that are external but

1409
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,318
we do still linked with the compilers

1410
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:37,908
library and I'd like to not even link

1411
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,909
with that when we get to the end

1412
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:47,489
gleamin 16:05 do you plan on reading the

1413
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:50,900
original config file and then rewriting

1414
01:09:47,488 --> 01:09:50,899
with modified values yes

1415
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:55,229
thus Isaac why not just set a boolean

1416
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,730
variable instead of recompiling a pound

1417
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:59,698
to fine because now we have no

1418
01:09:56,729 --> 01:10:02,250
performance overhead so for example we

1419
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:04,348
can put tons of debug code everywhere in

1420
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:08,130
our game including and here's the

1421
01:10:04,349 --> 01:10:12,480
spoiler alert including our profiling

1422
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:15,900
blocks so we can now turn on and off our

1423
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:19,589
profiling blocks dynamically in the

1424
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:20,879
game's UI so that if we have things that

1425
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,110
we don't want to profile a lot of the

1426
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,670
times because they generate too many

1427
01:10:22,109 --> 01:10:25,078
debug events it's okay we can actually

1428
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:26,429
turn them on in certain circumstances to

1429
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:29,429
turn them off and that can all be

1430
01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:31,020
completely flexible and handled within

1431
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:33,109
the game's UI which is gonna be pretty

1432
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,110
awesome

1433
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:45,219
will there be a dev console probably not

1434
01:10:43,569 --> 01:10:51,429
cuz I don't I can't think of any reason

1435
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:53,230
why I would need that student I'm 73

1436
01:10:51,429 --> 01:10:54,639
also system runs a program through

1437
01:10:53,229 --> 01:11:02,138
command dot exe which is yet another

1438
01:10:54,639 --> 01:11:03,489
dependency uh like it is but but not

1439
01:11:02,139 --> 01:11:04,840
really because we need that for our

1440
01:11:03,488 --> 01:11:08,649
build anyway so it's not really an

1441
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:15,819
additional dependency right

1442
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:16,988
I would everything I mean we need CMD so

1443
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:23,078
that's not really an additional one I

1444
01:11:16,988 --> 01:11:26,038
don't think but I don't know so it's at

1445
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:26,038
the end of the questions

1446
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:36,698
that's pretty great I wish Microsoft's

1447
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:38,289
compiler wasn't so slow because that

1448
01:11:36,698 --> 01:11:41,259
would the turnaround time there would be

1449
01:11:38,288 --> 01:11:43,389
much faster if it wasn't I guess we

1450
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:45,579
don't need the asset builder to be built

1451
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:52,739
anymore really because we did what we

1452
01:11:45,578 --> 01:11:52,738
wanted to do with it so there's that but

1453
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,360
the chat recommended create new window

1454
01:11:59,739 --> 01:12:02,559
as a process creation flag you could

1455
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,710
probably use that instead of the

1456
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:09,820
minimized window I don't think it's

1457
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:13,239
minimized though is it so if it's

1458
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:16,929
compiling it's not it's not there so

1459
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:18,819
it's it's SW hide is not SW minimize SW

1460
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:21,670
hide means don't ever show the window to

1461
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:23,170
the user at all so I don't think we need

1462
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,609
to make it not create a window I think

1463
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:26,560
it's okay that it creates its window we

1464
01:12:24,609 --> 01:12:27,789
just don't ever display that window and

1465
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,350
I think that might be better cuz I don't

1466
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:31,119
really know what happens if you tell it

1467
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:32,560
not to create a window at all I'm afraid

1468
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,720
that that maybe you know who knows if

1469
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:40,150
that breaks something sometimes I don't

1470
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:42,310
even know what is in the batch file

1471
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:44,170
that's run it's just our batch it's our

1472
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:46,180
standard build bat file that this is the

1473
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:50,739
build that we use so it's just running

1474
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:52,090
our normal build power c 9k why does it

1475
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:54,789
zoom out because that's what it's

1476
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:57,069
modifying the debug camera that's what

1477
01:12:54,789 --> 01:13:01,479
it's actually setting every time we do

1478
01:12:57,069 --> 01:13:05,909
that it sets the debug camera at acos it

1479
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:05,909
are using sublime no I'm using Emacs

1480
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:11,110
quantum placeand can you add a radial

1481
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:12,609
menu for debug camera instead of

1482
01:13:11,109 --> 01:13:14,889
piggybacking off topography it's bugging

1483
01:13:12,609 --> 01:13:19,989
me no because that's what we will be

1484
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:21,220
doing tomorrow no jumping ahead all

1485
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:24,909
right I'm gonna go ahead and shut down

1486
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:27,960
here that was pretty exciting I'm pretty

1487
01:13:24,909 --> 01:13:31,029
psyched about what that will let me do

1488
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:35,590
never actually done that before I don't

1489
01:13:31,029 --> 01:13:37,019
know why it took 60 minutes probably

1490
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:39,960
should've

1491
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:41,310
all right thank you everyone for joining

this compiled feature because I'm pretty

1520
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:35,699
psyched about it and there's all sorts

1521
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:38,279
of things I can think of that we could

1522
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:41,760

1523
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:43,289
that so that's about it for now I'll be
