00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,599
hello everybody welcome to handmade Hero

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,350
show recode a complete game live on

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,290
stream we are gonna be doing a bunch of

4
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:13,259
surprise streams all throughout December

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,268
here and well I guess late November in

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,560
honor of Krampus laughs which of course

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,829
is the Krampus run as you know Krampus

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:25,879
plays a big role in handmade hero and

9
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:28,679
one of the things that is celebrated

10
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:32,488
regretfully only overseas as far as I

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:36,960
know we do not have we do not have a

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:38,609
Krampus loft here in the US that I have

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,730
seen definitely not in Seattle that I've

14
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,128
ever seen but basically what it is is

15
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,369
it's a bunch of people dress up like

16
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:51,599
Krampus and they run around the streets

17
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:54,359
chasing little children around because I

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,980
don't know it's you know they want to

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,769
scare their children I guess for some

20
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,390
reason it sounds fantastically creepy

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,400
and exactly the sort of thing that I

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,109
think would be cool and so we have

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,590
always sort of structured something

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:13,430
around Krampus time for handmade hero

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,049
and I think it's December 5th

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,009
traditionally so it's coming up here so

27
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,009
here we're getting a bunch of streams

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,560
extra streams and we're not necessarily

29
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,269
gonna be doing anything out of the

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,350
ordinary on these streams it should just

31
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:27,688
still be normal programming although we

32
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,969
may do a couple crazy things because we

33
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,589
have more streams maybe we'll do some

34
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:32,879
handmade ray at some point maybe we'll

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,868
do some other stuff I don't know we'll

36
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,920
see but for today we're just gonna do

37
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:39,359
straightforward handmade hero because we

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,219
had a bunch of stuff we wanted to do

39
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,890
that we were in the middle of so we're

40
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,048
gonna jump right into that and let's

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,140
talk a little bit about what that is so

42
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,799
if I load up our sort of current state

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,079
of handmade hero then as you know what

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,780
we did the previous couple of weeks is

45
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,039
we've done a bunch of work on art

46
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,468
pipeline stuff because we have a bunch

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,850
of art we want to put in the game and it

48
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,679
works pretty well now except for the

49
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:07,798
fact that we don't have annotation

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,599
really ability oh that's that's a little

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,900
surprise for later if you are wondering

52
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,919
why the PHP interpreter is is runnable

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,480
on here

54
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,339
there's gonna be a little surprise with

55
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:22,018
that at some point as well but we'll

56
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:26,370
talk about that later so what we want to

57
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:28,259
do here is take a look at the annotation

58
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,209
stuff that we need and figure out ways

59
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,340
that we can make those annotations

60
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,780
editable in-game and specifically what

61
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,170
I'm talking about for example we tried

62
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,699
loading in cap our asset data here at

63
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,438
what you can see is although our

64
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:42,479
pipeline works just fine loading in all

65
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:44,459
of our art assets now we don't have any

66
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,108
ways of doing stuff like saying how big

67
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,509
the cat should be so it's way too large

68
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:50,280
and we don't have any way of properly

69
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:53,370
snapping the cat together we're so like

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,120
the hat head piece goes on top of the

71
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,280
body piece and so on there could be ways

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,319
of doing this externally if you have a

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,430
different tool chain so for example if

74
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:02,908
your artists work with something like

75
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,159
spriter

76
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:08,009
or something like flash then you can

77
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:10,620
potentially use those file formats have

78
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:17,370
data in them that you might use for this

79
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:19,739
purpose but our our our art assets are

80
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,769
just made in Photoshop which means there

81
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,480
is no bone data there's no skeleton data

82
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,810
that we can look to to give us that

83
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,939
information as a result we need to sort

84
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,098
of augment the data that comes in with

85
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,128
that information so we need the ability

86
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:37,828
to make those point definitions and

87
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:40,348
those size definitions ourselves since

88
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,730
Photoshop really doesn't do it and so

89
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,590
what we want to do is just have that

90
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,408
ability we added the ability to specify

91
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,449
those things to our file format what we

92
00:03:46,408 --> 00:03:50,759
haven't done yet is make a way to

93
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:53,370
actually edit them but we have done a

94
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,739
bunch of work along those lines you can

95
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,930
pick things in the game now so I can

96
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,729
select things and we even made it so

97
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,739
that our little debug UI here that we've

98
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:05,129
been using for various things is now

99
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,979
sort of accessible outside as an actual

100
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:09,539
editing tool as well and so we're sort

101
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,250
of poised to allow editing in these

102
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:13,078
things that we have not actually done

103
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,459
the implementation of it so what we need

104
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,358
to do now is we need to go implement

105
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:22,379
some of that UI so that we can actually

106
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:24,778
edit that those elements of our art

107
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,889
assets that that you know just don't

108
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:30,029
exist anywhere

109
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:31,650
there is no existing data we can load so

110
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:34,318
we have to create it ourselves which is

111
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:37,500
fairly common in games it's it's not

112
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,990
unusual at all that a game cannot rely

113
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,189
entirely on our tools or the source art

114
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,348
tools in this particular case in

115
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:45,810
question to produce the complete set of

116
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:49,468
data that they need so augmenting art

117
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,810
with data specific to a game that is not

118
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:54,870
cut like commonly set up in the art tool

119
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,709
from whence the data arrives that's not

120
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,658
really unusual it's actually very common

121
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:02,278
so I'm gonna load up oops no I'm not

122
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:03,930
because I'm gonna spell it wrong I'm

123
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:06,990
gonna load up handmade in-game editor

124
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,000
and just zoom down to the bottom there

125
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,848
and show you kind of what's going on

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,860
here inside asset editor we wrote the

127
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:16,468
code already that would sort of layout

128
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,360
this stuff we say like here's the

129
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:20,699
alignment points for this thing and you

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,229
know here's some editing operations you

131
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:27,449
might do on them and then we also have a

132
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:31,528
UI kind of starting here right here in

133
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:33,538
Wi you can see we sort of got the

134
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:35,550
beginnings of a system that would allow

135
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:36,930
us to edit these things but a lot of

136
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,788
these functions all we did is we just

137
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,158
stub them out so you know this code

138
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:43,139
compiles but when it actually goes to

139
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:45,538
run any of the the things that would do

140
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,639
the work it really doesn't end up doing

141
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,740
anything and so our primary job is going

142
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,800
to be meant to make it so that these

143
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,949
things actually work and allow us to

144
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,778
actually edit the stuff in question and

145
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,028
there's two ways we can really go about

146
00:05:57,778 --> 00:06:02,579
doing it and it's unclear at the moment

147
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:04,709
anyway which way we really want to do so

148
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,348
our job is kind of twofold is to make

149
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:09,508
sure that we pick a good way and then to

150
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:13,079
actually do that way and if we take a

151
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:16,770
look in here and we look at what we had

152
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:19,378
for the debug UI well we can see on here

153
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:22,378
is we've got sort of layout stuff that

154
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,180
already was written to do a lot of the

155
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,180
things that we might want to do so you

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,900
can kind of see here when you call one

157
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,209
of these debug UI functions not the WI

158
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,038
functions with debug UI functions they

159
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,859
were capable of producing information

160
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,870
that actually looks if you you know take

161
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,759
a look at here you can see that it's

162
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:47,850
not particularly specific to the debug

163
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:51,569
system anymore so I think what we want

164
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,870
to do here is kind of merge these things

165
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,540
in and really it's this part right here

166
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,629
that makes this specific to the debug

167
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,020
system and so figuring out how to maybe

168
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,459
make that not be the case anymore so

169
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:07,409
pulling this out of the debug system and

170
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,229
making it so that it can operate in both

171
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,780
realms might just be the most effective

172
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:15,150
way to go because we kind of just need

173
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,819
the same stuff in both so there doesn't

174
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:20,279
seem to be a lot of reason why we would

175
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,569
want to implement that stuff twice so

176
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,469
what I'm going to do here is I'm just

177
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:28,649
gonna look through the debug state and

178
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,810
see what is actually getting used now

179
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:33,089
you know you can see here a lot of this

180
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,949
stuff it's very generic and it would be

181
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:37,949
really easy to pull it out it's not

182
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,389
specific to debugging at all it's things

183
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,930
like the font scale and the font

184
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:46,439
information these sorts of things really

185
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,530
pretty basic and so I think unless I see

186
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:52,230
something surprising further down it's

187
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:54,569
really the like interaction tracking the

188
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,810
render group these are things that would

189
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:59,730
be common to both systems for sure and

190
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,160
just you know just looking at them here

191
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:10,920
really does seem like we could totally

192
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:13,340
pull this out of the debug system so I

193
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,410
mean I think that's sort of a no-brainer

194
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:17,879
in terms of at least these functions so

195
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,830
I think that's kind of what I'm gonna do

196
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,730
I'm gonna follow the same pattern that

197
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:27,389
we used on the previous stream where BCA

198
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,939
said look let's take the debug state out

199
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:32,159
of this equation let's find out what

200
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:35,039
breaks will repair it in the debug

201
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,649
system and then we'll move it over to

202
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,500
the other UI system so what I'm going to

203
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,990
do is exactly that I'm sort of gonna say

204
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,539
look let's get rid of this line here

205
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,759
let's see what has to happen we're gonna

206
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,709
assume we'll get this because this is

207
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,720
the thing that we knew that we needed to

208
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,730
do stuff like draw text so what I'm

209
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,460
gonna say is let's go ahead and

210
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,950
and just merge this over and then force

211
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,950
the debug system to use it right so I'm

212
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,290
going to ice it out of there put it in

213
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,330
here we're gonna call this a dev UI

214
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:11,669
layout and deal with the fallout from

215
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:13,050
that and we're gonna call this here

216
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:14,549
where we've got sort of the thing that

217
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:17,209
we were back pointing to we're gonna

218
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:19,319
call that the context so we're gonna say

219
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,170
again just step by step

220
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,990
extra cating that piece of code from its

221
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,120
original context in which it was created

222
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,970
we're basically saying look what are its

223
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,909
actual connections to debug system sever

224
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,220
those and now we'll have both systems be

225
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:37,289
able to use it by just passing the

226
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,930
actual data from the debug system that

227
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:41,879
was necessary in in that way both

228
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:44,309
systems can just keep that kind of data

229
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,189
and feed it upwards rather than having

230
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:49,799
this system be sort of inexorably tied

231
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,540
to the debug system because as we saw we

232
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,819
actually did a pretty nice job writing

233
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,959
it originally we didn't it wasn't you

234
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,790
know spaghetti like it wasn't

235
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,680
intertwined in there in a way that

236
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:01,490
really makes it difficult to pull out so

237
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:04,049
it turns out it's actually pretty easy

238
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,750
so our goal here is going to be yet to

239
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,789
extricate that out and then also here

240
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,860
just say let's go ahead and grab all of

241
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:13,259
this code and so essentially what we're

242
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,289
gonna do here I think is nuke this file

243
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:20,100
because mostly there isn't anything in

244
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:24,349
here that actually is specific to the

245
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:29,700
debug code you look and I just don't see

246
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:32,850
very much of that in here that there

247
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,430
really isn't yeah like I'm just not

248
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,740
seeing much in the way of debug specific

249
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:39,269
code here so I think we may be able to

250
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,519
just kind of say look all this stuff

251
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,649
comes over and then these fight these

252
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,460
files may just go away we may not have

253
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:49,139
them anymore in the first place right so

254
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,580
we're gonna drop those in here and then

255
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,720
we're gonna deal with the fallout so

256
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,560
let's take a look at where all the

257
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,090
errors start out again a big thing is

258
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,339
just going to be renaming here obviously

259
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,230
we've sort of got some things that we

260
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,330
changed the name of so in this case here

261
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,370
we've got sort of some stuff that's

262
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,650
gonna that's going to change but that's

263
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,629
you know pretty basic so I can go in

264
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,789
and just do a bulk rename on that and

265
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,588
that won't really be a big deal so

266
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:15,889
anywhere that we saw layout before I

267
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:18,270
could change that to a dev UI layout now

268
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:20,759
and that should be you know pretty

269
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:24,509
simple here right so let's just take a

270
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:27,509
look so a layout element should probably

271
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:29,580
be a WI layout element as well that's

272
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:32,519
probably true so you know just to be

273
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,089
clear because layout element let's be

274
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,370
honest

275
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,230
doesn't really scope it down

276
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,278
particularly much doops that one this

277
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,700
we're now into the code that actually

278
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:44,939
already had that so you know we probably

279
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,379
should do the the modicum of work there

280
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,740
that's necessary to just sort of make

281
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:51,210
sure that's named in a way that makes it

282
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,500
unambiguous about who we're talking

283
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,220
about layout pretty generic term so you

284
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,190
know how it is

285
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,790
so in here where we've got debug IDs are

286
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:05,820
equal that really should be WI because

287
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:08,099
these these are dev IDs now I believe so

288
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,320
I didn't know we forgot to rename that

289
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,350
but it looks like we did so if we take a

290
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,220
look here at where that's happening in

291
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,860
in sort of the debug ID space here we

292
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,480
probably just want that to be placed

293
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:28,649
somewhere more specific so let me see

294
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:35,009
dev ID I don't know where we've actually

295
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:36,389
got that defined here we can say there

296
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,009
if that's something that people want to

297
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:41,189
be able to do we'll just say you can do

298
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:42,838
it okay so that should take care of that

299
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,650
now let's go back to what I was doing

300
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,600
before so again in here we kind of have

301
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,240
this notion of an interaction that's

302
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,950
currently the one that's being used and

303
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,589
that's something that I think we want to

304
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,810
pull out into that context right so what

305
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:03,630
we want to do is we want to say that

306
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:06,208
inside I mean you know it's permanent

307
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:08,970
state really so I think we probably want

308
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:11,789
to say that this is the permanent State

309
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,459
that's sort of being kept you know for

310
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:16,969
the most part so I don't know we could

311
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:20,639
you know if we wanted to be really

312
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,710
discreet about it you know we could do

313
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,769
this and have another one in there I

314
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,110
just don't know if we care so it's okay

315
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,819
to be a little piggy here I think I'm

316
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,759
not really assuming that there's gonna

317
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,980
be a whole lot of wastage there really

318
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,319
so I think we could probably say hot

319
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:41,370
interaction here and then you could just

320
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,160
say look if you know what the context is

321
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,799
that you're using just pass me that and

322
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,679
we'll check it off there and off we go

323
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,899
right I think that should basically do

324
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,620
it and then all of these things here for

325
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,329
text our app and get text size and so on

326
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:02,399
I'm not sure what we want to pass in

327
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:04,080
there but chances are when we look at

328
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,970
what's going on here you can see that

329
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,520
these are sort of cracking routines that

330
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,160
really were just getting the WI context

331
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,600
anyway whether we want to keep those or

332
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:14,459
not I don't know but I suspect we

333
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,440
probably don't I think it's probably

334
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,120
fine to just add an arrow for the people

335
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,770
who are calling these so I think we

336
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,860
could probably say is look let's just

337
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:25,289
make this be something that passes the

338
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,539
context in the first place and then that

339
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:28,949
way first of all this is not necessary

340
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:31,049
so I don't know why that's even there

341
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,810
but then what we can do is you say look

342
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:35,279
like pass that in and off we go

343
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,529
and if we really want to make a helper

344
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,519
function later for that fine but at the

345
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,199
moment I don't really think it's

346
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,179
necessary so don't think people are

347
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,050
calling this so often that we need to do

348
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,579
that that they couldn't just use this

349
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:52,049
format for their call you know I'm

350
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:55,139
saying all right so that's you know just

351
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:57,719
the easiest way to deal with keeping

352
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,899
these functions usable in in both

353
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,279
contexts pun intended I suppose and I

354
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,230
think that just continues to cascade

355
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,549
down through a lot of these so a lot of

356
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,340
these things where you were taking a

357
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:10,139
debug state nowadays you're just taking

358
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,170
a context because the context has this

359
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:16,529
stuff explicitly right it's got the

360
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:18,870
scale in it it's got the font info in it

361
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,549
and so any of these things that had to

362
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,409
happen here will just work

363
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:24,329
I'm gonna move this over to the front

364
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:26,339
just to keep a consistent ordering for

365
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,259
it you can see here these are basically

366
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,480
similar routines that just use the font

367
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:32,429
scale to modify whatever the font

368
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,720
parameters are so that having them in

369
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:38,909
two different formats just made

370
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:41,449
using and I'll update our type Naumann

371
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:43,409
clay char here - while I'm at it

372
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:45,688
someday we'll just go through and like

373
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,328
change everything the f32 because that's

374
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:51,389
my new mine that's my jam

375
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:56,399
I'm done with our ours done F is the new

376
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:58,730
are soo anyway this looks pretty much

377
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,339
intact right that's just going to remain

378
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:05,550
the same as it was all of these I think

379
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,290
same thing so we really get down back to

380
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,990
here again where we're doing this begin

381
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:11,818
layout action and again that's gonna

382
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,459
probably take a context now and just

383
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:17,610
replace that debug state with the

384
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:19,109
context there so something like that and

385
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,089
when we look at what's going on in here

386
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,730
this all should be still the same right

387
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:27,060
so all that stuff I think ends up being

388
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:31,949
pretty clean that we have in here and

389
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:33,268
layout and I assume we also had a begin

390
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:35,188
layout in here somewhere I don't know

391
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,509
where that was originally dude did we

392
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:41,068
have one I don't even know where that

393
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:42,930
was maybe we didn't I don't know so we

394
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:45,120
maybe not didn't have that one so maybe

395
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:47,938
this is all just fine and layout isn't

396
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,409
gonna do anything so that's fine too so

397
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:57,688
all of this stuff seems pretty

398
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:58,980
reasonable so far yeah so we're gonna

399
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:00,120
have to change couple of these things

400
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,490
how they work eternally we'll look the

401
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,990
errors guide us there I'm just looking

402
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,949
at this stuff and it all looks again

403
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,980
pretty pretty clean the tool tip buffer

404
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:19,308
stuff that's probably going to be

405
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:22,349
something that gets moved up a bit so

406
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:25,769
you know tool tip buffer is just a

407
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:27,750
string we already have that type so we

408
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:32,250
should probably while we're at it change

409
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:38,909
that around because that's not really

410
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:40,650
necessary either I mean you can see

411
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:45,559
right here that it really is just one of

412
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,559
these so that's a good

413
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:57,460
so that's really I mean right look

414
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,509
familiar

415
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,579
so we really don't need to have it work

416
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:06,190
this way we could probably just reuse

417
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:09,879
this type and have everyone who does

418
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:13,930
counted memory blocks just use that as

419
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,330
we sort of go so that I'm not gonna

420
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:22,779
change yet but I'm going to probably

421
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:23,678
change it before long and again we'll

422
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:25,240
get to there we're gonna get to there

423
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,630
all right so let's jump back to the

424
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:32,440
error hunt now I'm gonna go take a look

425
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:38,860
at this B 32 here what's the problem I

426
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:45,070
cannot cover argument 1 so interactions

427
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:47,349
are equal is what exactly it's okay all

428
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:49,960
right so so that dev UI interaction

429
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:53,079
looks like it's getting actually copied

430
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:58,420
in there so I guess what we're saying is

431
00:18:53,079 --> 00:19:02,859
this is actually not a pointer so let me

432
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:05,620
dump just remind myself if that's the

433
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:08,229
case is that actually what restoring it

434
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:11,379
is so what we probably want to do is say

435
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:14,980
look this stuff here is what we need for

436
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:17,440
a lot of the stuff so we're probably

437
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,009
going to want to import that over to

438
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,779
here right because we're gonna be moving

439
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:27,400
this the things in here that are

440
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:29,049
specific to the use you know to the

441
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,540
stuff in here that's specific to user

442
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:34,178
interface is gonna want to migrate out

443
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,950
so a lot of these things that were

444
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,690
previously welded into the debug system

445
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,730
will move out to the UI and the debug

446
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,450
system will just retain its actual

447
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:48,160
information about debug stuff and so all

448
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:53,920
of this will probably come through like

449
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:56,230
you know something like this and we will

450
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,630
move the input processing that was

451
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,910
happening here

452
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:03,160
into here slowly but surely

453
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,360
so okay that answers our question about

454
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,670
whether that should or shouldn't be a

455
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:09,729
pointer it shouldn't be so that's

456
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,980
confirmed so we should be able to kind

457
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,750
of move on from there these we renamed

458
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,000
because they're not debug fonts anymore

459
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,059
they're just fonts that are used in the

460
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,039
UI and that's fine

461
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:24,669
again here just cleaning up things that

462
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:29,409
were accessing the debug state no longer

463
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:31,509
need to do so pretty basic so here we've

464
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:35,440
got the WI context being pulled out

465
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:39,789
right instead of the debug state and so

466
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:42,160
the layout like so can just be accessed

467
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:44,170
same with a debug state was and then we

468
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,970
can access any of the other things it

469
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,610
does mean that we've got sort of in the

470
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,460
WI now we want to pull those again those

471
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:53,589
things that are basically all of these

472
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,170
things here that we were using before

473
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:59,199
all of that probably lives over here now

474
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,720
right and can be made with this system

475
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,450
rather than the debug system and

476
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,240
probably a lot more of these will - you

477
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:11,009
know I mean as we come through you know

478
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:14,529
this is obviously all debug specific

479
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:17,559
this is debug specific debug specific

480
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:19,990
probably maybe not hard to say not debug

481
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,940
specific write debug specific and so on

482
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,710
so really what we'd be doing is you know

483
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,720
pulling out a few these probably the

484
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,500
tooltips maybe I don't know it's hard to

485
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:32,819
say but basically pulling this stuff out

486
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:36,430
that should be you I and not debug just

487
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:39,189
moving that out one by one I think is

488
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,410
all we really need to do here and it'll

489
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,559
be a little bit of a slow going because

490
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:48,720
there's so much of it to extricate but

491
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,720
that's it's easy work right it's it's

492
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:55,329
it's just shove one code at that point

493
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,400
so we're going to just pull these out

494
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:58,839
here the render group is arguably

495
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,380
something that maybe should just get

496
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:04,359
pulled out you know at the outset

497
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,280
because anyone who's drawing is going to

498
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,178
do that we don't really need to keep

499
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:11,808
talking about it over and over

500
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:13,730
again here so let's just grab that in a

501
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:16,940
more direct fashion here's all those

502
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,200
push Rex now I'm just looking through to

503
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,600
see if there's anybody else who's using

504
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,519
it doesn't look like there is so in here

505
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:27,109
what I'd like to do is pull that out

506
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:28,460
right same way and just make sure nobody

507
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:30,949
else here is doing anything there I

508
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,629
don't think they are again debug state

509
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,210
in this case is is really just the

510
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:37,939
context in all these cases I'm trying to

511
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,798
look to see if we've got any other debug

512
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,850
state stuff going on here is a different

513
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:44,359
function looks like that's the first

514
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:46,878
time it's used ok so again since we're

515
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,418
gonna need the dev UI context here we'll

516
00:22:46,878 --> 00:22:52,459
pull it out from the layout and then

517
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:54,528
we'll just use the context everywhere we

518
00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:00,350
were using the debug state before should

519
00:22:54,528 --> 00:23:02,329
be fine the render group doesn't really

520
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:06,288
get used much here so I'm ok with that

521
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:09,740
still being sort of pulled from from the

522
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:13,669
pointer in this case see starting

523
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,419
baseline why um so you know look looking

524
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:19,759
at that I feel like and maybe I'm wrong

525
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:22,700
but the starting baseline y-you can see

526
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:26,028
here we've got to get baseline situation

527
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,909
here and this is font scale times the

528
00:23:26,028 --> 00:23:31,128
baseline that just looks like it's just

529
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,879
this call being reimplemented for no

530
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:34,849
good reason

531
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:37,908
um so we probably either forgot we had

532
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:39,709
it or we implemented this before we had

533
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:42,320
it and so really that should just be

534
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,940
that call and so I'm gonna go ahead and

535
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,888
and put that back on there oops did I

536
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,889
accidentally delete a parameter there

537
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,748
yes I did

538
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:10,730
okay I see what happened so what we need

539
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:13,349
is just that get baseline context um and

540
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,808
then I think we're good there we go

541
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:22,048
so now you can see it lining up properly

542
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:23,668
okay so the rest of this is pretty clean

543
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:25,528
it looks like let me just

544
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,210
REM highlight I'm not sure why that was

545
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:28,769
the old style of implementation either I

546
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,899
guess it's been a while spin this code

547
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:33,089
maybe for coder didn't have it at that

548
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:35,729
point we made it I'm not sure but

549
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:38,189
looking through here yeah I don't see

550
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,899
much else again this this is the get

551
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,669
baseline call again so it looks like we

552
00:24:39,898 --> 00:24:45,689
definitely thought we had to keep doing

553
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:47,419
that at least back at that point but we

554
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,080
really don't

555
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:51,080
so there we go

556
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,559
and again this stuff here looks like

557
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:58,138
mostly things that you know should get

558
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:00,778
converted pretty pretty directly so I'll

559
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:05,988
go ahead and do that the render groups

560
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:10,798
get pulled out there tooltip' transform

561
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:13,730
also something that we have now yeah I

562
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:17,398
can really pretty basic stuff here just

563
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:22,440
just basic boarding nothing particularly

564
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:24,268
interesting and that'll looks pretty

565
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,249
good all right let's keep going here

566
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:39,149
we'll just use the arrows to kind of

567
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:41,159
skim so the render group in this case it

568
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:43,408
looks like we store a pointer to that

569
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:47,278
rather than the actual render group in

570
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:52,590
question so we don't really need to do

571
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:54,690
the aunt address there I guess we will

572
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:56,249
keep it that way we could make it so

573
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:01,230
that it was actually stored directly in

574
00:25:56,249 --> 00:26:02,899
there but out know that we want to we'll

575
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,569
think about that a little bit later on

576
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:09,209
so yeah keeping going here you can see

577
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:10,109
we've got this debug line buffer thing I

578
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,778
don't

579
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:14,069
much about what we did with tooltips so

580
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:18,119
I'm just gonna try and take a look and

581
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:21,119
see what we were doing it looks like

582
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,768
here we just create sort of some kind of

583
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:33,589
a temporary holding cell for these

584
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:37,528
things basically and I'm not really sure

585
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:47,939
why we did it this way or who even cares

586
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:51,329
about it I mean especially if are these

587
00:26:47,940 --> 00:27:01,139
things capped I don't know what the deal

588
00:26:51,329 --> 00:27:05,278
is with this so I don't know much about

589
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:08,849
this but what I'll say for now is we'll

590
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:11,339
just keep it as it is we'll say that

591
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:16,138
this thing is just a deaf you eye line

592
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:18,839
buffer for now and we'll maybe revisit

593
00:27:16,138 --> 00:27:22,308
what this wants to be a little bit later

594
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,308
on so we'll just say like you know

595
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:39,869
because I'm pretty sure all this thing

596
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:43,319
is for is for tooltips like that's all

597
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:46,469
it does and so it probably I can't think

598
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:49,019
of a time when tooltips tooltips are

599
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,329
just per frame so really you you don't

600
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:55,920
need it to be fixed size like this you

601
00:27:51,329 --> 00:28:00,119
know it could just be created on the per

602
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,800
frame memory stack so you know again

603
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,739
this might just have in a case of like

604
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:07,440
early on in the dev stream we don't have

605
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:14,279
a lot of tools so we do sort of the poor

606
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:19,289
person's version of it right so I don't

607
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:21,269
know we'll see how we want to you know

608
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:30,809
how we want to deal with that a little

609
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:33,089
bit later on okay moving on let's see

610
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:39,450
here so here's the way we draw one of

611
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:46,109
those things and they pretty much pour

612
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:47,039
it directly over I think default

613
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:53,309
cliprect

614
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:55,940
in this case probably again wants to be

615
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:58,799
something that's in the UI system itself

616
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,900
I can't see or think of a reason why it

617
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:08,579
wouldn't be basically all this stuff is

618
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:10,350
over here now right doctor we can kind

619
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:12,329
of get rid of it so I do wonder if we

620
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:14,669
maybe want this to kind of be like this

621
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:18,089
you know what I mean

622
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:20,670
and so you just snap the pass in there

623
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:23,849
as opposed to doing a pointer to it it's

624
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,590
kind of hard to say but it seems like

625
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:27,929
that's probably a good idea I don't know

626
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:30,750
it might not be and this stuff can go

627
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,100
away here and just be replace by this so

628
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:39,779
effectively what we would have is

629
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:43,859
something like this right and you know

630
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:46,710
this this context it's not really a

631
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:47,819
context per se it's more just like the

632
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,500
UI

633
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:56,579
another thing we could say is that it's

634
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:59,309
just that and so it's more like this you

635
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:01,109
know what I mean because this is the

636
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,079
central UI structure it holds the

637
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:08,549
permanent state and so you more or less

638
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:10,079
just can do that the UI layout might be

639
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,789
a better place for this render group

640
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,960
because this is sort of permanently

641
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:19,019
stored stuff and this is what you

642
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,880
actually do per pass and so this there's

643
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:24,299
a strong argument one could make for

644
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,770
moving this from here to here just to be

645
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,769
a little clearer about what's going on

646
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,240
so I think we should probably consider

647
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,160
that when we're done with this pass

648
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:44,910
through the code so moving on I'm just

649
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:46,590
going to change these here I'm gonna

650
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:56,970
change everywhere that we saw a dead

651
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:57,619
view I context could just be WI all

652
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,230
right

653
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:03,089
and this will change back to that so

654
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,630
where we saw contexts I'm just going to

655
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:05,629
rename that

656
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:33,850
and I think that's it okay let's see

657
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:35,900
here so not really much to say here

658
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:38,179
again I would like to think about moving

659
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:41,060
the render group around so we may want

660
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,580
to change that a little bit in a second

661
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:48,679
here but that's again a separate issue

662
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:52,669
sort of let's see dev UI context again

663
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:55,400
that's gonna sort of change to just be

664
00:31:52,670 --> 00:32:00,769
WY just in case there was any one or

665
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:07,640
those there let's see here what else we

666
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:09,559
got going on okay so we know that's

667
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:19,759
gonna be coming from there now instead

668
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:23,389
mouse text layout so I guess that's the

669
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,670
tooltip one and so I guess we create

670
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,890
sort of two of these things

671
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:33,620
two of these layouts that of course

672
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:36,140
would be a reason not to have it welded

673
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:39,889
in there although it would be an

674
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:46,670
argument in other words it does seem

675
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:50,480
like maybe this is the correct structure

676
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:52,519
right so when you're going through all

677
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,539
of these things and you're gonna render

678
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:59,809
something and you need to do a render

679
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:02,299
group right you probably need to pass it

680
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:08,240
this way and I'm just trying to think if

681
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:09,500
that makes good sense you know we kind

682
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,420
of got away with not doing it here

683
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,430
because what people kept doing is they

684
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,630
just passed the UI and they expect the

685
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,630
render rib to be in that

686
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:26,639
and you know I feel like it maybe maybe

687
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,220
that wasn't the best idea

688
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,288
I feel like though I don't know it's

689
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,409
just a really tough it's just a really

690
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:35,970
tough call I'm gonna leave it the way it

691
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:37,770
was because I just don't see a lot of

692
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,230
benefits to doing it it just I feel like

693
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:42,839
it probably is a little bit wrong and

694
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,759
that's okay anyway so if we are going to

695
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,849
look at what the mouse layout was here I

696
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,379
think that may be a little bit janky so

697
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:51,779
what I think I might do instead is say

698
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,330
look you just passed me the one you want

699
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,980
so you know you tell me where you want

700
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:58,470
this thing laid out and I'll lay it out

701
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,480
that way rather than grabbing it out of

702
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,909
here which doesn't feel quite right to

703
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,548
me because why would I have to know

704
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:09,079
magically where that layout existed

705
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:12,599
right so that feels a little bit better

706
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,750
coming through here so this right here

707
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:22,830
the dev's Mouse text layout that's gonna

708
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:24,090
be a dev you I layout now right and now

709
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:27,049
we should move on to stuff that was

710
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,050
calling this stuff

711
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:39,139
um this is just the WI which I now have

712
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:41,210
put up here and I'll try to gather those

713
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,339
things together a little bit better so

714
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:49,099
you know here's all the stuff we were

715
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:51,890
using so you know we've got this layout

716
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:53,900
the tooltips in the WI right and that

717
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:59,869
I'll kind of goes together in terms of

718
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:02,329
stuff here that's you know UI related I

719
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:08,409
could also sort of gravitate that more

720
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:08,409
towards the bottom by sort of doing this

721
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,289
and this stuff maybe is what migrates

722
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,260
over eventually so you know you this

723
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:20,179
stuff will move because just looking at

724
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:31,610
it here right like all of these things

725
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:33,619
are debugger based so this stuff this

726
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:38,570
stuff is all rightfully part of the

727
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:43,429
debugger and it should remain inside the

728
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:47,420
debug system and then I think this stuff

729
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:49,299
here is the UI so these will remain

730
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:54,829
because it's how the debug system

731
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:56,510
accesses those UI services or at least

732
00:35:54,829 --> 00:36:00,469
something like this or mean it may get

733
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:02,480
past this as well because we might want

734
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:05,239
to unify our editing and debug you I at

735
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,679
that point that seems totally reasonable

736
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:12,589
too but basically we want to look at

737
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:15,379
moving this stuff out as we go

738
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:19,550
now I don't really know what selected ID

739
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,200
count selected ID was for because I

740
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:26,090
don't remember us doing a lot of stuff

741
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:29,029
with selection per se so I couldn't

742
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:31,400
actually say like I don't know that we

743
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:37,100
did we do stuff with selecting things I

744
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:40,849
don't think we did yeah I'm not seeing

745
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:43,610
much there so I don't I don't really

746
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:45,019
know that that's getting used for

747
00:36:43,610 --> 00:37:11,990
anything anymore

748
00:36:45,019 --> 00:37:18,380
let's just see so we had something like

749
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:22,699
that I just don't know how we ever

750
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:25,960
produced one of those we've still got

751
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,960
the logic in there for it

752
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:38,110
I'm just not sure what we ever do with

753
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:38,109
it

754
00:37:47,510 --> 00:38:05,160
so it kind of looks like we just you

755
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:16,140
know I'll be honest it looks like we

756
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:19,699
just we're supposed to be able to hold

757
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:26,069
down the shift key and multi-select

758
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:28,919
is that true I mean it doesn't seem to

759
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:34,710
do anything we'll have to go see what

760
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:37,200
that does but that probably would go in

761
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:40,250
the debug in the UI as well like

762
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,929
multi-select mine as well I mean

763
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,460
probably I don't know since we

764
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:46,799
implemented it we might as well keep it

765
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,289
so we'll play with that one a little bit

766
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,339
later on when I actually have some idea

767
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:58,139
of what's going on there right okay so

768
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:59,940
in here when we're doing oh I see what

769
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:04,289
that was for that was for multi

770
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,440
selecting things in the world okay I get

771
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:06,358
it

772
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:11,639
yeah you can see here this was if this

773
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:13,799
was if you wanted to use that in like in

774
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:16,379
in the game like as something where you

775
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,440
want to be able to select stuff that way

776
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,789
which again I don't think I'm gonna use

777
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,650
because I don't really want that to be

778
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:25,949
tied into the debug system I want the

779
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:27,780
world asset editing stuff to be stuff

780
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:30,118
that you can do whether video bug

781
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:34,769
compiled it or not so we probably won't

782
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,329
use that but you even so okay so once we

783
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:39,599
have the debug state you know you can

784
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:44,710
you should be able to do this pretty

785
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:49,830
directly I think and go from there

786
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,829
what did we actually call this just WI

787
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:59,320
yeah so I think that's all we need to do

788
00:39:54,849 --> 00:40:01,780
for now on that debug ID interaction is

789
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,519
actually dev UI the interaction really

790
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,500
but we don't really need to rename it at

791
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,949
the moment well we can deal with those

792
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,469
sort of renaming a little bit later

793
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:12,879
again this is just basic stuff that's

794
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:17,250
reaching into the state and playing with

795
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,250
a little bit and that's actually fine

796
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,269
alright so render group in this case is

797
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:30,279
probably something I just want to pull

798
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:33,849
out here so I'm just gonna say like

799
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,849
render group render group and that comes

800
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:39,700
from the debug States the the dev UI

801
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:43,599
right and so we can just get that

802
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:51,250
anytime we want and now where we were

803
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:55,599
doing the render group that can just be

804
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:57,400
passed directly here we'd have to worry

805
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:08,140
about because we didn't do the arena

806
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:13,780
occupancy stuff so that looks fine let's

807
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:16,719
see here so UI transform that's just

808
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,250
gonna be from the dev UI as well so

809
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:24,118
maybe what I could do here is just say

810
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:24,119
look the WI is going to get pulled out

811
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:29,608
I'm gonna try to anyway

812
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:46,570
and then inside here we can just grab

813
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:48,440
these from it the tooltips I don't know

814
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,150
because those are gonna have to get

815
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,570
moved out as well so we'll have to

816
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:57,039
actually do that at some point first and

817
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:59,809
there because these are not actually

818
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,519
available right now right cuz they're

819
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:07,009
actually still in here somewhere

820
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:09,710
I think yeah so I think we probably want

821
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,810
tool tips to be sort of universal right

822
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:14,449
cuz like they're gonna be handled by the

823
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:18,049
you I always so again I think that just

824
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:20,230
kind of gets moved up you know what I

825
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,230
mean

826
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:28,730
so probably the tooltips end up

827
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,380
something like in here because they're

828
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:33,460
going to be things that you always can

829
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,460
access inside the UI

830
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:42,720
so let's see uh when we're doing the

831
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,049
pressing cure for profile bars looks

832
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:49,319
like people tend to set the next hop

833
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:51,539
interaction pretty directly all the time

834
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:55,860
I only know to what extent we want them

835
00:42:51,539 --> 00:43:05,579
doing that seems better if they were to

836
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:06,990
make a call for that I'll leave it this

837
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:08,969
way for now because I don't really need

838
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:10,679
to upgrade this system at this point but

839
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:13,829
it's a little janky the way that that's

840
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:18,269
being done so just I figure I just point

841
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:19,579
that out for the time being the render

842
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:21,900
group here I'm going to go ahead and

843
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:24,090
again pull that out at the top because

844
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,099
it's usually something that people want

845
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:32,430
to be able to use so there's render

846
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:40,190
group and you know we we probably want

847
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:43,619
the WI as well it's something like this

848
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:53,340
and then everyone can get that as

849
00:43:43,619 --> 00:44:02,309
necessary all right so these are off of

850
00:43:53,340 --> 00:44:04,380
the UI now I really wish I don't want to

851
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:10,320
have it go to the errors for this see

852
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:16,980
also thing what are you gonna do so yeah

853
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:22,530
in here we're gonna get the tooltips

854
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:25,159
from the UI that's going to be off the

855
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:25,160
UI as well

856
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:36,119
that's gonna be off the UI - is this a

857
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:44,250
new function though yet is so we need

858
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:47,240
the dev UI to be accessible here and I

859
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,239
think we're good to go

860
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:58,349
oops text that's gonna take the UI get

861
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:02,210
text size it's gonna take the UI I

862
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:07,920
really hate that I hate these little

863
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:09,539
note jumps they're so frustrating they

864
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,269
make it impossible to just quickly go

865
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:18,059
through your code and fix the basic

866
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:19,798
errors um let's see so I need to add

867
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:22,230
something in for coder that skips those

868
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:25,159
there may already be something actually

869
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,119
I don't know if I have to turn it on

870
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:29,969
because it looks like you could skip

871
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,068
them by looking if you saw note : in it

872
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:33,268
you know what I mean and I think it

873
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:34,528
might have something like that already

874
00:45:33,268 --> 00:45:37,018
actually it gets saw something that I

875
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:40,108
just haven't put it in mind but I don't

876
00:45:37,018 --> 00:45:42,899
like them uh all right so let's take a

877
00:45:40,108 --> 00:45:45,900
look at tooltips here so that's again

878
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,298
just coming off of this nothing special

879
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:55,670
happening there again just looking at

880
00:45:48,298 --> 00:45:55,670
the UI the render group pull out here

881
00:45:56,449 --> 00:46:01,129
and the UI as well

882
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:13,250
all right uh like we're making some

883
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,250
progress here

884
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:27,240
check your render group yep you're right

885
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:33,568
um that all looks fine nothing special

886
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:35,279
happening there look look at how many

887
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:37,679
times it makes me look at stuff that's

888
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:44,670
totally irrelevant it's like just go to

889
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:46,279
the next actual thang and fix okay there

890
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,329
we go

891
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,690
actually this should be pulled out

892
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:58,109
directly way we've been doing it so only

893
00:46:51,690 --> 00:47:06,450
those should really be involved here and

894
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:12,838
I think we are mostly good there that's

895
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:15,179
all the regular debug stuff all right so

896
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:18,900
this is not a thing anymore we don't

897
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:21,078
have layout we have dev UI layout so I'm

898
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,190
going to preemptively change it to that

899
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:30,690
since we know that's what it actually is

900
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:33,210
going to be and then this stuff looks

901
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,068
like most of this can flow through okay

902
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,220
I'm gonna pull out the renderer oh well

903
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:43,079
I already did it looks like here

904
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:45,659
previously just looks like people aren't

905
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,339
using it for reasons I couldn't really

906
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:51,469
tell you but yeah you can see them right

907
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:51,469
they're not using it right

908
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:59,308
so looking everyone's capable of using

909
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:06,808
that just fine

910
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:10,990
go that all looks good pretty basic

911
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:14,120
stuff nothing weird happening here

912
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:14,119
[Music]

913
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:27,510
yeah it all seems totally fine yeah

914
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:37,359
all right yeah so I don't see anything

915
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:40,438
weird here

916
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,439
[Music]

917
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,809
I mean that all seems good so I need to

918
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,940
make sure that all these people who were

919
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:52,039
taking a layup for are gonna take a WI

920
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,829
layout now because we renamed that just

921
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:56,210
to be clear about who was doing what and

922
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:58,269
when

923
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:00,789
so this stuff here needs to have that

924
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:03,259
placed in there but other than that

925
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:07,340
there's really not much going on here

926
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:15,110
this is all pretty generic does look

927
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:17,750
like we need the WI here but otherwise

928
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:26,269
is pretty reasonable all right so let's

929
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:32,929
see that's off the UI that is actually

930
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:34,880
this so it looks like cuz this is gonna

931
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:36,529
need the debug state so it looks like

932
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,990
this actually will have to be passed

933
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:44,869
here right so we're gonna do a draw

934
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:47,709
elements gonna need to that's gonna have

935
00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:47,710
to flow through there

936
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:54,099
in addition which is a little bit of a

937
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:57,730
pain in the butt right but that's just

938
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:57,730
that's just the way it goes

939
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:11,059
um not sure oh that's just because that

940
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:14,209
doesn't work on there anymore this Saul

941
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:16,219
looks reasonable what is the problem

942
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:20,599
here

943
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:23,719
Oh so begin element rectangle may be

944
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:26,239
something that takes a regular layout or

945
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:31,909
not does it no it's got it doesn't look

946
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:33,109
like that so ah it's just that that's

947
00:50:31,909 --> 00:50:35,690
fine

948
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:38,360
so yeah anywhere that was doing a layout

949
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:43,340
element would have to take a WI layout

950
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:47,990
element which is fine it's a pretty

951
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:49,460
basic change all right so again really

952
00:50:47,989 --> 00:50:52,189
non glamorous stuff here

953
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:54,860
pretty basic but it'll have to get done

954
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:57,050
to pull this code out if we want to be

955
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:02,809
able to use it sort of in the general

956
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:09,440
case so that's all fine that's all fine

957
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:11,869
too not much to do there god it's so

958
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,389
hard to just fix code when it does this

959
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:16,759
look at how many there are right

960
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:20,690
it just says all of this stuff it's just

961
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:23,750
I gotta find a way to make that not

962
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:27,470
happen it takes so much longer I'll have

963
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,420
to look last gallon about it I may have

964
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:31,399
already fixed that on my not to see I

965
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,829
haven't updated this for coder in a

966
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,570
while I don't remember it being this

967
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:38,690
ownerís on mine so I think I may have

968
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:40,370
already fixed this because it probably

969
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:46,460
would have driven me nuts when the

970
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:47,779
compiler does that so let's see again I

971
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,340
have to jump through 50 million things

972
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:53,240
to find out where the next actual error

973
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:54,550
is which happens to be here that's all

974
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:59,469
fine

975
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:59,470
you see skip the notes myself

976
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:26,639
God go this is another one let's get

977
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:26,640
baselines right that all looks good

978
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:45,849
debug draw elements needs to take the

979
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:51,369
debug state all right um so we're

980
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:56,829
getting down to it here like a lot of

981
00:52:51,369 --> 00:53:03,210
this stuff is non UI related right most

982
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:03,210
of it in fact so that's pretty cool

983
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:22,060
render group is off of the WR what else

984
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:23,469
we get to begin layouts I think only

985
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:25,210
needs that it doesn't need the debug

986
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:33,369
state anymore

987
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:35,650
I don't really know if any of these

988
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:37,239
other things need anything different I

989
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:39,630
don't think they do so I think that's

990
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:45,129
pretty much just all there is to it

991
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:48,640
right let's see here undeclared

992
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:51,010
identifier layouts correct you are you

993
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:53,190
renamed that otherwise I think we're

994
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,190
good

995
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:59,489
that looks fine

996
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:11,510
so this stuff here we we could

997
00:54:08,269 --> 00:54:13,880
potentially share or we could decide not

998
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:19,520
to share it and I'm not sure which of

999
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:20,960
them we want to really do because again

1000
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,360
we sort of we've got a lot of different

1001
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,500
ways that these interactions can work

1002
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:30,559
and I'm not 100% certain how we want to

1003
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:33,130
start sharing those out that's going to

1004
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,210
be the hairiest part of things for sure

1005
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:38,260
because there's just lots of different

1006
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:48,289
ways to try and make those systems happy

1007
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:51,350
you know what I mean so I think at the

1008
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:55,070
outset what I'll probably do is just say

1009
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:57,980
look I'm gonna leave these as sort of

1010
00:54:55,070 --> 00:55:02,000
doing their own separate functions for

1011
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:05,440
the at first and then I'll probably try

1012
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:10,159
to make them come together a bit more

1013
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:12,950
after that that's my guess anyway and

1014
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:15,889
we'll see how it goes because I don't

1015
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:19,009
know that I really want these the actual

1016
00:55:15,889 --> 00:55:21,170
logic here to be miscible like you know

1017
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:23,690
I might want to keep them fairly

1018
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:28,340
separated so the video bug stuff gets

1019
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:30,380
compiled out completely and so it's a

1020
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:32,750
little hard to say how we're gonna want

1021
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:37,430
that data flow to go there's a lot of

1022
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:39,579
ways that it could go but you know we'll

1023
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:39,579
see

1024
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:55,150
um so again yeah not really anything

1025
00:55:51,429 --> 00:56:10,089
interesting to say here just manual text

1026
00:55:55,150 --> 00:56:13,300
modification and of course it's

1027
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:15,789
impossible to actually update code

1028
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,050
because the compiler just really wants

1029
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,400
me to know about hundreds of other

1030
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:21,310
places in the code that are completely

1031
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:29,470
unrelated to the air what are you gonna

1032
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:30,639
do by the way did you know this other

1033
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:32,439
piece of code that has nothing to do

1034
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:38,500
with your error still has nothing to do

1035
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:40,950
with your error well yes I did thank you

1036
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,949
for telling me

1037
00:56:44,219 --> 00:56:54,449
um just didn't quite hit them all here

1038
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:58,539
nothing else to do there all right so

1039
00:56:54,449 --> 00:57:01,049
let's see most of these are probably

1040
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:06,599
going to be these now too

1041
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:06,600
so we will do that

1042
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:25,280
and now it looks like yeah so I think

1043
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:27,430
now we're basically done so now what

1044
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,840
we're gonna want to do here is

1045
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:33,109
previously where this stuff was being

1046
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:36,470
set up we probably want to roll this now

1047
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:41,090
into the UI system proper so that

1048
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:44,659
basically we you know all of this stuff

1049
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:47,390
right is just handled in the UI setup

1050
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:51,349
and you don't have to worry about it

1051
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:54,920
separate from the rest of the of the

1052
00:57:51,349 --> 00:58:03,190
system so like probably what we want to

1053
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:12,680
do here is say okay inside the WI system

1054
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:16,730
you know probably probably in here let

1055
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:20,149
me see kind of jump around let me see

1056
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:24,130
what what did we do for do we ever

1057
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:26,599
initialize those we didn't really

1058
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:28,880
alright so probably what we're gonna

1059
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:35,900
want to do here looking at the endgame

1060
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:38,360
editor right it never really gets an

1061
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,579
init call and I think we probably want

1062
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,680
it to have one so I think what I'll

1063
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:48,319
probably do is say alright you know

1064
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:52,579
there's gonna be in an it here and all

1065
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:59,600
of this stuff can go into it right so

1066
00:58:52,579 --> 00:59:01,869
all of this here except for the push

1067
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,869
font

1068
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:19,230
I think that all just kind of wants to

1069
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:20,429
go in here so I'm gonna grab most of

1070
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:23,519
this stuff out

1071
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:24,690
so yeah like just looking at what's

1072
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,780
going on I'm gonna have to stay like

1073
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:29,610
pretty much almost all this the global

1074
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,220
with global hype part I'm gonna leave

1075
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:33,630
because I don't really know yet where

1076
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:36,179
that's gonna use so we'll take a little

1077
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:40,140
bit of look at that but may it's gonna

1078
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:43,559
pull all of these out into sort of more

1079
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:44,879
of a UI start and end thing because

1080
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:48,719
we're probably going to need these UIs

1081
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,190
to link up to each other like I said

1082
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,439
they're gonna have to you know we don't

1083
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:54,630
want them fighting over who's processing

1084
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,980
user interface or input so we're gonna

1085
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:59,579
need that to be a little bit more

1086
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:03,210
systemic so yeah just looking at this

1087
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,650
stuff here this won't have to happen

1088
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:06,809
because it's already gonna be happening

1089
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:08,280
here and maybe this is just something

1090
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:10,619
that gets pet will get passed down to

1091
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,690
the debug system when debug start is

1092
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:14,699
called will try to look and see where

1093
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:16,740
that's actually happening and be a

1094
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:17,909
little bit more careful about it but

1095
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:21,389
basically what it means is this won't

1096
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:24,199
have to happen they're looking through

1097
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:24,199
here

1098
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:46,429
yeah the pushing the sort barrier on

1099
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:54,380
there does that actually do something

1100
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:56,259
cuz I don't think it does yeah okay say

1101
01:00:54,380 --> 01:01:04,900
we don't use that anymore

1102
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:04,900
so that's over so I think

1103
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:22,409
I mean I think that's mostly it so if we

1104
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:24,450
I think we're pretty good to go there

1105
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:34,078
you know it's gonna want to do its

1106
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:36,149
layout stuff here and so I think I

1107
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,028
should kind of just be able to wrap this

1108
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:43,889
stuff up so let's take a look at where

1109
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:45,659
that's actually getting called you know

1110
01:01:43,889 --> 01:01:48,538
who's doing the actual distance batch

1111
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:51,629
right and so it looks like we're calling

1112
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:55,170
debug game frame end here and then we're

1113
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:57,358
doing the start and end that way right

1114
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,798
and the render commands are coming in

1115
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:03,980
here but the question is like how is a

1116
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:10,639
UI happening exactly so I assume that's

1117
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:10,639
getting called in win32 right probably

1118
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:28,278
yeah

1119
01:02:28,588 --> 01:02:45,398
so since the game memory gets passed to

1120
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:47,798
that it's definitely a little bit tricky

1121
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:52,808
to link it up because what we would like

1122
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:53,739
to do is have the UI be accessible in

1123
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:59,319
both places

1124
01:02:53,739 --> 01:03:02,978
right and I just don't know how we would

1125
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:06,128
do that in order to keep the debug

1126
01:03:02,978 --> 01:03:08,348
system completely isolated it would seem

1127
01:03:06,128 --> 01:03:11,739
to me that we wouldn't really be able to

1128
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:14,579
have it tie directly into the existing

1129
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:14,579
UI

1130
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:28,930
and so that seems difficult like there's

1131
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:30,879
a couple different ways that we could go

1132
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:34,659
about doing that one way is we could

1133
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,730
make it so that the the you eyes don't

1134
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:38,618
connect they're completely separate you

1135
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:40,838
eyes they happen to share all the same

1136
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:43,720
code but they don't ever share any state

1137
01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:45,730
and then you either put yourself in

1138
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:47,709
debug mode or you're either in debug

1139
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:51,820
mode or you're not in debug mode you

1140
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:53,619
know what I mean and when you're in

1141
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,750
debug mode none of the other UI stuff

1142
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:58,780
works so you just have you know it kind

1143
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:01,619
of like takes over the the interface and

1144
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:01,619
that's all there is to it

1145
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,429
and that seems reasonably compelling

1146
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:09,940
because then you just don't have any

1147
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:17,069
conflation of those two things but I

1148
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:25,300
can't really say what I think about it

1149
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:26,650
otherwise like I don't know but I think

1150
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,140
what I'm gonna say is I'm gonna leave

1151
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:31,690
them separate for now and maybe what

1152
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:35,049
we'll do is we'll maybe have it so that

1153
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:37,030
the debug UI stuff takes over when

1154
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:39,369
you're in that mode so that these two

1155
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:40,869
things don't fight with each other now

1156
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:42,338
maybe you never really have to worry

1157
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:44,108
about them fighting because their mouths

1158
01:04:42,338 --> 01:04:45,338
based interfaces anyway and so they'd

1159
01:04:44,108 --> 01:04:49,690
only fight with each other if they were

1160
01:04:45,338 --> 01:04:52,000
overlapping or something I don't know I

1161
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:53,500
mean it's just it's hard to say I'm not

1162
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,300
sure one way or the other how I think

1163
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:01,269
that should go so but what I'm gonna do

1164
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:07,380
for now is just say look we're gonna

1165
01:05:01,269 --> 01:05:07,380
have an init function like an init UI

1166
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:19,599
and it's gonna set up all this stuff

1167
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:22,090
when you actually go to do a render pass

1168
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:25,059
it'll do this stuff

1169
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:29,130
more specifically although I think we

1170
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:29,130
could just make it so that this happens

1171
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:35,589
yeah it could happen to begin layout I'm

1172
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:38,349
not sure so we'll we'll see what we want

1173
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:39,670
to do with that in a second but at the

1174
01:05:38,349 --> 01:05:41,650
moment we don't care about that part of

1175
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:45,130
it so I'm going to port the rest of this

1176
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:50,740
stuff here's you know how this stuff

1177
01:05:45,130 --> 01:06:05,710
would go we we can do this one at any

1178
01:05:50,739 --> 01:06:09,099
time right and this one here for font ID

1179
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:18,639
we kind of need to figure out which font

1180
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:20,858
we want and remember it so that but

1181
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:23,799
that's you know again easy enough these

1182
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:27,460
things I think have to kind of happen

1183
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:29,230
every time in order to make sure the

1184
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:31,300
font remains loaded because if we stop

1185
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,679
using it then you know it will get

1186
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:38,109
purged from the asset system eventually

1187
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:41,230
when it runs out of space so that stuff

1188
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:44,769
all seems pretty basic this has to

1189
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:48,369
happen every time as well this stuff

1190
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:53,650
does not so all of this can kind of just

1191
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:55,690
be set up one time I believe because it

1192
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:59,200
doesn't actually depend on anything it's

1193
01:06:55,690 --> 01:07:06,119
just Z offset nonsense that we're doing

1194
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:07,839
for sorting there and let's see so this

1195
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:11,350
default cliprect

1196
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:13,600
is also all of this stuff this is all

1197
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:15,519
the per frame stuff so this is setup

1198
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,739
that would happen every frame but this

1199
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:22,420
is setup that wouldn't so all of this

1200
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:25,019
stuff as far as the in-game UI is

1201
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:25,019
concerned

1202
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:33,358
why that stuff can kind of come in here

1203
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:47,469
yeah so I think that's good and it'll go

1204
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:49,088
through all of these things and

1205
01:07:47,469 --> 01:07:59,639
initialize them except for this because

1206
01:07:49,088 --> 01:08:09,969
this is these are basically like per and

1207
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:12,779
all this stuff isn't so I think that's

1208
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:12,779
pretty good

1209
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:20,079
and again like if you look at how this

1210
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,539
breaks down it feels sort of like the

1211
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:25,298
Devi I layout itself would be the thing

1212
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:28,199
that would store these other elements

1213
01:08:25,298 --> 01:08:30,519
like the render group part and all that

1214
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:34,358
but the thing about that that's a little

1215
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:38,890
bit weird is that it's you still kind of

1216
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:41,230
have two levels of that because you

1217
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:43,869
could have multiple layouts that you do

1218
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:45,548
inside a single render group that's

1219
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:47,920
using you know the same font and all

1220
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:51,130
that stuff right and the same tooltips

1221
01:08:47,920 --> 01:09:00,548
pass and everything so it's really more

1222
01:08:51,130 --> 01:09:04,060
of the case and you know maybe maybe

1223
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:05,949
it's like this right um but it's still

1224
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:09,700
the case that like these things here are

1225
01:09:05,949 --> 01:09:12,068
really sort of a dev UI pass sort of a

1226
01:09:09,699 --> 01:09:13,750
struct because they're not really a

1227
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:18,489
layout because the layout you might do

1228
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:21,579
multiple times right and so that's

1229
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:23,829
really kind of confusing and I don't

1230
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:27,880
know whether we want to bother having

1231
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:29,920
another one of those like it doesn't

1232
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,930
seem necessary so it's kind of like

1233
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,838
we're breaking we'd be breaking up the

1234
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,909
structure just to be pedantic about it

1235
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:39,729
which I don't want to do

1236
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:42,819
but it is worth noting that it's like

1237
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:46,269
definitely a different thing like this

1238
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:47,859
stuff is different you know so it's

1239
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:50,530
we're storing some stuff in here that

1240
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:56,670
really doesn't probably want to be in

1241
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:56,670
there if we're honest about it right so

1242
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:08,170
we initialize it and then every time we

1243
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:10,570
want to you know begin a frame we have

1244
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:13,659
to call it to initialize this stuff and

1245
01:10:10,569 --> 01:10:18,039
so then that's where this code goes

1246
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:20,289
right so inside here now we're where's

1247
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:22,479
the the font ID looks like we didn't

1248
01:10:20,289 --> 01:10:28,510
save that we want to do that as well

1249
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:31,149
right so we want to be able to like you

1250
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:33,670
know get the font ID get the font info

1251
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:35,439
and the scale set up the transforms and

1252
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:37,390
all that and nice stuff

1253
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,099
we want to be able to do that and get

1254
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:41,289
all of that correct and then we also

1255
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:43,900
want to initialize this stuff probably

1256
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:47,140
so you know I mean we don't really know

1257
01:10:43,899 --> 01:10:55,059
what this stuff is we'll set it to

1258
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:56,680
nonsense for now and we'll zero these

1259
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:59,550
out just because I have no idea what

1260
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,550
else do we do with them

1261
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:11,399
so all of that stuff would then be

1262
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:14,430
initialized properly at that point and

1263
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:16,289
then we would need somehow in here you

1264
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:19,170
know - every time we're gonna go to

1265
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:22,079
begin a frame you know we're gonna have

1266
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:24,659
to call this stuff and presumably we

1267
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:27,600
would also need an end UI frame thing

1268
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:30,659
here as well now the thing that I don't

1269
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,720
know is do we want to just link it up to

1270
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:35,519
an existing one and that I think maybe

1271
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,140
is fairly compelling that's why I was

1272
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,570
saying I think this render group should

1273
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:44,610
really maybe have been a pointer you

1274
01:11:39,569 --> 01:11:46,619
know I don't know but it seems like it

1275
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:48,420
would want to because you just want to

1276
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:49,769
tie it in with existing render groups I

1277
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:51,750
don't know there's any reason to have a

1278
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:53,790
separator group it's really hard to say

1279
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:55,890
I just don't have a strong feeling about

1280
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:59,579
it so again I'm gonna leave it that way

1281
01:11:55,890 --> 01:12:02,640
I don't know that that's really there

1282
01:11:59,579 --> 01:12:03,899
isn't a strong argument for it but there

1283
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,490
isn't a strong argument against it

1284
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:08,369
either it's just kind of like hey it

1285
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:15,809
doesn't seem quite right and so you know

1286
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:24,630
that's that's where we're at so that all

1287
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:26,750
looks fine the width should have been

1288
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:30,150
getting pulled out here from the

1289
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:37,460
commands but it doesn't look like it was

1290
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:40,739
I assume that's because of this right

1291
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:42,300
and so if I come through here I can now

1292
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:51,420
get rid of most of this because this was

1293
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:54,869
just set up for this purpose so I'm just

1294
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:57,050
gonna do that and then get rid of all

1295
01:12:54,869 --> 01:12:57,050
this

1296
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:07,249
so when we go to do update and render

1297
01:13:03,889 --> 01:13:10,458
editor I also again want in here to be

1298
01:13:07,248 --> 01:13:14,828
able to do and initialize editor now I

1299
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:18,349
want to be able to do this because I

1300
01:13:14,828 --> 01:13:24,168
would like to do that like I said and

1301
01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:29,059
then I also want to be able to call one

1302
01:13:24,168 --> 01:13:34,819
of these and as far as assets are

1303
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:39,070
concerned here I don't know I mean I

1304
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:51,340
guess we'll keep passing that down seems

1305
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:56,058
okay so yeah so we'll initialize the UI

1306
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:57,110
that we're using and again we've got a

1307
01:13:56,059 --> 01:13:59,659
couple of different ways we could do

1308
01:13:57,109 --> 01:14:01,819
this we can make the UI actually and

1309
01:13:59,658 --> 01:14:04,538
maybe we should just make the UI be

1310
01:14:01,819 --> 01:14:08,599
something that the game has in general

1311
01:14:04,538 --> 01:14:10,158
in which case actually this becomes a

1312
01:14:08,599 --> 01:14:12,590
little bit different right in other

1313
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:17,148
words we could just say alright in hand

1314
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:21,199
made that H we're actually gonna stick

1315
01:14:17,149 --> 01:14:22,550
the it in here right so there is one of

1316
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,018
these actually I guess it's like that

1317
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:25,610
you know what I mean

1318
01:14:24,019 --> 01:14:27,619
and then it will actually initialize

1319
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:29,808
that and instead of initialized editor

1320
01:14:27,618 --> 01:14:32,328
being something that does this stuff for

1321
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:34,639
you instead what's happen what would

1322
01:14:32,328 --> 01:14:37,099
happen is it just gets a UI to use when

1323
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:42,349
it's trying to do its editing right so

1324
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:43,819
it would be more like saying yeah okay

1325
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:46,458
you know you're gonna initialize

1326
01:14:43,819 --> 01:14:49,069
yourself great good for you

1327
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:53,059
when we call you here we will pass you a

1328
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:56,208
WI to use and that'll come from the from

1329
01:14:53,059 --> 01:14:58,130
the game state and then you'll just use

1330
01:14:56,208 --> 01:15:00,889
that UI rather than making your own

1331
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:02,659
thing so in here where you do a WI

1332
01:15:00,889 --> 01:15:05,179
layout you'll do a begin layout and

1333
01:15:02,658 --> 01:15:08,799
you'll do it on this UI and that'll be

1334
01:15:05,179 --> 01:15:08,800
the end of it right oops

1335
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:14,279
so then all this stuff will just flow

1336
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:20,850
through there pretty straightforward

1337
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:22,979
nothing fancy and it also means that

1338
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:24,930
this commands doesn't have to be passed

1339
01:15:22,979 --> 01:15:28,139
down anymore right because it's not

1340
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:30,630
setting up any drawing which I think

1341
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,820
it's what we want that seems a little

1342
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:35,850
nicer to me that means in here the

1343
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:38,009
initialization actually occurs in game

1344
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:41,280
update and render when we actually have

1345
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:43,560
to initialize some state so in here when

1346
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:46,079
we say like oh we don't have anything

1347
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,970
set up then what we would do here is

1348
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:51,029
call the initialization functions at

1349
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:54,090
that time so we'd initialize the editor

1350
01:15:51,029 --> 01:16:01,109
and we would initialize the layout I'm

1351
01:15:54,090 --> 01:16:05,159
sorry the UI as well so King State WI

1352
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:10,139
and game state editor would both get

1353
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:12,619
initialized here the assets would get

1354
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:15,060
passed down I think in both cases

1355
01:16:12,619 --> 01:16:17,309
they're not really necessary cure but

1356
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:19,410
I'm gonna say that since the editor

1357
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:21,660
edits the assets may be the case that we

1358
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:23,010
roll the assets indirectly right here

1359
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:25,949
and then we don't have to pass them down

1360
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:28,170
anymore that seems a lot more sane

1361
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:33,090
because if you look at how long how many

1362
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:37,050
times we've had to do that it seems like

1363
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:39,329
a lot right so I think a more sane thing

1364
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:42,770
to do here might just be a mutt might

1365
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:45,390
just be to say look that's just you know

1366
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:47,880
there's only one place these things

1367
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:49,829
could come from we don't you know have

1368
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,340
some kind of an idea that were some time

1369
01:16:49,829 --> 01:16:56,390
some that in some point in the future

1370
01:16:53,340 --> 01:17:01,319
we're gonna have like lots of different

1371
01:16:56,390 --> 01:17:02,880
assets like pools running around that we

1372
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:06,509
need to like know which one we were

1373
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,770
talking about or anything like that so I

1374
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:10,640
think this is a little more

1375
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:10,640
straightforward

1376
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:24,840
that just seems a little bit better

1377
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:31,859
oops

1378
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:46,989
this one um I may keep because it's sort

1379
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:49,599
of actually talking about the assets

1380
01:17:46,988 --> 01:17:51,609
more directly and that maybe would go

1381
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:53,260
into the actual asset system so I'm not

1382
01:17:51,609 --> 01:18:09,069
going to touch that one at the moment

1383
01:17:53,260 --> 01:18:14,710
all right what else we got okay so looks

1384
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:16,420
like for the UI frame stuff so we have a

1385
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:17,078
left edge and a right edge and stuff

1386
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:24,670
like this

1387
01:18:17,078 --> 01:18:37,029
so I assume we want to keep tracking

1388
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:41,199
that like the default clip rect however

1389
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:43,599
I think is also probably just tells you

1390
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:47,638
that information so I'm not sure to what

1391
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:47,639
extent that's really all that relevant

1392
01:18:50,578 --> 01:18:59,229
so I may say honestly I'm not sure I

1393
01:18:56,618 --> 01:19:02,109
care about that stuff at the moment

1394
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:07,058
we'll see we'll see what I think about

1395
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:10,808
that going forward all right

1396
01:19:07,059 --> 01:19:14,230
so an in-game editor I'm gonna say like

1397
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:16,000
look it it's the ass that's among other

1398
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:20,519
things so it's going to keep the pointer

1399
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,520
to that and I'm gonna initialize it

1400
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:39,350
these don't need to pass the assets

1401
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:42,590
anymore it just needs to pass the assets

1402
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:42,590
same here

1403
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:55,239
[Music]

1404
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:14,300
okay

1405
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:25,870
so I guess going from here now I need to

1406
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:27,760
start merging these things together in

1407
01:20:25,869 --> 01:20:31,380
terms of their functionality as well so

1408
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:35,890
yeah like looking at begin UI frame B

1409
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:37,750
this stuff here this needs to get called

1410
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:40,090
now in a sort of more centralized

1411
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:45,250
fashion so in here where we were

1412
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:48,090
previously doing like you know hit test

1413
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:51,069
stuff and update and render editor so

1414
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:52,779
you know I don't really know exactly how

1415
01:20:51,069 --> 01:20:55,779
we want to treat the UI stuff as it

1416
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:57,759
flows through but at the moment you know

1417
01:20:55,779 --> 01:20:59,859
I'm just gonna do it only around the

1418
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:07,570
part that we actually care about so in

1419
01:20:59,859 --> 01:21:09,159
other words this is sort of where that's

1420
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:13,469
gonna happen so I'm going to do begin UI

1421
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:23,079
frame here and then I'll do end UI frame

1422
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:25,900
here and so this will i don't know that

1423
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:27,250
i don't remember if assets needs to get

1424
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:31,029
past that but let's just say that it

1425
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:34,029
does so i'm just gonna let that control

1426
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:35,769
how this works this beginning UI frame

1427
01:21:34,029 --> 01:21:43,779
part won't really do anything in

1428
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:45,250
particular at the moment it'll just say

1429
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:46,989
look i'm gonna say what return anything

1430
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:52,319
particular just it'll just set it up to

1431
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:55,960
go and that looks fine and so this will

1432
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:57,939
get the UI and then other people who

1433
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:00,310
want to use this you I could use it so

1434
01:21:57,939 --> 01:22:02,619
we could call other editing things here

1435
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:05,110
and we could even Brack and bracket more

1436
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:07,090
of this we wanted to and have it so that

1437
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:08,529
you could call different people I mean

1438
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,909
there's a lot of stuff we could do there

1439
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:11,920
I don't think it's particularly good

1440
01:22:09,909 --> 01:22:14,139
idea so I'm gonna leave it as sort of a

1441
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:16,300
separate thing that happens outside and

1442
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:18,220
then like I said I'm not gonna try to do

1443
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:21,640
anything fancy there I'm gonna let the

1444
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:25,329
debug system call it separately and use

1445
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:28,900
its own sort of debug stuff now debug

1446
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:31,510
view ID up CBP is now dead letter so

1447
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:33,819
it's not something that's going to be

1448
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:38,079
use anymore so I can get rid of these

1449
01:22:33,819 --> 01:22:39,908
two files as well and I don't know that

1450
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:41,380
we yeah we do have a retired directory

1451
01:22:39,908 --> 01:22:46,359
so those are just gonna go in there and

1452
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:49,000
not be around anymore so that's starting

1453
01:22:46,359 --> 01:23:06,880
to look good I got to get rid of the

1454
01:22:49,000 --> 01:23:13,779
debug UI include files so that I don't

1455
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:16,690
forgot any others all right

1456
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:18,219
and then the debug system itself has to

1457
01:23:16,689 --> 01:23:21,638
actually call these when it wants to use

1458
01:23:18,219 --> 01:23:26,769
them right so the debug system wants to

1459
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:30,130
be able to just you know wants to be

1460
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:31,570
able to utilize the same system and so

1461
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:33,849
the stuff that it was doing to end the

1462
01:23:31,569 --> 01:23:36,849
frame in here also has to be the stuff

1463
01:23:33,849 --> 01:23:39,639
you know anything that was happening in

1464
01:23:36,849 --> 01:23:43,150
the end frame part of things has to be

1465
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:45,389
done here as well so just looking at

1466
01:23:43,149 --> 01:23:45,388
that

1467
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:55,289
I think we're basically just talking

1468
01:23:52,680 --> 01:24:09,950
about just this stuff here

1469
01:23:55,289 --> 01:24:13,739
so think that is basically it probably I

1470
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:16,470
mean it looks like it anyway so I think

1471
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:18,479
that's what we would be doing the mouse

1472
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:23,159
text layout stuff I don't really know

1473
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:28,109
what that was for because again that's

1474
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:30,949
old debug stuff looks like it's stuff

1475
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:36,469
that was happening at the cursor

1476
01:24:30,949 --> 01:24:39,239
position or something weird like that oh

1477
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:42,119
no we're just using that for picking so

1478
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:45,989
yeah I don't really know what the point

1479
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:47,970
of this stuff is actually I have no idea

1480
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:49,590
what the what the stuff is doing here

1481
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:52,140
and so I'm not really gonna play with it

1482
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:53,789
right now anyway and I don't care I just

1483
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:56,039
want to make sure this stuff works okay

1484
01:24:53,789 --> 01:25:06,569
so we're gonna make sure this gets

1485
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:13,890
called on both ends so it'll you know be

1486
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:17,039
able to finish this up properly and draw

1487
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:19,619
the tooltips and whatever right but then

1488
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:23,189
we also need to call this so when we

1489
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:27,239
were going to do all this stuff before

1490
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:28,649
look inside debug start or whatever we

1491
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:32,869
want to be able to do this here as well

1492
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:32,869
right so you know

1493
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:49,609
so we'll begin the UI frame can end UI

1494
01:25:47,029 --> 01:25:51,380
frame here so this can be used and then

1495
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:53,269
in here we would just need to do when we

1496
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:56,050
do our debug in it we would also need to

1497
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:59,480
be able to do the same initialization

1498
01:25:56,050 --> 01:26:05,119
for the UI system right so for the debug

1499
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:08,089
States WI system it's got to do it this

1500
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:10,130
way now where it gets the assets I'm not

1501
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:15,980
entirely sure right it needs to be able

1502
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:21,680
to get those somehow Jimmy and I'm not

1503
01:26:15,979 --> 01:26:24,489
sure how it would be getting them when

1504
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:29,630
it gets initialized you know what I mean

1505
01:26:24,489 --> 01:26:31,760
and so like I think maybe what it was

1506
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:37,659
doing was every time it would run it

1507
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:37,659
would wreak wery for a new font maybe

1508
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:47,600
and I'm not really sure we could do that

1509
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,340
so if we wanted to we could move that

1510
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,440
query so that it happened every time

1511
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:52,909
that way when you initialize one of

1512
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:54,309
these you don't need assets to

1513
01:26:52,909 --> 01:26:57,139
initialize it

1514
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:59,330
the advantageous part of that is if you

1515
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:02,630
updated the font it would update

1516
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:07,449
properly by you know if you added a

1517
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:14,119
better font match can't say that's

1518
01:27:07,449 --> 01:27:15,319
particularly compelling and I guess I

1519
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:19,539
don't really know much about how

1520
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:19,539
debugging it actually happens either so

1521
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:41,730
I mean it looks like it just gets the

1522
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:50,119
assets by asking for them right so it

1523
01:27:41,729 --> 01:28:11,908
seems like you could just call that and

1524
01:27:50,119 --> 01:28:15,779
so maybe we try it yeah okay so not much

1525
01:28:11,908 --> 01:28:18,408
left to go over here again a lot of

1526
01:28:15,779 --> 01:28:22,229
changes necessary to make these things

1527
01:28:18,408 --> 01:28:24,179
sort of separate working systems that

1528
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:26,218
can both share all the code but again

1529
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:28,340
only an hour or two of work is really

1530
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:30,750
not that much at the end of the day so

1531
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:34,800
it is a lot of changes but it's also not

1532
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:36,869
a lot of changes so I'm gonna take a

1533
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:44,940
look at the line buffer stuff here just

1534
01:28:36,869 --> 01:28:46,649
see what's going on there it looks like

1535
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:48,719
it needs whichever layout we're gonna do

1536
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:51,119
and so like I saying before we need to

1537
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:53,069
kind of know what layout the tooltips

1538
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:56,340
should have I'm guessing that we

1539
01:28:53,069 --> 01:28:58,139
probably just want to use something

1540
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:01,619
about the mouse location to figure out

1541
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:04,800
where we want those to be and it

1542
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:07,229
probably also depends on sort of where

1543
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,969
you are relative on the screen which we

1544
01:29:07,229 --> 01:29:12,539
at the moment don't really do much about

1545
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:15,210
and possibly we should you know we

1546
01:29:12,539 --> 01:29:17,519
should possibly take a look at where we

1547
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:19,829
are in like readjust maybe draw a line

1548
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,409
buffer does that I don't actually know

1549
01:29:19,829 --> 01:29:25,109
if it does so that's kind of a separate

1550
01:29:22,408 --> 01:29:27,509
issue but we could go ahead and look at

1551
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:30,089
what like last mouse pee was that I'm

1552
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:31,770
not sure where we were setting I suppose

1553
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:36,779
that's also something that should be set

1554
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:39,239
here like the mouse

1555
01:29:36,779 --> 01:29:47,779
is going to have to be handled here as

1556
01:29:39,238 --> 01:29:47,779
well right

1557
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:55,609
yeah so we're also going to have to sort

1558
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:57,860
of start trucking that a bit separately

1559
01:29:55,609 --> 01:30:01,849
so for example in here we're gonna need

1560
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:04,309
the mouse position that we're using for

1561
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:06,890
tracking because you can see like

1562
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:10,370
there's a delta mouse value that needs

1563
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:14,090
to come through that needs to be made

1564
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:16,039
more systemic up here and I'm not sure

1565
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:17,869
exactly how we want to do that but it

1566
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:18,739
probably doesn't want to be in here

1567
01:30:17,869 --> 01:30:22,340
anymore right

1568
01:30:18,739 --> 01:30:27,170
so you know when you go through and

1569
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:29,420
start doing a pass on the UI it probably

1570
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:33,680
wants to be something that's tracked in

1571
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:41,480
the UI system more explicitly and more

1572
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:52,190
directly so probably something like you

1573
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:55,639
know like this maybe like this and so

1574
01:30:52,189 --> 01:30:58,849
when you do one of these you pass in the

1575
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:00,619
mouse key or whatever right and probably

1576
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:03,710
we want to make that be a little bit

1577
01:31:00,619 --> 01:31:07,279
more involved so maybe when you go to do

1578
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:11,000
one of these things we actually do a lot

1579
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:16,909
of this checking for you so you know and

1580
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:21,140
also that's more like that and so in

1581
01:31:16,909 --> 01:31:32,539
here we when we go to do the

1582
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:36,200
calculations of everything we can we can

1583
01:31:32,539 --> 01:31:38,300
compute it here right so we'd like set

1584
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:40,789
the new mouse position to be whatever it

1585
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:43,250
was we would do the subtraction and that

1586
01:31:40,789 --> 01:31:46,420
would actually be stored right so all of

1587
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:49,939
that information is preserved so

1588
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:52,960
similarly all this stuff here probably

1589
01:31:49,939 --> 01:31:56,379
would also all of this would all get

1590
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,380
rolled in there

1591
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:07,410
right and so you know we would want to

1592
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:09,930
sort of have all of this stuff get taken

1593
01:32:07,409 --> 01:32:12,689
into account weed reset the mouse stuff

1594
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:16,619
we do you know this the unprojected all

1595
01:32:12,689 --> 01:32:21,439
that stuff I think that's basically what

1596
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:25,409
we launched so here we would do this and

1597
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:29,699
this and before we did any of it we

1598
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:36,630
would do that so that would get us the

1599
01:32:29,699 --> 01:32:38,220
complete the complete set of user

1600
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:42,119
interface parameters there that we would

1601
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:45,240
need the alt UI stuff the whether or not

1602
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:51,989
the mouse was transformed and how far it

1603
01:32:45,239 --> 01:32:54,389
moved in either case I don't really know

1604
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:56,489
if the unprojected to quite do it the

1605
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:58,350
way it's doing it there but we'll keep I

1606
01:32:56,489 --> 01:33:00,840
mean that I mean the weather the Delta

1607
01:32:58,350 --> 01:33:04,710
wants to be in the original Mouse space

1608
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:06,569
or in the unprotected space hard to say

1609
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:12,109
but at the moment we don't really do

1610
01:33:06,569 --> 01:33:12,109
anything fancy enough to care so

1611
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:24,199
so I wonder why

1612
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:28,608
what is begin layout taking such that it

1613
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:33,288
wants to of those things Mouse P and the

1614
01:33:28,609 --> 01:33:45,499
upper left corner okay it's weird but

1615
01:33:33,288 --> 01:33:47,238
fine since the UI has the mouse B I'm

1616
01:33:45,498 --> 01:33:49,279
not sure why we really need to be

1617
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:51,828
passing that down anymore but I guess

1618
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:53,838
we'll look at that a little bit later

1619
01:33:51,828 --> 01:33:55,429
too a lot of the stuff could start to be

1620
01:33:53,838 --> 01:33:57,109
cleaned up I mean all we're doing is

1621
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:59,658
really breaking apart the code here and

1622
01:33:57,109 --> 01:34:02,300
putting it in various places and a

1623
01:33:59,658 --> 01:34:03,888
little later on we may find that there's

1624
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:16,519
a bunch of stuff we can do to improve

1625
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:18,139
how things are working right since we're

1626
01:34:16,519 --> 01:34:19,699
gonna call this couple or use this

1627
01:34:18,139 --> 01:34:25,849
couple times here I think I'm actually

1628
01:34:19,698 --> 01:34:27,378
going to do this and because you can see

1629
01:34:25,849 --> 01:34:28,939
how many times it gets used I'd rather

1630
01:34:27,378 --> 01:34:44,929
just be able to refer to it a little bit

1631
01:34:28,939 --> 01:34:46,249
more conveniently okay um ah sorry I

1632
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:48,828
guess I did that in the opposite order

1633
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:50,868
so since this is actually stored here I

1634
01:34:48,828 --> 01:34:59,179
guess I have to more do it like this

1635
01:34:50,868 --> 01:35:00,738
oops this stores it into the UI

1636
01:34:59,179 --> 01:35:03,889
structure and then this is a way to

1637
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:05,478
reference it more quickly right so I

1638
01:35:03,889 --> 01:35:08,800
kind of have to go backwards with it if

1639
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:08,800
that makes sense there we go

1640
01:35:10,269 --> 01:35:13,269
and

1641
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:25,489
all right so the draw line buffered now

1642
01:35:22,789 --> 01:35:27,890
what we need here is some way of making

1643
01:35:25,489 --> 01:35:30,439
a layout for this so we kind of need to

1644
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:32,660
do one of these here which is the mouse

1645
01:35:30,439 --> 01:35:37,549
layout or whatever it's called there

1646
01:35:32,659 --> 01:35:43,579
right and so the mouse layout thing just

1647
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:44,930
has to do I don't actually know to be

1648
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:51,649
honest with you that and layout does

1649
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:54,760
anything I think it doesn't but we'll

1650
01:35:51,649 --> 01:35:57,649
cross that bridge when we come to it so

1651
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:59,960
begin layout again don't really think

1652
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:02,179
that this needs to happen at the very

1653
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:03,619
least you really don't need to pass at

1654
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:06,920
the mouse PD because we're you know

1655
01:36:03,619 --> 01:36:09,140
that's gonna be known by the UI system

1656
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,699
either way so at the moment that can go

1657
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,020
away for sure and I think we could even

1658
01:36:10,699 --> 01:36:14,689
get rid of it here this doesn't really

1659
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:16,730
need to be saved so really it's just the

1660
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:18,919
upper corner that's the only thing that

1661
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:20,599
we need to do here and again I don't

1662
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:23,090
know where that's gonna be but let's

1663
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:25,190
just say it's going to be here for now

1664
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:28,460
so we'll deal with that in a second and

1665
01:36:25,189 --> 01:36:31,099
layout I don't know anything about so

1666
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:32,569
we're gonna take a look at it here looks

1667
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:35,060
like it just takes the layout in

1668
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:38,840
question like so and it doesn't really

1669
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:41,480
do anything with it so then I think we

1670
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,520
can move on to this I don't know where

1671
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:45,319
we're gonna put this UI so we're gonna

1672
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,470
pass nothing at the moment but we're

1673
01:36:45,319 --> 01:36:53,119
gonna figure that out a second the rest

1674
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:54,710
of these things yeah like you can kind

1675
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:56,989
of see we're gonna want to pass all this

1676
01:36:54,710 --> 01:37:00,460
stuff down so probably what we want to

1677
01:36:56,989 --> 01:37:00,460
do here is maybe something like this

1678
01:37:07,408 --> 01:37:27,268
and then looking through here almost

1679
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:28,198
done with this very large pass and we're

1680
01:37:27,269 --> 01:37:29,789
probably still not out of the woods yet

1681
01:37:28,198 --> 01:37:30,958
we got a lot of stuff we want to now go

1682
01:37:29,788 --> 01:37:40,679
through cleanup but it you know we're

1683
01:37:30,958 --> 01:37:50,688
pretty good right so let's take a look

1684
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:50,689
at begin UI frame so it needs the input

1685
01:37:59,609 --> 01:38:07,618
and I think this doesn't need these

1686
01:38:04,198 --> 01:38:07,618
anymore right

1687
01:38:11,609 --> 01:38:19,719
because assets should not be passed here

1688
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:20,800
all right so that's all good we got more

1689
01:38:19,719 --> 01:38:26,050
to do

1690
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:28,000
begin layout doesn't need to pass mouse

1691
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:29,590
key anymore so everywhere in the debug

1692
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:42,069
system it was doing that doesn't really

1693
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:46,779
have to do it we call debug in it we can

1694
01:38:42,069 --> 01:38:56,009
just pass the memory well although can

1695
01:38:46,779 --> 01:38:56,009
we how does it normally get the assets

1696
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:07,900
preto so it normally gets them by

1697
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,460
looking at the game state that's stored

1698
01:39:07,899 --> 01:39:10,779
off of the game memory and then if it

1699
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:12,368
can get them it can get them all right

1700
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:13,809
so it could easily do it that way now

1701
01:39:12,368 --> 01:39:15,939
again I don't really know where like

1702
01:39:13,809 --> 01:39:19,690
whether I could call that whether I can

1703
01:39:15,939 --> 01:39:24,000
call this this way it's a good question

1704
01:39:19,689 --> 01:39:24,000
what I could do too is I could say look

1705
01:39:25,078 --> 01:39:34,750
game state oops game assets assets gets

1706
01:39:31,328 --> 01:39:37,719
passed here so they can utilize the UI

1707
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:41,828
and then you know maybe that back here

1708
01:39:37,719 --> 01:39:44,609
we kind of do it like this and pass it

1709
01:39:41,828 --> 01:39:44,609
in this way right

1710
01:39:50,170 --> 01:40:03,190
all right so beginning you wanna frame

1711
01:39:53,529 --> 01:40:07,368
doesn't take what oh it needs the input

1712
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:11,629
to be half that hopefully looks like

1713
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:13,939
only debug end gets the input which is a

1714
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:15,289
little unfortunate so we'd like to have

1715
01:40:13,939 --> 01:40:31,939
that at the beginning right

1716
01:40:15,289 --> 01:40:35,810
I would think hmm so I think I'll just

1717
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:37,519
do it I think I'll just add it cuz I

1718
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:39,199
don't know that we care anything

1719
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,330
particular about that doesn't even

1720
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:48,379
really change the the way in which these

1721
01:40:41,329 --> 01:40:50,448
things are called I'm also not sure the

1722
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:52,699
extent to which like why is width and

1723
01:40:50,448 --> 01:40:56,238
height something that's passed in there

1724
01:40:52,698 --> 01:40:57,618
it's not used here so really that should

1725
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:00,169
go away too probably

1726
01:40:57,618 --> 01:41:07,399
so it should look more like that and

1727
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:09,980
these don't need to be here also does

1728
01:41:07,399 --> 01:41:11,719
that in init do we care about those much

1729
01:41:09,979 --> 01:41:15,559
either I mean they're pretty much just

1730
01:41:11,719 --> 01:41:19,340
used here I'm not sure this is a good

1731
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:21,860
way to do this anyway so I think we'd

1732
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:23,300
probably want to get rid of that too

1733
01:41:21,859 --> 01:41:28,429
there's just a lot we could clean up now

1734
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:33,980
which is nice all right so I'm debugging

1735
01:41:28,429 --> 01:41:35,569
here when we're calling this in order to

1736
01:41:33,979 --> 01:41:38,779
get the render group that's gonna want

1737
01:41:35,569 --> 01:41:41,029
to come out of the dev UI other than

1738
01:41:38,779 --> 01:41:50,179
that not sure what else it needs to

1739
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:52,759
really know looks like this I don't

1740
01:41:50,179 --> 01:41:56,239
really know what this was for I don't

1741
01:41:52,760 --> 01:42:00,190
know what the draw trees part was that

1742
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:00,189
actually something we were using

1743
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:13,519
it doesn't use that layout so honestly I

1744
01:42:11,329 --> 01:42:16,220
think this is just nonsense because this

1745
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:17,990
was just all that was was the thing for

1746
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:18,829
doing the tooltips and we don't need

1747
01:42:17,989 --> 01:42:20,569
that anymore

1748
01:42:18,829 --> 01:42:25,600
so I'm pretty sure we're just down to

1749
01:42:20,569 --> 01:42:25,599
this and off we go

1750
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:47,029
so I'll go ahead and grab UI here and

1751
01:42:39,380 --> 01:42:50,779
that seems good all right so now I think

1752
01:42:47,029 --> 01:42:53,090
we're back to just debugging and I think

1753
01:42:50,779 --> 01:42:56,689
we can implement most of the calls that

1754
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:58,670
we wanted now surprisingly I would say

1755
01:42:56,689 --> 01:43:06,529
very surprisingly all of that just

1756
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:11,329
worked which is nuts kind of even the

1757
01:43:06,529 --> 01:43:16,159
tooltips worked all right so you know

1758
01:43:11,329 --> 01:43:22,159
some days you get lucky I don't know how

1759
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:24,559
much time I have does anybody know how

1760
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:30,949
much time I have are we in the QA where

1761
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:36,460
are we in savate what time did we start

1762
01:43:30,949 --> 01:43:41,470
this thing what I start at 3:30

1763
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:41,470
probably so we got like 8 minutes maybe

1764
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:51,530
so let's see what's going on in here I

1765
01:43:47,149 --> 01:43:53,179
don't really know let's just take a

1766
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:55,579
quick look at what's going on in here

1767
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:58,190
with like these ends section begins

1768
01:43:55,579 --> 01:44:02,809
section begin line all this nonsense

1769
01:43:58,189 --> 01:44:04,159
right so we now can merge the start to

1770
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:07,820
merge these things together

1771
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:11,269
and so like with the begin line and end

1772
01:44:07,819 --> 01:44:14,059
line stuff like we've got now ways of

1773
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:17,690
doing some of these things because we've

1774
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:19,250
we've now opened up access to like all

1775
01:44:17,689 --> 01:44:20,210
of the things that we had already

1776
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:23,149
written

1777
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:25,689
so like you know these end element

1778
01:44:23,149 --> 01:44:31,219
advanced elements all that sort of stuff

1779
01:44:25,689 --> 01:44:34,729
so begin row an end row is really begin

1780
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:37,640
line end line right so we can just say

1781
01:44:34,729 --> 01:44:39,199
that that that's what that is and now

1782
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:43,430
everywhere that we were calling

1783
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:57,769
beginning ends we should be able to just

1784
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:59,690
do this and now this this can be calling

1785
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:01,250
into the system that actually does

1786
01:44:59,689 --> 01:45:07,399
something right because like I said we

1787
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:08,869
we already wrote it and then when when

1788
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:09,920
we want to do stuff like labels and

1789
01:45:08,869 --> 01:45:14,559
stuff like that we now just have to look

1790
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:14,560
at see what do we actually have here for

1791
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:21,380
for element drawing right and how are we

1792
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:23,359
previously doing that so you can see

1793
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:27,619
that we have the ability to do these

1794
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:30,559
basic text elements here so presumably

1795
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:36,890
if we wanted to do some of the stuff

1796
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:40,520
that we had like a button isn't

1797
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:43,910
particularly hard we could probably just

1798
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:48,440
implement that that way trying to think

1799
01:45:43,909 --> 01:45:50,329
of what else we got here label F so a

1800
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:52,039
lot of these things I think could be

1801
01:45:50,329 --> 01:45:57,229
implemented in terms of basic text

1802
01:45:52,039 --> 01:45:59,149
elements and some jumping around and

1803
01:45:57,229 --> 01:46:02,239
Squinkie miss

1804
01:45:59,149 --> 01:46:02,239
[Music]

1805
01:46:08,828 --> 01:46:13,979
I mean because you can see right I mean

1806
01:46:11,078 --> 01:46:13,979
here it is

1807
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:23,229
so button is just action button so let

1808
01:46:21,488 --> 01:46:25,178
me just go ahead and make that and the

1809
01:46:23,229 --> 01:46:27,189
only difficult part is we don't have

1810
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:29,520
interactions for these action buttons

1811
01:46:27,189 --> 01:46:51,519
yet

1812
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:54,010
so if we just do this you know I gotta

1813
01:46:51,520 --> 01:47:01,630
do a little bit of work here to actually

1814
01:46:54,010 --> 01:47:04,860
wire this up but if we're talking about

1815
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:04,859
something like this

1816
01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:22,989
we've already got a label as well so I

1817
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:25,240
think you know if we just define this

1818
01:47:22,989 --> 01:47:26,710
interaction somehow we probably can make

1819
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:29,819
it work so that we can get buttons

1820
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:29,819
working in short order

1821
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:40,239
oops that's not what I want to do so you

1822
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:43,240
can see we've already kind of got the UI

1823
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:47,199
appearing there right as I move around

1824
01:47:43,239 --> 01:47:51,880
here and so we're off to an okay start

1825
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:52,989
but we we just need to now actually put

1826
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:58,989
put some of the rest of the stuff in

1827
01:47:52,989 --> 01:48:01,269
there right let's go in and try to get

1828
01:47:58,989 --> 01:48:07,420
the rest of those in there so for the

1829
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:16,360
other things in here like you know the

1830
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:20,649
boolean type size that stuff I don't

1831
01:48:16,359 --> 01:48:23,519
actually know to what extent you look in

1832
01:48:20,649 --> 01:48:23,519
the renderer here

1833
01:48:29,229 --> 01:48:38,059
so I don't know to what extent we need

1834
01:48:32,779 --> 01:48:51,920
to look at like frame based memory here

1835
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:55,820
I don't think I don't I don't know to

1836
01:48:51,920 --> 01:49:01,579
what extent we have sort of support for

1837
01:48:55,819 --> 01:49:03,949
this but like you've got you've got this

1838
01:49:01,579 --> 01:49:10,100
frame arena right that can stick stuff

1839
01:49:03,949 --> 01:49:12,559
on it and I don't know to what extent

1840
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:17,180
any of these things need that like

1841
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:19,940
they're dumping the they're dumping

1842
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:21,829
stuff on here that's basically yeah so

1843
01:49:19,939 --> 01:49:24,079
you know they're just dumping lists of

1844
01:49:21,829 --> 01:49:25,519
drawing is on there so I guess we don't

1845
01:49:24,079 --> 01:49:28,039
even really need to save any of this

1846
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,690
stuff so for the most part we can just

1847
01:49:28,039 --> 01:49:32,750
use local buffers to print out what

1848
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:35,809
these things are and then be done with

1849
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:42,979
it I think so it's actually pretty easy

1850
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:46,760
to do so yeah so I mean I think you know

1851
01:49:42,979 --> 01:49:53,269
and it's not necessarily the best way to

1852
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:55,900
do it but I think you could really just

1853
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:55,900
do this

1854
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:16,469
it's you know I'm Sam and then print it

1855
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:23,380
out in here now we need to actually

1856
01:50:16,469 --> 01:50:26,819
thunk through to this because we are

1857
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:29,800
they're passing us an F as well in here

1858
01:50:26,819 --> 01:50:32,139
and so we kind of need to do this

1859
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:36,309
version of it only because we have to

1860
01:50:32,139 --> 01:50:42,279
use the VA list so we need to do like

1861
01:50:36,309 --> 01:50:45,820
you know VA start VA end kind of a thing

1862
01:50:42,279 --> 01:50:50,349
I don't remember exactly how that goes

1863
01:50:45,819 --> 01:51:05,289
so we'll just look at it here there we

1864
01:50:50,349 --> 01:51:07,809
go and there we go so that and then once

1865
01:51:05,289 --> 01:51:16,420
we have that we can just call the label

1866
01:51:07,809 --> 01:51:19,230
function afterward so that gets a little

1867
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:19,230
closer as well

1868
01:51:30,619 --> 01:51:39,409
and so yeah that's almost the rest of

1869
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:42,409
the UI and now we just need some of the

1870
01:51:39,409 --> 01:51:44,149
other editable types in there which I

1871
01:51:42,409 --> 01:51:48,170
get again I could throw in pretty

1872
01:51:44,149 --> 01:51:50,059
quickly I think they're not actually

1873
01:51:48,170 --> 01:52:09,529
editable but if we were just wanted to

1874
01:51:50,060 --> 01:52:18,160
see them right there just like they're

1875
01:52:09,529 --> 01:52:21,649
all like that and I think that's it so

1876
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:24,109
you can see that this will come together

1877
01:52:21,649 --> 01:52:28,299
pretty quickly actually or at least I

1878
01:52:24,109 --> 01:52:31,759
think it probably will so yeah not bad

1879
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:33,230
we'll go ahead and go to a brief Q&amp;A and

1880
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,140
then it seems like we'll be in good

1881
01:52:33,229 --> 01:52:39,459
shape for next stream to go ahead and

1882
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:39,460
get the rest of that UI done

1883
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:49,319
looks like we are question free so that

1884
01:53:46,809 --> 01:53:49,320
makes pretty easy

1885
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:11,110
all right

1886
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:19,960
you forgot no questions we can wrap it

1887
01:54:17,659 --> 01:54:19,960
up

1888
01:54:29,618 --> 01:54:33,228
all right thank you everyone for joining

1889
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:34,969
me flips on a handmade here it's been a

1890
01:54:33,229 --> 01:54:36,229
pleasure coding with you as always if

1891
01:54:34,969 --> 01:54:38,420
you would like to follow on series at

1892
01:54:36,229 --> 01:54:40,190
home you can always pier the game on

1893
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:41,479
handmade here org and it comes with a

1894
01:54:40,189 --> 01:54:44,238
source code so you can play around with

1895
01:54:41,479 --> 01:54:48,050
it I will be back for the next surprise

1896
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:50,959
stream sometime I can't say when at a

1897
01:54:48,050 --> 01:54:55,099
surprising time but you can always check

1898
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:56,989
the watch schedule I do put the the

1899
01:54:55,099 --> 01:54:58,429
surprise ones on there you know within a

1900
01:54:56,988 --> 01:55:01,368
couple minutes of when they're gonna

1901
01:54:58,429 --> 01:55:07,239
start as well and the Twitter feed also

1902
01:55:01,368 --> 01:55:09,380
gets updated so I think probably

1903
01:55:07,238 --> 01:55:12,319
probably pretty soon we'll do another

1904
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:13,639
stream and we'll just go through because

1905
01:55:12,319 --> 01:55:14,960
I want to get the UI stuff done as well

1906
01:55:13,639 --> 01:55:16,909
and then we can start playing out the

1907
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,719
art assets a bit which is also kind of

1908
01:55:16,908 --> 01:55:19,460
fun

1909
01:55:17,719 --> 01:55:20,809
so hooks to you back here for the next

1910
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:21,948
price dream till then have fun

1911
01:55:20,809 --> 01:55:25,179
programming everyone and I'll see you on

1912
01:55:21,948 --> 01:55:25,178
the Internet techies everybody
