1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,059
welcome to hand made here sure we could

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:07,379
a complete-game live on stream yesterday

3
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:09,000
so I'd want to do some camera work

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:10,169
yesterday but I actually ended up going

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,230
and doing something the entities this

6
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,660
creation system because it turns out we

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,149
had not you know our world generation

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,410
code is still pretty rudimentary right

9
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,979
we haven't spent a whole lot of time on

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,839
it it's something to spend more time on

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,689
as we go forward but we really just

12
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:29,670
haven't spent a lot of time in there

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,460
because we haven't been focusing on that

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,559
and so one of the things that we didn't

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,299
have was the ability to tell the world

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,759
generation look I want to place an

17
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,468
entity next to another entity or these

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,210
two entities have to be in this

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,259
relationship to each other like this one

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,579
asked me to the north of that one or

21
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,780
this one has to be above this one or

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,090
whatever so we added that yesterday and

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,558
it went pretty well and the reason that

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,780
I added that was because I wanted to

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,209
have a test for the camera system to see

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,120
if you could do things like place a

27
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,149
square that you hop on and it would zoom

28
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,469
in and then hop off and it zooms out so

29
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,170
for things like talking to another

30
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,658
character or things like that I don't

31
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,540
know whether we're actually going to do

32
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,909
this in the actual game again it's just

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,368
exploratory and this is an educational

34
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,350
stream so when I see opportunities to do

35
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,868
something in the codebase I do them

36
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:23,009
right that's generally the rule so I

37
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:26,400
don't necessarily know how much we're

38
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,170
going to do with this with special

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,299
cameras we may decide that they're too

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,090
distracting or they don't really work

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,000
very well from the standpoint of the

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,799
player being able to you know the player

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,359
doesn't really want to do that they

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,020
don't want to have this happen to the

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,930
camera but I want to put it into the sea

46
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:47,969
and so since I knew that we would want a

47
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,280
bunch of stuff in the game that had to

48
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:52,379
do with entity placement separate from

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,170
this particular problem I figured it

50
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,509
couldn't hurt to put this in because

51
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,759
we'll use the placement part even if we

52
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,840
don't use the camera part so I'm going

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,209
to go ahead and show you what I'm

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,799
talking about I believe at the end of

55
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,769
the last dream we just tested this out

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,289
by saying that we needed to have a cat

57
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:12,840
placed to the side of I'm sorry above

58
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,530
each of the little orphan heads we put

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,650
down

60
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,960
and if you see it appears to work just

61
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,789
fine like there's a cat above each of

62
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,240
these right you can see the cat each

63
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:26,069
time and and so that worked great so now

64
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,050
what I want to do is I want to push

65
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,439
forward on that and instead all right

66
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:38,280
let's create a thing that makes a place

67
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:40,620
we can have the character stand so we'll

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,569
have an orphan and we'll have them

69
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,509
facing downward and to the south of the

70
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,840
orphan we will have a square you can hop

71
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:51,030
on but zooms in okay so that's what I

72
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,719
want to do in the world generation code

73
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:59,969
right now so if I go into handmade prj

74
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,939
and I just rebuild everything so I know

75
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:05,280
we're starting from a good clean place

76
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:07,229
I'm gonna go into the world gent code

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,060
and I'm gonna go into the entity gem

78
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:12,299
code and I'm gonna see if I can make

79
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,770
that happen now we sort of have a mix of

80
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,510
code in here this is sort of the old

81
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,860
code that'll probably go away eventually

82
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:18,449
and this is sort of the new style code

83
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,090
where we basically have a callback

84
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:23,509
system where we can let's not only call

85
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,400
back it's more like a service system

86
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:28,048
where we basically say this is the code

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
you can use to create any of this type

88
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,099
and they're interchangeable so you can

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,159
pass a pointer to add cat at orphan and

90
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,439
whatever and so in here we want to add a

91
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:44,959
talk square basically like a thing that

92
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:47,969
says here is something to say and I

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,560
don't really know exactly how we're

94
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:51,030
gonna do the talking part of it because

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,670
that's really not the part that I'm

96
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,000
focusing on at the moment so I'm not

97
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:59,399
sure what I want in terms of the talking

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,469
but I am sure what I want in terms of

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,260
the camera and so that's the part that

100
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:08,159
I'm actually going to try and create now

101
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:10,979
if you look so this is going to be a for

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,579
lack of a better term a conversation

103
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:17,608
Square so we're just gonna call that an

104
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,139
add conversation and in some sense you

105
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,889
know maybe I should use the more the

106
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,348
term bark

107
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,209
well barks not really what it is so I am

108
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:25,889
gonna use the the term conversation for

109
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:26,939
now it's not a conversation because the

110
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,879
user doesn't really

111
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:31,649
responses it's not a dialogue tree but

112
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,480
in the end of teen it's not really

113
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:37,349
industry bark is used to refer to

114
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,860
something that is said out of hand by an

115
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:44,340
NPC so for example if you might be

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,949
playing a stealth suitor and a chem PC

117
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:48,599
is patrolling and you make a sound and

118
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:52,259
the NBC goes what's that or something

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,790
right or you know maybe just the NPC's

120
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,670
just patrolling and it goes gosh I'm

121
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,140
bored or I wonder what's going on over

122
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,590
there or things like that right just

123
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,110
just random stuff they say that doesn't

124
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:05,669
really have a specific part in the

125
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,520
narrative right it's not like something

126
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,980
that a scriptwriter was thinking went in

127
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,959
some kind of a story progression or

128
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,790
narrative arc it was just something that

129
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,699
gets recorded and can be said at any

130
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,560
time given a certain circumstance like

131
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,620
you know guard is doing this or a guard

132
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,120
is idle or whatever so it's not really

133
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,009
that either because the player is

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,290
hopping on to it so I'm gonna avoid the

135
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:29,639
term Bart for now and I'm just gonna say

136
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,900
look I don't know we're gonna call it

137
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,879
we're gonna call a conversation for now

138
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,099
and we'll just have to leave it there

139
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,329
because I don't have a better word for

140
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:44,760
it so inside room genna's well you can

141
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:48,359
see in here so we make right here you

142
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:54,480
can see me making a room camera right

143
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,889
and that it's just a area that says what

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,480
happens to the camera in that room right

145
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,509
that's all it does and it's it's how we

146
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,430
move the camera around in that way and

147
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,230
so what I want to do here is I want to

148
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,600
have another way of creating one of

149
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,410
those cameras and what do they do is I'm

150
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,680
gonna look at what I create here I with

151
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,360
respect to how the camera gets created

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,329
differently for the special camera as

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,639
for the room camera and then I'm

154
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:23,129
probably gonna do is merge those two

155
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,509
things together so I'm gonna like take

156
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,100
the camera the room cam stuff and then

157
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,750
the special camp stuff and I'll probably

158
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,629
make a utility function called create

159
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,740
camera volume that does all of this

160
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:40,189
stuff I and I'm gonna go from there

161
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,189
right

162
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:49,569
all right so if you look at what's

163
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:52,449
happening here we've got sort of a

164
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:54,759
camera for the conversation I do want to

165
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,109
add an entity for that I don't want to

166
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,939
send any flags on it because it doesn't

167
00:06:56,108 --> 00:07:00,658
collide it doesn't take up space it's

168
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:03,338
not standing anywhere it's just a region

169
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:05,918
if I set the collision volume for it

170
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:08,738
what I'm going to want to do is create a

171
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,678
tile sized collision volume right

172
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:14,518
so whatever tile I'm on I want to create

173
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:17,948
something that occupies that entire tile

174
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:22,360
so that when people are on it it does

175
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:24,509
this operation green slot we may want to

176
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,610
do something with but I'm not sure right

177
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:30,579
and then when we call this function here

178
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,439
get camera offset Z for dim that is the

179
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:34,569
thing that tells us how far we zoom in

180
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,479
on rooms right and so looking at this

181
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:39,519
our minimum is like 13 that we zoom and

182
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:43,478
so I might just set that offhand right

183
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,699
now to 10 and furthermore I might even

184
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:48,878
do something a little bit more specific

185
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:52,538
here which is to say maybe I'll make

186
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,449
that a call get camera offset Z for

187
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:59,079
close-up and that way I know that when I

188
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,269
call that I anyone who was trying to do

189
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:03,158
something like that will call this and

190
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:04,869
then that way I know where it comes from

191
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:07,149
you know just to make it a little

192
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:09,099
clearer so there's not just a 10 sitting

193
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,048
around in the code and in the future we

194
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:13,959
might be able to pass parameters here to

195
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:19,718
the extent that we care about them so

196
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:21,269
we'll see right so anyway if you look at

197
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:24,009
what happens here the special brain

198
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:27,459
special brain slot for type brain room

199
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:30,278
you know what I mean that is not really

200
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:33,788
something that we want to specify here

201
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:36,969
because this isn't a room entity and so

202
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:39,188
if you look at the brain oops I hit the

203
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,129
caps lock key there if you look at the

204
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:47,409
types of brains that there are this may

205
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:48,730
be something that we mark and we're you

206
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,639
know where we maybe just want to say

207
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,990
like this is a

208
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:57,529
[Music]

209
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:59,879
you know some kind of camera brain thing

210
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:02,490
and the reason that I might want to do

211
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,590
that is because inside the simulation

212
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,690
system when we're updating the camera

213
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,269
for a particular movement of the entity

214
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,130
what you can see in here is normally we

215
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,379
just look to see whether this thing has

216
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:15,899
any kind of camera behavior set to it

217
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:18,179
and in the future we may want to just

218
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,579
only look at entities that have brain

219
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,159
type camera associated with them so

220
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,139
again I don't really know to what extent

221
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,379
I want to do that but I might want to do

222
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:32,009
that I on the other hand another thing

223
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:34,500
we could do is this where we say that

224
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,600
it's a conversation type so again I

225
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,519
really don't know what we want to do

226
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,970
here there's just things we could do

227
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:47,009
here at the moment I guess I will just

228
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:48,960
say hey maybe I don't really need to do

229
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,939
either of those things just yet I'll

230
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,580
just set the camera behavior to change

231
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:58,290
the offset and we'll call it a day

232
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,300
because at you know just looking through

233
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:03,870
that code there I just don't see much

234
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:05,969
reason to so those are the things I

235
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,250
considered and I guess I can't really

236
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,750
say that there's much reason to do them

237
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,179
so I think I'm gonna just avoid it for

238
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,460
now so if I look at how this is is

239
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:17,429
working here what I now need to do is

240
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,980
just get the coordinates into play and

241
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:21,779
so if we look at what's happening here

242
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,120
in terms of what gets passed when

243
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:31,470
entities are created what you can see

244
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:35,129
inside the world gencode what I meant to

245
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,410
say was really gencode what you can see

246
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:40,049
inside the room gencode is when we go in

247
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:42,870
here and create pending entities we are

248
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:46,229
gonna pass them the location and we're

249
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,840
also going to pass them a reference that

250
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,750
says this is what you're standing on and

251
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,060
so we can do a couple different things

252
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,090
here but at the moment I suppose the

253
00:10:54,059 --> 00:11:01,109
easiest thing to do would really just be

254
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,990
to do a rectangle Center dimension where

255
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,930
we create a box that's just kind of

256
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:12,240
based around that p-value that we get

257
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:14,579
past so inside the MV gencode here where

258
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,370
you see us getting this p-value and then

259
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,650
the standing on value we would start

260
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,060
with that p-value as the center of the

261
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:27,929
box that we're gonna create excuse me

262
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:30,569
and then we create a dimension for it so

263
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:33,479
here's the dimension that we want to

264
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,840
make and I don't really know how big we

265
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,460
want these to be at the moment so I'm

266
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,920
just gonna create something that's small

267
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,450
like that I'm gonna give the dim here

268
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,990
and since we wanted this to be resting

269
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:51,060
on the ground P what we would do is say

270
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:53,669
we want to create a offset in Z that

271
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:55,500
happens to be whatever half of this is

272
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:59,279
so that it's basically a rectangle off

273
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,110
of the base right and I don't know if we

274
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,360
have a math for a grounded rectangle

275
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,889
like that so you know I'm just doing it

276
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,419
manually here but in the future we

277
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,590
should probably make some math for that

278
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:11,039
I'm guessing because that's a pretty

279
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,320
typical thing to want to do so if we set

280
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,089
the collision volume equal to this we

281
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,560
set the behavior equal to offset and we

282
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,340
set the offset equal to whatever that

283
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:23,699
close up zoom would be then when we

284
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,920
place the entity again in here I think

285
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,350
we don't really have to do that we can

286
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,979
just say look place the entity at the P

287
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,259
that it's at like this I think that's

288
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,670
really all we have to do and again I

289
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,080
don't really need to call that anything

290
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:40,259
other than entity in this case because

291
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,730
we're just creating that one so if we

292
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,980
add a conversations this will add the

293
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,060
close up for that conversation and it

294
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,440
won't do anything else though right so

295
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,929
it's worth noting that that's the only

296
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,120
thing that will do let me go ahead and

297
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:56,879
expose this series so people can call it

298
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,769
as necessary also don't ask me why these

299
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,799
aren't coming first because normally

300
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:03,990
they do so that's what that's supposed

301
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,829
to look like but for some reason it

302
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:10,139
didn't so anyway that's the long and

303
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,600
short of it now what we would need to do

304
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,519
is just request if that thing be added

305
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,009
now what I want to do before we do that

306
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,029
though is right now we would never see

307
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,830
that thing

308
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:22,049
so it'd be really hard to debug so

309
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,850
inside enemy I'm also gonna make it so

310
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:27,120
that we turn on drawing the bounds of

311
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:30,409
these things and so I don't really

312
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,149
remember what this code has to do here

313
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:35,100
but I'm pretty sure that it has changed

314
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:38,279
because for pushing volume outline we

315
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:43,500
kind of need a way to actually make this

316
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,699
thing to actually draw the thing at the

317
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,230
location it's supposed to be because the

318
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,780
entity transform isn't taking effect

319
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,639
anymore so I would need to create an

320
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,399
offset rectangle that like moves this

321
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,840
thing to the location where the entity

322
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,399
actually is in the world which is you

323
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,970
know the enemy ground pay for example

324
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,829
right and so just creating something

325
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,300
that draws those outlines first I want

326
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,730
to make sure I have that because

327
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:09,059
otherwise I would have no idea where

328
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,550
anything was in the world so I just want

329
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,559
to see what's going on with that and so

330
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:16,500
here you can see me drawing those

331
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,119
collision volumes and what you can see

332
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,649
from me drawing the collision volumes

333
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,929
right as you can see that every room has

334
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,459
one and the player head has one that's

335
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,929
just kind of a residual that's left in

336
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,460
there we don't use it right now but in

337
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,500
the future we probably will for things

338
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,290
like whether or not people hit you and

339
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,899
things like that so if you just look at

340
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:38,909
what's going on there we get exactly

341
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:41,840
what you expect and so now what I'm

342
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:44,250
looking to try and do is I want to see

343
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,879
when we make this change I want to see

344
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,549
the orphan have a collision box to its

345
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:53,399
south right that's what I'm looking for

346
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:54,779
and so I'm drawing that because I since

347
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,090
it's an invisible region that's just

348
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,529
going to control the camera maybe the

349
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,139
whole thing works the first time and the

350
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,929
camera zooms in but if it doesn't I'm in

351
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,789
a position where I wouldn't even know

352
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:08,189
whether the entity got created and I

353
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:10,860
don't want to start from that so I'd

354
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,890
like to have that code path working as

355
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,560
something that we have now you can also

356
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:18,240
see in here these if ones if zeros those

357
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,729
are things we may want to add to the HUD

358
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,740
eventually as well because we have live

359
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,039
code reloading it's free for me to just

360
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,230
toggle the if on and off but it's one of

361
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,089
those things that it's just like maybe

362
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,819
better in the HUD cuz it's faster you

363
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:34,079
don't have to go through

364
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:36,368
recompile to turn it on and off right so

365
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:43,028
and because it's pretty low cost to

366
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:45,668
check right okay so moving along if I

367
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:47,708
went into world gen now and we look at

368
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:49,749
when we create an orphan so in here

369
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:52,028
we've got like a place orphan call and

370
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:54,609
we're adding an orphan in here we add a

371
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:56,168
cat as a constraint and in here we say

372
00:15:54,609 --> 00:16:00,819
look North I'm gonna change that to

373
00:15:56,168 --> 00:16:03,100
South I'm also gonna add a tag to the

374
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:06,988
orphan and I'm gonna say that the facing

375
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:11,528
direction for the orphan is going to be

376
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:13,269
0.75 F times tau right and that's just

377
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,828
giving me rotation around the circle so

378
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:16,178
the thing will be facing downward

379
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:19,838
because I want the orphan facing

380
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:21,159
downward now remember tau I have a long

381
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,589
ramp that I've been building up about

382
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:26,978
tau and pi before I started handmade

383
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,689
hero and well when we got to this when

384
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:30,699
we talked about PI in tau on handmade

385
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,259
hero I'd really didn't have a strong a

386
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:36,038
pain about it I've been putting at PI

387
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:38,259
most of my career just used to it people

388
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:41,350
kind of made the case for tau and they

389
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:44,379
have a good case so I said well we'll

390
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,859
use tau on handmade hero I actually ever

391
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:49,720
ramps on pi and tau coming up it's that

392
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:51,519
both PI and tower stupid and we

393
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,158
shouldn't be using either of them

394
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,548
and so that's coming up and I will

395
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:58,958
probably post a blog post about it but

396
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:02,908
we may go through and rip those out of

397
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:05,109
handmade hero after I do that rant so

398
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:06,818
putting that aside because you don't

399
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:08,859
really need to adjust that right now I'm

400
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,480
just going to go ahead and set that

401
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,308
facing direction in here so that it's

402
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,048
facing right way and then in here we

403
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:15,158
have this tag I don't need to tag for

404
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:18,788
this and I'm just gonna say add

405
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,769
conversation and so now this should put

406
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:23,709
a conversation entity to the south of

407
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:27,370
the orphan and then I should be able to

408
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:30,669
see that entity as a collision box that

409
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:32,229
I can then go and step on right and so

410
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:34,629
that's what we're doing and so what I'm

411
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,450
seeing here is you can see that that

412
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:40,658
collision box looks nowhere near where

413
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:43,538
it should be right so I feel that that

414
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,790
is probably just highly erroneous like

415
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:48,299
I've obviously

416
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:50,039
in the wrong place where something so

417
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,839
let's see what's going on there and this

418
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,220
is exactly why I did that right this is

419
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,049
why I want to see it because I knew that

420
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,789
this would be a likely place to have

421
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:58,980
that error oh and you can see what's

422
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,440
going on here this is not supposed to be

423
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,120
p+ anything this collision volume is

424
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,890
relative to the entity's location so

425
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,979
adding the P would effectively add the P

426
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,740
twice so that was just a typo so let's

427
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,710
see if they're in the correct place now

428
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:16,440
right looks better to say the least and

429
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,980
so now when we hop into those I don't

430
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,360
actually know to what extent

431
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,339
we're actually triggering those properly

432
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,189
but now I can actually at least see that

433
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:27,750
they were placed in the correct position

434
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,120
and now I just want to know whether I'm

435
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,920
inside one or not right and I don't

436
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,359
actually know that I don't know whether

437
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,550
that case is getting triggered or

438
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,259
whether it isn't so the first thing I

439
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:40,259
want to do is see whether that case is

440
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:42,390
in fact being triggered or not so let's

441
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,730
start there I may need to recompile in

442
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,790
debug mode because this will be hard to

443
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,380
step through in fact let me just go

444
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,539
ahead and do that right now

445
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,730
if we go back here I'll put myself in a

446
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:57,659
position where I can i where the case

447
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,730
should trigger and so if I in here go to

448
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,220
the builds and I just say look give me a

449
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,360
debug build it should keep the state of

450
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,400
the game the same so we should just now

451
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:11,309
have the debug mode so this the speed of

452
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,720
updating should slow down dramatically

453
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,809
but the game is still in the exact same

454
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,839
position that it was so now if I go back

455
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:21,919
here and I say look tell me if we hit

456
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:25,319
this case right it should stop here

457
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:30,090
regardless because it should stop on the

458
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,129
room that I'm in and so the question is

459
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:38,179
just do we ever get the SPECIAL camera

460
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:42,030
showing up right and so I'm not sure I

461
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,549
guess I have to kind of see whether the

462
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,710
brain slot type equals brain slot room

463
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:50,579
or not so it loads I got to see when we

464
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:53,220
stop are we getting this happening right

465
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:55,710
and then when we are getting that I also

466
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,250
need to know like when we do in the

467
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,000
overlaps entity

468
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:02,890
I kind of need to see neither these

469
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,079
should be set so I need to kind of set

470
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,970
it to pass only I need to look at only

471
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,879
in pass so you can see we're never

472
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:15,069
getting here right we're not getting an

473
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,750
overlap of any kind right now one of the

474
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:18,970
interesting things about this and I

475
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,700
guess I don't I guess I should check

476
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,940
this a little more Sicily so when we're

477
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:29,110
doing entity and test them these so this

478
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,640
is the player I believe right so any

479
00:20:29,109 --> 00:20:34,569
like entity is the thing that we're

480
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,660
passing in here right so entity this is

481
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:40,809
the players location or represents the

482
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,400
players location right it's this and if

483
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,629
you look at the collision volume what

484
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,390
you can see is the player doesn't

485
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,330
actually have one right it that there

486
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,910
isn't one it's just zero zero zero right

487
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:56,710
so you're testing to see whether this PE

488
00:20:51,910 --> 00:21:00,490
overlaps the you know this this tests

489
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,259
entity in any way and what that means is

490
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:06,250
we might be in a case where we have to

491
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:08,109
enlarge this thing a little bit more in

492
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,759
order to actually capture the non

493
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:12,399
collision entity of the player because

494
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,549
it's actually a single point so looking

495
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,890
at this when we do this here what I

496
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:21,879
think I want to do is I want to do an ad

497
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:24,570
radius call and I just want to expand

498
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,300
this thing out by like a safety margin

499
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:31,319
because it's not gonna necessarily

500
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:34,779
include the ground point in its entirety

501
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:36,579
if I don't and so I just want to take

502
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:41,079
that out of the equation

503
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:43,389
I think it's that actually yeah so I

504
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:47,049
want to make sure that those boxes in

505
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,550
you know include that much you can see

506
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:51,099
it's much lower because we're in debug

507
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,720
build now so our lighting here is it's

508
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:55,389
taking all the time I should have a way

509
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,339
of turning the lighting off for debug

510
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,350
builds until we actually have it faster

511
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:01,750
and so now you can see those include the

512
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:03,009
ground a little bit right you can see

513
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,109
those collision volumes including the

514
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:07,569
ground a little bit and so now I want to

515
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:11,289
see if we actually can trigger that pass

516
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:15,700
case now where the players position

517
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:17,649
is on the base there so that basically

518
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,140
and so what you can see now is we

519
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,790
actually do get that right we do get

520
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,310
that overlap now and that was just

521
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:26,049
because again we did wait since the

522
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,669
player doesn't have a volume right now

523
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,549
and you could argue we probably should

524
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,630
give give the player one but because the

525
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,480
player doesn't have a volume right now

526
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,240
that test is only gonna work if the

527
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,620
volume actually encompasses the entire

528
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,849
place where the point could be and when

529
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:42,489
the player hops into it

530
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:45,369
if the player hops into it and that

531
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,980
point was actually a like right on the

532
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:49,659
the minimum point of the box that might

533
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,309
not be considered in I don't remember

534
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,320
how we wrote this code but for floating

535
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,389
point accuracy purposes we wouldn't want

536
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,879
to rely on that anyway so you want to

537
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,860
sort of capture a wider area to make

538
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,690
sure that no matter where that point is

539
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:03,219
floating point precision wise it's it's

540
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:07,450
always gonna actually be considered

541
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,410
inside so now we should get that special

542
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,750
camera call

543
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,570
happening and the special camera should

544
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:16,750
now be set if we look at what that's

545
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:19,329
actually set to for camera behaviors we

546
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:23,710
should be able to see the special camera

547
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:28,480
say that it wants an offset right so in

548
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:31,840
here there's a camera behavior yeah

549
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,630
right there and the offset should be set

550
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:39,759
to ten and it is right and so if we come

551
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:42,390
in and actually use that how did we jump

552
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,390
back up there

553
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,950
what okay there we go

554
00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:01,809
no no what just happened there that's a

555
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:03,519
little bit weird oh wait no that I'm

556
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,869
sorry that's exactly what happen we

557
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,490
finished this loop first before we

558
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:08,918
process anything no that's all good I'm

559
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,720
not freaked out so when we checked such

560
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,259
a camera now we should do is this should

561
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,808
override the location and offset and it

562
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:20,980
does and so that's exactly what I wanted

563
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:22,450
to have happen right so now what we need

564
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,878
to do is just adjust those settings

565
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:30,340
potentially meaning that like you know

566
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:31,898
we may want to change how the zoom what

567
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:34,418
the zoom is focused on or how far in the

568
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:36,369
zoom goes but at least now we've got

569
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:38,528
that element of the camera stuff working

570
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:41,319
and so we can play around with that a

571
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:43,000
little bit more as we go so now you can

572
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:45,189
kind of see I hop in here and it zooms

573
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,429
in that's not enough of a zoom I wanted

574
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,320
a more egregious zoom so I wanted

575
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:53,590
something that was going to be really

576
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,750
absurd so in terms of egregious zooms

577
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:57,459
what I would really like here is

578
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:01,778
probably something just you know that's

579
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:06,340
like really really out there you know

580
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:08,409
just just just really bizarre and so let

581
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,730
me now try hopping on it and see what I

582
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:12,730
think of that so you know I'm gonna go

583
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:16,298
in to talk to this orphan and we get a

584
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:19,389
zoom like that yeah now you can see we

585
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:20,980
also have some problems with with the

586
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:23,558
way our camera interface is working in

587
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,360
terms of the that near and far plane so

588
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,638
when we zoom into things you can see

589
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,619
that the near and far planes don't keep

590
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:32,798
up properly so that's another thing

591
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:34,869
we're gonna want to make sure key you

592
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:38,048
know we're gonna want to make sure we

593
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:39,579
solve that in another in a good way but

594
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,319
this is what I had in mind so you know

595
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:43,960
I'm in this room doing stuff if I want

596
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:47,048
to talk to this entity it zooms in like

597
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,038
this and you know does some kind of

598
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:52,929
conversation nonsense here right now the

599
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,429
problem that I'm gonna have and one of

600
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:57,700
the things that I need this is why I

601
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:59,860
said we yesterday I alluded to this what

602
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,730
I really want this box to be is I want

603
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,729
it to sort of encompass

604
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:12,610
I want this offset to be something a

605
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:16,839
little bit more based on well you know

606
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:18,729
what here I don't really know how I want

607
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:20,259
to solve this going forward because it

608
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,670
depends how flexible we want to be but

609
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,799
let's suppose we're hard coding our

610
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,529
conversations to be that facing

611
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,470
direction then it's pretty easy to do

612
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:33,160
because the camera offset Y can just get

613
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:37,180
modified by some value so I can say

614
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:40,150
something like this and then we do that

615
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,250
offset right and I don't remember what

616
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,600
this is a plus or minus so I don't

617
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,490
remember which way we interpret the

618
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,559
offset but this would allow me to focus

619
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:51,400
on the conversation offset a little bit

620
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:52,990
more like so and that's really more the

621
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,030
way I want it because because you want

622
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,289
to see the person you're talking to and

623
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:59,170
you should kind of be at the bottom

624
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:02,529
right so that's the kind of zoom that

625
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:06,100
we're more looking for here I and once

626
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:07,480
we've got that you know we just need to

627
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:09,309
think about whether we need to

628
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,140
parameterize that conversation in some

629
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:12,519
other way to make it so that if you were

630
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,640
talking to someone to the side of you

631
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:18,279
that offset didn't you know wasn't gonna

632
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,400
happen that way or something so again

633
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:25,539
I'm not really sure exactly how I want

634
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,790
that to go but this is good enough for

635
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,889
now and so what will happen is when we

636
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:31,210
hop on these we'll want to have the

637
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,740
thing that actually puts up the line of

638
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,509
dialogue and we can look at doing that

639
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,329
but right now the important thing to

640
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:39,190
focus on is just that camera code and so

641
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:42,490
now I think I have all of the things

642
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,289
that I want in terms of cases for the

643
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,490
camera code and so now the rest of the

644
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:47,889
day we should be able to work on

645
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:50,559
improving the quality of the camera code

646
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:53,410
and again I listed kind of what all

647
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,659
those are but just to give a recap

648
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:57,820
I want to damp out any like unnecessary

649
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,950
movement of the camera like following

650
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:05,159
the hopping I don't want that I want it

651
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:08,890
to be smoother I want to try and fix the

652
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,690
interpolation of the Alpha clipping so

653
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,730
that when you zoom in on things the

654
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,740
Alpha clipping doesn't go ahead of you

655
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:17,079
right because that's a problem right now

656
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,769
and you can see that really clearly in

657
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,509
this case

658
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:23,259
there it was there and here it is again

659
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:26,500
here right it's that slow interpolation

660
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:30,609
of the Alpha fade distance really

661
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,990
doesn't work with the speed of the

662
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,779
camera movement so we have to get those

663
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:37,089
two things locked together better and

664
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:38,710
then yeah where you can see like it's

665
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:40,299
really bad there right and so we want

666
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,460
those interpolations to happen

667
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:44,289
concurrent so that you don't you know

668
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,029
you want to like that right what I'm

669
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:49,119
doing right now you don't want to do the

670
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:51,039
other thing so we have to fix those and

671
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:57,069
then the other thing that we want to do

672
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:59,139
is we want to we want to make sure that

673
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:01,509
we have a debug camera again and we

674
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,000
don't have that right now right we don't

675
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:06,460
have any way to go into debug camera

676
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,140
mode so those are plenty of things to

677
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,180
keep us busy for the rest of the day at

678
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,460
least on the camera and so I'm gonna

679
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,470
dive in on those and get working on

680
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,380
those right now I'm gonna tackle those

681
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:20,259
in the order that I feel like they're

682
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,390
actually existing right now in terms of

683
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:24,549
problems for me Oh actually there's one

684
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,530
other thing we have to do we also want

685
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:28,269
to have something for the camera where

686
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:29,920
we can solve for the light volume like

687
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,410
right now you can see the line where the

688
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,990
lighting stops we want something that

689
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,120
actually correctly takes a camera

690
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,910
frustum and puts all the things that are

691
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,899
should be lit into it and right now we

692
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:46,029
don't have that either

693
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:48,580
right so yeah so really what I need to

694
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:51,970
do is tackle these in that order and

695
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:53,439
like I said what I want to do here is I

696
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,360
want to focus first on that weird

697
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,400
interpolation problem so the first thing

698
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,929
we're gonna focus on is getting this to

699
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:05,860
work properly the camera looks just fine

700
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:09,039
but the the Alpha plane clipping the

701
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:11,379
Alpha value totally gets wonky

702
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,259
especially if you are hopping in here

703
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,050
for the first time from like something

704
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,789
where the Alpha was really far before

705
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:20,589
and then you kind of hop in here and do

706
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:24,039
a zoom quickly you can see you get a lot

707
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:26,619
of problems there so I'm gonna start

708
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:30,759
with that code and see what we can do

709
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:31,179
about that so inside the sim region we

710
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,460
have

711
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:39,269
the way in which the camera is getting

712
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:39,269
updated and you can see in here

713
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,440
for update camera for any movement which

714
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:48,909
we were just in you can see in here

715
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,870
where we set up the things that we want

716
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:56,410
to know we actually have like explicit

717
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:59,709
ideas about what we want the focus Minzy

718
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,269
and focus Maxie to be and we know where

719
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:06,069
we think the camera should be and then

720
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:08,679
we had some rather crappy interpolation

721
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:11,678
set up here where we would interpolate

722
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,390
those things and we just did a

723
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,679
proportional derivative controller for

724
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,360
this which i think is the only thing we

725
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,040
really could figure out that would was

726
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:19,479
going to work in a reasonable amount of

727
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:24,639
time that wasn't going to be a huge math

728
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:26,170
adventure and then here all we did at

729
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,610
the end of the stream when we were doing

730
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,590
that is just slapped a proportional

731
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:33,099
derivative controller on that as well

732
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:38,099
the target expected focus values and so

733
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:42,609
the question is is there some way of

734
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:45,159
measuring this so that the Z

735
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:47,199
interpolation of this and the Z

736
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,800
interpolation of these is more

737
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:56,769
commensurate because really what we want

738
00:31:50,799 --> 00:32:01,569
to know there to a large extent is we

739
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:04,240
want to know that our Z clipping values

740
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:07,928
so our Minzy and our maxi for like the

741
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,880
room focus on the enemy focus right we

742
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:16,360
want to know that those values are

743
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:19,960
tracked essentially one to one with the

744
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:23,469
motion of the camera and the problem is

745
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:27,100
we can't necessarily map them directly

746
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:32,019
to the camera because we don't have the

747
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:36,089
requisite information for that at least

748
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:36,089
I don't think we do right

749
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:49,970
meaning because we don't really know

750
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:52,700
exactly what the cameras location like

751
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:55,490
we don't really know where we were

752
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,019
coming from because that's constantly

753
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:01,220
sort of changing in a way it's

754
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:05,480
continuous we don't know how quickly we

755
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:09,710
can set the target expected focus min

756
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:12,950
and Max to be their new values but or

757
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,299
rather the expected focus min and Max we

758
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,840
don't know how quickly we can set them

759
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:19,399
to the target because we don't know how

760
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:21,799
much the camera has to move before those

761
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,950
things are valid right we know how far

762
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:30,430
away we are from it but that's all we

763
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:35,630
know and so I'm not sure how to really

764
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:44,150
measure that right and so that's a

765
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:47,900
little bit tough now there are some

766
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:50,420
things that we do know so we do know for

767
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,220
example we do know if we wanted to make

768
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,420
these things be in line more

769
00:33:52,220 --> 00:34:06,049
appropriately we do know that we could

770
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:12,139
eliminate some parts of the camera in

771
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:15,440
terms of updating these right so if we

772
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:19,449
were to let's say right that we were to

773
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,650
remove the expected focus velocities so

774
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:23,899
what if we just got rid of those

775
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,280
velocities because let's say that we

776
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,380
just don't think we're gonna be able to

777
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,510
quite make these to be harmonious if we

778
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:33,019
constantly have to keep matching their

779
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:35,120
speeds or something right so if we were

780
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:40,460
going to do that then the first thing

781
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:44,509
that we could say here is look if the

782
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:47,599
camera has arrived at its target right

783
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:50,870
which we know is true because you can

784
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,119
see these two cases are different right

785
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:57,139
so here's the one where we stop and we

786
00:34:53,119 --> 00:35:00,679
lock the camera to the target if that's

787
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:04,009
the case then we want in here to have an

788
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:10,069
expected focus min and expected focus

789
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:11,600
max we want those two values to be hard

790
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,940
set there as well right

791
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,940
meaning the target and the expected

792
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,159
should equal each other at the time when

793
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:23,360
the camera comes to rest at the final

794
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:28,429
location right so we kind of know that

795
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:31,849
that that happens right so now the

796
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:36,440
question is kind of like well so if I

797
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:39,049
look here the question is what should I

798
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,710
do about updating these in the case

799
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:47,360
where we haven't done that right so in

800
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:51,829
the case where we're still updating the

801
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:53,870
cameras motion right the cameras Z Delta

802
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:55,039
or whatever else you want to talk about

803
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:58,219
that

804
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:04,429
where I'm moving the camera in Z still

805
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:15,319
potentially I want these to be in

806
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:18,649
operation right and so I kind of want

807
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:23,300
the amount that we update those to be

808
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:26,360
proportional to how far we are from the

809
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:28,940
target in a sense right meaning the

810
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:33,130
update step for the expected minimum

811
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:38,329
maximum values I want that to be

812
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:41,930
commensurate with how far we think we

813
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:45,969
have to go right to get there so what I

814
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:50,119
could do is say what is the proportion

815
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:54,379
in Z in fact you know what I think I can

816
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,969
do this pretty cleanly so what I'm gonna

817
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,890
try to do here is I'm just gonna

818
00:36:55,969 --> 00:37:01,759
mathematically tie these two things

819
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:04,210
together more explicitly we know what

820
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,910
the Delta P value is

821
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:12,970
right and so after this is done like

822
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:17,379
after we take that step we would then

823
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:24,868
know how much of a step we took relative

824
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:28,180
to the the Z value of these two things

825
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:31,690
trying to think of exactly how I suppose

826
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:33,489
I need to actually keep that in place so

827
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:37,929
I'm gonna I guess I will leave it this

828
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:41,229
way um but basically what I want to do

829
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:44,769
here is I want to update these two based

830
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:47,800
on the ratio of their difference so

831
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:50,019
their ratio of their difference to the

832
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:54,250
reach to the step size being taken for

833
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:57,849
the length right so in here I'm going to

834
00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:00,639
take these lengths so I'm gonna probably

835
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:11,289
bite the square root here so I'm gonna

836
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:17,348
say Delta P Len and I'm gonna say total

837
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:19,150
Delta P Len and so here I'm just saying

838
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,609
look this is the length of those two

839
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,818
things I can still say if the Delta P

840
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:28,469
length is less than the total then we'll

841
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:28,469
to do the step otherwise we won't right

842
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:35,108
so that's all good but then what I want

843
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:37,568
to do is in here if we're going to take

844
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:42,159
a step then what I want to do is I want

845
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:46,210
to do the Delta Minzy and the Delta max

846
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:50,440
see I want these to be computed based on

847
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:53,170
that ratio okay so there I've got the

848
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,929
target Minzy that's what I'm trying to

849
00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:01,420
get to I've got the expected focus Minzy

850
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:04,929
so this is the range that I have to

851
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:08,700
cover to get from where I'm at from in

852
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:12,848
focus II to where I want to be right and

853
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:15,279
I can create a ratio between that and

854
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:17,349
the difference between these two right

855
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:22,390
so this is the

856
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:25,420
the length difference right maybe I'll

857
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:28,748
call this the piece ban right and so

858
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:33,959
that's just this is how far I have to

859
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:37,268
cover in terms of my total length right

860
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:42,429
and so the difference between those two

861
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:50,228
amounts of coverage I can use to figure

862
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:51,848
out and how my dress is I know that I

863
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:53,739
have a certain amount of distance to

864
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:56,170
cover to move the camera from one point

865
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:58,478
to another I also know I have a certain

866
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:01,778
amount I want to cover in terms of focus

867
00:39:58,478 --> 00:40:04,389
Minzy maxi I just need to take the Delta

868
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:06,548
I'm doing in one and map it to a Delta

869
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:09,608
in the other so I know they will always

870
00:40:06,548 --> 00:40:10,679
arrive at the same time does that make

871
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:15,670
sense

872
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,058
now all right you know what I take it

873
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:21,449
back

874
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:21,449
I over complicated that in a bad way

875
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:29,440
the focus Minzy and maxi only depend on

876
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,659
camera Z distance so actually we should

877
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,349
only be measuring the Z distance anyway

878
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:37,989
so here technically I can just do Z span

879
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:41,380
instead and what that means is if I take

880
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:44,499
the total Delta P Z that's how far I

881
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:49,239
have to go in Z that's really all I need

882
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:52,689
so then the Delta ratio here so the the

883
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:56,619
amount I'm going to go versus the amount

884
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:59,889
I have to go is just obvious right it's

885
00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:03,969
just that so that tells me how to map

886
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:06,038
from a spacial motion right because it

887
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:08,048
says here is the total spatial distance

888
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:12,339
and here's the distance I'm going to go

889
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:14,409
right I can use that ratio to map things

890
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:16,989
that aren't spatial that we're in the

891
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:20,978
focus Minzy focus Maxie I can use it to

892
00:41:16,989 --> 00:41:23,829
map there Delta's right does that make

893
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:29,228
sense and so setting up the map here if

894
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:30,820
I wanted to know what the if I wanted to

895
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:36,219
know how

896
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:38,530
far to go here I just need to create the

897
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:50,649
spans for each of these so this is the

898
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:52,390
Minzy span right there's the difference

899
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,099
there that's the direction I'm going and

900
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:56,589
that can be negative right that's

901
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:58,360
actually fine because it's allowed to be

902
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,010
negative since we can take steps in a

903
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,240
negative direction so I don't care if

904
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:03,820
there's a sign in there that's totally

905
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:05,589
fine right this will never be negative

906
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,730
because these are lengths so they have

907
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:11,440
to be positive right

908
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:12,670
oh well no that's not true so this

909
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,320
actually needs to be an absolute value

910
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:25,900
because we're checking the Z's directly

911
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:29,740
right yes problem I don't really because

912
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:33,670
that Z will also be going in the same

913
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:36,099
direction so actually I know that those

914
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:39,159
are both the same signs so it'll always

915
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:41,710
cancel that's a little nasty but you see

916
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:43,839
my point right so now what I need to do

917
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:46,300
is just from these two spans I need to

918
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,840
figure out how to produce one of these

919
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:52,570
that like a delta for these so I need

920
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:57,880
the Delta Minzy and the Delta maxi there

921
00:42:52,570 --> 00:43:01,630
right so I just need to be able to do

922
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,210
that mapping so I want something in the

923
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:07,960
focus space here right I want something

924
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:10,750
in focus min space and I have a delta

925
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,179
which is Delta P Z I have that's the

926
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:16,480
amount that I'm actually going in space

927
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:19,269
right so this is the percentage of the

928
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,190
distance I'm going right I'm going this

929
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:25,150
Delta % right I mean you could think of

930
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:27,159
it as this I'm going that much so if I

931
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,349
just take the total amount I have to

932
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:32,920
travel in either of these and multiply

933
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:35,589
it by that value then I will get the

934
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:41,920
amount I should move to make sure that

935
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:43,360
the these two are commensurate right now

936
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,050
I know that's a little Squinkie but you

937
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,910
get my point

938
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:49,630
right

939
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:52,960
so hopefully we can tune that and to get

940
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:55,059
correct Z that updates at the same rate

941
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,690
the cameras updating so we don't have

942
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:58,210
that problem

943
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,940
right and you can see already it cleaned

944
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:03,460
up all of that lag that we were seeing

945
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,990
in the Alpha plane clipping now let's do

946
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,670
the real test let's go down the stairs

947
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:08,108
and make sure that that actually works

948
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,608
because that's the place where the Z

949
00:44:08,108 --> 00:44:16,920
clipping really gets stressed right so

950
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,920
let's say I hop down here beautiful

951
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,900
right um and so again so all I did there

952
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:25,838
right is I just used the math to tie

953
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:32,160
those two values together and you can

954
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:35,259
you can see oh it's just it's just great

955
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:37,269
so that just removes all of that from

956
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,339
from the equip you can see why I

957
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:41,318
preferred that solution right by tying

958
00:44:39,338 --> 00:44:43,779
the interpolations directly together I

959
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:46,059
don't have to fiddle with a bunch of

960
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:49,210
knobs to try and make sure that I got it

961
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,929
right and now it just can't be wrong you

962
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,789
know what I mean

963
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:53,588
because those Z values are locked

964
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,269
together so as long as they're set to

965
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:57,039
reasonable things that their start and

966
00:44:55,269 --> 00:45:01,679
end point I don't have to worry about

967
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:05,259
what they do in between so much right

968
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:07,989
and so that's really yeah so that's

969
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:11,890
really great I'm really happy with that

970
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:13,899
I think that's that's very nice all

971
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:16,719
right so let's move on to other stuff

972
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,700
here here in the second error debug

973
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,159
camera probably wants to be its own day

974
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:27,269
so I'm not going to do debug camera next

975
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:27,269
well maybe whoa what did i do there

976
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:37,619
all right so to be fair maybe this has a

977
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:37,619
bad bug in it somewhere

978
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:45,789
you know what if this Z is zero this

979
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:49,570
would blow up so there is one issue here

980
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:53,489
which is that this code path really

981
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,490
wants to exist right

982
00:45:56,699 --> 00:46:07,750
meaning if these two things if the total

983
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:11,230
Delta P Z is not at least a nominal

984
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:13,150
amount like is if this is going to be

985
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:16,570
some fraction really fractional thing

986
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:18,490
then we just hard set it right because

987
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:21,970
that's a divide there and this value

988
00:46:18,489 --> 00:46:23,739
can't be 0 and it might be so we need to

989
00:46:21,969 --> 00:46:25,089
take precautions when you're going to

990
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:28,000
interpolate from one place to another

991
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:32,350
and the Z's are identical we need to

992
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:38,380
just say ok we just use we pretend we're

993
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:41,769
already at the target right I think

994
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:47,320
that's all correct so looking at these

995
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:50,079
two I want to say this now that it's got

996
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:53,859
that check can also be pulled out so I

997
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,539
think this is also correct meaning we

998
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:58,150
can just always look at the total Delta

999
00:46:55,539 --> 00:47:01,029
P and use that to make our decision

1000
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:04,030
about whether we're going to do either

1001
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:05,500
of the two interpolations and we don't

1002
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,980
need to nest them and that way we don't

1003
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:13,320
need to repeat this case twice so I

1004
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:20,349
think that's just a little cleaner yeah

1005
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:24,240
so I think that's good that seems good

1006
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:24,239
up but no that was not good

1007
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:42,390
Oh helps it that that goes the correct

1008
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:44,699
directions basically I said if it's a

1009
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:49,519
large change don't interpolate it like

1010
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:54,299
okay if their way around their case

1011
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:59,699
alright let's just double-check that we

1012
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:03,320
don't have any issues there just try to

1013
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:03,319
slide it around here a little bit

1014
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:24,748
yes very good positive development

1015
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:35,329
all right so this is feeling great I'm

1016
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:38,348
loving this the camera feels really nice

1017
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:40,668
[Music]

1018
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:41,959
again there's a little wobble in there

1019
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:44,478
that's the thing that I wanted to go

1020
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:49,728
dress now right is that I wanted that

1021
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:53,208
smoothing I don't want it to do that I

1022
00:48:49,728 --> 00:48:56,778
feel like the Z distance is a little

1023
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:58,848
high right now so if you're on this step

1024
00:48:56,778 --> 00:49:03,739
I don't think you should be seeing that

1025
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:07,009
so I feel like the actual clip Z

1026
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:10,039
distance is not quite set correctly so

1027
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:13,748
like in here right where we're setting

1028
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:17,659
these I feel like the alpha distance is

1029
00:49:13,748 --> 00:49:22,688
is probably better set to something a

1030
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:22,689
little lower you know

1031
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:40,259
problem is that's really touchy with how

1032
00:49:38,219 --> 00:49:42,379
far that goes let me see what I think of

1033
00:49:40,259 --> 00:49:42,380
this

1034
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,429
I'll play with this a little bit

1035
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:13,429
so don't really like that much I think

1036
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,739
maybe what I want to do here is say so

1037
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:18,419
when you're on the ground like this the

1038
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:21,329
problem is these things have a Z

1039
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:23,548
variance in them and so as you go up and

1040
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:30,470
down it actually is changing that alpha

1041
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:33,268
clip with every height change there and

1042
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:36,059
so it's a little bit tricky for me to

1043
00:50:33,268 --> 00:50:39,098
think about how that should really go

1044
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:39,099
[Music]

1045
00:50:51,619 --> 00:51:00,159
I don't know

1046
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,750
but I'm tempted to just leave it as it

1047
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:16,340
is because I like the effect and if

1048
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,139
there's occasionally things that sort of

1049
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,150
alpha in or out we could probably do

1050
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:29,079
some clamping where we where we

1051
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:29,079
threshold the alpha values if need be

1052
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:49,150
sorry I'm just trying to observe here I

1053
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:56,140
have nothing to say at the moment

1054
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,139
because I'm watching

1055
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:16,469
yeah so I don't know I think those

1056
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,470
values might be a little better

1057
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:23,559
275 five might be more my preference

1058
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:25,659
it's hard to say let me crank it up to

1059
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:35,500
like 75 and see what I feel like about

1060
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:38,799
that it's a little more gradual maybe

1061
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:44,858
I'll leave it there so 275 75 I think

1062
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:49,890
might be my my sweet spot there in terms

1063
00:52:44,858 --> 00:52:52,900
of like the camera alpha min alpha max

1064
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:59,009
so I might change those we were using

1065
00:52:52,900 --> 00:53:01,030
those I'm going to use 275 and then 75

1066
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,650
just feels a little better and they

1067
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:05,500
don't get some of that ringing so I

1068
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:10,150
think I'm gonna leave it there and that

1069
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:13,239
feels pretty good all right so back to

1070
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,920
our story let's talk about how we're

1071
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:16,838
gonna deal with some of that damping and

1072
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:21,849
some other things that potentially might

1073
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:26,858
want to do so in terms of the sort of

1074
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:28,510
that buoyant motion what I think we want

1075
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:30,519
to do here there's a couple different

1076
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:33,550
things we can do right one is we could

1077
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:36,219
track the player's position separate

1078
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:39,910
from the hopping but the problem with

1079
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:41,709
that is it it will if we go that route

1080
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:43,509
and I sort of talk I talked about this

1081
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:46,900
thing a little bit in the pre stream

1082
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:49,660
when someone asks this question if we

1083
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,568
start adding additional information in

1084
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:55,539
there but like things that are like

1085
00:53:52,568 --> 00:54:00,550
artificial things that tell the camera

1086
00:53:55,539 --> 00:54:01,539
what to do so you know in this case

1087
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:02,920
we're we're saying this is a

1088
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:05,079
conversation here's where you should

1089
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,318
zoom that's a cinematic thing you're

1090
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:10,930
trying to say I'm okay with that trying

1091
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:12,639
to eliminate the hopping the bounce in

1092
00:54:10,929 --> 00:54:14,559
the camera for the hopping by adding

1093
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,598
something that says here's where the

1094
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,078
player actually is ground point is or

1095
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:19,990
whatever

1096
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:21,789
I like that less and the reason is

1097
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:23,919
because then you constantly are creating

1098
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:24,380
these special cases that we're gonna

1099
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,630
have to

1100
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,420
through and deal with separately such as

1101
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,920
hopping down the stairs right we then

1102
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,900
have to say okay do we just like

1103
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,240
linearly move the player or what if

1104
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:39,139
there's like some crazy like things that

1105
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:42,258
can hop on height-wise in here or

1106
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:48,528
whatever and so I just I really feel

1107
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:52,039
like I don't want that I don't really

1108
00:54:48,528 --> 00:54:54,349
want to have this problem of having to

1109
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:56,650
constantly have an out-of-band

1110
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:59,420
communication channel to the camera

1111
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,019
that's gonna be something I have to

1112
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,259
worry about

1113
00:55:00,018 --> 00:55:04,939
so what I'd rather do is first and if we

1114
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:06,858
have to do it I'm fine with that meaning

1115
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,440
if we end up having to do it that's okay

1116
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:11,389
if I can't solve a problem in the way

1117
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,829
that I would like I'm okay with solving

1118
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:14,900
it in the problem way that I wouldn't

1119
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:18,619
like right I mean I'll do what I have to

1120
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:22,220
do to get it to work okay but first I

1121
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:24,858
would rather see if I can make a filter

1122
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:27,618
that just only looks at the Claire's

1123
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:30,739
actual position and then comes up with

1124
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:34,700
the answer with nothing but that you

1125
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:36,278
know what I mean so that's what I'm

1126
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:39,368
gonna what I would like to try and do

1127
00:55:36,278 --> 00:55:42,679
now we're losing some frames here what

1128
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:44,480
who's of course it's just compute light

1129
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:47,750
propagation it's always just compute

1130
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,159
light propagation we gotta we gotta come

1131
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:53,179
up with the world's fastest lighting

1132
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:58,868
algorithm look at that takes all our

1133
00:55:53,179 --> 00:56:02,358
time look at that look at this look look

1134
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:08,108
at how much lighting we're doing it's

1135
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:13,699
nuts we'll figure it out don't worry

1136
00:56:08,108 --> 00:56:16,969
don't you worry we'll figure it out uh

1137
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:19,969
so anyway yeah let's go ahead and think

1138
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:21,679
through this some more and and see if we

1139
00:56:19,969 --> 00:56:23,750
can't come up with a filter that will

1140
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,828
just work and that way we can just be

1141
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,239
done with it and we don't have to

1142
00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:27,859
constantly be feeding all these little

1143
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,328
bread crumbs to the camera code be like

1144
00:56:27,858 --> 00:56:30,528
hey by the way don't really follow this

1145
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:33,289
motion because it's not important and

1146
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:34,880
all the other stuff so if we wanted to

1147
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:37,509
look at the filt filtering that we could

1148
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,509
do here

1149
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:43,519
what I might suggest is saying well

1150
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:46,639
first thing we can do is we don't really

1151
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,340
have to update the location of the

1152
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,369
camera if the player isn't too far from

1153
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:54,230
where it would have been already right

1154
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:57,679
so one thing we can do is sort of have a

1155
00:56:54,230 --> 00:57:01,010
camera mode like we could say what's the

1156
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:03,949
camera doing right now and we could say

1157
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:06,680
well if the camera is has come to rest

1158
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:09,469
we just won't move the camera unless the

1159
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:11,299
player has hopped outside of the unless

1160
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:13,969
the target has moved sufficiently since

1161
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:16,760
then right so that's one thing we could

1162
00:57:13,969 --> 00:57:21,259
do and that would be if we wanted to

1163
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:24,050
make it so that for example let's say

1164
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:28,940
you're in here you know and I'm fighting

1165
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:30,650
some some bad guy and I'm like hopping

1166
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,019
back and forth here to see how the

1167
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:34,880
cameras like moving like back and forth

1168
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:36,530
just kind of back and forth even though

1169
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,110
I'm will be staying within a very small

1170
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:41,269
area so one thing we might want to do

1171
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:43,880
there to avoid this kind of repetitive

1172
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:45,949
camera motion is just say look if I'm

1173
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,900
not far enough away from where the

1174
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:51,699
camera already is just don't worry about

1175
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:54,680
it right so only kick in the camera

1176
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:58,279
acceleration when we actually have come

1177
00:57:54,679 --> 00:58:00,379
a certain distance from where we look

1178
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,760
where we last position of the camera

1179
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:07,280
right so that's one of them and then for

1180
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,170
the hopping that would mean that the

1181
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:15,680
hopping here where we're doing this

1182
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:18,650
right we can keep that state separate

1183
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,079
meaning the X the Y and the Z states can

1184
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:24,920
all be a separate state so that will

1185
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:28,340
only update those states when they each

1186
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:34,430
have gone a certain amount out of the

1187
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:36,789
way and that would keep us from that

1188
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:40,669
would keep us from moving the camera for

1189
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:44,509
unnecessarily small adjustments if that

1190
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:49,030
makes sense and soo what I'm gonna do

1191
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:49,030
there is I'm essentially going to have a

1192
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:57,548
lack of a better term a camera movement

1193
00:58:53,768 --> 00:59:00,008
mask might be the way to say it and the

1194
00:58:57,548 --> 00:59:01,989
way this is going to work is the camera

1195
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:03,969
code which is this and by the way we

1196
00:59:01,989 --> 00:59:06,210
should probably make a camera file at

1197
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:08,700
this point because it's it's own thing

1198
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:12,130
could move like now that this code is

1199
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:14,558
fairly real we could just pull it out

1200
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:17,170
into a separate place where it does its

1201
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:21,940
own thing but you know not super

1202
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:24,489
motivated to do it so maybe I won't I'm

1203
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:27,818
gonna have a movement mask here and that

1204
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:30,728
movement mask is going to initialize to

1205
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:34,449
zero zero zero and what's going to

1206
00:59:30,728 --> 00:59:37,899
happen is every time I go to compute a

1207
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:41,498
camera DP instead of actually applying

1208
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:44,710
the camera DP I'm going to mask the

1209
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:50,889
camera DP by the movement mask value

1210
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:53,318
right and so when I take this stuff here

1211
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:56,949
and I look at like the total Delta P I'm

1212
00:59:53,318 --> 00:59:59,199
going to say total Delta P equals the

1213
00:59:56,949 --> 01:00:02,259
hat amount product of the total Delta P

1214
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,838
times the movement mask and remember the

1215
01:00:02,259 --> 01:00:06,519
Hadamard product is just the

1216
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:10,358
component-wise product x times X Y times

1217
01:00:06,518 --> 01:00:12,639
y C times Z so if the movement mask is

1218
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:14,348
all zeros you will never register a

1219
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,868
camera movement so if I run this right

1220
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:21,430
now the camera just won't move right

1221
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:22,660
it's not gonna go anywhere so we won't

1222
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:25,298
even be able to start the game

1223
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:28,420
it'll just be frozen in its tracks right

1224
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:29,858
we'll just see a blank screen oh well

1225
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,099
maybe not I guess we came to the first

1226
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:32,098
one

1227
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:40,920
alright I'll be honest I have no idea

1228
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,920
how that's working

1229
01:00:52,719 --> 01:01:04,879
nevermind so we're not actually using

1230
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:11,780
this value because reasons I guess you

1231
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:14,869
can see we never use it all right this

1232
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:17,200
is supposed to be in here and we didn't

1233
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:17,199
do that

1234
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:26,389
and so yeah I don't know what the deal

1235
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:41,090
was there um so here we need total Delta

1236
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:43,039
DP as well right and so this this value

1237
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:51,829
also needs to get modified by that even

1238
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:54,889
though it's not something that ever

1239
01:01:51,829 --> 01:02:00,380
equals anything other than zero at the

1240
01:01:54,889 --> 01:02:01,789
moment let's try that again although it

1241
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:06,890
seemed like we're still getting motion

1242
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:08,119
from one from zero zero III I think I'm

1243
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,909
still missing something because we

1244
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:12,949
shouldn't be able to move at all

1245
01:02:09,909 --> 01:02:18,369
if the total Delta P and the total Delta

1246
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:18,369
DP are both zeroed out because

1247
01:02:23,059 --> 01:02:33,110
oh well now I think about it this will

1248
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:36,019
always execute so we need to rewrite

1249
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:51,070
this as well so this also needs to be

1250
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:59,719
this right because if we don't do that

1251
01:02:51,070 --> 01:03:03,160
then we will never actually get if we

1252
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:07,219
don't do that then we'll never actually

1253
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:09,500
use this condition will always hit

1254
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:12,079
because if these of both are both zero

1255
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:14,300
we will never use the interior loop we

1256
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,599
will always use the exterior so we need

1257
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:19,970
to actually use the Delta which has been

1258
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,619
zeroed out in this case there's other

1259
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:24,589
things I could do there but that

1260
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:26,480
probably is the easiest and so now we're

1261
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:31,519
get what I expected to have happen which

1262
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:33,920
is we don't see anything right okay so

1263
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,900
now what I want to do is say all right

1264
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,639
the camera movement mask is going to be

1265
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:41,000
based on the difference between these

1266
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:44,440
two things and so we're only going to

1267
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:49,280
set these in very careful circumstances

1268
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:55,789
if the camera comes to rest so if it

1269
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:58,220
comes to rest in you know here then the

1270
01:03:55,789 --> 01:04:00,259
movement mask is going to reset to zero

1271
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:05,389
zero zero so that it has no movement

1272
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:08,480
right we're gonna check each element

1273
01:04:05,389 --> 01:04:13,190
here and we're gonna check each element

1274
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,750
in turn for its motion and if it's large

1275
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:20,150
enough we're gonna set the movement mask

1276
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:21,260
up for that element so each of these and

1277
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,820
I'm not going to bother with the floral

1278
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:25,670
loop because it would be longer to right

1279
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:28,700
than the actual thing basically if the

1280
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:33,500
total Delta P for whatever this thing is

1281
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:37,719
right it's the total Delta P for this

1282
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,719
thing is greater

1283
01:04:40,358 --> 01:04:54,139
then our movement threshold for that

1284
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:57,259
axis there we go

1285
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:59,000
Wow spelling day if it's greater than

1286
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:03,680
the threshold then the mask is one

1287
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,969
otherwise at zero right another way to

1288
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:11,358
say that oh well that's not actually

1289
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:13,459
what I want I I only I don't want to set

1290
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:21,920
it back to zero so I really just want to

1291
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:24,199
do this meaning if the movement exceeds

1292
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,750
our movement threshold and I'll what the

1293
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:29,750
heck I'll make that be per element so we

1294
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:31,639
can actually set the threshold to three

1295
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:34,010
different values if you want so for

1296
01:05:31,639 --> 01:05:36,500
example maybe the threshold is you know

1297
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:40,060
a four wide box this way but it's only a

1298
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:43,130
one wide box in Z or something right

1299
01:05:40,059 --> 01:05:46,070
who knows how we want that done but

1300
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:48,800
basically that means look if the

1301
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:51,800
threshold is exceeded then we turn on

1302
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:55,310
camera motion in that axis if the

1303
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:58,130
threshold isn't exceeded we don't we

1304
01:05:55,309 --> 01:06:02,599
turn the entire camera movement off when

1305
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:05,200
we arrive at our target right pretty

1306
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:05,200
straightforward

1307
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:22,880
so let's debug that yeah

1308
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:25,240
that's not right because that has to go

1309
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,240
there

1310
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,730
let's try it one more time

1311
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,240
there we go

1312
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:40,930
and so now as we move from room to room

1313
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:42,429
obviously we're not going to see you

1314
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:45,250
know unless I screwed something up which

1315
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:47,500
could have easily happened we're not

1316
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:49,929
gonna see any really weird stuff

1317
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:53,409
happened there because the camera was

1318
01:06:49,929 --> 01:06:56,919
locked per room here but we should see

1319
01:06:53,409 --> 01:07:00,190
stuff happen in other locations if we

1320
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,720
you know if we did this right and I can

1321
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:05,289
already tell I didn't quite do it right

1322
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:07,269
because you notice that oh well there it

1323
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:09,449
is so maybe I just need that region to

1324
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:13,588
be larger

1325
01:07:09,449 --> 01:07:17,108
let's try setting this to maybe like

1326
01:07:13,588 --> 01:07:26,980
something like 10 that way and 8 this

1327
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:28,759
way I don't know what Z should be so

1328
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,030
that's a little bit more like it

1329
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,790
[Music]

1330
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:34,380
of course that's now a little too

1331
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:37,498
permissive

1332
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:37,499
[Music]

1333
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,889
and you can see it's still doing the Bob

1334
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:07,909
there and I assume that's because the Z

1335
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:08,769
needs to be a larger threshold there we

1336
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:11,719
go

1337
01:08:08,769 --> 01:08:14,360
so now it's just it lets us say stable

1338
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:18,380
there it still seems like the Y is maybe

1339
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:22,690
larger so why that wasn't working why is

1340
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:22,690
for too little but six is not

1341
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:32,989
something's a little something is a

1342
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,150
little weird here so I think I've got

1343
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:37,609
something weird

1344
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:40,189
maybe that I'd not quite understanding

1345
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:42,319
about the way that code ended up falling

1346
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:47,469
out there because something's weird

1347
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:47,469
about those settings they seem to be off

1348
01:08:57,939 --> 01:09:06,358
I can't quite see anything though

1349
01:09:12,048 --> 01:09:19,548
I don't I unfortunately I don't really

1350
01:09:15,048 --> 01:09:25,909
see what's off do you see how dramatic

1351
01:09:19,548 --> 01:09:26,778
that difference is it just seems like

1352
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:29,000
that

1353
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:33,950
difference should be less and that's

1354
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:36,079
trigger in my my spidey sense there I

1355
01:09:33,949 --> 01:09:39,260
don't really have a spidey sense but

1356
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:41,689
that seems wrong so I think I'm doing

1357
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:44,750
something wrong but I'm not sure exactly

1358
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:46,759
what it is and so that total Delta

1359
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:51,619
p-value there where we subtract the

1360
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:53,989
target that we're going to minus the

1361
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:57,109
location that we're currently at that

1362
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:59,239
doesn't seem to really be doing what I

1363
01:09:57,109 --> 01:10:03,289
think it should be doing and so

1364
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:05,630
something is up with that code but I

1365
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:16,010
don't know what and it just seems like

1366
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:23,900
that threshold seems like that threshold

1367
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:25,640
is weird do we have so we don't have a

1368
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:26,750
just a general root debug we're gonna

1369
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,300
have to add that because I'd like to

1370
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:31,850
view this value so I would like to have

1371
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:34,430
our little route back again although I

1372
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:35,990
suppose for camera it's pretty easy for

1373
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:40,360
me to draw that actually under the

1374
01:10:35,989 --> 01:10:43,429
camera stuff at the moment but yeah

1375
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:45,139
whatevs so you can see the thing that

1376
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:47,030
I'm having trouble with tears I want to

1377
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,470
know why these threshold values seem to

1378
01:10:47,029 --> 01:10:50,539
not be behaving the way I would expect

1379
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:52,369
and you can see that actually very

1380
01:10:50,539 --> 01:11:00,170
clearly even in the first hallway it

1381
01:10:52,369 --> 01:11:03,460
seems so you'll notice there's no

1382
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:07,819
scrolling for all of that hopping and

1383
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:12,529
now inside the threshold if I was to

1384
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:14,569
change this down to 6 it should be like

1385
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:18,099
if it was 8 squares before it'd be 6

1386
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:18,099
squares now right

1387
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:24,529
and yet I don't see any difference there

1388
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,560
that's just so bizarre

1389
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:10,909
although I guess maybe this room was

1390
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,909
always supposed to Center anyway

1391
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:35,759
so honestly what it feels like is

1392
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:46,010
happening is it feels like we're setting

1393
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:46,010
the movement masks to zero prematurely

1394
01:12:53,500 --> 01:13:00,229
which I suppose is something that could

1395
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:08,770
happen maybe if the length of the total

1396
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:08,769
Delta P I just I don't see it

1397
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:21,920
I mean correct me if I'm wrong the

1398
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:24,110
movement masks once set cannot become

1399
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:37,130
unset until the camera reaches the

1400
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:40,329
target right I don't see a lot of ways

1401
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:40,329
that that is

1402
01:13:50,579 --> 01:13:57,579
yeah I I don't really see a lot of ways

1403
01:13:54,369 --> 01:14:09,849
that that is able to be circumvented

1404
01:13:57,579 --> 01:14:14,890
here and I suppose this that code is a

1405
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:17,520
little Squinkie but I still think it's

1406
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,520
correct

1407
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:33,360
hmm all right so I don't have any good

1408
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,909
ideas here I don't I can't really find

1409
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:38,458
the bug by inspection so I'm gonna go

1410
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:40,279
ahead and actually get these values

1411
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:46,639
debugged

1412
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:49,978
so you know if I look at our rendering

1413
01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:54,868
dump here I think I should be able to

1414
01:14:49,979 --> 01:14:58,650
like put some camera readout stuff in

1415
01:14:54,868 --> 01:15:03,630
there and just kind of get a little more

1416
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:06,388
information about that I can just see

1417
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:08,429
stuff is doing weird I'm obviously just

1418
01:15:06,389 --> 01:15:10,409
maybe I've got a typo or maybe I was

1419
01:15:08,429 --> 01:15:13,859
thinking this through wrong because

1420
01:15:10,408 --> 01:15:15,929
that's you know entirely possible so I

1421
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:17,969
want to see what's going on and even

1422
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:20,550
just ignoring this code down here right

1423
01:15:17,969 --> 01:15:22,260
I want to know why I'm getting this sort

1424
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,550
of weird where are these thresholds

1425
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:26,340
don't seem to be lining up with what I

1426
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:28,889
my intuition is so what I'd like to do

1427
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:33,208
is I'd like to draw the camera mask

1428
01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:38,849
right so I'd like to do a debug value of

1429
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:48,149
the camera movement mask and I will put

1430
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:51,090
that in a block under the render or just

1431
01:15:48,149 --> 01:15:53,399
so that we know that it goes there and

1432
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:59,029
so I want to get the movement mask and I

1433
01:15:53,399 --> 01:16:04,828
want that Toto Delta P I want that to be

1434
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:07,800
displayed here and I want to see what

1435
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:11,880
the movement mask is at any given time

1436
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:14,070
just just so I have some idea of what

1437
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:17,118
you know what while we're at it like why

1438
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:20,639
don't we just see the P and the target P

1439
01:16:17,118 --> 01:16:24,418
as well just so I can get some idea of

1440
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:29,519
you know what those values actually end

1441
01:16:24,418 --> 01:16:32,668
up being so if I restart this I don't

1442
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:34,289
know if I don't know if we had some

1443
01:16:32,668 --> 01:16:37,939
weirdness there let me see where his

1444
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:37,938
renderer there we go

1445
01:16:41,429 --> 01:16:52,359
so just looking at those right I mean

1446
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:55,389
it's already wrong but the why is wrong

1447
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:57,639
it should the the total Delta P should

1448
01:16:55,389 --> 01:17:04,630
be trimming that I'm doing an absolute

1449
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:10,480
value right so shouldn't that trigger

1450
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:12,368
the movement mask to be set up to one is

1451
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:16,379
there something wrong with the way I'm

1452
01:17:12,368 --> 01:17:16,380
doing the absolute value or something

1453
01:17:41,719 --> 01:17:58,859
let me get the post version of this as

1454
01:17:45,510 --> 01:18:03,539
well so I don't actually know how to

1455
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:04,859
make a second one of these in the debug

1456
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:06,600
interface I can't remember if we can

1457
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:13,589
just print something out in multiple

1458
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:16,260
steps that's kind of not something I

1459
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:20,029
actually know about so in here where

1460
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:23,369
we've got like debug value and we pass

1461
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:25,710
the value it always produces this name

1462
01:18:23,368 --> 01:18:26,908
it looks like that name though gets

1463
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:28,500
concatenate with a file on line number

1464
01:18:26,908 --> 01:18:30,779
so I think it's actually different so I

1465
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:32,988
think I can just I think I can just do

1466
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:32,988
this

1467
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:45,000
furthermore I could do this I think in

1468
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:47,279
which case our debug system should give

1469
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:57,179
me two separate readouts one for pre and

1470
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:59,479
one for post yeah and so the total Delta

1471
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:02,010
P here you can see it's negative for

1472
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:05,959
right

1473
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:11,639
oh and I guess the threshold is 6 okay

1474
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:14,270
all right Touche so let's say this was

1475
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:16,650
more what I would have expected it to be

1476
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:23,880
well let's say I move into like here or

1477
01:19:16,649 --> 01:19:31,759
something right so the total Delta P in

1478
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:31,760
this case it's saying is 2.6

1479
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:39,989
and that's just not enough to trigger

1480
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:43,108
the motion and you know you're right

1481
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:43,108
[Music]

1482
01:19:59,948 --> 01:20:05,638
you can kind of see - like the sense the

1483
01:20:02,288 --> 01:20:05,639
Z's are wrong there

1484
01:20:16,448 --> 01:20:20,439
it just gets cold set

1485
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:37,069
so these kind of have to be more

1486
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:38,510
sensitive than that which is a bummer

1487
01:20:37,069 --> 01:20:40,750
because it means the hopping is still a

1488
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:40,750
problem

1489
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:56,720
all right

1490
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,910
so one of the things I guess I'm seeing

1491
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:11,420
there is that the trigger for the motion

1492
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:13,949
of the camera gosh I'm really confused

1493
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:16,560
the trigger for the motion of the camera

1494
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:24,210
once the camera has come to rest it

1495
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:28,620
might be more that this this value

1496
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:32,340
vanishes too slowly so that this here is

1497
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:35,189
maybe not the right way to look at it it

1498
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:37,909
may be that this Delta P needs to be

1499
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:40,559
able to hit its target a little faster

1500
01:21:37,909 --> 01:21:46,319
so like the damping there needs to be

1501
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:52,020
less or something like this so that's

1502
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:54,210
kind of hard to say but I guess the

1503
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:55,320
problem is that once the camera gets in

1504
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:57,449
motion

1505
01:21:55,319 --> 01:22:00,449
sometimes it just stays in motion for a

1506
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:02,220
while like in and possibly erroneously

1507
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:04,380
and that may have been something sort of

1508
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:06,840
what I was seeing in terms of when that

1509
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:09,510
camera mass like even though that looks

1510
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:13,020
like it's come to rest it hasn't

1511
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:14,760
actually you can see that camera mass

1512
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:17,730
doesn't get reset for a while right

1513
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:22,140
watch this value here as I'm hopping

1514
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:24,089
around you can see like if I do that it

1515
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:26,010
takes a really long time for that to

1516
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:30,180
actually come back down to being set to

1517
01:22:26,010 --> 01:22:34,980
zero and so I think you know we actually

1518
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:38,070
want this to we want that to have a more

1519
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:41,669
definitive finish point that sucks up

1520
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:44,340
that small motion and so I think what

1521
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:48,750
we'd want to do here is say maybe

1522
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:51,000
there's like a a sort of either/or where

1523
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:55,739
we're basically saying look if you're

1524
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,750
gonna reach the target great that's one

1525
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:59,939
way to stop the motion the other way to

1526
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:04,829
stop the motion is if the length squared

1527
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:10,319
of the Delta P is just too low right

1528
01:23:04,829 --> 01:23:13,710
like if it's just if it's just smaller

1529
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:14,340
than some relative displacement we just

1530
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:17,340
don't want it

1531
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:19,319
with anymore and we could do that for

1532
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:29,640
setting the camera mask separately I

1533
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:31,170
don't know how we want do that I also

1534
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,690
don't really know what's going on with

1535
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:39,630
that camera position you can see it's

1536
01:23:33,689 --> 01:23:41,519
still interpolating I don't know right

1537
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:45,590
you can notice the camera value itself

1538
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,590
is actually interpolating

1539
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:10,869
and that's super-creepy that's the the

1540
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:12,400
actual p-value the the actual position

1541
01:24:10,869 --> 01:24:14,789
value that the camera is supposed to be

1542
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,789
set to

1543
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:29,449
and you can see here the camera movement

1544
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:31,880
mask is set to one one one even though

1545
01:24:29,449 --> 01:24:34,149
it clearly should be set to all zeroes

1546
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,150
right

1547
01:24:41,298 --> 01:24:48,979
meaning this total delta p the absolute

1548
01:24:44,689 --> 01:24:53,409
value of total Delta P in this case is

1549
01:24:48,979 --> 01:24:56,059
is clearly not above the threshold so

1550
01:24:53,408 --> 01:25:00,068
we're talking about whether this ever

1551
01:24:56,059 --> 01:25:01,569
got called and apparently it just didn't

1552
01:25:00,069 --> 01:25:06,039
meaning

1553
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:06,039
apparently the length squared of Delta P

1554
01:25:06,578 --> 01:25:11,978
is not less than this

1555
01:25:27,869 --> 01:25:31,989
we're in la-la land so I've got a bug in

1556
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:33,250
here somewhere that I'm just not seeing

1557
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:34,210
because that just don't make any sense

1558
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:39,659
at all right

1559
01:25:34,210 --> 01:25:39,659
here's Delta P let's get that in there

1560
01:25:41,939 --> 01:25:50,289
we're gonna have to restart because

1561
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:52,450
these aren't stable yeah I mean that's

1562
01:25:50,289 --> 01:25:54,550
the length squared of that is definitely

1563
01:25:52,449 --> 01:25:59,289
I mean it's definitely set to those

1564
01:25:54,550 --> 01:26:02,890
values so how is that how is this not

1565
01:25:59,289 --> 01:26:05,710
getting triggered if the length of Delta

1566
01:26:02,890 --> 01:26:09,400
P is less than the length of the total

1567
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:18,869
Delta or the length of Delta P is less

1568
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:18,869
than this Oh again

1569
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:30,900
so what we really want to do is that I

1570
01:26:28,189 --> 01:26:32,579
mixed up those two cases I should

1571
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:34,769
probably move this up into the top case

1572
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:39,119
because it's sort of the way I obviously

1573
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:44,250
was thinking about it okay now let's try

1574
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:45,930
to figure out what's going on here all

1575
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:48,739
right so now we have to figure out what

1576
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:52,770
this value should be right

1577
01:26:48,739 --> 01:26:53,880
oops that's not wanted so now we have to

1578
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:57,210
figure out what this movement value

1579
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:58,590
should be and it's basically like if the

1580
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:01,829
amount that you were going to move is

1581
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:05,449
just too small for us to really see and

1582
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:05,449
I should probably make that be

1583
01:27:05,899 --> 01:27:14,399
proportional to the time step so meaning

1584
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,890
that should vary according to the time

1585
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:20,210
step and so if you were going to move

1586
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:23,369
slower than something right like maybe

1587
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:27,470
0.1 units per second then it's just it's

1588
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:27,470
done don't move it all right

1589
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:55,948
we're still getting some wonkiness of

1590
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,949
there

1591
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:05,890
you can sort of see where that hits in I

1592
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:08,019
don't know if also maybe I don't know if

1593
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:10,210
I really want this check per se or if I

1594
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:12,790
just want to make sure that the camera

1595
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:15,220
motion like I may want to instead just

1596
01:28:12,789 --> 01:28:16,899
say look we can keep this check we just

1597
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:19,510
have to get rid of some of that damping

1598
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:20,949
so maybe this value is like just too

1599
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:23,820
high

1600
01:28:20,949 --> 01:28:26,289
so we don't really want to damp that

1601
01:28:23,819 --> 01:28:29,920
deceleration quite so gentle like we

1602
01:28:26,289 --> 01:28:37,380
want it to be pretty dramatic you know

1603
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:37,380
what I mean that's a little bit too much

1604
01:29:03,329 --> 01:29:07,199
so I'm not sure about this it's been

1605
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,630
pretty Squinkie and I don't love things

1606
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:12,059
that feel Squinkie like that and you can

1607
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:14,190
see that that's still not critically

1608
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:16,320
damped like we're definitely getting

1609
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:18,899
overshoot in there in that in the

1610
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:21,710
proportional derivative controller which

1611
01:29:18,899 --> 01:29:21,710
I definitely don't want

1612
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:33,630
right you see a lot of that

1613
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,819
yes still not

1614
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:06,310
still getting overshoot there too

1615
01:30:15,729 --> 01:30:19,209
so I don't know

1616
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:30,149
that feels better

1617
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:40,750
that feels pretty good now that we've

1618
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:47,500
just cranked that spring a little bit so

1619
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:48,880
that it doesn't quite have like that's

1620
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,229
feeling pretty good so it may need to

1621
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,199
spin that our spring was a little bit

1622
01:30:50,229 --> 01:30:55,959
was too damped so it just wouldn't ever

1623
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:58,170
really get down to it wouldn't really

1624
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:03,480
approach the target it was kind of like

1625
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:03,480
over damped so it always had a bad curve

1626
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:09,460
you can see right there like I'm getting

1627
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,259
that bounce and the reason I'm getting

1628
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:13,060
that bounce is because it still takes a

1629
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:16,420
little too long so it's it's still

1630
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:19,720
that's a little too damp it's not

1631
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:22,060
hitting the target that's you know so

1632
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:27,000
once I get into a movement zone I need

1633
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:27,000
it to like stop you know

1634
01:31:42,609 --> 01:31:47,109
just trying to confuse it here to see

1635
01:31:44,659 --> 01:31:47,109
what happens

1636
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:05,399
so another thing we could consider is we

1637
01:32:03,448 --> 01:32:08,819
could also consider having the movement

1638
01:32:05,399 --> 01:32:10,379
mask be signed meaning we won't start

1639
01:32:08,819 --> 01:32:12,509
going in a direction until you get too

1640
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:14,400
far in that direction cuz right now once

1641
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:17,010
I've got it going I can kind of go back

1642
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,960
and forth like this and it will just

1643
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:21,719
keep and until I actually until it

1644
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:26,760
actually hits a solid state it won't

1645
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:30,800
actually stop right and so that part is

1646
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:30,800
a little possibly bad

1647
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:19,340
sooo here's the thing that I think I

1648
01:33:16,139 --> 01:33:22,828
might propose thinking this through I

1649
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:28,889
think this might be the wrong way to

1650
01:33:22,828 --> 01:33:32,609
look at this so maybe what we want to

1651
01:33:28,889 --> 01:33:36,659
say here is we also want to look at the

1652
01:33:32,609 --> 01:33:40,259
speed because that also has to match so

1653
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:45,388
we may want to say look if the length

1654
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:50,119
squared is wrong or that if the length

1655
01:33:45,389 --> 01:33:50,118
squared of the velocity

1656
01:34:11,409 --> 01:34:16,479
because here's this part where we've

1657
01:34:13,539 --> 01:34:18,399
created the new velocity and so if I'm

1658
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:21,639
gonna look at the new velocity and I

1659
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:26,109
want to see like what the new velocity

1660
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:34,780
would be you know relative to the old

1661
01:34:26,109 --> 01:34:36,489
one their relative to the target I might

1662
01:34:34,779 --> 01:34:41,649
want to sort of get that measure it

1663
01:34:36,489 --> 01:34:44,380
again as well so you know if if this or

1664
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:48,849
I should say that if if what we're gonna

1665
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:51,880
set the velocity to and I can do that by

1666
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:55,000
the camera movement mask as well if what

1667
01:34:51,880 --> 01:35:01,930
we're gonna set the velocity to

1668
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:12,060
is less than if that difference is less

1669
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:12,060
than some threshold

1670
01:35:21,738 --> 01:35:29,638
right and the reason I'm saying that is

1671
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:31,710
because one of the problems that I'm

1672
01:35:29,639 --> 01:35:33,840
gonna have is that if you happen to

1673
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:35,908
camera was moving pretty fast in this

1674
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,828
direction and then the player was

1675
01:35:35,908 --> 01:35:38,339
hopping pretty fast in the opposite

1676
01:35:37,828 --> 01:35:40,979
direction

1677
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:42,929
they might just happen to align and the

1678
01:35:40,979 --> 01:35:43,529
camera would just freeze dead in its

1679
01:35:42,929 --> 01:35:46,590
tracks

1680
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:49,380
you know what I mean and that's not

1681
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:52,440
gonna feel good so I think we also have

1682
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:55,440
to check to make sure that the camera

1683
01:35:52,439 --> 01:35:58,198
itself is not moving too quickly

1684
01:35:55,439 --> 01:36:00,538
because if it is you don't want to stop

1685
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:05,488
it right I never want to have that

1686
01:36:00,538 --> 01:36:07,078
feeling of the camera hitting a wall and

1687
01:36:05,488 --> 01:36:14,189
I'm still kind of getting that feeling

1688
01:36:07,078 --> 01:36:16,170
here occasionally let me just see I

1689
01:36:14,189 --> 01:36:18,768
don't know if this value might be a

1690
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,769
little high

1691
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:33,079
and so I kind of just want to try to

1692
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:34,940
alleviate that wall hitting feeling so

1693
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:37,369
when the cameras in motion it can stay

1694
01:36:34,939 --> 01:36:39,289
moving but once it stops it won't start

1695
01:36:37,369 --> 01:36:50,809
again until you've got a pretty good

1696
01:36:39,289 --> 01:36:53,979
push you know what I mean you can see

1697
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:53,980
the cameras are drifting

1698
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:19,808
I think I will set that cold here

1699
01:37:23,658 --> 01:37:28,109
so I think we can do a better job on

1700
01:37:25,889 --> 01:37:29,699
this than what I've done so far having

1701
01:37:28,109 --> 01:37:32,339
explored it I think I can do another

1702
01:37:29,698 --> 01:37:35,279
pass on that maybe next stream we're

1703
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:44,369
close it's just that needs to be thought

1704
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:45,658
through just a little bit more and you

1705
01:37:44,368 --> 01:37:47,908
also get some of these things where like

1706
01:37:45,658 --> 01:37:50,158
we kind of need to know that the camera

1707
01:37:47,908 --> 01:37:51,569
movement masks in certain cases like

1708
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:53,248
there it's just saying well that's not

1709
01:37:51,569 --> 01:37:57,179
far enough for me to care about right

1710
01:37:53,248 --> 01:38:01,139
but that has to be so in some sense you

1711
01:37:57,179 --> 01:38:02,729
know you got a set when you set the

1712
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:05,909
focus we may have to set the camera

1713
01:38:02,729 --> 01:38:08,010
movement mask up so for example like in

1714
01:38:05,908 --> 01:38:11,219
the case where we have a special camera

1715
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:14,909
and the special camera is affecting the

1716
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:17,399
X Y offset or the Z we may need to say

1717
01:38:14,908 --> 01:38:20,038
look in a special camera scenario you

1718
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:28,228
got a one one one that you know what I

1719
01:38:20,038 --> 01:38:30,268
mean so the movement mask is

1720
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:34,550
automatically set for something where we

1721
01:38:30,269 --> 01:38:34,550
know we got to zoom in right

1722
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:49,329
it does not like the overlay window

1723
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:01,539
so yeah I think there's I think we want

1724
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:04,779
to maybe on Tang it a little bit I'm

1725
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:07,750
gonna do that next stream though because

1726
01:39:04,779 --> 01:39:11,460
I would like to make that a little bit

1727
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:16,988
it's just not quite there yet it's close

1728
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:18,460
but it's not quite there yet and so I

1729
01:39:16,988 --> 01:39:20,348
want to just go through now that we've

1730
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:21,819
got that code in there I want to go

1731
01:39:20,349 --> 01:39:25,510
through and give it a little bit more

1732
01:39:21,819 --> 01:39:28,179
polish it's very close it feels really

1733
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:31,750
good it's just I can still feel a little

1734
01:39:28,179 --> 01:39:35,529
bit of hitches in some cases a little

1735
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:37,420
bit of overshoot and stuff in there so I

1736
01:39:35,529 --> 01:39:40,509
think we can do better than what we've

1737
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:43,658
got and so we'll we'll take a look at

1738
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:50,980
that on next stream for now I think

1739
01:39:43,658 --> 01:39:53,519
that's good for today let's go ahead and

1740
01:39:50,979 --> 01:39:53,519
go to the QA

1741
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:03,880
see oops that's not how you spell kiwi

1742
01:40:01,069 --> 01:40:03,880
neck there we go

1743
01:40:26,489 --> 01:40:31,579
should probably do the work to make sure

1744
01:40:28,529 --> 01:40:33,989
the glove floats around with you

1745
01:40:31,579 --> 01:40:35,250
it's kind of been annoying having it not

1746
01:40:33,989 --> 01:40:37,229
float around with you we haven't really

1747
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:50,810
done that yet but like for some reason

1748
01:40:37,229 --> 01:40:50,809
we just have not done that yet I mean

1749
01:41:06,119 --> 01:41:27,559
I don't really want to do this at the

1750
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:27,560
moment but I think it's just this

1751
01:41:53,698 --> 01:42:18,129
right do I need to set that I'm not sure

1752
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:21,539
why that's not consistently lacing the

1753
01:42:18,130 --> 01:42:21,539
glove piece somewhere

1754
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:53,610
there we go

1755
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:06,430
all right

1756
01:43:20,658 --> 01:43:34,269
so not sure where that angle offset

1757
01:43:22,939 --> 01:43:34,269
actually gets set now I see

1758
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:54,210
I'm just playing around here I should

1759
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:57,600
actually look at the QA sorry this was

1760
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:59,489
just bugging me all right so yeah we'll

1761
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,539
do actual code for the fist at some

1762
01:43:59,489 --> 01:44:01,619
point in the future but it was just

1763
01:44:00,539 --> 01:44:05,609
bugging me that it wasn't floating

1764
01:44:01,619 --> 01:44:06,779
around with us right so I figured I'd

1765
01:44:05,609 --> 01:44:07,619
just make it float around with us for

1766
01:44:06,779 --> 01:44:10,109
now

1767
01:44:07,619 --> 01:44:13,319
and then we'll make it actually do it's

1768
01:44:10,109 --> 01:44:16,069
it's real stuff later on all right let's

1769
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:16,069
see we got for Q&amp;A

1770
01:44:25,229 --> 01:44:28,479
so I'm not sure I understand the reason

1771
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:30,250
why you don't sir the actual position

1772
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:32,049
and smoothly scrolling between tiles and

1773
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:33,340
the animation position doing the

1774
01:44:32,050 --> 01:44:34,719
bouncing the bouncing should only have

1775
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:36,010
to be dealt with during render and can

1776
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,510
be derived from the actual position so

1777
01:44:36,010 --> 01:44:40,989
you don't have stored anywhere am I

1778
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:42,429
wrong about that uh well again wrong is

1779
01:44:40,988 --> 01:44:44,619
probably the wrong word

1780
01:44:42,429 --> 01:44:46,300
in either case because there is Lee

1781
01:44:44,619 --> 01:44:47,590
isn't a wrong there's just what the

1782
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:52,270
consequences are of doing it various

1783
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:54,010
ways so if you take what you're

1784
01:44:52,270 --> 01:44:55,989
suggesting to the logical conclusion you

1785
01:44:54,010 --> 01:44:57,789
have a lot of problems right and what

1786
01:44:55,988 --> 01:44:59,319
that is is anytime you want the

1787
01:44:57,789 --> 01:45:01,119
animation of the player to be something

1788
01:44:59,319 --> 01:45:04,059
more complicated than hopping from one

1789
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:05,889
tile to the other what do you do so

1790
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:07,510
let's suppose that the character is

1791
01:45:05,889 --> 01:45:09,880
hopping from one tile to the other so

1792
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:11,980
you have moved their base position right

1793
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:15,639
to be underneath where they were but

1794
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:17,408
they're up here okay now they get hit

1795
01:45:15,639 --> 01:45:19,750
and they you're supposed to fly up in

1796
01:45:17,408 --> 01:45:22,089
the air and stay up in the air for a

1797
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:26,020
little while or something like this what

1798
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:27,760
where are they right you were lying to

1799
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:30,909
the camera about where they actually

1800
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:33,520
were so now you have to construct some

1801
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:35,649
kind of interpolation rule about what

1802
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:38,530
you do when you transition between your

1803
01:45:35,649 --> 01:45:40,779
fake position and the real position that

1804
01:45:38,529 --> 01:45:44,139
the player is actually at which is what

1805
01:45:40,779 --> 01:45:46,420
the viewer sees and so my experience is

1806
01:45:44,139 --> 01:45:48,639
you really don't want to do those sorts

1807
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:51,130
of things and the reason is because you

1808
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:52,869
will always end up producing artifacts

1809
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:55,539
that you then have to go and add special

1810
01:45:52,869 --> 01:45:57,908
code to fix once you have more things

1811
01:45:55,539 --> 01:46:01,420
happening action lives than just the one

1812
01:45:57,908 --> 01:46:03,488
you plan for right so if instead you

1813
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:06,039
just always do a filter on what the

1814
01:46:03,488 --> 01:46:09,908
actual thing is that the viewer looks at

1815
01:46:06,039 --> 01:46:13,929
it can't really be wrong because it's

1816
01:46:09,908 --> 01:46:16,210
what the viewer sees and so basing

1817
01:46:13,929 --> 01:46:18,460
things that that control the camera

1818
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:21,670
movement over fake elements that the

1819
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:24,279
user can't see and they're concentrating

1820
01:46:21,670 --> 01:46:25,719
on saying the user can see right because

1821
01:46:24,279 --> 01:46:28,359
the user doesn't know about your fake

1822
01:46:25,719 --> 01:46:29,649
camera thing then in that place where

1823
01:46:28,359 --> 01:46:32,829
you have to transition between the other

1824
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:34,689
all hell breaks loose and so I just

1825
01:46:32,829 --> 01:46:36,189
don't want to deal with that I just want

1826
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:38,519
to have something that will always work

1827
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:43,849
for what we actually see

1828
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:43,850
um and and go from there

1829
01:46:56,729 --> 01:47:00,359
what's the plan for lighting on the

1830
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:02,760
sprites so for lighting on the sprites

1831
01:47:00,359 --> 01:47:04,170
we will probably depend a little bit on

1832
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,420
how we finished up our lighting solution

1833
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:08,579
but they'll probably just be adding a

1834
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:10,230
Sam a synthetic sample point to the

1835
01:47:08,579 --> 01:47:13,680
lighting solution that just doesn't

1836
01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:15,329
really occlude anything or maybe it

1837
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:16,800
maybe even will include we might

1838
01:47:15,329 --> 01:47:18,720
actually put a whole cube in there and

1839
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,810
then we'll just light the sprite with

1840
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:24,079
the result of the cube that's that's it

1841
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:26,039
we won't be doing anything different

1842
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:27,779
it'll still just be a cube based

1843
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:30,079
lighting but there'll be a fake cube for

1844
01:47:27,779 --> 01:47:32,550
the sprite that you just won't render

1845
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:34,859
and it's not perfect right it would be

1846
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:36,449
better if we had actual 3d geometry for

1847
01:47:34,859 --> 01:47:37,889
all those shapes

1848
01:47:36,449 --> 01:47:39,359
much like what I said with the camera

1849
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:40,980
you always get artifacts there it's just

1850
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:43,380
those artifacts aren't gonna be that bad

1851
01:47:40,979 --> 01:47:45,089
because people can't pick up errors in

1852
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:47,550
lighting like they can errors in

1853
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:49,500
movement their eye is much more tuned to

1854
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:54,510
errors and movement than it is in errors

1855
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:55,770
in light so is the variance of lighting

1856
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:59,850
just a side effect the random sample

1857
01:47:55,770 --> 01:48:03,030
yeah our lighting isn't great we need to

1858
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:04,380
do a better lighting algorithm it's too

1859
01:48:03,029 --> 01:48:05,729
slow and we don't get good enough

1860
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:08,069
results for how much time we're spending

1861
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:09,239
on it we also maybe want to do it all

1862
01:48:08,069 --> 01:48:11,189
right we may want to do it on the

1863
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:18,420
graphics card and not on the CPU so

1864
01:48:11,189 --> 01:48:19,949
there's a lot yeah we're about to talk

1865
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:21,480
with Dino off-topic but how do you stay

1866
01:48:19,949 --> 01:48:22,949
motivated on projects like this I

1867
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:26,789
usually would lose interest much earlier

1868
01:48:22,949 --> 01:48:30,630
and wonder if there are techniques hmm

1869
01:48:26,789 --> 01:48:32,460
so let me say two things first let me

1870
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:34,230
answer your question for actual long

1871
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:37,140
projects and then let me give a caveat

1872
01:48:34,229 --> 01:48:39,329
for handmade Europe so for long projects

1873
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:42,210
I would highly recommend watching John

1874
01:48:39,329 --> 01:48:45,630
blows presentation on this actually gave

1875
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:48,180
a presentation on not as a motivation

1876
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:49,859
but just mental states right like how to

1877
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:51,510
deal with mental states he talks about

1878
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:54,149
some of the basics of that that you

1879
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:56,100
should know and I would recommend that

1880
01:48:54,149 --> 01:48:58,589
he's worked on multiple very long game

1881
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:00,150
projects that were very difficult the

1882
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:02,520
witness in particular was like I don't

1883
01:49:00,149 --> 01:49:06,960
even remember how long it was seven

1884
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:09,240
years very very long and it's an amazing

1885
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,020
game at the end so it wasn't like it was

1886
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:11,760
a struggle

1887
01:49:10,020 --> 01:49:13,410
project in a way it was like it just

1888
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,600
really needed this much time to be done

1889
01:49:13,409 --> 01:49:22,829
by the number of people that we're on it

1890
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:24,870
you know so I would I would reference

1891
01:49:22,829 --> 01:49:26,519
that people in the chat can probably

1892
01:49:24,869 --> 01:49:27,989
point you to the actual YouTube video

1893
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:31,230
but just it's it's Jonathan plays

1894
01:49:27,989 --> 01:49:34,260
lecture on on like mindfulness basically

1895
01:49:31,229 --> 01:49:35,969
I'm managing your mental state but other

1896
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:38,789
thing I'd say is I would really

1897
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:41,159
encourage people to remember that Hamid

1898
01:49:38,789 --> 01:49:44,550
hero is not a long project handmade hero

1899
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:47,130
has barely had any programming on it at

1900
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:48,989
this point I mean we are talking about a

1901
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:50,789
few hundred hours I don't know what it

1902
01:49:48,989 --> 01:49:54,510
is seven eight hundred hours of

1903
01:49:50,789 --> 01:49:59,220
programming that is child's play on a

1904
01:49:54,510 --> 01:50:01,619
project I mean I've never been on a

1905
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:04,860
project that shipped that was that

1906
01:50:01,619 --> 01:50:06,720
little programming right you might find

1907
01:50:04,859 --> 01:50:08,219
one if you're using a pre-built engine

1908
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:09,510
because then you're just maybe not doing

1909
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:11,369
much property and all maybe you're just

1910
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:12,720
like instantiating a typical

1911
01:50:11,369 --> 01:50:14,399
first-person shooter with the Unreal

1912
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:16,199
Engine and just making art assets for it

1913
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:19,049
or something so maybe then there's not

1914
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:22,550
very much programming but assuming that

1915
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:22,550
you're actually doing anything real

1916
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:33,869
700 800 hours of programming is nothing

1917
01:50:26,729 --> 01:50:39,149
I mean it's a blink of an eye it's it's

1918
01:50:33,869 --> 01:50:40,849
like what you know twenty thirty weeks

1919
01:50:39,149 --> 01:50:44,849
of programming it's not even a year a

1920
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:46,530
full-time work and so I would I often I

1921
01:50:44,850 --> 01:50:48,060
would say to people if the amount of

1922
01:50:46,529 --> 01:50:50,369
programming that's done on handmade hero

1923
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:51,780
if you think of that as a lot that's

1924
01:50:50,369 --> 01:50:53,430
probably a good indication that maybe

1925
01:50:51,779 --> 01:50:55,139
programming isn't for you right that

1926
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:59,940
should that should be a small that

1927
01:50:55,140 --> 01:51:04,230
should be a a very small amount of

1928
01:50:59,939 --> 01:51:05,250
programming and if you're early on and

1929
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:07,289
you haven't had much programming

1930
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:09,600
experience then that's okay but just

1931
01:51:07,289 --> 01:51:10,979
like if you're if you're not thinking oh

1932
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,750
yeah I'll get up to that point

1933
01:51:10,979 --> 01:51:14,669
eventually and that'll be a reasonable

1934
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:16,199
mount of program for me that's that's

1935
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:17,369
probably a bad sign you don't really

1936
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:18,479
want to be having those thoughts if

1937
01:51:17,369 --> 01:51:19,829
you're gonna be an engine program your

1938
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:21,149
partner should not think the amount of

1939
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:25,159
code on hammy or they're dumb as much

1940
01:51:21,149 --> 01:51:25,159
because it isn't and

1941
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:30,789
there's just not that much coding work

1942
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:34,420
that's gone into this project that makes

1943
01:51:30,789 --> 01:51:36,399
sense it's very low it stresses out over

1944
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:40,960
a long period of time because I only do

1945
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:43,750
a few hours a week you know but you know

1946
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:46,000
that that's not hard right that's just

1947
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:48,460
you know it's easy to say oh I just

1948
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,828
spent two week hours a week on it and I

1949
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:53,529
spent them you know so that doesn't

1950
01:51:50,828 --> 01:51:55,658
really wear you down mentally because

1951
01:51:53,529 --> 01:52:01,359
you're hardly putting that many hours of

1952
01:51:55,658 --> 01:52:13,738
work into a tree anyway how big is a

1953
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:13,738
material don't we have okay

1954
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:28,079
um what's it doing okay there we go

1955
01:52:23,639 --> 01:52:33,389
I handmade hero is 28 thousand lines of

1956
01:52:28,078 --> 01:52:34,590
code uh correct I mean depends on how

1957
01:52:33,389 --> 01:52:38,179
you want to count it you know I don't

1958
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:41,880
know if you want to count comments and

1959
01:52:38,179 --> 01:52:42,868
stuff like that or blank lines right but

1960
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:46,609
assuming you're just talking about lines

1961
01:52:42,868 --> 01:52:46,609
of code looks to know twenty thousand

1962
01:52:48,590 --> 01:52:53,239
and I think that includes handmade Ray

1963
01:52:53,868 --> 01:53:10,759
probably okay no it doesn't

1964
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:21,580
okay so it doesn't include kami right so

1965
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:27,070
it's that's a that's a fair estimate so

1966
01:53:21,579 --> 01:53:28,479
again like really not that big right you

1967
01:53:27,069 --> 01:53:39,189
know thirty thousand lines of code is

1968
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:40,839
just not a lot of lines of code she's

1969
01:53:39,189 --> 01:53:42,339
are getting print out what does it take

1970
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:46,630
for that have you noticed to change your

1971
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:50,860
mental stamina it's got no there really

1972
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:53,130
no if anything I think my mental state

1973
01:53:50,859 --> 01:53:55,269
has gotten better as I've gotten older

1974
01:53:53,130 --> 01:53:57,340
for better or for worse I don't know if

1975
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:58,810
that's a good thing but I'll stick with

1976
01:53:57,340 --> 01:54:02,650
things longer now than I used to

1977
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:07,389
probably I don't really get burnt out I

1978
01:54:02,649 --> 01:54:10,029
do get scared so I get I get really

1979
01:54:07,389 --> 01:54:11,650
scared about not having enough money to

1980
01:54:10,029 --> 01:54:13,689
finish something or stuff like that I

1981
01:54:11,649 --> 01:54:14,019
get I get terrified about those sorts of

1982
01:54:13,689 --> 01:54:18,238
things

1983
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:22,090
routinely like every couple of weeks um

1984
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:23,559
when I'm working on stuff that's not

1985
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:26,079
like somebody else paying me a paycheck

1986
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:29,340
to do a specific piece of code so I get

1987
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:31,510
scared a lot but really not burnt out

1988
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:33,340
you know if I was independently wealthy

1989
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:34,510
if I just had like billions of dollars

1990
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:35,079
or something sitting around in a bank

1991
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:39,130
account

1992
01:54:35,079 --> 01:54:40,988
I never burn out I don't think I'd just

1993
01:54:39,130 --> 01:54:42,550
be happy as a clam program in a way and

1994
01:54:40,988 --> 01:54:44,618
I wouldn't even care if it ever shipped

1995
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:47,230
I just that's just because I like the

1996
01:54:44,618 --> 01:54:50,170
act of programming so if I don't have to

1997
01:54:47,229 --> 01:54:54,908
worry about it my mental state is very

1998
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:58,090
good it's when I have to worry about

1999
01:54:54,908 --> 01:55:00,969
actually delivering something that I get

2000
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:03,460
scared and I think with good reason like

2001
01:55:00,969 --> 01:55:06,039
I think anyone should it's hard and it

2002
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:07,779
doesn't often go well a lot of games

2003
01:55:06,039 --> 01:55:10,800
don't make money any more there's a lot

2004
01:55:07,779 --> 01:55:14,408
of reasons to be scared I think it's I

2005
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:16,900
think it's totally reasonable so I don't

2006
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:17,979
fault myself for that and I don't think

2007
01:55:16,899 --> 01:55:20,439
there's a lot you can do about that I

2008
01:55:17,979 --> 01:55:22,539
think it's just it's it is scary you

2009
01:55:20,439 --> 01:55:24,238
know it's like skydiving or something

2010
01:55:22,539 --> 01:55:25,469
right it just is inherently scary

2011
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:27,209
it's something humans weren't meant to

2012
01:55:25,469 --> 01:55:29,880
do uh-huh

2013
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:31,949
and so you're kind of pushing a little

2014
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:32,909
bit of a emotional limit there no matter

2015
01:55:31,949 --> 01:55:36,449
what you do

2016
01:55:32,909 --> 01:55:38,189
burnout is is a different thing and I I

2017
01:55:36,449 --> 01:55:40,979
don't really feel like I have that very

2018
01:55:38,189 --> 01:55:42,389
often I definitely have some bad mental

2019
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:46,289
states I get into but they're usually

2020
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:49,350
fear and not exhaustion because I guess

2021
01:55:46,289 --> 01:55:55,859
what I would say that's just that that's

2022
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:59,489
just me how long does a full rebuild

2023
01:55:55,859 --> 01:56:01,439
take you just saw it many many many

2024
01:55:59,488 --> 01:56:04,019
times every time we hit build it's a

2025
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:06,319
full rebuild so I mean if you want to

2026
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:06,320
see it

2027
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:18,970
that's the full rebuild if the game

2028
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:20,890
isn't running it might be slightly

2029
01:56:18,970 --> 01:56:22,539
faster I'm not sure cuz our game takes

2030
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:25,180
up a lot of CPU so I don't know how that

2031
01:56:22,539 --> 01:56:26,949
affects it yeah so it's a faster if

2032
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:31,530
you're not running the game because then

2033
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:35,289
the compiler isn't fighting for time but

2034
01:56:31,529 --> 01:56:36,579
4.5 seconds full rebuilds that's what

2035
01:56:35,289 --> 01:56:38,590
the optimizations on by the way with

2036
01:56:36,579 --> 01:56:44,579
debug build I think that drops to 2

2037
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:44,579
points something so

2038
01:56:50,139 --> 01:56:55,010
Tice no says motivation I could

2039
01:56:53,328 --> 01:56:56,779
recommend your chat about the imposter

2040
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:58,340
syndrome it helped me a lot I used to

2041
01:56:56,779 --> 01:57:00,529
have way too high expectations of what I

2042
01:56:58,340 --> 01:57:02,059
can do in a day I reduce that

2043
01:57:00,529 --> 01:57:03,738
expectation and set myself smaller goals

2044
01:57:02,059 --> 01:57:05,719
for each day way easier to even start

2045
01:57:03,738 --> 01:57:07,069
then and I was surprised how quickly I

2046
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:11,868
got way more done than I initially

2047
01:57:07,069 --> 01:57:13,279
wanted to do um I don't remember where

2048
01:57:11,868 --> 01:57:14,238
that chatty is if someone wants to post

2049
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:14,988
in YouTube it must be one of the

2050
01:57:14,238 --> 01:57:16,759
handmade chats

2051
01:57:14,988 --> 01:57:19,009
yeah impostor syndrome was something

2052
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:23,750
that would that that word was not really

2053
01:57:19,010 --> 01:57:29,570
used when I was growing up and I really

2054
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:31,219
don't know how useful it is but but yeah

2055
01:57:29,569 --> 01:57:33,828
I think in that chat I just covered some

2056
01:57:31,219 --> 01:57:35,840
basic things like I just would I would

2057
01:57:33,828 --> 01:57:39,368
ignore that concept almost entirely and

2058
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:42,619
just focus on the fact that you know

2059
01:57:39,368 --> 01:57:45,609
everyone is always learning and this is

2060
01:57:42,618 --> 01:57:47,658
a very incomplete discipline and so

2061
01:57:45,609 --> 01:57:51,229
hopefully in watching streams like these

2062
01:57:47,658 --> 01:57:52,429
you can see that it doesn't really

2063
01:57:51,229 --> 01:57:56,658
matter how long you've been programming

2064
01:57:52,429 --> 01:57:59,059
you will still make mistakes you will

2065
01:57:56,658 --> 01:58:03,019
still need to explore to find good

2066
01:57:59,059 --> 01:58:04,849
solutions you will still be stumped from

2067
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:09,349
time to time you will still have to

2068
01:58:04,849 --> 01:58:10,760
accept imperfect solutions and that's

2069
01:58:09,349 --> 01:58:13,340
one of the main things I wanted to show

2070
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:14,960
on the stream to begin with and so I

2071
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:17,800
feel like impostor syndrome is something

2072
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:19,929
that we should just banish even from

2073
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:23,900
something people should worry about I

2074
01:58:19,929 --> 01:58:26,270
think if you're feeling like you're not

2075
01:58:23,899 --> 01:58:29,149
able to do the job I think you have to

2076
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:30,619
remember that like this is a very hard

2077
01:58:29,149 --> 01:58:35,029
discipline that everyone struggles with

2078
01:58:30,618 --> 01:58:36,738
and that's not just you and there are

2079
01:58:35,029 --> 01:58:39,109
lots of concrete ways that you can get

2080
01:58:36,738 --> 01:58:42,019
better at things and we all are trying

2081
01:58:39,109 --> 01:58:43,819
to do those things and there isn't there

2082
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:45,320
are no programmers out there who are

2083
01:58:43,819 --> 01:58:47,840
just magically awesome at everything

2084
01:58:45,319 --> 01:58:50,299
every day it simply is not the case I

2085
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:51,800
have worked with many of the greatest

2086
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:55,039
programmers in the game industry I've

2087
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:59,980
worked with and they all aren't that way

2088
01:58:55,039 --> 01:59:02,269
right it's just it's very hard and so

2089
01:58:59,979 --> 01:59:02,659
rather than thinking about impostor

2090
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:05,270
syndrome

2091
01:59:02,659 --> 01:59:09,649
I would more say realistic expectations

2092
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:12,200
don't don't imagine that the people out

2093
01:59:09,649 --> 01:59:14,269
there who have been doing this job

2094
01:59:12,199 --> 01:59:16,489
longer and do it better than you or

2095
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:20,030
something are doing something magical

2096
01:59:16,489 --> 01:59:23,210
they're only a little bit better and you

2097
01:59:20,029 --> 01:59:25,789
can get there if you practice right and

2098
01:59:23,210 --> 01:59:27,230
so yeah I mean that's one of the reasons

2099
01:59:25,789 --> 01:59:28,670
I think it's great that there's more

2100
01:59:27,229 --> 01:59:31,179
programmer streams now so that you can

2101
01:59:28,670 --> 01:59:33,350
watch and internalize that you can see

2102
01:59:31,180 --> 01:59:35,990
programmers who you may have respected

2103
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:37,670
and thought never made mistakes or we're

2104
01:59:35,989 --> 01:59:39,579
just doing some magical thing that you

2105
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:42,020
could never do you can see them like

2106
01:59:39,579 --> 01:59:45,229
being stupid on a stream and making us

2107
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:46,550
dumb mistake and taking an hour to find

2108
01:59:45,229 --> 01:59:48,229
a bug that should have been obvious and

2109
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:51,680
also it's like that's programming is

2110
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:55,459
complicated and it's something that you

2111
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:57,230
have to constantly work at and do not

2112
01:59:55,460 --> 02:00:02,770
set the bar unrealistically high for

2113
01:59:57,229 --> 02:00:02,769
yourself it's not that kind of a thing

2114
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:21,130
do you ever experience having no idea on

2115
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:23,050
how to approach a specific problem and

2116
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:25,270
have that negatively impact how

2117
02:00:23,050 --> 02:00:34,900
productive you are any tip on how to

2118
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:44,740
deal with it so I guess I do have a tip

2119
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:46,629
on that so when you are trying to solve

2120
02:00:44,739 --> 02:00:52,630
a problem that you don't know how to

2121
02:00:46,630 --> 02:00:55,960
solve the best advice I can give is try

2122
02:00:52,630 --> 02:01:01,869
a lot of things what I see a lot of

2123
02:00:55,960 --> 02:01:05,319
programmers do that I think is bad is a

2124
02:01:01,869 --> 02:01:07,269
bad habit in that situation is they try

2125
02:01:05,319 --> 02:01:10,599
to figure out the solution before they

2126
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:13,300
start typing there aren't very many hard

2127
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:15,340
problems in programming that you can

2128
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:18,699
figure out the solution before you start

2129
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:22,510
typing now sometimes there are if it's

2130
02:01:18,699 --> 02:01:24,789
math oriented but then my answer just

2131
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:28,840
becomes start writing right start

2132
02:01:24,789 --> 02:01:32,350
working the math and the reason I say

2133
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:34,840
that is because if something solution or

2134
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:37,120
mathematical representation is not

2135
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:39,069
immediately obvious to you it probably

2136
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:40,750
isn't immediately obvious period and

2137
02:01:39,069 --> 02:01:44,409
you're going to have to do exploration

2138
02:01:40,750 --> 02:01:46,779
to find it so the wrong thing to do is

2139
02:01:44,409 --> 02:01:49,449
to stop programming or stop writing math

2140
02:01:46,779 --> 02:01:51,550
and think about the problem the reason

2141
02:01:49,449 --> 02:01:53,559
for that is because your brain obviously

2142
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:58,539
isn't good enough to jump to a solution

2143
02:01:53,560 --> 02:02:01,840
and that's fine use the tools you have

2144
02:01:58,539 --> 02:02:05,319
to explore the problem until you find a

2145
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:07,659
solution make visualizations draw

2146
02:02:05,319 --> 02:02:09,789
everything you possibly can that relates

2147
02:02:07,659 --> 02:02:11,590
to the problem make simulations of the

2148
02:02:09,789 --> 02:02:15,310
problem collect data from those

2149
02:02:11,590 --> 02:02:18,100
simulations graph them right look at

2150
02:02:15,310 --> 02:02:21,039
everything you can if it's math work

2151
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:23,410
through the math use MATLAB to graph the

2152
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:25,180
math solve the math in multiple ways

2153
02:02:23,409 --> 02:02:28,000
right

2154
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:29,350
go find math books on the topic see if

2155
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,948
there are ideas in there that you don't

2156
02:02:29,350 --> 02:02:33,280
know about

2157
02:02:29,948 --> 02:02:35,729
right get on Google Scholar look for

2158
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:40,840
research papers involved you know get

2159
02:02:35,729 --> 02:02:43,899
going do something right build something

2160
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:47,230
and usually the solution will come out

2161
02:02:43,899 --> 02:02:49,869
of that the times that stumpers remain

2162
02:02:47,229 --> 02:02:55,229
stumpers is when you remain paralyzed

2163
02:02:49,869 --> 02:02:57,519
when you don't do something and so I

2164
02:02:55,229 --> 02:03:01,479
can't recommend highly enough

2165
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:03,160
the act of active programming active

2166
02:03:01,479 --> 02:03:05,169
solve problem solving

2167
02:03:03,159 --> 02:03:07,029
whether that be writing more equations

2168
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:11,489
making more graphs collecting more data

2169
02:03:07,029 --> 02:03:14,409
writing more code do something and that

2170
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:16,779
is almost always the route to the

2171
02:03:14,409 --> 02:03:18,880
solution sitting there contemplating it

2172
02:03:16,779 --> 02:03:24,009
in your head is rarely the thing and

2173
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:26,710
what you'll often find too is you may

2174
02:03:24,010 --> 02:03:28,929
then think of the answer the answer may

2175
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:32,170
come to you in your head as if you

2176
02:03:28,929 --> 02:03:34,659
thought of it but that moment only comes

2177
02:03:32,170 --> 02:03:38,560
because you've been working the problem

2178
02:03:34,659 --> 02:03:40,599
right and so that that active behavior

2179
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:43,480
actually stimulates your brain and

2180
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:45,610
provides more context and more ideas for

2181
02:03:43,479 --> 02:03:51,869
it to chew on and then that idea may

2182
02:03:45,609 --> 02:03:51,869
can't come right

2183
02:03:56,119 --> 02:04:05,460
alright I'm gonna roll it up alright

2184
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:06,930
thank you everyone for joining me for

2185
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:08,789
notes on a handmade hero it's been a

2186
02:04:06,930 --> 02:04:10,440
pleasure coding with you as always if

2187
02:04:08,789 --> 02:04:11,970
you want to follow my series at home you

2188
02:04:10,439 --> 02:04:14,009
can always peer to the game on handmade

2189
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:20,630
hero org it comes with the source code

2190
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:22,949
so you can follow along with it we will

2191
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:26,940
probably be on Christmas break for a

2192
02:04:22,949 --> 02:04:30,960
while I I will be away for Christmas

2193
02:04:26,939 --> 02:04:34,949
and so winter break might go till

2194
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:37,079
January 10th 15 something like that so

2195
02:04:34,949 --> 02:04:41,189
it'll be 2 or 3 weeks before I see you

2196
02:04:37,079 --> 02:04:42,479
again don't let that stop you whatever

2197
02:04:41,189 --> 02:04:44,729
project you're working on right now our

2198
02:04:42,479 --> 02:04:47,549
program we're doing do some good

2199
02:04:44,729 --> 02:04:50,189
programming over the winter break spend

2200
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:52,710
some time doing some cool stuff and

2201
02:04:50,189 --> 02:04:54,750
learning about programming and then when

2202
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:57,359
we come back we'll have a whole bunch of

2203
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:58,560
stuff we could do on handmade hero we

2204
02:04:57,359 --> 02:05:01,619
can play around more with the camera

2205
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:04,350
code that we can get to some stuff we

2206
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:07,439
even want to get to for a while I just

2207
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:08,820
throwing in some nice stuff ground cover

2208
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:11,549
or we could maybe look at the lighting a

2209
02:05:08,819 --> 02:05:13,439
little bit tie up the game look get it

2210
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:16,050
looking like a real game because we're

2211
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:17,729
pretty close to that actually and then I

2212
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:20,250
think we can finally check that box and

2213
02:05:17,729 --> 02:05:27,299
say it's all game play from here on out

2214
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:30,510
that'll be a bad day cuz I'm not a

2215
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:32,369
designer so you know I'll do everything

2216
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:35,640
I can before we get to there but at some

2217
02:05:32,369 --> 02:05:38,849
point we're running out of things that

2218
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:40,440
are that our engine side so so we got a

2219
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:41,750
few more things to do there when we're

2220
02:05:40,439 --> 02:05:45,089
but we're going through them pretty well

2221
02:05:41,750 --> 02:05:47,069
and so we'll we'll see and hopefully

2222
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:50,039
when we come back to we can get the

2223
02:05:47,069 --> 02:05:53,489
twitch stream set up a little bit better

2224
02:05:50,039 --> 02:05:57,390
gets we're gonna put some imodium oh

2225
02:05:53,489 --> 02:05:59,909
geez and their custom emotion you know

2226
02:05:57,390 --> 02:06:01,740
customer to Colin's and custom badges

2227
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:03,269
and stuff so now that we're twitch

2228
02:06:01,739 --> 02:06:05,279
partners and all that stuff we can

2229
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:07,340
settle that up for you guys too so

2230
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:08,630
that'll that'll be coming

2231
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:12,739
when we come back from Christmas break

2232
02:06:08,630 --> 02:06:17,630
as well already everybody have a good

2233
02:06:12,739 --> 02:06:20,569
holiday season and well in regardless

2234
02:06:17,630 --> 02:06:22,159
have a good break even if even if it's

2235
02:06:20,569 --> 02:06:24,199
not winter where you are or if it's not

2236
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:26,239
holidays where you are have a good

2237
02:06:24,199 --> 02:06:28,099
couple week break do some good program

2238
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:31,869
and have some fun and I'll see everyone

2239
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:31,870
when we come back thanks everybody
