00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,720
alright hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,330
hand made here oh sure we could a

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:13,379
complete-game live on stream yesterday

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,269
not yesterday that's a total lie what I

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,868
don't mean yesterday at all I mean last

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,899
weekend we made it so that we could

7
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:23,189
reload our renderer all we wanted in

8
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,229
fact we made it so we could really

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,879
reload anything all we wanted which is

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,800
kind of nice

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,178
so our hot code reloading which we made

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,429
at the beginning of the project we

13
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:35,250
eventually lost the ability to hot load

14
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:37,558
our renderer because our renderer got

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,730
cabbed off into a separate DLL and that

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:43,399
dll was not itself reloaded and I think

17
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:45,988
we also kind of didn't have that

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,509
separately I want to say we didn't have

19
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,009
that before because we had welded it

20
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,829
into the platform layer or something I

21
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,659
don't really remember but point being we

22
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,969
had been kind of lazy about that we just

23
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:58,349
hadn't taken it seriously

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,730
and I was like alright if we're gonna

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,489
start playing with this lighting stuff

26
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,808
and try to make this final I feel like

27
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:05,789
we should have that because it'll help

28
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,289
our iteration times if we can just like

29
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,380
leave it up and running and tweak some

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,600
things and see the results and so on and

31
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:14,908
so we did that work and I think we're

32
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,069
more or less at the state where that's

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,270
all working the only thing I don't think

34
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:24,118
we did is we haven't strobed it in any

35
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:27,319
way and what I mean by that is when we

36
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,909
reload the renderer we don't necessarily

37
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:32,158
make any special big deal about it

38
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,659
we just reload the code which means that

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,469
now the renderer will operate

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,150
differently

41
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,900
it's reloaded the code and it will run

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,359
the new renderer but any of the setup

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,640
work that's been done in that renderer

44
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,590
will not get redone because we haven't

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,780
told the renderer that it reloaded so it

46
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,469
doesn't even know that it's setup code

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,570
may have changed and so as a result a

48
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:57,658
lot of the things that we actually want

49
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,699
to do dynamically a good example here

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,460
would be if we want to change the

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,530
shaders those won't actually change

52
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,289
because even though we change them and

53
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,060
the changes get reloaded nobody ever

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,618
sends new versions down to the graphics

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,199
card so the graphics are still using the

56
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:15,120
old versions of the shaders so

57
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,039
we want to do now is just take a few

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,810
seconds to make this work it should be

59
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,090
relatively straightforward I think

60
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,830
because all we have to because we not

61
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,590
because it's easy but because we already

62
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,510
did this we already made it so that if

63
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,280
it detects the settings change it

64
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:32,039
reinitialize --is that got done a long

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,659
time ago and so now what we would want

66
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,789
to do is just go in and fix it so that

67
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,818
if you reload the renderer the renderer

68
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:41,039
gets notified in some way and that way

69
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:44,039
you can make sure that anything that was

70
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,469
changed actually gets fixed so if we

71
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,789
look at the opengl side of things what

72
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,509
i'm talking about is if we look for

73
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:52,798
example at the Z bias program here what

74
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,959
you can see is like we've got a bunch of

75
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,519
hard-coded strings that just have like

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,959
our you know here's the shader right

77
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,280
it's just written right into the program

78
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,650
we don't load it out of separate file

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,680
when we recompile we will get new

80
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,569
strings but this program this compiled Z

81
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,900
virus program function will never get

82
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:12,719
called because it exists down here in

83
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,090
compile Z bias program the call to Z

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,219
bias program here it exists down here in

85
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,859
OpenGL changed two settings which we

86
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,199
like I said conveniently do have the

87
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,030
ability to call again so we already made

88
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:26,789
something that would do this for us

89
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,590
where we would get everything

90
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,509
resubmitted but we're never gonna

91
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,299
actually do this so what I think we want

92
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:35,399
to do is in the settings here where

93
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,480
we've got this are equal you can see

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,430
that we're doing something where

95
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,078
periodically we check to see whether or

96
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,420
not our settings are equal and if

97
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,340
they're not equal we call this change so

98
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:47,039
all we really need to do is make sure

99
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,180
that this are equal this check right

100
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,099
here will actually fail when we do a

101
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,959
reload now there's a couple of ways we

102
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,310
can do that but I'm kind of gonna I'm

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,219
gonna probably go with a particular one

104
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,709
here I'll explain in a second if you

105
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,750
look at what we do all we're gonna do in

106
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,549
that check is look to see if the memory

107
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,310
for the two of them happens to compare

108
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,310
to be the same so if we changed anything

109
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,799
in the game render settings which is

110
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:18,829
this right here if we changed anything

111
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,829
in here we would get a recompile now

112
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,519
obviously we could change something get

113
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,129
a recompile like changing whether V

114
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,269
sinks on or off or something but that

115
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,589
doesn't seem like a very good solution

116
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,089
because then we're changing something

117
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:35,149
that we didn't actually want to change

118
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:38,269
so what I would ROS is we can just go in

119
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:41,029
here and put an ordinal in right we can

120
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:43,698
just basically say like settings ordinal

121
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:47,209
for something like this or settings

122
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,400
version right and this could just

123
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:52,370
increment any time we want to force a

124
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,989
recompile and it doesn't mean anything

125
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,939
it's just a value that will compare

126
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,370
differently so basically every time we

127
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:01,610
reload we can knock settings version up

128
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,649
one and that will force a reload even if

129
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,419
all of these were exactly the same which

130
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:07,219
they probably will be because no one

131
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:10,939
probably changed them on the same frame

132
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,620
that we happen to reload the renderer so

133
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:18,969
I'm gonna go ahead and say all right

134
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:24,189
look Settings version is a monotonically

135
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:30,010
increasing value that gets incremented

136
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:35,269
whenever the renderer gets reloaded or

137
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:40,399
another event occurs that might want the

138
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:43,759
renderer to reinitialize without

139
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:47,329
actually changing any of the settings

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,159
above and this will give us an

141
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:52,939
opportunity to just kind of increment

142
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,849
that value anytime we want and so then

143
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:58,339
when we look at the win32 side of things

144
00:05:55,848 --> 00:06:00,409
when we go into win32 hand-made which of

145
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,379
course controls is our tire entire

146
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,020
platform layer exists in here when it

147
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,430
decides to do this reload so you can see

148
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:10,579
you know here's us reloading the

149
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,680
executable here and then we come down I

150
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:15,159
think at the bottom of this and do the

151
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,959
reload for the renderer you can see here

152
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,450
we know thanks to the way that we

153
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,629
structured this code we know when we are

154
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:26,000
going to do this so right here we now

155
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:30,918
know when we do this reload if we just

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,709
knocked it up one if we just did this we

157
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,750
would be okay the problem is we're

158
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,099
are those actual settings right so we

159
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,959
got to go take a look at where those

160
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,900
actually are but hopefully those are set

161
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:45,379
here I believe we just have them already

162
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,609
just sitting in here but again I you

163
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:50,569
know don't remember this code very well

164
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,370
but I believe those exist in here so if

165
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,769
we take a look at where these come back

166
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,189
you can see us doing a begin frame here

167
00:06:54,769 --> 00:07:01,189
and we've got this stuff if I go look at

168
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:03,439
that frame right so if I go look at game

169
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,779
render commands I believe that the

170
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,480
settings just exist in here right and

171
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:11,239
every time that it calls begin frame I

172
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,759
think it gets the settings that are

173
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,310
copied from the actual OpenGL layer I

174
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,990
believe that's what happens now that's a

175
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,149
little unfortunate because it means that

176
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,180
I won't actually have them kind of where

177
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:27,049
I need them per se

178
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:29,900
meaning when I come in here and do the

179
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,370
end frame this is where I would probably

180
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:36,739
want to do the change and I could like

181
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,750
make it so that I remember whether I

182
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,360
changed it on the last frame and then

183
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,399
increment it here or something like that

184
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
but what I would rather be able to do is

185
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:47,089
I'd rather be able to increment it

186
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,640
directly that would be like my

187
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:52,189
preference and so what I want to be able

188
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:57,229
to do is have some way of actually

189
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:59,269
getting at the the settings the previous

190
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,790
settings as they existed because I know

191
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:03,620
they get copied out into here and then

192
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,960
they get copied over when we go into

193
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,490
this end frame call and so that's the

194
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,870
part that I would like to you know I

195
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:14,180
would like to be able to increment the

196
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:17,810
the one that comes out next right and

197
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:20,150
I'm not sure exactly how to do that well

198
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,620
actually you know what I guess I do kind

199
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:25,689
of know how to do that I guess I could

200
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,189
just say like renderer was reloaded and

201
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:36,700
then I guess I could just do if renderer

202
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:36,700
was reloaded then frame settings

203
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:46,500
oops I guess I can just do it this way

204
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:48,960
right so if the renderer was reloaded

205
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,340
then in here I'm going to go ahead and

206
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,019
increment oops that and maybe this

207
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,310
should just be called version let's be

208
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,319
honest it probably shouldn't be Settings

209
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:02,219
version because Ori in the settings and

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,980
then we just set this to false so here

211
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,170
we can just have a thing we remember and

212
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,230
I suppose that's all we really need

213
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:13,669
right and so in here when we enter our

214
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,940
running loop we can just say like

215
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,129
alright

216
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,160
the renderer was reloaded as a thing

217
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:22,549
that we remember and our game read

218
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,069
render settings has a version in here

219
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:31,319
and that's it right like that's all we

220
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:34,110
would really need to do so unless I'm

221
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,110
mistaken I think that we'll just do what

222
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,149
we needed it to do and now we will be

223
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,779
able to change shaders and other things

224
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:44,939
I think in there so let's see if that's

225
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,309
actually true because it's a relatively

226
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,720
complicated process like I said so I

227
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:51,719
don't want to assume that that actually

228
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,570
worked because it may well if not so

229
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,310
here we are hopping around and now I

230
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,740
should be able to change some things in

231
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:01,859
the renderer and see pretty clearly

232
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,600
whether they take effect or not so for

233
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,000
example if I went into the lighting

234
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,159
system here we've got a bunch of stuff

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,950
like you can see push debug box and

236
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,990
stuff like that so if I was to just turn

237
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,000
that off for example this should be an

238
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,279
example of a code change that we should

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,950
see immediately so let's suppose that I

240
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,169
just do that and then I'm recompiling at

241
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,580
the bottom you can't see it there but

242
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,769
when that recompile finishes I should

243
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,900
see the boxes go away and I do and now

244
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:30,809
if I put them back in I should see the

245
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,549
boxes come back and again it's really

246
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,229
just about the compile time which is a

247
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:36,120
little bit slow right now unfortunately

248
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,659
but you know we could probably speed

249
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,370
that up in fact maybe we want to anyway

250
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:43,949
so you can kind of see all right that's

251
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,539
you know working just fine so now let's

252
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,190
try and change something in an actual

253
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:48,629
shader which is the part that's harder

254
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,040
or in some other aspect of the

255
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:51,210
initialization but shaders are the ones

256
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,309
we're probably going to

257
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,930
and it the most so let's go ahead and

258
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:56,309
take a look at that so let's look at

259
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:59,729
compiled seabass program which is

260
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,869
currently doing everything that we that

261
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,899
renders basically everything in the game

262
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:07,950
right let's go ahead and do something

263
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,629
like lock our values to one so if I went

264
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,509
in here and said all right this is going

265
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,389
to be 1.0 instead of this actual value

266
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,939
that comes out and now I recompile let's

267
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,379
see if we get a surface reflection

268
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:24,480
change where we get read everywhere and

269
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:26,700
we do right so I think that seems fine

270
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:34,740
like it looks like we've got what we

271
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:36,660
need out of that and off we go so I

272
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,909
think now we can just dynamically change

273
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:41,789
everything the behavior of the renderer

274
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:44,549
and the shaders to our hearts content

275
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:46,649
and I think that's good because it'll

276
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:47,338
help us you know tune things a little

277
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:49,769
bit quicker

278
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,330
we won't like if I hop to somewhere and

279
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,250
say all right we're gonna take a look at

280
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,470
what's happening right here we can now

281
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,839
edit that code repeatedly and we don't

282
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,940
have to do any additional work to like

283
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:08,880
get back to this scenario or whatever

284
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:10,290
else we might need to do I hear noises

285
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,669
coming from over there I think it might

286
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:15,419
be the puss I'm not sure you probably

287
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:18,269
can't hear them but I can all right

288
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:22,860
anyway so what we'd like to do now is go

289
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:26,579
ahead and move to like the next phase of

290
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,289
getting the lighting working and I guess

291
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,050
it's kind of a little bit tricky because

292
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:33,329
like I said we've got a lot of things

293
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:35,069
that we want to do you can see like I

294
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,459
did the easy one last weekend which was

295
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:40,589
make this reloadable because that's

296
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,838
pretty straightforward but you can see

297
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,900
here we we listed some things and I

298
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:50,100
think that you know based on my

299
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:51,230
experience here I really think that this

300
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,528
part did not

301
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:57,089
I wasn't encouraged by what I was

302
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:58,379
looking at when I was like okay what

303
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:02,730
does it take to do a good flood-fill

304
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:05,009
here I think we could do flood feeling

305
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,470
maybe on the GPU side of things and

306
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:10,950
would probably work okay because we'd

307
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,480
have a lot more horsepower there but

308
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,980
just looking at it as like I don't think

309
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,480
this is gonna work it was just a lot of

310
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:21,779
extra actual manipulation and a lot of

311
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,029
costly lookups in 3d when you look at

312
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:27,179
the actual number of samples you had to

313
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:29,699
take to figure out what you were gonna

314
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,319
do even with one cell of the voxel for

315
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,660
filling you typically wanted to look at

316
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,470
a really wide area so like you typically

317
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:39,509
wanted to look at you know an area that

318
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,029
would be something like 25 voxels wide

319
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,620
right cuz you wanted like two to one

320
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:48,379
side two to the other and of course then

321
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:50,129
the one you're on and that's like a 5x5

322
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:51,840
actually no it was worse than that was

323
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,600
five by five by five right so it was

324
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,200
actually more like 125 samples right

325
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,080
and so voxel filling like that as like

326
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,080
and maybe you could do it by just doing

327
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:12,210
two passes that each use a three by

328
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:17,340
three by three so a nine by 27 but a 27

329
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:19,410
tap filter is still bad right um and so

330
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:23,269
I didn't really like that idea very much

331
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:26,579
and I'm kind of nervous about it so I

332
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:30,149
kind of feel like we don't really want

333
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:34,170
to be in that business much if we can

334
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:35,850
avoid it and I think we may just want to

335
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:38,399
go with something like if we have to

336
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,970
move to spherical harmonics fine but

337
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,169
let's not let's not assume we have to

338
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,509
fill areas that we don't know about

339
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,610
right and it's unfortunate because I

340
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:49,980
really liked the thing we had where we

341
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,139
sort of said all right so we can

342
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,379
extrapolate stuff outside of the region

343
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:59,399
and then we can get these nice sort of

344
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:02,399
fills I don't really know that we're

345
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,809
gonna be able to do that like I we might

346
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,459
be able to do that in a slightly

347
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:07,169
different way

348
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,210
by saying look when we take lots of

349
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:10,649
samples inside this voxel area if some

350
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,530
of them are in shadow and some of them

351
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:15,360
are not in shadow then when we average

352
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:17,730
those together we could produce things

353
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,779
like okay this is going to be a shadowed

354
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,050
area but it's

355
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:24,809
going to be set to a particular negative

356
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:26,490
value to encourage to be interpolated a

357
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:29,369
particular way based on the fact that we

358
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,399
did see some light contribution in the

359
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,509
area or something like that right

360
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,340
so I could imagine something like that

361
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:38,399
happening but at the moment like I'm

362
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,899
just not super enthusiastic about it and

363
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,620
so if I think about what I'm gonna have

364
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:45,929
to do here

365
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:55,139
the main problem that I see so if we

366
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:57,779
look at at oops the horrors of having

367
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,610
your keyboard offset if we look at the

368
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,019
spherical are minus basis functions and

369
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,629
I'm just gonna see if I can get a good

370
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,039
image of that here yeah so if we look at

371
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,960
a spherical R minus basis functions

372
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,349
really quickly the thing that I'm

373
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,540
concerned about for the most part is

374
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,810
that if we look at what we would

375
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:20,579
reasonably be able to store it would it

376
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:24,019
would be this top tree right so if you

377
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:27,600
again just to really quickly sort of re

378
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,220
recap what's going on here so if we look

379
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,509
at circular basis functions circular

380
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,060
minus basis functions what these are a

381
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:35,129
way of encoding functions on a sphere

382
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,659
that's pretty similar to if you were

383
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,970
going to do something like a Fourier

384
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:42,600
transform to encode things that are not

385
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,340
on the sphere right so if you're trying

386
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,290
to take like a 1d signal and in court

387
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:49,170
and in encoded with the Fourier basis

388
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:50,909
functions you would know okay we're

389
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:53,549
gonna you know take these sort of sine

390
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,809
waves right and we're going to project

391
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:56,939
the function on of the sine waves and

392
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:58,409
reconstruct whatever we it was using

393
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,560
sums of sine waves at different

394
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:03,689
frequencies and phases and whatever else

395
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,159
we you know whatever you want really I

396
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,779
mean Fourier base functions one of them

397
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,820
but you could imagine any you could do

398
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:10,649
anything you wanted with respect to that

399
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,029
just usually if you want those basis

400
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,050
functional you're gonna end up with a

401
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:14,759
Fourier transform one way or the other

402
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,589
same ones like the discrete cosine

403
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,779
transform for images or whatever so 2d

404
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:21,809
you know same thing we're just taking

405
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:23,849
various oscillating functions and we're

406
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,859
summing them together to produce the

407
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:28,139
same result as if we had just recorded

408
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,849
the signal manually why do we do that we

409
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,170
do that because it allows us to decimate

410
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,819
the signal right it allows us to say

411
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,740
alright let's reduce the

412
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,898
of basis function we're going to use and

413
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,669
store less parameters to still

414
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:41,758
reconstruct something that looks sort of

415
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:44,250
like the function so if we're going to

416
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,409
do that then what happens is when you do

417
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,538
circle basis D constructions of things

418
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:50,130
you have to decide how many terms you're

419
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:52,408
actually in the store now obviously if

420
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,940
you wanted to represent the sphere

421
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,528
sampling with perfect accuracy you'd

422
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,509
need to store lots of basis functions

423
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:59,220
you need to start enough basis functions

424
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,288
to reconstruct the lighting at the level

425
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,100
you actually sampled it right so that

426
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:06,480
you wouldn't lose any information

427
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:08,908
there's no way we're gonna store that

428
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,919
many because each one of these basis

429
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:12,570
functions requires a coefficient and if

430
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:17,490
you look at how many we could currently

431
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:21,480
store one texture sample has optionally

432
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:25,859
up to four components right RGB a which

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:29,099
means we could store basically one top

434
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:33,628
of a tree one two three four basis

435
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:35,459
functions right in a single color sample

436
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:37,378
we could reconstruct with four basis

437
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,929
functions now I know what you're saying

438
00:18:37,378 --> 00:18:41,609
didn't we already have Vox for voxels

439
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:43,889
each with four colors in them isn't that

440
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:50,069
16 basis function so couldn't we do 1 2

441
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:52,008
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 all

442
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:54,898
the way down to this part of the tree

443
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:57,480
yes we could but it would be black and

444
00:18:54,898 --> 00:19:00,808
white right the problem that we have is

445
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:04,440
we have three color channels if we want

446
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:06,089
colored lighting as opposed to lighting

447
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,950
that is just an intensity value so if we

448
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:10,740
want to actually know what the light

449
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,830
color value is we would need to store at

450
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,589
least three different spherical

451
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:19,378
harmonics one for each of these things

452
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:21,058
now we could try to do something a

453
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:23,699
little bit different with that because

454
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:26,519
there are ways we can cheat we could for

455
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,850
example store 16 basis functions for the

456
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:31,470
intensity and then some sideband values

457
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:34,378
that tell us what the color of the light

458
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,808
is overall or something but the problem

459
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:39,509
with that is if you have situations like

460
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:41,668
there being a bright red light on one

461
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:43,460
side of a character and a bright blue

462
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:46,350
light on the other side of the character

463
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,700
well we wouldn't be able to capture that

464
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,558
the intensity would be stored

465
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,350
differently from the chroma from the

466
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:54,329
color values right and once we get into

467
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:55,349
that situation we wouldn't be able to

468
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:58,529
store lights coming from different

469
00:19:55,349 --> 00:20:01,529
directions very well because different

470
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:05,038
colored lights because we could store a

471
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:06,899
single set of colored lights that were

472
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,609
brighter on one side and darker on

473
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,650
another or two different bright high

474
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:12,329
spot that would all work but as soon as

475
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,340
the different bright spots were coming

476
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:17,639
from different colored lights we

477
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,928
wouldn't be able to do it anymore so if

478
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,759
we did want to switch to spherical

479
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:23,640
harmonics the main problem that we're

480
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,250
gonna have there that you'd encounter is

481
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,500
we can only store a very limited amount

482
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,640
of this tree if we wanted three

483
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,650
different colored lights what we could

484
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,360
do is three voxels each with four

485
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,940
components in each voxel we know that's

486
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,428
fast enough for sampling and each of

487
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,169
these things would then have to be just

488
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:42,929
the top of the pyramid so we'd get just

489
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:45,179
these four and the question I have I

490
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,850
don't really know is that sufficient

491
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:51,450
like would that produce lighting that we

492
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:54,779
care about or not right and I have no

493
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,788
idea that's the blind side for these and

494
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:00,649
so I guess one thing I would be

495
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:05,849
interested about would be like spherical

496
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:08,009
harmonics with four coefficients I don't

497
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:12,899
know if there's any like thing that

498
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:16,019
would actually tell us this maybe like

499
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,730
if someone did some tests which I know

500
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:20,369
people have done in the literature as

501
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:23,700
well that we can where we can just see

502
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,779
kind of to what extent we would need to

503
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,080
store them

504
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:29,819
I wonder if DuckDuckGo is good enough at

505
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,678
this or not I've been trying it out

506
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,259
lately and it seems like it's good for

507
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,909
generic searches but I would say for

508
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,109
like technical searches it seems not as

509
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,409
good I don't know if other people have

510
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:41,548
that experience or not I think

511
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,140
DuckDuckGo needs to work on their

512
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:46,168
technical searches that'd be my guess

513
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,980
but anyway so in here if I wanted to say

514
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:48,980
like okay

515
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:59,409
so these are just the things that I

516
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:03,279
might try searching for I mean how long

517
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:07,420
should I boil eggs for seven minutes

518
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:15,269
you think seems good anyway

519
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:24,370
so if I wanted to say here okay spiracle

520
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:27,609
harmonics truncation do we have you know

521
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:31,809
any any kind of like our example images

522
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:36,359
of that like what does our lighting look

523
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:36,359
like as we sort of reduce the

524
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:42,179
coefficients downward you know what can

525
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:45,278
we expect right

526
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,278
[Music]

527
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,960
so that's unfortunately just the

528
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,710
coefficient things I think or is it not

529
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,240
what is that can I see this larger they

530
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:08,230
really don't want to show me that image

531
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:09,730
apparently I just want some light like

532
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,980
what I would really like is just you

533
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,179
know an object and then and I'm sure

534
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,029
there's a paper what has this it's just

535
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,519
like how long would it take me to go and

536
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:20,589
find it I just want a paper that

537
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:21,279
basically has here's an object with some

538
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:22,599
lighting on it

539
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,740
the lighting is relatively complicated

540
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:29,079
right here's what it looks like as I

541
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,789
drop the spherical harmonic coefficients

542
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:40,449
down so I start with 64 coefficients and

543
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:43,269
I drop to 32 16 8 4 2 1 right that's

544
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,460
really all I want to see so that I can

545
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:48,730
kind of get a sense of like how bad is

546
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:53,650
my letting gonna be as I start dropping

547
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:56,289
these down and I don't this is not gonna

548
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,630
help because I want to see like a ray

549
00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:00,668
traced image like show me what it would

550
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,429
look like if I Ray trace an image with

551
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:14,549
each of these like how much fidelity do

552
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:17,259
I lose as I go down the sort of the

553
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:20,379
pyramid right or as just I should say as

554
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:23,410
I go up the pyramid as I reduce which

555
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,410
ones I'm actually getting and I again

556
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,540
just really don't know so this is that's

557
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,980
what I wanted to see before I make any

558
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,240
decisions about whether I want to go

559
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,349
down that route

560
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,349
or not

561
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,000
because I don't think 16 per channel is

562
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:48,210
realistic if we did 16 that's 4 voxel

563
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,150
lookups per gun at 3 guns is just it's

564
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:53,600
48 box lookups it's just not and I'm

565
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,340
pretty sure at 16 it would be fine like

566
00:24:53,599 --> 00:25:00,209
so the question is just at 4 is it

567
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:02,129
usable or is it crap right and I really

568
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,170
don't know the answer and it does not

569
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,180
seem like a simple search is gonna cut

570
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:10,920
it like I'm not seeing anything here

571
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:17,279
this is just not giving me what I need

572
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:20,840
to know sadly what's what's this about

573
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,839
that looks sort of render II

574
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:56,000
yeah again not not quite there let's see

575
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:58,880
if we can pull anything up let's see

576
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,130
what we've got

577
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,559
I was kind of hoping that maybe there

578
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,600
would be some in some of these papers I

579
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:08,928
mean you can see here like we'll have

580
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:11,178
tons of papers to work from in terms of

581
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:13,070
how to compute the lighting because

582
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:17,149
there's lots lots of work has been done

583
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:20,119
on spherical harmonics right and you can

584
00:26:17,148 --> 00:26:22,759
see there's lots of stuff here that that

585
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:26,658
would give us lots of good information I

586
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:27,500
wonder you know what so here's like an

587
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:30,320
example

588
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,619
so Peter Pike Sloane whose researcher

589
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,908
actually knew him back in the day who

590
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:37,609
did a bunch of work on circle mines kind

591
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:39,169
of early on when people were starting to

592
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:42,319
do not early for spherical mass but

593
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:47,480
early for using them for lighting here

594
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:50,599
you can sort of see a cube map where you

595
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:54,500
can see the location of the lights in

596
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:56,119
the cube map the red versus blue is like

597
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:00,140
the positive and negative sphere it

598
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:01,969
doesn't matter which one right but point

599
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,700
being you can see that the two lobes of

600
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:08,778
the function when you when you're here

601
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:11,090
it's just an average color so or I

602
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:13,398
should say an average intensity so that

603
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:16,879
first coefficient is just how generally

604
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,918
bright is the light and then here you

605
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,200
are adding from someplace and

606
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,070
subtracting from another place so it

607
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,500
doesn't matter which one you

608
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:25,730
conceptualize is doing that because you

609
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,349
could always negate your components and

610
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,569
do the opposite but the point is just

611
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:31,278
that like so let's say the red subtracts

612
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:32,990
and the blue adds or the blue subtracts

613
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,700
and the red adds since this is red I'm

614
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,409
gonna go with blue some tracks and red

615
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,069
adds in fact that's what they did here

616
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:41,840
blues negative red is positive so it

617
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:45,470
would subtract light from this area and

618
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:50,240
add light from this area right and what

619
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:58,370
you can see here about that is I guess

620
00:27:50,240 --> 00:28:02,509
to a certain extent if you only stored

621
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:09,349
the top four that's sort of really only

622
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:11,539
storing one light direction right it

623
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:15,679
looks like if you wanted two highlights

624
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:19,849
you would you would be here am I wrong

625
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:26,330
about that because if I'm gonna add

626
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:29,209
these together I mean I guess I could if

627
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:33,289
they if the function happened to line up

628
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:34,640
just so where the lights happen to be

629
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:37,700
pointing in these two directions and I

630
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,460
guess I could do something but you know

631
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,330
it's probably not really gonna happen so

632
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,819
it would be pretty hard to encapsulate

633
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:49,069
or I should say capture lighting that's

634
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:54,470
coming from two different sides using

635
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:58,669
only these here and that doesn't seem

636
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:02,660
great right I mean that doesn't seem

637
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:04,100
fabulous and again it kind of sways me

638
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,110
from wanting to use these now granted

639
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:07,669
we're not trying to capture like the

640
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:10,279
whole lighting like if we wanted to do

641
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,740
highlights from direct lights we could

642
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:16,160
certainly do that by just actually using

643
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,900
lights on people using shadow maps or

644
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,310
something like if we wanted really good

645
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,200
direct lighting we could obviously get

646
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,240
that in a different way so I'm not

647
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,069
necessarily saying that this has to be

648
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,000
super accurate into terms of the

649
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:29,389
direction of the lighting or anything

650
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,309
like that but even just looking at this

651
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,540
and going if I wanted to have generally

652
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:34,309
some blue light coming from the right

653
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:37,519
and generally some green light coming

654
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:39,649
from the left Oh or I should say no

655
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:46,160
generally some white light from the left

656
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:49,460
and white light from the right I mean

657
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:52,550
this can't really do it I don't see any

658
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,890
way that's gonna work now once you get

659
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:58,149
down here I think you could do it but

660
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,150
this this doesn't seem likely

661
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:07,589
so I guess what I would see here is yeah

662
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:09,269
it's just it continues to be something

663
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:14,908
that kind of eludes me how we're gonna

664
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:18,028
store these and update them and I really

665
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:33,200
just don't have a strong notion of how

666
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:33,200
that's going to happen and that's nine

667
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,230
so that's two voxel samples for these

668
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:46,320
you know maybe nine maybe we could get

669
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,649
nine to work somehow just trying to

670
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:52,109
think so if we did two voxel samples

671
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:56,119
each so that'd be six voxel samples and

672
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:56,119
then a seventh one just for the top

673
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:14,389
I mean seven voxel samples isn't

674
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:15,950
completely ridiculous and seven voxel

675
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,460
samples would get us Circle harmonics

676
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:21,230
down to here right and at that point it

677
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:25,029
does seem like you're capturing enough

678
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:28,990
of the lighting to be useful I would say

679
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:35,899
now again I really like to see some

680
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:37,940
examples of this okay so this act okay

681
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,140
so this is what I want actually so

682
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:45,289
alright we're starting to get somewhere

683
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:47,390
now so here we go these are the images

684
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:49,670
of the reconstruction of an HDR light

685
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:53,450
probe into one to six spherical

686
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:57,289
harmonics right so in other words I

687
00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:00,740
think unless I'm wrong that's saying

688
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:03,139
rows of the pyramid so one would be this

689
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:06,349
two would be this three would be this

690
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,870
right so three is all I think we can

691
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:11,449
afford I don't think you'd afford four

692
00:32:07,869 --> 00:32:13,579
and three is still pushing it but if we

693
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,259
go down here and we look that would be

694
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:19,789
here's one that's completely useless

695
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:22,160
that's just a brightness right here is

696
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:24,500
two and like I said I think two just

697
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,380
captures one directional light pretty

698
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,059
much right and so you look at this and

699
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,720
you go like okay that doesn't really

700
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:36,440
help us because that's just like you

701
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,490
know it just stores generally the

702
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,279
direction the light was coming from

703
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,839
which is not probably what we want but

704
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,859
you get here and you're like alright

705
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:49,189
that's kind of like this it's not

706
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:52,809
perfect but that's something this is

707
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:56,570
obviously way better as is this in this

708
00:32:52,809 --> 00:33:00,769
but if you gave me this instead of that

709
00:32:56,569 --> 00:33:04,279
or that I'm not unhappy and furthermore

710
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:06,470
we want this game's art to be kind of

711
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,269
soft we're not going for like a hard

712
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,900
lighting look weird it's where these

713
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:13,849
soft and cartoony so you know this is

714
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,650
probably not what I want anyway for

715
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:17,480
incoming lighting because I'm probably

716
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,470
capturing more detail in the lighting

717
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,779
than I need at this point for

718
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,690
nice smooth result anyway this is

719
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:28,168
probably unnecessary and I don't know

720
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:30,840
that I would even want it so the you

721
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:35,038
know I could believe it so I guess I

722
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:40,109
could believe that doing spherical

723
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:43,669
harmonics on this would would be

724
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:43,668
reasonable right

725
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:58,799
so we could do that I would be down with

726
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,810
that now the only thing that I Bri

727
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,759
probably need to check and because I

728
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:08,849
don't really understand why is that's

729
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,809
fairly straightforward like and we would

730
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:14,909
just go read up on spherical harmonics

731
00:34:11,809 --> 00:34:18,230
evaluation and summations to figure out

732
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:22,110
what we're gonna do in terms of how to

733
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:24,780
update and compute the lighting based on

734
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:28,050
these but one thing that I would want to

735
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,570
know first a little bit is just what

736
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,340
exactly what why is it that for example

737
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,460
people are not using these as much

738
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:37,320
anymore so you know what do they know

739
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,090
that we don't know because this is part

740
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,090
of the rendering literature if if we go

741
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:47,789
look for example I don't know if you

742
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:49,500
remember but there's the there's the

743
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:51,750
paper that I mentioned originally when

744
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,230
we first started this if we go to

745
00:34:51,750 --> 00:35:01,920
Journal of graphics tools that's no no

746
00:34:55,230 --> 00:35:03,269
no what's it called now it's not called

747
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,389
that

748
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,389
[Music]

749
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:21,179
what so there's there's the thing that

750
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,679
that graphics gems become I thought it

751
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:24,839
was the Journal of graphics tools or

752
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:30,599
something like that I don't I don't

753
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:32,340
really remember and I don't remember

754
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:33,480
what it's actually called

755
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,030
ah Journal of computer graphics

756
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:43,320
techniques that's what I meant

757
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:44,820
so if we actually go and oh maybe we

758
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,990
should read that while we're at it

759
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:51,630
speaking of things if we actually go

760
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:53,519
here and look at the original paper or I

761
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,550
was thinking about which was this one

762
00:35:53,519 --> 00:36:01,349
and I mentioned it if we take a look at

763
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:05,910
the PDF here what I recall from looking

764
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:08,460
at this paper briefly was that they in

765
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:10,368
doing their lighting scheme and this is

766
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,449
a very recent paper on this obviously

767
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:15,990
where they're working with lighting

768
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:21,889
probes they didn't use spherical

769
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:24,149
harmonics they used a thing called I

770
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:26,639
guess they don't say what it's called

771
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,740
but it's octahedral I thought that had a

772
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:33,659
name but if they just so they store it

773
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:38,429
in some kind of 8x8 light sample so they

774
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:44,190
they store 64 values per probe which is

775
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:47,699
a lot if you ask me but they store 64

776
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:52,608
values per probe laid out in some way

777
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:55,349
right I don't know that we actually have

778
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,690
much information about how they're laid

779
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:59,690
out but I'm assuming they explain it

780
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,690
more

781
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:19,798
yeah I mean so if you look let's zoom in

782
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:21,390
here here's a like okay this PDF viewer

783
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:23,639
is rolling over and dying let's download

784
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:29,368
this and open it with the real PDF

785
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:39,659
viewer oh it's already there and by the

786
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:43,739
way let's download this too there it is

787
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:49,438
so if we look at I'll load that one up

788
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:51,239
as well if we look at what's in here you

789
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:55,168
can kind of zoom in and see this is how

790
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,849
they're encoding it and if you see the

791
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:59,938
encoding you can see there's a little

792
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:02,789
8x8 squares of lighting that they encode

793
00:37:59,938 --> 00:38:04,259
and I don't necessarily know exactly how

794
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:06,869
they're laid out but it's interesting to

795
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:10,438
note that like they decided to store 64

796
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:15,059
things pearlite probe right in a texture

797
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:19,768
that's how they're doing that and what

798
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:26,309
they actually do which is way more like

799
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:28,768
a 64 values for a for circle harmonics

800
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:31,039
would be insanely detailed right and

801
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:35,188
they specifically decided not to do that

802
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:37,079
so I'm imagining that maybe they know

803
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,699
something we don't and so let me just

804
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,869
give a sketch of some things they

805
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:44,179
probably know that we don't

806
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:47,489
and again this paper is written by total

807
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:49,679
render expert people right I mean Morgan

808
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:51,088
McGuire's like one of the most published

809
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,789
graphics researchers I can think of

810
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:56,068
right so you know this is not this

811
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,900
there's this is no joke so it's not like

812
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:58,798
this paper was by people who didn't

813
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,778
really know what they're doing and they

814
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:02,489
just stuff something's like if they did

815
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:04,559
it that way they probably knew something

816
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:06,208
we didn't or more specifically they know

817
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,569
the trade-offs very well and know how to

818
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:11,728
pick what to do and the thing that I

819
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,918
would mention is when we're doing our

820
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:16,259
voxel sample the reason we're doing

821
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:19,190
voxel samples is so that we can blend

822
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,570
neighboring light probes together and

823
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,670
otherwise there'd be no real reason to

824
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,670
do that like we don't really need voxels

825
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:29,579
for any other reason we just didn't know

826
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,619
any other real way of easily grabbing

827
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:34,860
the nearby light probes that we would

828
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:39,239
want to use and so I guess what I'm

829
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:42,269
wondering is how were they dealing with

830
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:48,149
that part because if we had an easy way

831
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:50,280
to just know to just do these samples in

832
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:52,200
some way where we just took samples from

833
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,580
multiple ones of these really easily and

834
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:56,009
then combine them and it wasn't a big

835
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,630
deal in the shader then maybe we just

836
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:01,800
would do that and we wouldn't have to

837
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:04,619
care right so I guess what I just want

838
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,200
to know some more details like how are

839
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:10,619
they doing this what exactly are they

840
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,599
doing for that part of the process and

841
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:15,170
and like how are they figuring out how

842
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,699
they want to shade these things right

843
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,829
and so you can see right here in figure

844
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:21,659
6 they're they're laying out what

845
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:26,360
happens there they're saying they sample

846
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:31,710
each probe in the 8 probe cage right and

847
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:34,410
that is exactly what we want to do and

848
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:38,090
so I guess how are they doing it do they

849
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:38,089
have their shader in here I don't know

850
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,659
sometimes they put shaders in the

851
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,660
appendix

852
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:59,949
so here's some examples of code in here

853
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,170
right so I don't know we could take a

854
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:04,449
look and we could see what they're doing

855
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,680
because maybe they're just doing

856
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:07,269
something that's like a really heavy

857
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:08,500
weight and large and we don't want to go

858
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:11,440
down that route cuz it's too expensive

859
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,420
or maybe they are doing something much

860
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,010
smarter than we're doing right and and

861
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,829
so that's just the thing that I want to

862
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:20,589
know so let's take a quick look cuz like

863
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:22,510
I said they're not using spherical marks

864
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:24,159
at all and it's not because they don't

865
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:26,859
know what they are right like I said

866
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:31,269
these these are experts in the field

867
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:33,400
they would know if spiracle Harmonix was

868
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:34,989
really smart in this case and offering a

869
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,940
lot of benefits they probably would have

870
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:39,039
used it I mean it's possible they didn't

871
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:41,769
because they find that this way is like

872
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,759
more straightforward and easy to debug I

873
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:45,369
mean I don't they could have had another

874
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,480
reason certainly but it's not like they

875
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,530
wouldn't have been aware of them or

876
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,949
wouldn't know how to implement them

877
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:52,450
because they would have alright so if we

878
00:41:50,949 --> 00:42:01,230
take a look here let me load up

879
00:41:52,449 --> 00:42:01,230
maybe notepad and see here

880
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:14,429
here's the source code for their shaders

881
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:16,848
I don't know what these are but let's

882
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:16,848
take a look

883
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:22,858
so generating random rays this is I mean

884
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:24,420
it's interesting we should probably look

885
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:28,139
at it sometime because it's like hey how

886
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,338
are current experts doing there it looks

887
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:33,748
like they're using spherical fibonacci

888
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:35,369
all right so you know that's interesting

889
00:42:33,748 --> 00:42:39,179
but not something I actually care about

890
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:40,739
it the immediate moment in here what we

891
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:44,308
because we looked at the circle for a

892
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:46,380
matcha tube if I look in here here's the

893
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:49,470
code for updating one of these probes

894
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,789
and so you can kind of see the sketch of

895
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:54,358
what they're doing so they go through

896
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:56,309
each probe and cast this number of rays

897
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:59,098
which I assume is just a constant if

898
00:42:56,309 --> 00:43:01,528
they tweak based on how you know good

899
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:05,338
they want versus versus the cost of the

900
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:07,798
update and so here you can see them

901
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:12,869
saying all right I'm going to do a

902
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:14,998
sample texture fetch on this Ray origin

903
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:18,239
here right which is the place we're

904
00:43:14,998 --> 00:43:21,419
trying to fetch from and that gets back

905
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:27,329
a probe location I assume then that this

906
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:37,739
is saying which probe we hit is based on

907
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:40,219
a sample that I assume is a voxel let's

908
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:40,219
take a look

909
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:53,730
so I guess I'm not sure so what we can

910
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:56,308
say is these are not voxels right so

911
00:43:53,730 --> 00:44:09,889
these are all two-dimensional look up

912
00:43:56,309 --> 00:44:15,390
tables and and I guess I don't really

913
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:17,308
understand so yeah I'm kind of confused

914
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:22,230
so here's the reason I'm confused so

915
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:23,640
looking up the raid erection by this C

916
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,440
value like these don't mean let's us

917
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,268
because this is the R value for the

918
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,099
array so this is how many rays I want to

919
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:32,548
cast I would have thought we would have

920
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:37,980
passed our here oh maybe this is like a

921
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:44,818
randomizer of some kind or something

922
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:48,028
like that so I'm I'm passing in which

923
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:50,880
probe and then the R value and maybe

924
00:44:48,028 --> 00:44:54,619
that is a two-dimensional vector because

925
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,298
I want to fetch I want to do my fetch

926
00:44:54,619 --> 00:45:00,450
based on having different Rea directions

927
00:44:57,298 --> 00:45:02,940
for different probes or something you

928
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:06,568
know I'm saying you're not totally sure

929
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:10,489
I get it but you can see that like we're

930
00:45:06,568 --> 00:45:14,389
fetching into a Direction table and

931
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:18,349
we're using both the Ray number and

932
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:22,108
which probe were on in order to do that

933
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:24,210
and so like I said I'm not 100% sure I

934
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:28,949
know because I don't know exactly what

935
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:34,108
that table looks like so that's not

936
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:36,449
great but you know hard to say anyway if

937
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:38,369
you take a look at these and we look at

938
00:45:36,449 --> 00:45:40,078
these you can see here that we're

939
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:41,700
basically saying like okay we're looking

940
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,420
at which direction I assumed which

941
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:49,230
direction we're casting in here where I

942
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,909
say ray hit radiance I don't know what

943
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,498
that would be doing either but I assume

944
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:56,929
it has something to do with the fact

945
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:56,929
that we are taking the

946
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:09,600
Shh no I guess I don't know what that's

947
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:11,070
doing either yeah I don't I don't really

948
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,699
know what these are doing because I'm

949
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:20,490
not also not sure what this fetch here

950
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:22,559
is talking about so is this just saying

951
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:24,389
that we packed this stuff maybe these

952
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:28,860
are just storage like is this just we

953
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:29,879
did the work on a previous time I mean

954
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,829
that could be right

955
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,240
these could just be things where we did

956
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:35,009
the work and we stored them and now

957
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:45,989
we're just getting them back by looking

958
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:49,380
at them up in fact that does look like

959
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:51,000
what they're doing okay so never mind so

960
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,059
I guess all this is doing is unpacking

961
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,119
them so it's doing update irradiance

962
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:59,579
probe based on samples it already took

963
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,500
so this is where we're actually doing

964
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:05,009
the work I guess and we just write it

965
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,480
out into those buffers probably I mean I

966
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:09,540
guess I don't know but that's what it

967
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,769
seer sort of seems like right so if we

968
00:47:09,539 --> 00:47:12,650
come through here let's take a look and

969
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:20,789
see if this makes any sense to us right

970
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:21,840
so if we look at you know this this

971
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:24,420
looks like something that takes a

972
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,230
direction in and produces part of the 2d

973
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:31,139
lookup so this like octant code here

974
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:35,730
look is that do we have how they're

975
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:38,809
doing the octagonal encoding because

976
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,809
that's pretty relevant to us

977
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:52,799
I'm not seeing it yes so I don't know

978
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:56,700
where the octant code code would be

979
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,250
maybe in you till now

980
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:02,969
so it may be that this is something they

981
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:12,320
didn't include I don't know

982
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:12,319
I assume none of this is relevant so

983
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:19,980
yeah I don't know where that öktem code

984
00:48:15,449 --> 00:48:23,069
function is exactly that would be pretty

985
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,719
relevant I could try to find it

986
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,860
separately but that was sort of part of

987
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,569
the thing I was wondering about right

988
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,930
it's like how are they choosing to do

989
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:33,360
those and codings and I and I don't

990
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:34,739
think we really got that answer because

991
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,380
it looks like that's just something that

992
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:39,689
happens and I don't see that code

993
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:45,840
anywhere in here unless I just scrolled

994
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:51,300
by it accidentally and I don't see it

995
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:51,930
like octahedral GLSL is probably what

996
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,900
we're looking for

997
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:57,899
I would assume and that's not included

998
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:03,829
in here now I don't know if maybe those

999
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,829
materials are included somewhere else

1000
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,579
yeah well let me take a look it's

1001
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,139
possible that this is just freely

1002
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:22,390
available like part of in videos like

1003
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:32,289
thing or whatever see if it exists

1004
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:33,909
somewhere here we go so here's how

1005
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:35,920
they're doing the Achtung code and

1006
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:40,389
decode assuming this is the same thing

1007
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,130
Oh in fact it is looks like same authors

1008
00:49:40,389 --> 00:49:46,239
- right well one of the same authors

1009
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,740
anyway so if we take a look at this we

1010
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,229
look at the encoding and decoding of

1011
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:53,649
those octahedral samples this is how

1012
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:56,139
they take a vector and go from where it

1013
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:58,630
would be in three-dimensional space

1014
00:49:56,139 --> 00:50:04,799
pointing in direction and then how they

1015
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:08,500
put it into an actual you know 2d square

1016
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,660
so first they essentially are taking the

1017
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,730
total magnitude right if you look at

1018
00:50:10,659 --> 00:50:14,379
this this is like a look at Euclidean

1019
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,519
one norm kind of a thing right we're

1020
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,369
taking the absolute value of each

1021
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,019
component of the direction and adding it

1022
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:22,780
together so that kind of gives us a

1023
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:30,460
value that's like look nothing can be

1024
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:34,119
higher than this right this is the this

1025
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,130
is the max value of our of our system

1026
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:39,568
that we're dealing with we then go and

1027
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:43,000
say all right take the XY coordinate of

1028
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:46,088
this so you know this is a three

1029
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,550
dimensional Direction so we've got an X

1030
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:50,049
and a Y and then we've got a Z we're

1031
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:52,839
gonna treat those as sort of two

1032
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:56,050
separate pieces so first we say let's

1033
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:59,588
take a 2d planar projection of this

1034
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:02,380
direction and let's make sure that it

1035
00:50:59,588 --> 00:51:06,338
conforms to the one norm so we're going

1036
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:12,940
to make this as long as it can possibly

1037
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:16,659
be right such that it's two values such

1038
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:19,179
that if you summed the X the Y and the Z

1039
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:21,759
together you would get one we're gonna

1040
00:51:19,179 --> 00:51:24,369
normalize the x and y that way

1041
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,760
but we're not actually normalizing the Z

1042
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:29,409
so we're saying that the X&amp;Y oh hey you

1043
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,630
know what it actually is called the one

1044
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:33,460
norm I didn't even read that when I said

1045
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:37,119
this is like the Euclidean one norm yeah

1046
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:38,710
it's literally the exam one norm not

1047
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,480
only were they taking the occluding one

1048
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:44,829
norm they knew they were taking the

1049
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:47,019
decoding aluminum so anyway so when we

1050
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:48,699
look at this we say okay this is

1051
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:52,090
normally what we expect to see done to

1052
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:54,389
the whole vector if you wanted XY and Z

1053
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:57,460
to sum up to one right

1054
00:51:54,389 --> 00:52:00,460
and when I say sum up to one I don't

1055
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:03,880
quite mean it in this case because these

1056
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:05,860
are not positive definite values so they

1057
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,289
could be negative that's what this

1058
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,990
absolute value here is doing so we're

1059
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:12,369
we're doing the operation that would

1060
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:14,500
make them sum to one if they were all

1061
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:16,269
positive but since they can be opposing

1062
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,769
signs they're not gonna do that anyway

1063
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:19,239
and furthermore we're doing something

1064
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:21,250
even a little bit weirder here which is

1065
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:22,599
which we're saying that not only that

1066
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,159
but we're only going to do that to the

1067
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:26,949
first two components we relieve the Z

1068
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,989
unchanged so then we're gonna do here is

1069
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:34,480
say look let's take a look at what the Z

1070
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:35,859
value is now right so before we touch it

1071
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,000
you know before we do anything to the Z

1072
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,039
value we're gonna take a look at what it

1073
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,420
is and what you can see happening here

1074
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:46,059
is the Z value itself we don't care

1075
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,940
about in a sense because you can see

1076
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:52,389
that when we return we just return the

1077
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:56,230
XY so we're basically getting Z out of

1078
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:58,809
this equation entirely so the only

1079
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:01,809
question is are we going to do something

1080
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:04,349
to the Z depending on the circumstance

1081
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:04,349
right

1082
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:15,100
and so what you can see here as we say

1083
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:18,279
alright when we do this in code if the Z

1084
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:21,219
was positive we don't do anything so

1085
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:25,350
we're just going to remember what the XY

1086
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:30,879
plane err version of this thing was

1087
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:33,190
normalized to the one norm and I guess

1088
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:42,039
to be completely honest with you I'm not

1089
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:48,220
sure why we do that but my guess would

1090
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:52,539
be that if we do that we are making

1091
00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:57,099
better use of the bits we have if we

1092
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:59,429
truncate this so that it's not stored in

1093
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:59,429
float

1094
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,800
so here's the thing I don't actually

1095
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:22,689
know why they're doing that that might

1096
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,200
be the reason why it might not be since

1097
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:30,880
they handily presented us with this I

1098
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:36,669
guess I would say let's take advantage

1099
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,930
of that so here's our survey of

1100
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:41,710
efficient representations for

1101
00:54:37,929 --> 00:54:44,379
independent unit vectors and you know in

1102
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:47,108
here we've got some stuff

1103
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,760
here's talking about this looks like a

1104
00:54:47,108 --> 00:54:52,509
pretty cool paper by the way never read

1105
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:55,540
it you know here we go we've got some

1106
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:58,510
stuff and here we go for 3d unit vectors

1107
00:54:55,539 --> 00:55:00,579
and here's some stuff we could do we can

1108
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:03,460
store three floats that's the complete

1109
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:05,579
thing we could store s norms we could do

1110
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:09,429
a spherical mapping we could do a cube

1111
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:12,670
we can do a warped cube we can do that

1112
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:19,169
long we can do octahedral which is what

1113
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:21,159
we're actually talking about now and hey

1114
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,720
this is the one we care about so let's

1115
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:24,129
pause here although here's a bunch of

1116
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,639
other things or it looks like actually

1117
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:29,318
not a bunch there's only two more Stern

1118
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,699
concentric so here's the octahedral

1119
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:32,769
mapping it basically says all right

1120
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:36,879
let's talk about these as if they were

1121
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:39,730
on a actual tetrahedron

1122
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:43,150
I suppose octahedron so to tetrahedrons

1123
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:44,530
one on the top on the bottom and you

1124
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:45,849
could actually see so this is a great

1125
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,119
diagram now I know exactly what they're

1126
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,530
doing

1127
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:48,818
and this was gonna be pretty hard for me

1128
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:51,550
to determine and I've think about it a

1129
00:55:48,818 --> 00:55:52,539
lot harder to get to here here's they're

1130
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,400
doing they're just saying look we got a

1131
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:56,769
sphere let's take each section of the

1132
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,300
sphere map it to an octahedron let's

1133
00:55:56,769 --> 00:56:02,588
take each octahedral piece and unfold it

1134
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:05,099
into a square lovely that's that's great

1135
00:56:02,588 --> 00:56:08,279
I love it

1136
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:08,280
don't ever change

1137
00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:14,400
all right so now we can see what the

1138
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:15,389
Euclidean 1 norm does Euclidean 1 norm

1139
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,260
is actually the thing that takes this

1140
00:56:15,389 --> 00:56:20,489
curve here and straightens it so what

1141
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,590
the occluding in one room is doing is

1142
00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:24,299
it's this this transform here is

1143
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:26,730
Euclidean 1 norm because the Euclidean 1

1144
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:34,220
norm of a sphere is an octahedron is one

1145
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:34,219
way to think of it right I I want to say

1146
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,030
that

1147
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:51,629
I want to say that this diagram is also

1148
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:54,220
almost ACTA this might be a little small

1149
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:55,900
but I want to say this diagram is almost

1150
00:56:54,219 --> 00:57:00,629
accurate to scale in the sense that

1151
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:04,150
these points will remain the same so the

1152
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:07,300
point like right here like the point

1153
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:09,309
where these regions meet where the where

1154
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,990
you see the cross-sections and the color

1155
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:17,559
change the points where lines meet on

1156
00:57:13,989 --> 00:57:19,689
this diagram will remain in place so

1157
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:21,730
from here to here the this looks like

1158
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:23,710
maybe it's like a little bit but other

1159
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,210
than that slight amount of shrinking if

1160
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:27,608
you imagine blowing this out so that

1161
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:29,710
just a slight bit so that these points

1162
00:57:27,608 --> 00:57:32,858
lined up there there there there and

1163
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:35,349
there right that's actually what will

1164
00:57:32,858 --> 00:57:36,759
literally happen because at those points

1165
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:39,760
the one norm won't do anything because

1166
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:43,450
one of the coordinates is one and the

1167
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,250
others are zero at those points so you

1168
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:47,409
will literally get the same point back

1169
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:49,989
when you one norm all right scissors

1170
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:52,960
Berg so that's the one norm goes to the

1171
00:57:49,989 --> 00:57:55,059
octahedron love it and then the next

1172
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,639
step is just saying all right at that

1173
00:57:55,059 --> 00:58:01,750
point we're just gonna flatten this

1174
00:57:57,639 --> 00:58:03,279
thing down onto the onto the plane by

1175
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,349
looking at it from the top down and the

1176
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,050
only thing we need to do now is say if

1177
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:09,460
you were on the bottom of this thing we

1178
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,010
don't want you to write into the same

1179
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,659
location so we're gonna flip you out

1180
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:17,050
right we're gonna take if you would have

1181
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:18,670
been in this part down here right then

1182
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,990
instead of writing to here we want you

1183
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:22,530
to write to here so there's gonna flip

1184
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:25,358
you we're gonna unfold you basically

1185
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:28,119
love it

1186
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,380
this is great I'm really glad I opened

1187
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:32,470
up that paper that looks awesome

1188
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:34,690
I don't remember where I was looking at

1189
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:37,449
this value I think it was on some github

1190
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:41,159
page somewhere give me that could've

1191
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:45,848
come back to me there yeah so that's

1192
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:48,819
this step right here that goes from a

1193
00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:51,580
sphere to an octahedron happy birthday

1194
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:53,859
this right here says are we on the top

1195
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:55,659
or the bottom of the octahedron if we're

1196
00:58:53,858 --> 00:58:58,360
on the top of it we're

1197
00:58:55,659 --> 00:59:00,129
because this is just what we wanted but

1198
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:02,710
if we're on the bottom of the octahedron

1199
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:04,360
we have to flip you out and the way

1200
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:06,970
they're gonna flip us out here is

1201
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:12,360
they're going to say all right let's

1202
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:15,939
take the absolute value of whatever the

1203
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:18,190
XY that we produced we're gonna flip the

1204
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:20,170
coordinates so the Y goes into the X the

1205
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:23,920
X goes into the Y we're just Swizzle it

1206
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:28,090
right and then we're gonna take it and

1207
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:30,789
subtract that from one okay now what

1208
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:37,539
that we'd have the effect of doing in

1209
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:39,909
this case is as so these values right

1210
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:44,920
what would let me just go back to that

1211
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:45,909
diagram here kind of a bit of a head in

1212
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,710
your head you kinda have to imagine

1213
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:48,639
these things happening so if we take a

1214
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:51,670
look at what's happening on the

1215
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:54,839
octahedron here we have one of the faces

1216
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:56,740
of the octahedron we already know that

1217
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:59,650
regardless of whether it let's let's

1218
00:59:56,739 --> 01:00:01,269
take these down here or right here let's

1219
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,789
do no let's do these two because these

1220
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:05,139
two we can see clearly so if we're gonna

1221
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:08,500
do these and it's got a little arrow

1222
01:00:05,139 --> 01:00:10,829
pointed to so you can see this face we

1223
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:12,849
know we're gonna be in this triangle

1224
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:15,730
regardless of whether we're on the red

1225
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:17,500
face or the blue face right but if we're

1226
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:19,630
on the blue face we're trying to push

1227
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,190
ourselves out to here but we know that

1228
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,760
we're actually gonna be here and and

1229
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:29,679
where are we gonna be on here well if

1230
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:32,470
the Z was one we're gonna be here if the

1231
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:34,179
Z was zero we're gonna be here and based

1232
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:36,719
on the x and y you know we're gonna be

1233
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:39,159
somewhere in here through all of those

1234
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:42,339
you know through all of the in-between

1235
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:46,089
values and so what we want to be able to

1236
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:52,390
do is say all right if we were on this

1237
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:55,870
line so let's say Z was in fact zero

1238
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:59,230
then we're on this line if Z is 1 we're

1239
01:00:55,869 --> 01:01:01,059
out here so we know that at Z 1 we're

1240
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:04,869
gonna have to push ourselves out to the

1241
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:08,199
far extreme and what you can see about

1242
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:09,309
that is saying like alright if the Z was

1243
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:11,230
1 then both of

1244
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:14,259
are going to be zero and so hey guess

1245
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:18,250
what we're literally at 1:1 at that

1246
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:19,810
point right so we kind of know that that

1247
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,730
will produce the right answer for us

1248
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:25,119
because it's like yeah we know we're

1249
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:30,010
gonna be at 1 1 if this absolute value

1250
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:32,650
here if these are both 0 so now the

1251
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:35,080
question is what do we need to do with

1252
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:37,030
them otherwise well I guess what we're

1253
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:38,860
sort of saying with the cuz this part is

1254
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:42,820
a little confusing why are we taking the

1255
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:44,530
absolute value of those right and I

1256
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:47,440
guess the reason that we want to take

1257
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:50,170
the absolute value of those is because

1258
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,920
it's difficult for us we were we're

1259
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:57,250
trying to simplify this we're trying to

1260
01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:02,829
make one line of code right that works

1261
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:06,010
by having that will work all in all

1262
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:08,049
quadrants because we could write just

1263
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:12,700
this expression and probably make it

1264
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:14,710
work for any quadrant if we if we knew

1265
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:17,169
which quadrant we were in then we

1266
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:19,750
wouldn't take the absolute value we just

1267
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:21,190
put the correct version of one in here

1268
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:23,769
negative one positive one whatever he

1269
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:26,019
wanted such that when we added this

1270
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:29,199
value it would just continue to push it

1271
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:30,610
away into the correct region so I guess

1272
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,980
what this is doing is just saying look

1273
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:36,010
we want to be able to do that just by

1274
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:38,500
doing the sine of each of these whatever

1275
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:40,740
the sign was and reconstructing that

1276
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:43,809
later right

1277
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:47,289
so this basically says let's pretend

1278
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:51,009
because result YX being absolute values

1279
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:54,579
he's saying let's pretend we were up in

1280
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:57,070
this region always right and we know

1281
01:02:54,579 --> 01:02:59,980
that at that point if we just negate

1282
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:02,080
these and flip them we can make it so

1283
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:04,030
that we fill this triangle the way that

1284
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,690
the way that it would line up normally

1285
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,690
right

1286
01:03:17,619 --> 01:03:27,059
and I guess on this particular line Z is

1287
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:27,059
zero

1288
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:44,288
you know I'm gonna have to be honest

1289
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:47,249
with you I don't understand why we

1290
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:47,249
flipped the why in the ex

1291
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:33,838
so I literally have no idea why the Y

1292
01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:49,119
and the X would be flipped there and and

1293
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:52,328
I just I just don't understand so let's

1294
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:56,619
suppose that I was trying to unfold this

1295
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:58,509
and so I'm you know maybe we're in this

1296
01:04:56,619 --> 01:05:01,829
region so this region is down back

1297
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:05,889
moments this part back here right I

1298
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:07,539
would assume that my goal here is that

1299
01:05:05,889 --> 01:05:09,639
I'm trying to make it so that the

1300
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:16,900
lighting values like line up along this

1301
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:18,429
line right I mean I want all of these

1302
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:21,059
lines like that I want to line up with

1303
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:23,469
that and this I want to line up with

1304
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:26,739
like this part I want to line up with

1305
01:05:23,469 --> 01:05:28,239
that part so along the diagonal if I

1306
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:30,190
want to line up I would think what would

1307
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:33,818
happen is all right so let's suppose

1308
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:37,539
I've got and I step out to like here so

1309
01:05:33,818 --> 01:05:39,338
I've got a high Y value and a low X

1310
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:43,180
value like my x value is here and I've

1311
01:05:39,338 --> 01:05:46,838
got a high Y value right and then I just

1312
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:49,419
take that one step slightly over here so

1313
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:51,759
does it mean that no I guess it does you

1314
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:55,150
know what it totally makes sense now so

1315
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:57,759
I will have a high x value because I

1316
01:05:55,150 --> 01:06:00,369
need to subtract a high value to get out

1317
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:03,940
to here and I'd have a low Y value nope

1318
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:05,199
all right totally fine it's a little it

1319
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,849
was not intuitive to me that that would

1320
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,009
be the case but totally makes sense

1321
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:11,199
because once you start subtracting the

1322
01:06:09,009 --> 01:06:12,429
values and you're trying to make them go

1323
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:14,459
the other direction

1324
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:17,588
that is exactly what happens because

1325
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:20,169
because rather than coming away from

1326
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:22,420
this line I'm going to that I've taken a

1327
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:24,869
90 degree turn so that does make good

1328
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:27,190
sense all right

1329
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:30,278
and then finally the last place here for

1330
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:32,409
sign not zero that's just the quadrant

1331
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:33,969
push as far as I can tell so basically

1332
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:35,108
we're just saying look we're gonna do

1333
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:37,058
everything as if it was up in this

1334
01:06:35,108 --> 01:06:39,788
quadrant and then we just need to flip

1335
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:41,619
you to the correct side right so what

1336
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:43,569
we're gonna do here is take the sign of

1337
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:48,068
whatever it was we started with and put

1338
01:06:43,568 --> 01:06:51,009
that sign back in right this is great I

1339
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:52,778
never knew this I'm really glad we like

1340
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:56,460
that this is a fantastic encoding I

1341
01:06:52,778 --> 01:07:06,699
think that is just absolutely delightful

1342
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:12,420
I mean that that's that's just

1343
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:12,419
delightful I really like that a lot

1344
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:21,400
yeah I mean I mean I have no complaints

1345
01:07:19,778 --> 01:07:24,039
about this that just looks that just

1346
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,260
looks great the one thing that's that's

1347
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:31,900
that's maybe not the best thing in the

1348
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:35,859
world is that you know you do have a you

1349
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:37,269
do have a extra mass computation in

1350
01:07:35,858 --> 01:07:38,288
there that's maybe not the best in the

1351
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:40,298
world but that's okay I mean it's just

1352
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:42,789
that's one test and then that's just

1353
01:07:40,298 --> 01:07:47,518
used for predication I mean this is this

1354
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:52,890
is really cheap at the end of the day

1355
01:07:47,518 --> 01:07:55,538
you know abs is like it's like one and

1356
01:07:52,889 --> 01:08:00,308
four each and then you got the two ads

1357
01:07:55,539 --> 01:08:02,140
and then you've got one reciprocal not

1358
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:07,028
even square-root reciprocal but just

1359
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:13,739
straightforward reciprocal one multiply

1360
01:08:07,028 --> 01:08:19,569
one test and then a masked a sign of

1361
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:26,759
subtracts another and another and and an

1362
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:26,759
or really I mean that is really cheap

1363
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,960
that is really really cheap

1364
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,150
um so I'm pretty glad we looked at that

1365
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:36,889
to be honest with you I feel like that

1366
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:38,149
was really educational I've never seen

1367
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:40,100
that encoding before because again I'm

1368
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:41,299
not being a really strong graphics guy

1369
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:44,539
it's not what I spend most of my time on

1370
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:47,570
I don't necessarily know all the good

1371
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:50,539
tricks the latest tricks and as these

1372
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:51,979
sorts of things come down the pipe it's

1373
01:08:50,539 --> 01:08:53,600
good to be aware of them right because

1374
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:55,729
some of them can be really helpful

1375
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,780
that's a great thing I yeah I don't

1376
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:58,489
necessarily know right now we're gonna

1377
01:08:56,779 --> 01:09:02,199
use it but I mean like I really wanted

1378
01:08:58,489 --> 01:09:06,949
to know that that's that's pretty great

1379
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:08,510
so moving back now okay so now we know

1380
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:10,159
how to do these octahedral encodings

1381
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:12,440
that's great because that means yeah we

1382
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:14,090
can pack anything in there that means

1383
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:16,819
again we don't really have to use if we

1384
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:21,260
don't want to we don't have to really

1385
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:24,019
figure out much with respect to how we

1386
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:25,460
look at those recordings so this gets us

1387
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,470
back to just the next question which is

1388
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:31,130
locates a pose we were encoding those

1389
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:34,100
things we still have the problem of we

1390
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:35,449
need to build the cage and when we look

1391
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,609
at what they were doing to build the

1392
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:41,779
cage it looks like someone on the chat

1393
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:45,920
had suggested that we use voxels for the

1394
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:47,960
lookups and so we did end up trying that

1395
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,659
but what I had done before then was

1396
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:55,609
effectively build the cage right we did

1397
01:09:50,659 --> 01:09:57,769
do this is exactly what we had been

1398
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:59,630
doing we looked at what direction we

1399
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:04,250
were going to sample and we would pick

1400
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:06,590
the we would basically pick which parts

1401
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:11,210
we which of the light probes in the cage

1402
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:12,650
we were gonna sample right so maybe we

1403
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:21,109
just go back to doing that because let's

1404
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:24,259
say we did that if we did that then what

1405
01:10:21,109 --> 01:10:26,750
we could do was we could just pack our

1406
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:28,909
samples in using octahedral just like

1407
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:33,710
they're doing here because again like I

1408
01:10:28,909 --> 01:10:35,989
said these guys are experts what they're

1409
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:38,689
doing is either correct or at least

1410
01:10:35,989 --> 01:10:41,059
correct for in RTX 2080 so the really

1411
01:10:38,689 --> 01:10:42,649
only real question is are they doing

1412
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:44,780
something that's just too much for us

1413
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:50,839
like that that's a little too have

1414
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:53,239
high-power so if we want to do this we

1415
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,789
could imagine storing octahedral samples

1416
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:58,460
for our lighting on whatever size we

1417
01:10:55,789 --> 01:11:01,010
actually decided we wanted right so

1418
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:03,109
could be whatever size we want and then

1419
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:06,680
we just have in our voxel what our

1420
01:11:03,109 --> 01:11:11,089
actual light probes are that indexes

1421
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:12,940
into where they would be right and then

1422
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:16,130
what we would have to do is we'd have to

1423
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:19,939
take a look in the voxel we'd have to

1424
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:22,760
use the direction to pick out what we

1425
01:11:19,939 --> 01:11:25,579
were going to interpolate between right

1426
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:28,640
so we would have to use like the

1427
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:32,750
direction vector to pick for voxel

1428
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,850
samples we'd take an octahedral sample

1429
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:37,210
from each of those four and then blend

1430
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:37,210
it together

1431

01:11:58,998 --> 01:12:06,019
I mean I don't know man it seems pretty

1433
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:08,058
good right anyway so looking a little

1434
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:09,739
bit further in here you can see that

1435
01:12:08,059 --> 01:12:12,619
they're they're actually describing this

1436
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:14,029
technique in detail and if you look at

1437
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:17,420
what they say here I think it's probably

1438
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:20,059
worth just going over each of these

1439
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:21,319
points because like I said we've already

1440
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:29,510
learned something pretty good which is

1441
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:31,158
the octahedral encoding and that seems

1442
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:33,139
like it's really it would be really fast

1443
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:34,399
to sample right because when you want to

1444
01:12:33,139 --> 01:12:36,380
take a sample in a direction

1445
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:39,529
all you're doing now is octahedrally

1446
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:42,409
encoding just that sample direction and

1447
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:44,899
then it's one texture lookup to get that

1448
01:12:42,408 --> 01:12:46,908
blend because it's gonna place it right

1449
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:51,109
where it should blend now there's a

1450
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:53,408
little bit of of an issue that happens

1451
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:59,748
when you're gonna wrap around the edge

1452
01:12:53,408 --> 01:13:02,448
and I don't really know what you do to

1453
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:04,130
fix that but like one example would be

1454
01:13:02,448 --> 01:13:09,228
to just turn on rap sampling and use a

1455
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:11,599
texture array I mean right I don't know

1456
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:14,030
do they not do that I don't know why

1457
01:13:11,599 --> 01:13:19,190
they wouldn't but I didn't see them say

1458
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:20,569
anything about that but maybe they do we

1459
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:23,808
can go look at their code since we have

1460
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:26,109
it now where was that image with the

1461
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:26,110
things

1462
01:13:39,729 --> 01:13:51,009
I was I'm just curious they say whether

1463
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:52,929
they use the texture rate for this so

1464
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:59,949
for some reason they say packing all the

1465
01:13:52,930 --> 01:14:03,250
probes in an atlas but I guess I don't

1466
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:04,539
understand why why wouldn't you put them

1467
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:06,579
in a texture array because if you put

1468
01:14:04,539 --> 01:14:08,260
them in a texture array then like this

1469
01:14:06,579 --> 01:14:10,949
is so what they're saying here is

1470
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:17,440
exactly what I didn't didn't want to do

1471
01:14:10,949 --> 01:14:22,380
and this this one pixel gutter border

1472
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:24,699
was exactly what I did not want right so

1473
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:26,020
why wouldn't you pack them into a

1474
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:27,579
texture array because if you packed them

1475
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,500
into a texture array then you wouldn't

1476
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:31,420
need the gutter because you just set it

1477
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:35,250
to wrapped sampling and it would sample

1478
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:42,190
the proper part of the octahedron right

1479
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:43,630
so I mean once again the problem here is

1480
01:14:42,189 --> 01:14:44,649
if I thought these people were idiots I

1481
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:46,119
just feel like oh they didn't think of

1482
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:47,679
it but like I said these people are

1483
01:14:46,119 --> 01:14:49,960
pretty much the most knowledgeable

1484
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:51,970
people you could probably ask for so if

1485
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:54,310
they didn't do it they probably had a

1486
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:57,880
reason so it always makes me nervous

1487
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:59,789
because when somebody who I think knows

1488
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,859
what they're doing doesn't do something

1489
01:14:59,789 --> 01:15:03,789
it's not really a good idea to assume

1490
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:06,279
that it's just because they didn't think

1491
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:11,010
of it that's probably a bad idea right

1492
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:11,009
so I'm wondering what I'm missing there

1493
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:20,920
because I feel like it's probably

1494
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:23,259
something but I don't know what yeah so

1495
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,119
I don't know that's that's an outside

1496
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,920
thing I would say my first shot at it

1497
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:32,559
would be do it in a new texture ray

1498
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:41,770
that's my first thought and I I don't

1499
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:44,400
know crap why didn't they do it in a

1500
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,400
texture ray

1501
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:02,690
so let's think about this again

1502
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:08,270
so maybe I'm wrong and this doesn't line

1503
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:11,539
up properly let me think about this

1504
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:13,909
octahedron a little more carefully I'm

1505
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:24,319
gonna go to the whiteboard so that I can

1506
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:33,460
see guess suddenly it's a blackboard all

1507
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:33,460
right sue oops

1508
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:51,658
what I need to know here is let's

1509
01:16:38,488 --> 01:16:52,769
suppose that I take my octahedron this

1510
01:16:51,658 --> 01:16:56,000
is the really bad drawing of an

1511
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:56,000
octahedron and I apologize

1512
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:19,710
all right so here are the faces of my

1513
01:17:17,649 --> 01:17:22,659
octahedron and granted they're not great

1514
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:26,409
but let's try to number them so here's a

1515
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:28,859
here's B here's C here's D letter them I

1516
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:32,699
should say right going around the top

1517
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:41,369
and then going around the bottom will

1518
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:44,199
number them again e f a b c d e f g h

1519
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:45,819
right so looking at these it's like that

1520
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:47,470
points that way that points this way

1521
01:17:45,819 --> 01:17:50,590
that points this way this points that

1522
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:54,400
way right that's that way that way that

1523
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:55,960
way that way now what we're seeing is

1524
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,210
that if we were then to look at this at

1525
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:07,170
the top down right so now we're gonna

1526
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:09,039
like smoosh this into a square like so

1527
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:11,020
then when we look at what these values

1528
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:13,869
are we're we're saying that this was a

1529
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:17,980
this was B this was C and this was D

1530
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:20,289
right and then when we did our push on

1531
01:18:17,979 --> 01:18:24,069
these guys we would expect this to be H

1532
01:18:20,289 --> 01:18:26,229
this to be e this to be F and this to be

1533
01:18:24,069 --> 01:18:30,429
G if I'm not mistaken that's what we're

1534
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:33,009
saying right and so if I look at what

1535
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:36,130
the borders sampling would be if we in

1536
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:40,180
wrap mode what it would be well that'd

1537
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:43,869
be F and that would be G right that

1538
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:45,909
would be H and that would be e right I

1539
01:18:43,869 --> 01:18:46,989
mean I'm not doing anything fancy here

1540
01:18:45,909 --> 01:18:48,489
where I'm just looking at what would be

1541
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:51,250
on the other side of it that would be G

1542
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:57,579
that would be F that would be e that

1543
01:18:51,250 --> 01:19:00,460
would be H right so the question is is

1544
01:18:57,579 --> 01:19:03,340
that the correct thing is the border

1545
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:08,890
between F and G and F and E actually

1546
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:12,069
here right so if this was face F like so

1547
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:14,140
and I'm talking about crawling along the

1548
01:19:12,069 --> 01:19:15,670
border from B so here's B and I come

1549
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:19,060
around the border this way right so

1550
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:21,579
that's me crossing in here our E and G

1551
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:25,770
on either side of my face and the answer

1552
01:19:21,579 --> 01:19:28,199
is yes they are right so I'm

1553
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:30,990
not sure like doesn't that just work

1554
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:32,460
everywhere like I mean is there anywhere

1555
01:19:30,989 --> 01:19:35,699
that doesn't work like so here's the H

1556
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:38,189
face it should have a and G on either

1557
01:19:35,699 --> 01:19:41,659
side of it and it does I mean it just

1558
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:44,869
seems like wraps sampling just works

1559
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:44,869
doesn't it

1560
01:19:52,729 --> 01:19:57,889
what am I missing oh is it flipped

1561
01:19:55,908 --> 01:20:02,170
people in the chat were saying that it

1562
01:19:57,889 --> 01:20:08,059
was flipped meaning that like this and

1563
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:10,779
this are going in the wrong are going

1564
01:20:08,059 --> 01:20:13,400
the wrong orientation so these are like

1565
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:23,958
you know as you go over here it comes

1566
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:26,299
the other way around I guess let's see

1567
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:29,420
if that's true so let's suppose I walked

1568
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:31,369
from here to here in the midpoint right

1569
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:33,679
because we don't really care where that

1570
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:37,969
is and now what we're saying is all

1571
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:39,800
right I'm gonna go to the I'm only gonna

1572
01:20:37,969 --> 01:20:42,139
go a little bit in so I'm not going to

1573
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:46,219
go very far down and I'm going to go

1574
01:20:42,139 --> 01:20:48,920
over to the G side of the face right so

1575
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:51,590
if I were to walk directly down to that

1576
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:55,429
side so let's say I was to walk here so

1577
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:57,139
I'm gonna cross over on D right so if I

1578
01:20:55,429 --> 01:21:02,449
was going to cross over on the midpoint

1579
01:20:57,139 --> 01:21:06,109
on D and go to where I would be on H

1580
01:21:02,448 --> 01:21:08,808
right then I'm basically saying like

1581
01:21:06,109 --> 01:21:10,998
let's say I crossed on this side here it

1582
01:21:08,809 --> 01:21:14,630
would be like sort of up there right on

1583
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:16,340
H and so if on here I said I was gonna

1584
01:21:14,630 --> 01:21:18,409
do the same thing to try and get to that

1585
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:22,670
point let's say I went to here I'd be

1586
01:21:18,408 --> 01:21:25,638
sort of up towards here right and then

1587
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:33,729
I'd cross in on here which at which

1588
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:33,729
point would put me on this face

1589
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:48,319
wait I'm looking at the wrong side I'm

1590
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:50,000
sorry I'm trying to go to gh is totally

1591
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:51,739
out of question so I never mind so try

1592
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,880
to go to G so let's suppose I wanted to

1593
01:21:51,739 --> 01:22:00,500
walk over to G right yeah okay I see the

1594
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:04,369
problem so this should go to G but

1595
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:08,390
instead it goes to e that's the problem

1596
01:22:04,369 --> 01:22:13,369
cuz these are wrong right so as I come

1597
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:18,670
up and and sample outside of this I'm

1598
01:22:13,369 --> 01:22:18,670
actually trying to go over here right

1599
01:22:44,100 --> 01:23:05,550
want to see something just curious does

1600
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:08,820
this have ducks on the wrapping mode

1601
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:08,820
here anywhere

1602
01:23:22,409 --> 01:23:34,238
so it's interesting like if you look at

1603
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:38,050
these so GL mirrored repeat is really

1604
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:40,299
close to what you want so it's almost

1605
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:42,610
like we could have supported sampling

1606
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:46,440
this thing right but you would have

1607
01:23:42,609 --> 01:23:50,189
needed you would have needed this to

1608
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:55,809
actually support flipping the Y in the X

1609
01:23:50,189 --> 01:23:59,979
U and I'm saying to you so it's kind of

1610
01:23:55,810 --> 01:24:01,390
a bummer because it seems like it seems

1611
01:23:59,979 --> 01:24:05,769
like you could have actually made this

1612
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:08,619
work anyway that explains why they don't

1613
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:10,540
bother with this right because if you

1614
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:12,729
can't quite make that work then it's

1615
01:24:10,539 --> 01:24:14,979
just a it's just not worth it right

1616
01:24:12,729 --> 01:24:16,869
there's if you there's no reason to

1617
01:24:14,979 --> 01:24:20,379
using a texture array if you can't

1618
01:24:16,869 --> 01:24:21,988
actually use the wrap sampling that's a

1619
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:25,390
bummer

1620
01:24:21,988 --> 01:24:31,779
because you almost can write it's pretty

1621
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:33,789
close but but no cigar so I guess I

1622
01:24:31,779 --> 01:24:36,099
don't know what they end up doing for

1623
01:24:33,789 --> 01:24:39,449
that like do they try to add because you

1624
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:42,370
would want the padding in there probably

1625
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:46,619
maybe you don't actually care I mean you

1626
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:46,619
could use clamp I suppose

1627
01:24:50,800 --> 01:25:00,039
I want to take before we conclude for

1628
01:24:57,939 --> 01:25:01,029
today I think this does give us a good

1629
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:05,109
thing to kind of know what we might want

1630
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:09,219
to try tomorrow but looking in here if

1631
01:25:05,109 --> 01:25:10,929
we take a look at all of this stuff this

1632
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,190
is the part I want to go through so when

1633
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:13,539
they actually want to sample their cage

1634
01:25:12,189 --> 01:25:16,389
what they do is they say all right you

1635
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:20,229
they call probes that lie below the

1636
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:22,480
shading points tangent plane right and

1637
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:24,069
using a soft special that falls off

1638
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:25,329
smoothly as the dot product of the

1639
01:25:24,069 --> 01:25:27,279
shading normal with the direction

1640
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:30,279
towards a probe approaches zero that's

1641
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:34,710
exactly what we did - right because you

1642
01:25:30,279 --> 01:25:34,710
want to like blend them out as you go

1643
01:25:34,859 --> 01:25:39,039
and then here we say we apply a

1644
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:40,480
perceptive based weighting to account

1645
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:42,819
for the human visual system sensitivity

1646
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,739
to low intensity lighting in otherwise

1647
01:25:42,819 --> 01:25:46,659
dark regions we reduce the graduation of

1648
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:48,039
very low radiance values less than 5% of

1649
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:51,489
their episode according to a montage

1650
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:53,800
using curved profile that sounds like

1651
01:25:51,489 --> 01:25:55,059
interesting but not really quite related

1652
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,789
to us constructing the scheme that's

1653
01:25:55,060 --> 01:26:01,240
like more of a light I mean you can kind

1654
01:25:57,789 --> 01:26:03,939
of see for all of these things this is

1655
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:07,119
maybe getting a little too hardcore but

1656
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:09,159
it's ok we offset the shading point

1657
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:10,420
according to a bias proportional to the

1658
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:11,949
shading normal and the direction of the

1659
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:13,270
probes this improves the rest of the

1660
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:14,859
visibility based interpolation weights

1661
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:17,710
by moving away from potential shadowed

1662
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:18,880
unshadowed discontinuities and we then

1663
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:20,199
perform a standard for linear

1664
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,940
interpolation based on the distance

1665
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:24,099
between the shading point and the probe

1666
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:27,609
centers using the aforementioned waiting

1667
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:34,900
and biasing factors trilinear

1668
01:26:27,609 --> 01:26:38,559
interpolation so what they're saying is

1669
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:42,869
they actually do all eight and they just

1670
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,870
wait these less

1671
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:55,649
that seems fine all right so if we

1672
01:26:51,069 --> 01:26:55,649
imagine doing eight octahedral samples

1673
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,279
you know how much does that scare me

1674
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:24,100
so I'm going to go ahead and say that

1675
01:27:22,179 --> 01:27:26,199
doesn't really scare me so let's suppose

1676
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:32,369
that we wanted to do eight octahedral

1677
01:27:26,198 --> 01:27:32,368
samples to produce the blend here

1678
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:46,829
if we wanted to do eight octahedral

1679
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:52,550
samples we would take the position we

1680
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:56,369
would produce the value that we thought

1681
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:58,500
we would produce an index from that that

1682
01:27:56,369 --> 01:28:00,269
we could use based on the just the

1683
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,670
position value right we'd map it into

1684
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:07,110
the voxel and we would use its voxel

1685
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:10,109
coordinate to produce effectively a 2d

1686
01:28:07,109 --> 01:28:12,109
index into a giant texture that had all

1687
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:14,429
our octahedral samples right just by

1688
01:28:12,109 --> 01:28:17,549
taking the Z multiplying it by the x

1689
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:19,320
times the y to unfold it and then making

1690
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:23,720
sure that we blew out the values by

1691
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:27,630
however big each octahedral square was

1692
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:30,030
right we would do that eight times to

1693
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:36,090
produce eight different coordinates

1694
01:28:30,029 --> 01:28:38,039
inside the octahedral sheet so so far

1695
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:43,110
we've taken no texture samples and then

1696
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:44,519
we just take eight 2d texture samples we

1697
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:47,130
then trilinear them together and we're

1698
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:54,630
done traveling in together is kind of

1699
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:55,489
expensive certainly but it's not that

1700
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:59,430
expensive

1701
01:28:55,489 --> 01:29:01,229
so one trilinear and 8 texture samples

1702
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:01,770
seems pretty good to me I'm sold I'm

1703
01:29:01,229 --> 01:29:05,729
sold

1704
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:10,940
I think this is okay I can do this we'll

1705
01:29:05,729 --> 01:29:10,939
do it tomorrow let's go to Q&amp;A

1706
01:30:13,998 --> 01:30:18,939
what is tomorrow well tomorrow we got to

1707
01:30:16,309 --> 01:30:18,940
go implement this

1708
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:53,420
are you preferring chrome over Firefox

1709
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:57,760
and if yes what's the reason not really

1710
01:30:53,420 --> 01:31:01,569
I actually have been using Firefox on my

1711
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:05,480
other machines lately and on my phone

1712
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:13,699
and I guess I've never really bothered

1713
01:31:05,479 --> 01:31:15,439
to switch this one over but shake Jess

1714
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:16,519
Scott's question you mentioned on

1715
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:17,899
Twitter you were building you learned

1716
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:20,930
program course can you tell us more

1717
01:31:17,899 --> 01:31:24,500
about it yes

1718
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:27,710
so I've got beta testers signed up right

1719
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:31,970
now I hope to start getting the testing

1720
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:35,119
started this week and it'll be a couple

1721
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:38,990
weeks of me giving them content and

1722
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:46,550
seeing how they do with it and then

1723
01:31:38,989 --> 01:31:48,710
adjusting that content so it's it's

1724
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:50,390
gonna be a little bit but I hope to have

1725
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:52,130
the course out in short order I'm just

1726
01:31:50,390 --> 01:31:54,079
I'm trying to make it so that basically

1727
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:55,430
like it'll be out for you soon it's not

1728
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:59,510
gonna be like a years long development

1729
01:31:55,430 --> 01:32:01,940
thing so at the very least it should be

1730
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:03,739
out in like an early access forum like

1731
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:06,739
once I'm fairly certain that it's like

1732
01:32:03,739 --> 01:32:09,619
got this it's that it's got all the

1733
01:32:06,739 --> 01:32:11,059
videos in it and maybe there's still

1734
01:32:09,619 --> 01:32:12,769
some tweaking to do but like it's

1735
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:15,800
basically the course is what it is

1736
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:18,860
you'll be able to get it

1737
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:24,440
it'll be on Steam I don't know how much

1738
01:32:18,859 --> 01:32:26,359
it'll cost I think just based on what

1739
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:30,259
I've been thinking lately it'll be the

1740
01:32:26,359 --> 01:32:33,170
price of a game or less so it'll be 60

1741
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:34,640
bucks or less probably I don't hold me

1742
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:37,069
to that but I'm pretty sure that's what

1743
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:42,110
it'll be priced so it won't be

1744
01:32:37,069 --> 01:32:47,899
particularly expensive it would it would

1745
01:32:42,109 --> 01:32:51,159
basically be like a less less than the

1746
01:32:47,899 --> 01:32:51,159
cost of a triple-a game basically

1747
01:32:59,229 --> 01:33:02,538
how's a sparse energy system been has

1748
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:06,260
there been any drastic amount of

1749
01:33:02,538 --> 01:33:09,380
occasion to it no really not I would say

1750
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:10,820
that the addition of an entity cache was

1751
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:11,989
probably one of the most interesting

1752
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:13,099
things that occurred during hand-made

1753
01:33:11,988 --> 01:33:15,288
here oh it's something that I probably

1754
01:33:13,099 --> 01:33:19,788
will think about every time I do and it

1755
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:21,920
is in the future I'm surprised I've

1756
01:33:19,788 --> 01:33:23,389
never seen anyone talk about it before I

1757
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,880
think probably because like a lot of

1758
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:26,989
engines just suck at entities and they

1759
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:30,590
really haven't thought it through

1760
01:33:26,988 --> 01:33:34,549
but like entity cash I think that's a

1761
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:36,199
big thing I kind of feel like all of my

1762
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:38,420
games in the future will have an

1763
01:33:36,198 --> 01:33:42,019
explicit enemy cash model or just like

1764
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:42,710
it just seems really smart I hadn't

1765
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:44,119
thought about it

1766
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:45,770
it just kind of happened we were doing

1767
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:48,319
it and I was like oh in retrospect

1768
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:51,320
if I was smart I would have just done

1769
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:52,698
this I would have thought of it kind of

1770
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:54,078
came out as a just a consequence of the

1771
01:33:52,698 --> 01:34:00,288
architecture I really like it I think

1772
01:33:54,078 --> 01:34:02,000
it's pretty I think it's really good you

1773
01:34:00,288 --> 01:34:03,590
can include the string whack G in a

1774
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,868
doctor cookery to get Google really

1775
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:10,340
I only just switch to DuckDuckGo I'm

1776
01:34:08,868 --> 01:34:17,500
gonna have to try that so basically what

1777
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:21,020
you're saying is if I say whack G how

1778
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:22,130
long should I boil an egg for some

1779
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:26,750
reason that was something came up before

1780
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:31,118
that's what that will do interesting so

1781
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:31,118
that just shunts you over to Google

1782
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:46,239
interesting all right good to know

1783
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:59,420
there are some certain Amish

1784
01:34:58,039 --> 01:35:00,829
implementation on street or you could

1785
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:03,619
look at I don't know something else uh

1786
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:05,420
so I kind of just don't think I want it

1787
01:35:03,619 --> 01:35:07,340
I think the octahedral is just better I

1788
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:10,670
really like that I'd never seen that for

1789
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:13,579
the main thing I really like about the

1790
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:15,619
octahedral is it's just explicit right

1791
01:35:13,579 --> 01:35:17,059
it doesn't involve a projection on to

1792
01:35:15,619 --> 01:35:19,399
periodic basis function and like that

1793
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:22,370
it's just saying look here's a good way

1794
01:35:19,399 --> 01:35:24,198
to store spherical stuff because then

1795
01:35:22,369 --> 01:35:26,390
you can just visually inspect it too we

1796
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:29,269
just look at that sheet and go does it

1797
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:31,369
look like the lighting right it just

1798
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:32,840
looks it just looks right you know we

1799
01:35:31,369 --> 01:35:34,369
don't have to then recompute the

1800
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,989
lighting by adding things together and

1801
01:35:34,369 --> 01:35:38,469
have a debug visually it's just correct

1802
01:35:35,988 --> 01:35:38,468
right

1803
01:35:50,569 --> 01:35:54,829
what is an entity cash so the way we

1804
01:35:53,298 --> 01:35:56,809
ended up doing it is we just have a

1805
01:35:54,828 --> 01:35:59,748
world system which basically says look

1806
01:35:56,809 --> 01:36:02,359
the entire set of information about the

1807
01:35:59,748 --> 01:36:06,198
universe of the game is stored behind

1808
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:09,079
some like opaque wall that is not meant

1809
01:36:06,198 --> 01:36:10,668
to be used when you actually want to

1810
01:36:09,078 --> 01:36:12,828
simulate anything or render anything or

1811
01:36:10,668 --> 01:36:15,608
do whatever you ask it to give you the

1812
01:36:12,828 --> 01:36:19,158
set of entities that exist in a region

1813
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:20,809
what it does is it gives you those but

1814
01:36:19,158 --> 01:36:23,868
it gives them to you as basically

1815
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:25,489
pointers into a cache and so if it

1816
01:36:23,868 --> 01:36:27,348
already had decompressed the

1817
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:29,328
representation of an entity into like a

1818
01:36:27,349 --> 01:36:31,788
simulation version rather than a storage

1819
01:36:29,328 --> 01:36:33,139
version of that entity it'll just give

1820
01:36:31,788 --> 01:36:35,389
you a pointer to one that already exists

1821
01:36:33,139 --> 01:36:37,458
in memory if it doesn't it'll evict some

1822
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:44,389
existing entity and move one of the ones

1823
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:45,588
you needed into it right it's just a

1824
01:36:44,389 --> 01:36:47,298
really good way to do things

1825
01:36:45,588 --> 01:36:49,038
it's just how it was how a CPU does

1826
01:36:47,298 --> 01:36:51,788
things and it just works really well I

1827
01:36:49,038 --> 01:36:51,788
really like it a lot

1828
01:37:29,619 --> 01:37:33,519
so by the way I know people are sort of

1829
01:37:31,869 --> 01:37:37,390
having a DuckDuckGo google chat on the

1830
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:41,860
web so I actually don't care so much

1831
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:44,039
about the other sort of oh sorry so let

1832
01:37:41,859 --> 01:37:48,009
me know this was actually relevant so

1833
01:37:44,039 --> 01:37:51,720
cash tables I'm not sure what lobbying

1834
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:51,720
calls a cash table sorry let me look

1835
01:38:25,538 --> 01:38:34,078
I know so I would say this really has

1836
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:34,079
nothing to do with it

1837
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:57,319
so no this this is this is different so

1838
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:59,840
anyway what I was gonna say about Google

1839
01:38:57,319 --> 01:39:02,059
dr. Koh is actually the I wasn't

1840
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:04,279
switching like a lot of people have like

1841
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:05,510
privacy or whatever reason I mean they

1842
01:39:04,279 --> 01:39:08,960
have like reasons why they were

1843
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:13,730
switching I actually didn't care about

1844
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:23,000
that my problem is actually that like

1845
01:39:13,729 --> 01:39:26,089
you know I find this just impossible to

1846
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,770
read i I just I can't read that like my

1847
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:32,060
brain looks at this and it just

1848
01:39:27,770 --> 01:39:33,830
barfs so I was totally happy with Google

1849
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:36,320
I didn't have a problem with the search

1850
01:39:33,829 --> 01:39:38,869
at all they changed this format and I

1851
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:40,429
just can't use it so I use it if I

1852
01:39:38,869 --> 01:39:42,289
absolutely have to if I think dr. Koh

1853
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:48,110
search is probably not good but

1854
01:39:42,289 --> 01:39:51,109
otherwise this is just my brain is able

1855
01:39:48,109 --> 01:39:53,179
to read these typographically so i can

1856
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:57,229
see where the search results are that's

1857
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:59,150
the problem so i don't care about ethics

1858
01:39:57,229 --> 01:40:01,459
of it at all like i am not making a

1859
01:39:59,149 --> 01:40:01,849
moral judgment at all between these two

1860
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:05,869
companies

1861
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:08,240
it's a lay out judgment if google went

1862
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:11,890
back to their old way of displaying

1863
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:14,929
information I would just use them again

1864
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:19,640
it's just it's this is some of the worst

1865
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:22,100
typography I've ever seen for a modern

1866
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:24,200
web company like modern web companies

1867
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:26,240
are usually all about typography maybe

1868
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:27,889
not the best as far as information is

1869
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:34,069
concerned but they're usually pretty

1870
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:37,610
fancy right and so I don't know what to

1871
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:40,759
make of this because you know this is

1872
01:40:37,609 --> 01:40:44,449
this is absolutely horrid this

1873
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:46,430
typography is so bad that if you if a

1874
01:40:44,449 --> 01:40:48,590
typographer was involved with this they

1875
01:40:46,430 --> 01:40:49,970
should be fired right my guess is they

1876
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:51,500
weren't because I'm assuming a good

1877
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:55,390
typographer would have told you never to

1878
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:55,390
ever do this right

1879
01:41:02,488 --> 01:41:07,439
I mean it's literally like when you look

1880
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:09,899
at what this does typographically you go

1881
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:12,389
okay so this is clearly what creates a

1882
01:41:09,899 --> 01:41:14,309
heading so anybody who looks at this

1883
01:41:12,390 --> 01:41:17,369
will immediately think that's a heading

1884
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:20,640
so their brain will begin to create the

1885
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:22,890
box for this typography right here it

1886
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:26,579
will extend down until they see the next

1887
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:28,770
one so the box they see is United

1888
01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:31,649
Federal Credit Union the description for

1889
01:41:28,770 --> 01:41:33,989
it and then this URL so now you think

1890
01:41:31,649 --> 01:41:37,309
that United Federal Credit Union's URL

1891
01:41:33,988 --> 01:41:42,959
is Waterfront FC you org but it's not

1892
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:44,910
right that's what 99% of humans will do

1893
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,489
when they look at this box because you

1894
01:41:44,909 --> 01:41:49,409
don't create box based on whitespace you

1895
01:41:47,488 --> 01:41:52,409
create boxes based on what you actually

1896
01:41:49,409 --> 01:41:54,029
see as headings right there's lots of

1897
01:41:52,409 --> 01:41:55,289
white space in here there's white space

1898
01:41:54,029 --> 01:41:57,509
there there's white space here there's

1899
01:41:55,289 --> 01:42:00,750
white space there and what you typically

1900
01:41:57,510 --> 01:42:03,840
do is you process boxes in terms you you

1901
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:06,060
first insert things based on headings

1902
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,069
and then you will break up things based

1903
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:10,830
on the white space into pieces so you

1904
01:42:08,069 --> 01:42:13,079
know that this and this are not the same

1905
01:42:10,829 --> 01:42:15,420
piece of text but you don't know that

1906
01:42:13,079 --> 01:42:22,399
they're that this binds with that that's

1907
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:25,050
not a common way to look at it right now

1908
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:27,179
some people may do it the other way

1909
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:29,159
round meaning some people may still use

1910
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:32,700
this white space but that's not a reason

1911
01:42:29,159 --> 01:42:33,899
not to do it it doesn't matter if some

1912
01:42:32,699 --> 01:42:36,149
people will correctly guess the

1913
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:36,629
typography the fact is the other way

1914
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:38,579
around

1915
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:40,560
everyone will correctly guess the type

1916
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:45,090
like you'd have to be the extremely rare

1917
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:48,630
specimen to not know what the box blocks

1918
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:50,190
were here because both this and the

1919
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:52,020
white space are telling you the same

1920
01:42:50,189 --> 01:42:54,889
thing so you really can't get it wrong

1921
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:54,890
right

1922
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:21,890
another way to say it would be that this

1923
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:25,309
is a congruent layout and the other

1924
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:26,930
layout is is effectively conflicting the

1925
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:28,430
white space tells you something

1926
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:31,310
different than the headings tell you

1927
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:33,740
would be one way to look at it so people

1928
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:35,840
who break the tie in favor of the white

1929
01:43:33,739 --> 01:43:37,550
space read the page correctly people who

1930
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,619
break the tie in favor of the heading

1931
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:41,930
read it incorrectly and that's just

1932
01:43:39,619 --> 01:43:44,269
always bad right you never want to have

1933
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:46,039
a tiebreaker decide which way you group

1934
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:53,240
your typography might be a better way to

1935
01:43:46,039 --> 01:43:55,600
explain it right all right I'm gonna get

1936
01:43:53,239 --> 01:43:55,599
some lunch

1937
01:44:06,019 --> 01:44:13,099
whoa oh that's just Milton I'm like what

1938
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:17,658
no it's not was oh it's the game I'm

1939
01:44:13,099 --> 01:44:22,730
like what's in the background awesome we

1940
01:44:17,658 --> 01:44:23,658
forgot it was running all right thank

1941
01:44:22,729 --> 01:44:24,919
you everyone for joining me for the

1942
01:44:23,658 --> 01:44:26,598
episode of handmade hero it's been a

1943
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:28,010
pleasure coding with you as always if

1944
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:29,659
you would like to follow on the series

1945

at home you can always pre-order the

1946
01:44:29,658 --> 01:44:32,960
game on handmade hero org comes the

1947
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:34,609
source code so you can follow along with

1948
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,929
it some people were asking about the

1949
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:40,848
courses that will be coming I will put

1950
01:44:38,929 --> 01:44:43,158
something up in here as soon as it's

1951
01:44:40,849 --> 01:44:45,498
ready for public consumption

1952
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:47,229
it will be purchasable on Steam that's

1953
01:44:45,498 --> 01:44:49,760
about the only information I have so far

1954
01:44:47,229 --> 01:44:52,308
I don't actually know if we'll be able

1955
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:56,239
to purchase it from the epic store they

1956
01:44:52,309 --> 01:44:57,949
don't let you just put stuff up on the

1957
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:03,229
epic store I would be happy to do so but

1958
01:44:57,948 --> 01:45:06,529
I yeah that I mean I don't they would

1959
01:45:03,229 --> 01:45:09,319
they would have to let me so I'll try to

1960
01:45:06,529 --> 01:45:10,609
put it on storefronts at least the at

1961
01:45:09,319 --> 01:45:14,049
least steam I know because it's already

1962
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:15,920
I already have the beta on there and so

1963
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:17,239
I'll try to put it on some more

1964
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,618
storefronts as I find ones that are

1965
01:45:17,238 --> 01:45:20,299
capable of distributing huge files

1966
01:45:18,618 --> 01:45:26,558
because a lot of videos so it's fairly

1967
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:26,559
sizable right and we will go ahead and

1968
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:34,328
we will provide more information about

1969
01:45:31,519 --> 01:45:37,429
that as soon as we have some until then

1970
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:39,170
I will be doing more handmade hero so

1971
01:45:37,429 --> 01:45:43,038
I'll be back here tomorrow same time

1972
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:44,179
same place and we will go ahead and

1973
01:45:43,038 --> 01:45:46,849
started playing that letting algorithm

1974
01:45:44,179 --> 01:45:48,769
that's about it for today until tomorrow

1975
01:45:46,849 --> 01:45:50,090
have fun programming everyone and I'll

1976
01:45:48,769 --> 01:45:52,389
