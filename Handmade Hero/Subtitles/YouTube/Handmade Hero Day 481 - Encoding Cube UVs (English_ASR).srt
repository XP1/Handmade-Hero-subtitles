00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,669
hello everybody and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:09,780
Hero show recode a complete-game live on

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:11,669
stream we have done a bunch of work with

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:14,548
our renderer to make it a lot more

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,710
efficient in hardware really has nothing

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:19,829
to do with renders in general it was

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,839
mostly just a case of hardware really

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:23,639
doesn't like texture changes if you're

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,339
on certain types of cards other types of

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,349
cards don't mind and so we kind of

11
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:31,140
needed to have a solution to that

12
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,759
problem and so what we did is we started

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,009
using texture arrays and we have much

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,899
much better throughput than we did

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,009
before we still get other issues in the

16
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,689
renderer that we'll have to address some

17
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,238
at some point that have to do with

18
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,299
performance right now we're using way

19
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,099
too much memory due to our the way we're

20
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,078
handling our back buffers right now

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,399
we're doing some stuff with def peeling

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,320
and multi sampling and stuff like that

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,929
that's just it's a little too piggy

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,789
and so we're probably gonna have to do

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:03,000
some work to make sure that those things

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:05,159
are a little bit more frugal and we also

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,810
are doing some things right now with

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,840
respect to texture usage that are absurd

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,409
for example right now everything's a 512

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,090
by 512 texture but we've never updated

31
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,250
the fonts to for example be packed into

32
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,009
a single texture so right now like every

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,640
letter of a font I believe will get its

34
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,280
own 512 by 512 bitmap into which it will

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,259
pack a little tiny character in the

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,650
upper left corner is what what is

37
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:37,500
actually happening as you might imagine

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,380
that is not particularly useful or

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:44,280
necessary so we will want to do some

40
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:47,158
work ship wise on that sort of stuff

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,820
down the line however I don't really

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,618
know that we care about it at the moment

43
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:55,859
especially because you know if we take

44
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,478
up 50 of our texture slots with random

45
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,188
characters or something it doesn't

46
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:03,030
really affect our ability to develop the

47
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:05,069
game we're still getting totally fine

48
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,420
frame rates and everything else and the

49
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,868
only thing that we have right now that's

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,640
a bit slow is lighting which of course

51
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,000
we can always turn off for development

52
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,629
if we need to and

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,699
we will eventually improve that anyway

54
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:20,439
so that's really not a big deal so I

55
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:22,839
would say let's just leave it for now

56
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:26,199
it's in a good state it's a pretty

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,180
reasonable system I think what we want

58
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,539
to do now is focus on the asset system

59
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,030
and the asset tagging and we have a

60
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,349
pretty clear path for that really what

61
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,219
we just want to do is iterate on it

62
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:41,560
until we think it's in a good place and

63
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:44,979
the way we're gonna do that is right now

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,590
our world is very barren we can create

65
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:51,039
rooms and hop around them and do

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,650
whatever we want but what we cannot do

67
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,169
is really decorate them much because we

68
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,349
just don't have we don't have an answer

69
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:02,619
for how we want to bind our input assets

70
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,329
to what we see on the screen and so

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,120
that's really the challenge that we have

72
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,739
to face and this is actually I would

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,689
actually argue this is one of the most

74
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,480
difficult things in game programming and

75
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:16,389
the reason why it doesn't appear

76
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:18,219
difficult most of the time is because

77
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:21,399
most of the time people don't really end

78
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:23,709
up solving it and we're not gonna solve

79
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,709
it fully on handmade hero either because

80
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:32,650
my my feeling is that the actual

81
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:34,569
solution to it which i think is the more

82
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,840
appropriate one actually involves such a

83
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:39,009
huge step forward in terms of game

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,590
development systems and things like that

85
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:44,739
that it's impractical to consider on a

86
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:52,090
project where we only code two hours a

87
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:54,340
day two days a week so put that aside

88
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,400
and just say that asset binding is a

89
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,079
very very difficult problem and most of

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,450
the time the way to solved much like

91
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,310
np-complete problems is you don't really

92
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,929
solve the problem you solve an easier

93
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,849
problem that gets you most of what you

94
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,340
want and you accept some of the

95
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:12,519
compromises so that's really all we're

96
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,530
looking for and again it just has to

97
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,139
work in order for our game

98
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,120
to run and do what we need it to do it

99
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,098
doesn't have to be perfect in order to

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,780
ship in fact if things had to be perfect

101
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:26,529
to ship we'd probably never ship

102
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:29,799
anything so anyway we know that we're

103
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:31,569
we did the cutscenes as well and those

104
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,060
all seem to be working we double-check

105
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:34,839
those so here's the game running just

106
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,910
fine

107
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:40,239
but as you can see everything is just

108
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,100
cubes blank cubes and we don't want a

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,110
game full of blank cubes what we want to

110
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,400
do is put things on the cubes and in

111
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,830
addition to putting things on the cubes

112
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,389
we also want to be able to put items in

113
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,009
the rooms and that sort of stuff right

114
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,629
because we've got little items that we

115
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,860
can put in there but right now if we put

116
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:56,680
an item in there it would just be

117
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:02,590
another Bank blank cube or something and

118
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:04,750
we do have a fairly kind of poor system

119
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:06,699
right now for picking some assets and

120
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,769
that's how we made like the hero pick

121
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:12,250
pick the head asset and so on and we can

122
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,930
you know do some stuff here in terms of

123
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,970
training the hero and so on but it

124
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,480
really isn't that good and so what we

125
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,550
want to do is we want to now actually

126
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,770
create a real answer to this problem

127
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,710
right we've got most of our stuff

128
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:28,959
working in a pretty reasonable way and

129
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:30,849
so what we would like to do here is we'd

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,219
like to come up with some kind of an

131
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,650
answer as to how we're really gonna do

132
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:39,130
this and I feel like the best way to do

133
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:41,319
it is to actually try to make an

134
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,600
orphanage filled with the stuff that we

135
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,339
think should really be there and also

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,110
fix the hero the hero still using the

137
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,519
old assets we have new assets for the

138
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,810
hero that are at the right perspective

139
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,810
this is kind of at the wrong perspective

140
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:58,060
so all those sorts of things really want

141
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,459
to happen at some point here and I think

142
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,620
now is that point right that now is the

143
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:05,049
time that we want to try to get that all

144
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,910
working we should probably fix our debug

145
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,770
system to snap these to the corners to I

146
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,330
don't know when we lost that snapping I

147
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,399
think we changed to like pixel

148
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,870
coordinates at some point rather than

149
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,149
like percentage based coordinates or

150
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,149
something and we lost a little bit of

151
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:20,918
something there so anyway that's that's

152
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:23,319
really what I want to do and I feel like

153
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:27,310
the things we can focus on in the short

154
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,599
term to try and like drive that because

155
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,149
we've got a few things here we can

156
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,040
really clearly focus on one of them is

157
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:37,209
get the right sprites for the hero the

158
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,729
other is the walls provide a really good

159
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:42,728
opportunity for working on the asset

160
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:45,098
tagging because there's actually some

161
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:48,848
fairly complex stuff that has to happen

162
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:52,209
with those wall textures if you look at

163
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:55,658
what we've got in terms of what goes on

164
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:57,579
to the walls art wise right in the

165
00:06:55,658 --> 00:07:01,598
handmade art directory

166
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:04,628
we've got example assets from Anna that

167
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,699
are what things you know testings and

168
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,610
what you can see here is right like

169
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:12,699
there's these textures that have panels

170
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,879
and those panels are semantic like this

171
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,559
is clearly the beginning of a run this

172
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:22,199
is the middle of a run this is the end

173
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:25,240
of a run and this is for one like

174
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,419
isolated one that doesn't have a run you

175
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,348
know and so and like that's for the top

176
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:33,758
and these are for the bottoms you know

177
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:39,550
and so if we looked at something like

178
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:43,749
that we know that the assignment of

179
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,088
those is has to be like coming from the

180
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:48,550
procedural generator because only the

181
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:50,939
procedural generator is going to know oh

182
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,218
you know I wanted this to be a

183
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:56,069
continuous run of this wall so each one

184
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:58,360
of these things should be that way and

185
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,528
furthermore like you know the procedural

186
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,759
generator probably wants to think in

187
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,990
terms of should these things be

188
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,060
staggered Heights are all the same

189
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,338
height so that they look continuous or

190
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,120
not right and all of those sorts of

191
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:18,519
things are pretty important for getting

192
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:21,519
getting it right you know so we want to

193
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:24,430
come up with a very good system for

194
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,588
describing those things that makes it

195
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:31,360
easy for us to do what we need to do

196
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:33,338
here now if we look you can see that

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,379
we've got a couple different types of

198
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,260
orphanage blocks as well these are like

199
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:40,448
floor tiles for example and these are

200
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:42,278
stone floor tiles right so we have two

201
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:44,639
different types of floor tiles there and

202
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:48,129
then these are like wall tiles you know

203
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:52,480
and here's an example of a forest simple

204
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:54,240
forest ground tile too you know we've

205
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,550
got

206
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:09,909
trees we've got furniture to place right

207
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:13,139
and so we want to we want to try and

208
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:17,620
conceptualize what's the easiest way for

209
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:20,019
our code in the generator to articulate

210
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:24,068
things into the world that will then

211
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:26,350
select the right assets and the most

212
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:30,269
primitive way of doing that would just

213
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:32,528
be to explicitly say what the asset is

214
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:35,169
you know and maybe that's what we go

215
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:36,850
with there's the notion of having some

216
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:40,899
matching we have some of that in there

217
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,209
now and finding the balance between

218
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:46,828
those is going to be important sometimes

219
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:50,138
you cannot articulate the entire thing

220
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:50,528
and the hero would be a good example of

221
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,839
that

222
00:09:50,528 --> 00:09:56,049
the hero is an entity in the world but

223
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,310
the hero can turn right so if we were to

224
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:02,639
just say explicitly what the hero is

225
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:05,528
then he couldn't turn because the

226
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,750
parameter of what direction hero is

227
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:11,259
facing could be used

228
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:13,809
you just have explicit bitmaps right so

229
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,850
it might be fine for a wall to have that

230
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,099
but it wouldn't be fine to hear that

231
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,709
that extending it a little bit further

232
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,379
it might also not be fine for a wall to

233
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:26,049
have that why well let's suppose we

234
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:30,278
wanted walls when we hit them to show

235
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:33,039
damage well if damage if a damaged wall

236
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:36,578
is a different asset from a wall then if

237
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,039
all you know about the wall is that it

238
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:41,828
is having this particular texture on it

239
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:45,549
you wouldn't know what texture to look

240
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:48,789
for when it got damaged so you can see

241
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:51,698
how raising it up one level and saying

242
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:54,429
well I'm going to specify a class of

243
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:56,500
possible things around this wall with at

244
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:59,349
least one parameter which is how damaged

245
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,539
it is gives you the ability to specify

246
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,850
something if the generator that is what

247
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:06,278
you wanted to say but then have a match

248
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,058
occur later on in the pipeline that

249
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:09,479
allows the

250
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:13,598
is to put more things in they can show

251
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:15,788
response to some parameter does this

252
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:19,089
make sense and so again this is why I

253
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:22,078
say this is a very very sensitive part

254
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:26,019
of the pipeline in other news I'm

255
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:28,269
wondering why we're having weird I think

256
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,999
this might be a fog based issue there's

257
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,038
some kind of weirdness with like if you

258
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,149
look at this all of the alpha blending

259
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:35,979
looks totally right

260
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:39,009
you see I'm saying it looks perfect

261
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:40,629
really really good right

262
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,619
and remember this is order independence

263
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,199
and that's pretty awesome that the

264
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:46,449
render is doing that it's great but like

265
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:48,188
that is wrong and I think it's because

266
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:50,588
it's getting fogged I feel like the

267
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:52,688
Alpha is getting fogged wrong you know

268
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,389
I'm saying to you and I guess I can

269
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:58,688
prove that by the fact that this looks

270
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:00,129
fine even in the same exact way and the

271
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:05,828
only difference here is that the fog is

272
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:08,769
turned off so we've got a fog bug you

273
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:12,778
know what why don't I go and love that

274
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,778
in our fancy github

275
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,830
all right there we go I've had to learn

276
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:57,050
how to use github because I released the

277
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,570
meow hash as open-source and it seems

278
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:03,819
like people all use github for that sort

279
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:07,850
of thing so I had to learn how to use

280
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:12,290
github which was a real treat let me

281
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,750
tell you but so I sort of vaguely know

282
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:17,120
my way around it now it's not pretty but

283
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,789
for example I at least know the basics

284
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,649
like I can make new branches put stuff

285
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:23,480
in there merge them in and comment and

286
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:27,409
all that stuff so I had to learn to do

287
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,029
all that stuff reluctantly but it does

288
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:30,919
mean that I can at least use the hand

289
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,539
made here oh one more now which of

290
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,069
course I never really did I just made a

291
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:39,019
script that would update it and I never

292
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:41,030
looked at it again more or less but I do

293
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,350
sort of know how to use it now and it

294
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:46,879
can least use this stuff reasonably so

295
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,259
there we have it

296
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,330
so anyway what I want to do is focus on

297
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:55,100
that for the next few weeks because that

298
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,110
will take our game from something that's

299
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,620
very prototype looking to something that

300
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,730
actually starts to look quite game-like

301
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,899
the difference between something that

302
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,810
looks like a prototype of something that

303
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,220
looks like a game is is art I mean

304
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:09,169
people ship entire games where the

305
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,940
gameplay is terrible so it's not

306
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:15,529
gameplay that differentiates a prototype

307
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,940
from a finished product sadly but art

308
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,470
definitely does so you look at this

309
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,910
screenshot and it clearly looks like a

310
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,450
prototype because everything is fairly

311
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:23,329
blocky

312
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,620
I mean granted you know you know

313
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,520
Minecraft are the best-selling games of

314
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,600
all time doesn't look particularly

315
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,220
different than this but that's a

316
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,779
separate issue I suppose you can't

317
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,259
compare things to Minecraft sort of an

318
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:34,939
anomaly most of the time if you look at

319
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:36,289
a game that looks like this you know

320
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,130
that it's a prototype because it clearly

321
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:39,129
doesn't have much art in it

322
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,500
so really what we want to do is take our

323
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:45,259
game from looking like a prototype to

324
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,019
looking like more of a an actual game

325
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,929
and that just involves having you know

326
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,759
art assets in place and looking like

327
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:54,679
they belong there so that's what we're

328
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,370
gonna try and do now and we want to try

329
00:14:54,679 --> 00:15:01,069
and move that as far down as we can to

330
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,350
something that looks you know if not

331
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,980
shippable than at least on the way to

332
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,350
shippable insane so I'm gonna go ahead

333
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,340
and build the game here just to make

334
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,000
sure everything is still working

335
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,769
properly looks like everything is oops

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,269
don't ask me why I've got two for coders

337
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,120
open I guess I got a little overzealous

338
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:21,879
there all right but if you recall the

339
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,750
way that we were doing this previously

340
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:28,429
is that inside the asset system we've

341
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,679
got a bunch of different ways that this

342
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:33,469
sort of stuff works but we have these

343
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:36,409
things called asset vectors and an asset

344
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,080
vector basically has a tag count and the

345
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:42,289
tag count is something that's specified

346
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:47,600
in the hhas here so we've got this

347
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:51,500
notion that any individual asset can can

348
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,340
sort of depend on or specify a series of

349
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,139
parameters right and on top of that we

350
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,649
also had a type system so we would say

351
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:03,049
something like okay you know this thing

352
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,529
here this asset shadow or asset tree

353
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:11,120
sword rock grass tough stone those sorts

354
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:15,409
of things right all of those things were

355
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,539
also a sort of orthogonal way of

356
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:21,350
selecting things so you could also say

357
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:23,990
in addition to saying here's some tags

358
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,879
and each tag has a parameter so you know

359
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,139
if I said well let me let me actually

360
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:34,850
load up the tags here they should be

361
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:36,529
here somewhere so the tags are things

362
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,690
like smoothness flat it's facing

363
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,639
Direction Unicode code point font type

364
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,270
shot index primacy blah blah blah blah

365
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,919
blah right and the difference between a

366
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,750
tag and a type is a type is just a

367
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,299
category of objects you basically say

368
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,879
look this is what I'm looking for

369
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:56,120
whereas a tag is a thing that says

370
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,610
here's a parameter like I don't just say

371
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:04,369
that something is flatness I say that it

372
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:06,440
has flatness of 0.4 right and then when

373
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,958
I go to pick an asset I say here is a

374
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,559
type of asset and here is the time right

375
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,930
and and so on

376
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:20,389
sooo that was sort of the way that we

377
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:23,299
had things going and I mean you know

378
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,449
it's it's ok we could keep going that

379
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:32,809
way it's just it's a little off it's

380
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:36,940
just not quite right I and so I want to

381
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:39,470
try in take the approach of

382
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,529
snuffleupagus oriented programming which

383
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,940
we've done before I and snuffleupagus

384
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,940
oriented programming if you'll remember

385
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:54,589
SOP is when we basically say look we all

386
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:57,769
really know what we're doing here we

387
00:17:54,589 --> 00:18:01,039
don't have a strong opinion about how we

388
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:02,930
want this code to work but we know that

389
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,970
we want it to work and we want to work

390
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:12,590
well so let's start on the side that

391
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:17,180
uses the system and let's see what we

392
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:19,129
would type in if we imagined that we

393
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,279
have the perfect system on the other

394
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,660
side so just every put it out of your

395
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,220
mind how it works

396
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:31,060
it's magical it's just gonna appear

397
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:34,130
somehow with pixie dust and unicorns

398
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:38,659
snuffleupagus just comes and saves the

399
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:42,140
day it's fine what would we write in

400
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,210
that case and then we use what we come

401
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,640
up with there by focusing on the

402
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,950
imaginative perfect system to then

403
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,250
inform our design of the actual system

404
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:55,160
which we then have some idea of what we

405
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:58,130
might want right so it's kind of a way

406
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,930
of generating some requirements when you

407
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,150
don't really know what they are yet

408
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,590
right you know sometimes you go into

409
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,360
piece of code you know exactly what it

410
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,409
should do and so the goal is just to

411
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,899
write a piece of code that

412
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,500
satisfies those things that you want the

413
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,180
code to do

414
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,670
other times you're dealing with a much

415
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,009
more conceptual and abstract in this

416
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,410
case that's exactly we have we know we

417
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:20,539
want some way of talking about these art

418
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,670
assets that works well for the code we

419
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:25,220
need to write for the gameplay but we

420
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,200
don't really know what that would be we

421
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,470
don't know exactly what the best type of

422
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,539
code would be calls would be for this

423
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,360
system so this is a way of us getting

424
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,639
insight into what that should be is just

425
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:42,919
imagine we can call anything we want

426
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:45,040
anytime what do we end up typing in so

427
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,320
let's pop into the world generator code

428
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,359
and try some stuff so here's the couple

429
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,250
things I might try first of all I'm

430
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:54,529
gonna take a look at code that generates

431
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,420
a room and I'm going to say for the code

432
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:59,420
that generates a room I want to do the

433
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:02,000
basic step that I was just talking about

434
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,519
just a moment ago which is let's figure

435
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,809
out how we might state that we want to

436
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:14,859
put those orphanage wall blocks in there

437
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:17,779
so you know this stuff how would I say

438
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:20,299
that I want to put like these on the

439
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:23,029
floor and maybe I randomly want to pick

440
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:25,279
you know different ones of these because

441
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:26,480
these are just tests imagine when Anna

442
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,639
actually does them eventually those

443
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,589
these will probably somewhat different a

444
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,780
little more than that maybe or maybe not

445
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:34,819
like maybe we just that's as we don't

446
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:36,319
want that much variance I don't know but

447
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:38,629
point being you know we want to be able

448
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,329
to randomly pick from some of those we

449
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:44,140
want to be able to make these work

450
00:20:41,329 --> 00:20:46,970
properly where we have depending on

451
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:51,320
where is in the run it selects the right

452
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:53,720
panel out of the art right so let's see

453
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:55,579
how we're gonna say that and how we're

454
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,279
gonna include that in the entity and

455
00:20:55,579 --> 00:21:00,230
then based on what we've come up with

456
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,819
there then we'll have some idea of what

457
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:09,470
to code on the other side when the

458
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:11,359
entity goes to actually render so there

459
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:16,509
we go all right I think how much time

460
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,509
you have left half hour is that right

461
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:23,579
when did we start we're at 12:30

462
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,220
oh no no we've only been doing four and

463
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:28,918
we thought we've got an hour hour and a

464
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:33,200
half hour and a half all right

465
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:36,049
so in here when we go to place a room

466
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,009
and again this is just some basic

467
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:40,109
generation code we made it's nothing

468
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,389
particularly special but what you can

469
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:45,298
see here is we we then have sort of some

470
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:48,959
code which will go in there and for

471
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:51,960
example here it's doing some some work

472
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,808
to sort of put rooms in place but I

473
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:59,250
think this just puts the rooms there

474
00:21:54,808 --> 00:22:00,388
right yeah I think so so this is

475
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,240
probably the code I really want to look

476
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:04,589
at because we don't really need to deal

477
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,149
with it at a higher level we can deal

478
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:10,048
with it right weren't actually spotting

479
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:11,699
down the tiles so this for example is

480
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:14,190
where we're we're sliding down those

481
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,980
tiles and you can see us adding in the

482
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,019
pieces here and you can see us just kind

483
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,839
of what we randomly do is slap down

484
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,538
something asset grass here which is

485
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,668
probably pretty meaningless and that's

486
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:28,619
just what we called the the the cube

487
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:30,240
type that was that was there right cubes

488
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:32,428
at the moment don't even get textures on

489
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,308
them in our system we have the ability

490
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,659
to do so we just don't even use it so

491
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:38,428
this is what generates all of those

492
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:42,950
entities and what we want to do is be

493
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:45,990
able to generate the correct wall tiles

494
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:49,889
for each of these so what you can see

495
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,628
here is inside this inside all this

496
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:54,538
generation code mostly what we're doing

497
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:56,158
is we're putting entities on and the way

498
00:22:54,538 --> 00:23:00,569
that we're putting entities into the

499
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:03,539
world is we start by adding an entity we

500
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:07,439
end by placing it somewhere and in

501
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:10,079
between right we often do stuff like

502
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,019
this where we add pieces to the entity

503
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,418
and the reason we have this notion is

504
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:19,950
that an NV is sort of a logical

505
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:22,320
construct that we think of as you know

506
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:26,548
there's a wall here or there's a player

507
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,230
here but that individual semantic

508
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:30,569
construct that we're programming with

509
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,329
may itself be composed

510
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:35,849
smaller pieces that we don't think about

511
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:38,730
separately other than to produce the

512
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:41,879
visuals and so that's what the idea is

513
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,639
behind the piece is a wall could have

514
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,070
two different pieces to it like if there

515
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:49,558
was a weird floating I on a pedestal or

516
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:50,970
something right that always just wanted

517
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:52,589
to be talked about together because they

518
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,600
never really were able to be separated

519
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:56,699
or anything like that but you want to be

520
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,480
able to control their animation or you

521
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,190
know how they're rendered we've got this

522
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,610
notion that an entity can have multiple

523
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:12,149
pieces and so the piece concept is

524
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:16,378
really what encodes how an entity's

525
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:19,469
visuals are presented and so we want a

526
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:21,538
way of specifying those that's actually

527
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:27,319
what we're trying to do here we want a

528
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:31,319
way of specifying those such that we can

529
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:34,918
capture the specificity that we were

530
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:37,500
talking about with the texturing right

531
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:41,340
so that's that's where we would need to

532
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:46,878
encode what parts of this we were

533
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:52,869
expecting to have happen right um so

534
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:56,069
let's say that I wanted to move over to

535
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:56,069
[Music]

536
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,349
let's say that I move over to the entity

537
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,359
system here and we've got the definition

538
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:08,490
remember the entity system will be

539
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,008
finalized later so this is kind of we

540
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:14,069
can do whatever we want here we can

541
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,808
literally just do anything that comes to

542
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:17,668
mind we don't have to think about doing

543
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:19,109
anything well we can just throw anything

544
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,879
in here and this will be dealt with

545
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:26,278
later that's intentional very

546
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:30,028
intentional so you look at this one of

547
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:33,619
the things that it looks like to me sort

548
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,619
o'the right is

549
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,039
we've got these entity pieces here it's

550
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:50,439
called it's called any visible piece you

551
00:25:43,039 --> 00:26:02,930
can see that it encodes a few things and

552
00:25:50,440 --> 00:26:12,140
they're not that bad honestly it's light

553
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:16,850
index still used it's not I don't think

554
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:20,330
it was they're not that bad right

555
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:21,949
we know that it's got some color we know

556
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:25,730
this got an offset from wherever the

557
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:28,880
entity is we know that it has an asset

558
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,890
type which is how we select I don't know

559
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,420
really why it's there I think that's how

560
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,160
I would normally do it right so we've

561
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:38,170
got our vector here and then we've got

562
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,790
sort of our flags and type down here but

563
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,440
so we have our color our offset and

564
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:44,019
we've got our dimensions the dimensions

565
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,029
probably should be three dimensional

566
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:51,079
rather than two dimensional if we're in

567
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:52,519
keeping sort of with the fact that now

568
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,259
things generally exist in three

569
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,000
dimensions we can always just ignore the

570
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,740
Z for things that are flat but I think

571
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,180
we probably want three I think we want

572
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,950
everything to sort of be conceptually a

573
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,590
cube even if we don't render it as cube

574
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,480
especially because we may need to absorb

575
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:07,609
light and stuff within our final

576
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,980
lighting we want to kind of know what

577
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:11,599
that is so I'm going to start with just

578
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,299
some basics here I'm gonna make this

579
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:17,629
into three-dimensional which shouldn't

580
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:20,269
really require much because now in here

581
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,710
where we're doing ad piece we can just

582
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:22,789
force people to specify

583
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,910
three-dimensional things and they can

584
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:28,460
just specify the final component as 0 if

585
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,960
that's actually what they wanted so in

586
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,559
here where we're adding a piece will

587
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,630
just say look there's the dimension and

588
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,359
it's fine then you hear where we're

589
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:41,270
doing this sort of thing instead of a v2

590
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:43,429
where we just do 0 and the height for

591
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:46,069
those sorts of things

592
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:49,340
of course I don't really know why we

593
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:51,409
specify it that way but I guess we do

594
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:57,679
you know we can just put this thing here

595
00:27:51,410 --> 00:28:00,500
for now like so and for this one I guess

596
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,140
in here we can just say radius radius

597
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:09,440
radius it's kind of sounds like kind of

598
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:13,550
funny there and yeah same here so in

599
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,470
here we we know that we've got the ball

600
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:17,899
height I feel like that should really be

601
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,549
in Z though so I kind of feel like these

602
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,710
should probably be more like that

603
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:23,690
honestly like we kind of want to go

604
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,990
through and clean that up into making

605
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:29,570
everything actually specify things in 3d

606
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,039
uh so you know that's that's roughly

607
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:35,599
what we're looking at here when we go to

608
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:38,599
actually render these things we would

609
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,339
also like to render them a little more

610
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,379
sensibly there I'm gonna take a look in

611
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:43,939
here I think we've got entity rendering

612
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,270
where we go through the pieces here

613
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:50,390
right here so you can see here we we

614
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:52,400
kind of do our our nonsense where we

615
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,670
where we fuss with it a little bit you

616
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:59,690
can see where we do our dimensions we

617
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:01,810
actually kind of control that stuff by

618
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,460
picking out the pieces that we wanted

619
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:07,339
and so what I point out here is like

620
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:12,440
when we're doing a cube now we could

621
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:16,250
actually do this correctly so X Y Z like

622
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,820
that we could have this now be specified

623
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,920
in its entirety that lets us use full

624
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:30,919
three-dimensional specification for that

625
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:34,910
which I think we want for lights again I

626
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:39,410
think should really just just specify

627
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:43,190
the dimension again like so seems good

628
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:46,519
to me and so really these folks just use

629
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,769
the Y which is fine because that's you

630
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,299
know if we want to just encode a single

631
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:53,240
dimension for flat things that's fine

632
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:54,470
too but it just seems like that's a good

633
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,849
thing to just start with getting

634
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,829
ourselves properly properly set up for

635
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:01,879
that now since we're back in the game

636
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:03,129
and we don't really care about the

637
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,950
cutscenes much I'm gonna

638
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,710
pop back over to handmade that's EPP and

639
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,210
I'm just gonna go ahead and turn back on

640
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,640
the little we've got this little thing

641
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:15,009
that instead of actually playing the

642
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,920
intro cutscene what we do is we force

643
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:20,289
the game immediately to pretend that the

644
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:25,230
player one has started so that we just

645
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:32,200
boot directly in which is a lot easier

646
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:34,000
so anyway this is this is just exactly

647
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,610
the same as it was before or should have

648
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,799
been you can see that the lights are a

649
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:42,639
little bit larger I think because before

650
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:54,220
I guess we where did we add pieces for

651
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:56,050
lights so much they shouldn't really

652
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,230
have been larger let me look at where we

653
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,230
were

654
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:15,399
you really care about things so add lamp

655
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:18,270
when this calls add piece light this

656
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:23,259
stuff is kind of old and pretty out

657
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:26,259
pretty worn out at this point because

658
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:27,730
it's gone through a lot of revisions so

659
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,069
when it calls add piece light it just

660
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:33,849
passes radius and an offset and the

661
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:40,990
radius gets spammed in here so they they

662
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:43,329
really should always be the same size if

663
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:46,538
we're doing it correctly and so I want

664
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:48,490
to see what's going on there when we

665
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:52,500
push a light in here we're passing the

666
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:55,210
piece dimensions so are they always

667
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:03,028
cubes yes

668
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:03,028
they are all right so I take it back

669
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:25,419
all right so that's all well and good

670
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:27,489
let's take a look now at how we're going

671
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:32,709
to fix the part where this doesn't have

672
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:36,419
any texturing on it so if we go into the

673
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:39,909
renderer we've got the push cube call

674
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:42,489
and we're calling that directly what you

675
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:44,909
can see about the push cube call is it

676
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:48,909
kind of specifies textures very

677
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:50,528
explicitly here and we don't really want

678
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,059
it to do that because we would like to

679
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:56,648
control where those textures are coming

680
00:32:52,058 --> 00:33:02,979
from now we did do a little bit more of

681
00:32:56,648 --> 00:33:06,939
that and I think yeah so this was our

682
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:09,190
answer right is if you want change what

683
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,190
the layout is you can actually do that

684
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:17,349
by using a set of tables that allows you

685
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:26,649
to pick different cube layouts now I

686
00:33:17,348 --> 00:33:29,318
think I think we probably don't want to

687
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:33,788
have to specify that entire thing each

688
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:36,788
time so we probably just want to build a

689
00:33:33,788 --> 00:33:38,888
set of those and the other thing about

690
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:40,898
it is like I said kind of later on is

691
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:42,698
this is just a big waste of time anyway

692
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:45,788
we could make it more efficient by

693
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:50,649
having this be generated in like a mesh

694
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:52,719
shader of some kind right because we

695
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:54,848
know that the assets for cubes are

696
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:57,179
always laid out like this so really we

697
00:33:54,848 --> 00:34:00,308
only need three pieces of information

698
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:02,379
which tile to pick at the top which tile

699
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:04,959
to pick for the sides and which time to

700
00:34:02,378 --> 00:34:07,028
pick at the bottom you could argue it

701
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:09,190
six pieces of information like which

702
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:12,668
tile for each side and then the top of

703
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:16,690
the bottom but at most you're talking

704
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:20,679
about six IDs and each ID is just two

705
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:23,139
bits right so six IDs of two bits is 12

706
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,329
bits even if you padded it out to 16

707
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:28,539
bits you're talking about one 16 bit

708
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:30,310
value per cube is all we actually need

709
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:36,760
to send down

710
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:40,000
but at the moment we really don't have a

711
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,880
way of sending down a 16-bit value for a

712
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,269
primitive and having that get expanded

713
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,599
out into different texture coordinates

714
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:52,719
per vertex right that's the domain of

715
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,000
something like a mesh shader or the

716
00:34:52,719 --> 00:35:03,039
earlier incarnations of that geometry

717
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:08,230
shaders and again I don't really want to

718
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:15,309
go down that road but what I might want

719
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:19,119
to do is I might want to say let's what

720
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:21,909
if we do use a scheme like that for

721
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:27,969
encoding it at the higher level pass it

722
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:30,879
down to the lower level and then even

723
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:33,429
though we're gonna blow it out here at

724
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,700
least then we would be ready to do a

725
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:40,989
better path by just directly encoding

726
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:43,149
the 16 bits later on right so maybe

727
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:45,279
we'll architect for the good thing now

728
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:50,590
because it gives us an opportunity to do

729
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:53,050
something nice there and we'll kind of

730
00:35:50,590 --> 00:36:00,960
go from there so I think what I'll do

731
00:35:53,050 --> 00:36:04,300
here is say ok let's encode in here a

732
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,289
u16 that gives us that layout

733
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:11,140
flexibility i and we'll make something

734
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:13,539
that kind of works that way so let's

735
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:15,579
look at what that would be like we would

736
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:18,340
be passing a render a texture down that

737
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:20,949
says kind of what the texture is in

738
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,519
general and then in addition to that one

739
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:27,969
we would be passing down a u16 that says

740
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:29,469
like the UV layout right and I mean

741
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:35,500
maybe we can leave that in the same

742
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:38,169
place and we can say default cube UV as

743
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,110
an actual thing here as well scuzz we

744
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:44,059
can say that there is a default cube UV

745
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:48,229
i and

746
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:51,589
default cube UV layout like so and we

747
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:53,358
could just say in fact we could just say

748
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:57,170
that that's 0 is always the default

749
00:36:53,358 --> 00:37:02,420
right that gets us out of that business

750
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:05,588
entirely right I and so what that would

751
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:09,108
be is that would be like an encoding of

752
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:16,568
where we want each which tile we want in

753
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:21,889
each case so for example we could say

754
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:25,369
encode queued UV layout like so and then

755
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:31,150
in each case here we would say alright

756
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:35,719
there's gonna be you know a top index

757
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:39,410
there's going to be side index and this

758
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:44,708
is probably like it's got a wind around

759
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:44,708
so we'll probably do something like this

760
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:56,358
maybe I'll do top bottom and then side I

761
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:59,929
don't know I feel like maybe that's

762
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:03,130
better so you see what's on top you say

763
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:03,130
what's on the side so it's on the bottom

764
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:09,949
I suppose to be correct and order it

765
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:17,900
would have to be more like this so it's

766
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:21,130
bottom side side side side type sorry

767
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,130
east side

768
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,599
and I'm just gonna go around

769
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,740
counterclockwise compass right so

770
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:40,519
basically the same thing you get if you

771
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:43,189
did sine cosine right so here we would

772
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:45,650
just specify which sites we wanted I'm

773
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:48,409
going all the way around and then we had

774
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:52,190
the bottom of the top so to encode our

775
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:55,369
cube UV layout we would just pack these

776
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:58,460
values into a new 16 so the first thing

777
00:38:55,369 --> 00:39:02,630
I would do is I'd say I want each of

778
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:13,579
these things to basically be packable

779
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:25,039
into two bits right and assuming that

780
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:26,420
they are you know we're okay so you know

781
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,670
let's make sure everything fits

782
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,900
assuming everything fits then let's go

783
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,780
ahead and pack them together so then

784
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,460
we've got a results and the results just

785
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:42,950
going to be all of these things board

786
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:44,990
together right we're just gonna smush

787
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:46,730
all the bits together but we need to

788
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:50,179
make sure that they don't overlap so we

789
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:52,760
want to slot each one in every two bits

790
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,889
so the bottom index will just naturally

791
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,510
slot in there at the bottom and I'll

792
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:58,129
write it this way so it's clear what

793
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:00,980
we're doing but we're not actually going

794
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,539
to modify it right the next one will we

795
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,010
need to leave the two bits we add for

796
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:06,349
the bottom of next so it's got to go up

797
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,420
by two right then the next one that's

798
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:10,549
got to go up by that two plus another

799
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,889
two to leave room from the side index

800
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:17,080
and so on right so we're just gonna

801
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:20,199
slide each value up two bits at a time

802
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:20,199
excuse me

803
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,319
look okay so we basically put two bits

804
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,379
two bits two bits two bits two bits two

805
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,760
bits and that's all packed together it

806
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:44,608
gives us our result and that in this

807
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,980
particular case this u16 our inputs

808
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:50,460
allowed to be just regular integers we

809
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,369
want to cast down to make sure that it

810
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:58,679
comes it goes from a 32-bit to a 16-bit

811
00:40:53,369 --> 00:41:01,260
there right so that encodes a cube UV

812
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:06,029
layout so then what we need is a way to

813
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:08,579
decode a cube UV layout and I think

814
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:14,849
really the only person who needs to do

815
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:17,400
that is is really the the push cube call

816
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:20,510
itself so for the moment I think we can

817
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:27,869
weld that right right in here actually

818
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:31,050
and so we can go ahead and kind of work

819
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:36,329
that into the specification so here's

820
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:38,700
the bottom piece and I guess I should

821
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:43,560
change us to do and say if we eventually

822
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:48,318
have mesh shaders in the renderer we can

823
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:54,630
actually save a ton of bandwidth by just

824
00:41:48,318 --> 00:42:00,269
encoding the 16-bit cube layout directly

825
00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:04,230
and expanding in the shader because

826
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:07,050
that's really all we need to do so if we

827
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:11,490
look at this bot stuff here what we can

828
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:16,160
see is you know we we had a notion of

829
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:21,149
this stuff before the cube UV layouts

830
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:24,629
this stuff right so you can see exactly

831
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,970
what it was previously and what I'd like

832
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:31,380
to do here is just start by assuming

833
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:33,959
that it actually is the same right so

834
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,059
we'll start by just initializing these

835
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:43,619
guys like

836
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:48,170
this so this is what the bottom would

837
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:48,170
have been before I believe oops

838
00:42:52,759 --> 00:43:00,809
so that's how the bottom gets picked

839
00:42:55,528 --> 00:43:07,489
so mmm you know not us realized too so

840
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:07,489
if we think about this we actually have

841
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:17,818
we actually have more bits available

842
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:22,499
than we're using right if we were to

843
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:25,558
think of this slightly differently so we

844
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:30,058
could also say in addition to the

845
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:32,459
encoding of which tile we're picking we

846
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:35,489
could encode the orientation of that

847
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:42,618
tile so for example if we wanted to take

848
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:46,739
the top and point it in a direction you

849
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:49,380
know what I mean we could do that now I

850
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:55,829
don't know that we want to do that but

851
00:43:49,380 --> 00:44:04,289
we could so I don't think there's any

852
00:43:55,829 --> 00:44:05,910
point in encoding the bottom direction

853
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:07,410
because you can't really see the bottoms

854
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,659
ever they're really just there for

855
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:15,058
lighting in fact we could probably just

856
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:18,409
not even have them as far as we know so

857
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:23,849
really we would only care about the top

858
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:26,098
and the top could have another two bits

859
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:33,679
that just said which of the directions

860
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:33,679
it was facing so I might do that

861
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:58,610
something like that so basically we

862
00:44:54,110 --> 00:45:18,110
could just say look if the top is or you

863
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:21,890
know I guess it's more like well like

864
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:25,490
that um so we're basically saying we'll

865
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:27,769
spin that top one around because we

866
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:34,189
might as well do it because we've got

867
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:40,190
that that extra space so that way we now

868
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:42,170
are using 14 of the bits and you know I

869
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,659
don't think there's really much else we

870
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:54,260
could in code you could flip you could

871
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:57,409
do a 180 rotation on the sides I don't

872
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:59,630
think the art would work that way so I

873
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:02,029
can't say that it makes sense to do that

874
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,760
speculatively the bottom I don't think

875
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:06,500
matters so I think that's pretty much

876
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:13,040
what we're looking at that's a pretty

877
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:15,800
flexible set of information there so

878
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:18,650
let's just leave it at that

879
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,660
so we encode that cube layout now what

880
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,119
we want to do is encode the rest of this

881
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:26,139
stuff the bottom really doesn't matter

882
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:31,389
but we're gonna I guess relining to pick

883
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:31,389
one thing that you know may be a mistake

884
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:44,450
is maybe what we really should do

885
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:48,860
instead of packing them this way is move

886
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:52,939
these up here and just have twice as

887
00:46:48,860 --> 00:47:04,640
many options for top tiles you know what

888
00:46:52,940 --> 00:47:10,119
I mean because I just can't think of

889
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:12,589
when we're ever gonna use like you know

890
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:15,079
what's the circumstance where we can

891
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:18,320
ever see the bottoms of tiles I mean we

892
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:20,449
we can see them when we do this but our

893
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:26,210
game you know is always gonna look like

894
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:29,469
that and there's just no way to ever see

895
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,470
the bottom face of the cube

896
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,199
I mean I'm trying think of the case

897
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:50,730
where we would care what's on the bottom

898
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:50,730
but I just I can't can't do it

899
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:13,609
so I guess in some here's here's gonna

900
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:17,420
be my fairly poor rationalization so

901
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:20,940
'hammied hero is a learning project and

902
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,309
so as such the decisions made in it are

903
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:26,099
not exactly the same as they would be if

904
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:32,039
it's a game that's just some game I made

905
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:37,469
or whatever right we could in theory in

906
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:41,039
the future want to do rate racing like

907
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:43,579
let's say Nvidia r-tx turns out to work

908
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:46,050
three or four years down the line and

909
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:46,699
just turning on rate racing makes a lot

910
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,560
of sense

911
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:52,829
well maybe we want to have some mirror

912
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:57,599
tiles that show the reflection of things

913
00:48:52,829 --> 00:49:00,329
that are on the ceiling right if we

914
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,610
didn't specify anything on the ceiling

915
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:03,929
we couldn't do that so adding

916
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,599
reflections does seem like something

917
00:49:03,929 --> 00:49:08,250
that would be educational at some point

918
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,929
even if someone else did it not me

919
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:14,159
meaning someone took them a hero

920
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:20,960
codebase and added that in there so ok

921
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:22,769
I'm gonna leave them in there there I

922
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,119
don't know that I'm gonna encode the

923
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:27,030
rotation for them though because I don't

924
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:30,089
know that we care about that but you

925
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:32,010
know we'll we'll see maybe I'll do it

926
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:34,140
just because it's symmetric and we have

927
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,660
two extra bits right like you know we

928
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:41,659
could we could say that there's a bottom

929
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:41,659
index and a bottom facing index like so

930
00:49:49,800 --> 00:50:00,789
and it would be free for the most part

931
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:04,960
to do right if there's the the encoding

932
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:13,019
then it just means we've got this

933
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:16,949
instead and hey now we use all our bits

934
00:50:13,019 --> 00:50:19,329
right so that does feel kind of nice

935
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:23,529
it's nice to have used all the bits you

936
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:26,019
know time saying so that's good so I

937
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:28,450
think if we just said well let's go

938
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:30,759
ahead and and encode it and we'll treat

939
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:32,980
the top and the bottom the same and

940
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,750
we'll go from there if that seems ok I

941
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:39,699
don't have a problem with that and off

942
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:42,579
we go all right so let's take the bottom

943
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:45,939
and the top and just weld those into

944
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:50,829
place here temporarily and then we'll do

945
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:58,200
the sides so oops so I'm gonna grab this

946
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:58,199
back there I'm gonna grab this up there

947
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:10,389
let's grab these so and the first thing

948
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:14,469
that I'm gonna do is I'm going to the

949
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:18,549
sides because the sides don't actually

950
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:21,189
have rotation right so the bottom and

951
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:24,550
the top kind of reluctantly the bottom

952
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:26,170
but definitely the top need to be

953
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:28,570
oriented and that's gonna be a little

954
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:32,019
bit different how we write the code but

955
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:36,640
as far as this one's concerned all you

956
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:40,570
really need to do is offset it by like

957
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:46,179
also it laterally right so this is the

958
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:52,420
exact set of of coordinates that we will

959
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:55,389
use in all cases right you just go ahead

960
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,680
and get this stuck in there this is the

961
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:59,578
exact set of coordinates that we'll use

962
00:51:56,679 --> 00:52:04,649
in all cases except for

963
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:06,749
act that we will slide them over so the

964
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:09,869
only change that's happening here is

965
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:14,629
that it will slide relative you know by

966
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:14,630
0.25 as we go

967
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:24,078
wait a minute

968
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:30,019
that can't be right

969
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:53,530
oh I I see we encoded them this way I'm

970
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:59,290
like what that doesn't make any sense it

971
00:52:53,530 --> 00:53:00,910
makes slightly more sense now and really

972
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:02,259
I don't I probably shouldn't even do

973
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:03,730
what I'm doing here I only need one of

974
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,830
them so I'm not sure why I'm bothering

975
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:07,510
with this in fact I'm not going to

976
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:24,429
bother with this it's just grab them

977
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:26,290
like this all right so that's what a mid

978
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:30,339
panel looks like and we just need to

979
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:33,730
slide it back and forth right so what

980
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:37,358
I'd like to do here is be able to set

981
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:38,920
the the mid results and I you know I'm

982
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:42,519
just gonna try and look at where we've

983
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:47,309
got these there you can see how we're

984
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:50,889
pushing the claws on like this right I

985
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:53,588
feel like those kind of want to be

986
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:55,480
arrayed so we can just kind of treat

987
00:53:53,588 --> 00:53:57,909
them as an array I'm guessing I don't

988
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,420
really know how we want to do that

989
00:53:57,909 --> 00:54:00,420
exactly

990
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:31,358
I mean one way we could do it is just

991
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:34,180
like this right and each of these is

992
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:38,789
just a copy of that with a different

993
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:38,789
offset in fact a kid mister like this

994
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:58,358
because I don't know that I want to

995
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:59,530
overcomplicate it the ones for rotation

996
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:00,909
will be a little more complicated so

997
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:09,309
we'll see maybe I want to overcomplicate

998
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:16,029
those but each one of these should be

999
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:26,069
pretty straightforward if we know what

1000
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:26,069
the cube layout is from this parameter

1001
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,589
we know that all we have to do to

1002
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:36,949
extract one of the facing sides is shift

1003
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:40,250
down by however much that side is right

1004
00:55:36,949 --> 00:55:41,529
then get rid of everything but the

1005
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,630
bottom two bits

1006
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:48,320
so we're slide it over get rid of it we

1007
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:51,440
then have a number between zero and

1008
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,519
three that says how far over we want it

1009
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,550
to be right

1010
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:57,679
so that's decrypted at that point into a

1011
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:00,050
number between zero and three and since

1012
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:03,440
we know exactly how much we move over

1013
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:06,080
each time we can just multiply that out

1014
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,570
that gives us the offset that we need

1015
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,549
and we can do it the exact same way for

1016
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,870
each of these that is if you actually

1017
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:19,820
managed to get the right number of

1018
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:24,889
parenthesis right so we can shift down

1019
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:27,080
mid x0 by four then mid x1 by six and

1020
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:30,920
other than that the rest of it remains

1021
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:35,139
exactly the same and these would follow

1022
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:40,360
suit in exactly the same way right so

1023
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:43,519
really trivial to decrypt those and then

1024
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,170
use them as offsets on the x-parameters

1025
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,650
to to basically initialize everything

1026
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,510
right because the Y parameter is always

1027
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,650
the same so we don't really need to fuss

1028
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:54,880
with that at all

1029
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:59,990
that's not necessarily true for the

1030
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:01,640
bottom ones right those might because we

1031
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:03,500
want to have the potential to encode

1032
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:06,949
rotation those are gonna be a little bit

1033
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:11,030
more finicky but for the moment that's

1034
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:17,719
basically what we're talking about okay

1035
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:21,320
um so I think the only thing I don't

1036
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:23,959
know is whether these are encoded in the

1037
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,539
order that we want them to be though so

1038
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:34,610
let's make sure we wanted this to be the

1039
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:36,800
eastward facing right so let me rephrase

1040
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:38,720
these this is the one facing down the

1041
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,330
positive access this is the one face

1042
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,379
down the positive y-axis this is

1043
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:44,630
negative x in this

1044
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:46,640
is negative Y so it's plus X plus y

1045
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:52,340
negative x and negative Y it's what we

1046
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:56,059
want to see right so here's the one

1047
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:57,980
facing down the positive x-axis assuming

1048
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:00,710
that I've got this right that should be

1049
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,630
zero and it is the one facing down the

1050
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,099
positive will actually be one the

1051
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,260
negative should be two and the three

1052
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:08,360
three so those are exactly what we

1053
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:10,190
wanted that we already did obey that

1054
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,510
convention and again that's just using

1055
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:14,920
cosine and sine as the rule so that

1056
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:20,600
everything always obeys that same rule

1057
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:23,240
so we can lock this up a little bit and

1058
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:26,480
just say well we also know that our top

1059
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:30,649
X and our bot X are also computed the

1060
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:34,400
exact same way so this computation here

1061
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:37,900
is also identical and what we could do

1062
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:40,160
is get out the top and the bottom

1063
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:43,840
equivalently I believe the bottom was

1064
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:47,119
encoded at 12 and the top 0 right

1065
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:54,769
there's the bottom and there's the top

1066
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:56,920
and yeah so I think that's all we need

1067
00:58:54,769 --> 00:59:02,599
to do to make those slide over properly

1068
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:06,250
is is use that as the offset now again

1069
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:09,969
we now have sort of this other issue

1070
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:12,369
which is we need to figure out how to

1071
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:17,569
rotate the top and the bottom

1072
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:20,539
around and if you think about what's

1073
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:23,059
gonna happen there really the only thing

1074
00:59:20,539 --> 00:59:27,860
that's gonna do is it's gonna cycle

1075
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:30,730
these parameters so all you would do if

1076
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:34,250
you're rotating one is you're basically

1077
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:38,389
shifting over which one is T 0

1078
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:42,610
which one is T 1 and so on so that T 0

1079
00:59:38,389 --> 00:59:45,609
is now T 1 T 1 is now T 2 T 2 is now T 3

1080
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:45,610
right

1081
00:59:50,548 --> 01:00:00,119
so I don't really know the best way to

1082
00:59:54,369 --> 01:00:02,970
do that but I assume it looks something

1083
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,970
like this

1084
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:05,969
so

1085
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:34,699
assume that I capture one of these

1086
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:35,750
setups into an array like so pretty

1087
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:38,088
straightforward yeah

1088
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:42,199
so I basically say early and I've got

1089
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:43,369
four coordinates that make up a tile and

1090
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:48,469
off we go

1091
01:00:43,369 --> 01:00:53,869
well then hopefully we all agree that if

1092
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:58,480
I was to take one of these tiles and say

1093
01:00:53,869 --> 01:01:05,079
you know that the BOP tile is gonna be

1094
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:05,079
you know a pointer to

1095
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:19,660
well it's gonna be hard to actually

1096
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:22,660
phrase that correctly um let's just say

1097
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:25,710
this so assume that I read these out

1098
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:25,710
like so

1099
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:39,159
right and maybe I do this it's not the

1100
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:47,739
best way to write it but you know what

1101
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:50,589
are you gonna do right so hopefully we

1102
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:52,750
can see that this would give me what I

1103
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:55,329
needed and furthermore I could do the

1104
01:01:52,750 --> 01:02:03,579
top the same way I would just have to

1105
01:01:55,329 --> 01:02:08,500
offset the the Y as well too to get it

1106
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:14,829
there oh sorry I got a switch this to

1107
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:18,460
the top well cut pasted that right so if

1108
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:20,860
I take the version I used for the top

1109
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:22,420
and use it for the bottom I'm sorry at

1110
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:25,150
the bottom and used for the top all I'm

1111
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:27,579
doing is is looking for higher up in the

1112
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:30,930
bitmap right but that's that's all that

1113
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:34,539
happens here these are the same as these

1114
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:43,599
offset by 0.75 and that the rest of it's

1115
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:46,449
the same right to 525 I think so if we

1116
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:50,440
want to rotate these what we could say

1117
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:54,339
is well if I want to never fetch outside

1118
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:58,510
of this array no matter what I do I can

1119
01:02:54,340 --> 01:03:01,750
just end this with 3 right hopefully we

1120
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:04,600
would agree that that makes it so that

1121
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:06,190
it can never get outside of the 4

1122
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:09,039
elements that are there because you

1123
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:10,990
could either be 0 1 2 or 3 and all the

1124
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:13,630
top bits are knocked out so I know I'm

1125
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:16,899
always gonna be those so what that means

1126
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:23,680
is if I then go and decode the facing

1127
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:24,338
direction right like so I'm just going

1128
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:26,978
to take the

1129
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:31,739
UV layout and shift it down by two to

1130
01:03:26,978 --> 01:03:31,739
get the up sorry this is the bottom face

1131
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:46,318
this is the top face if I extract those

1132
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:50,528
two values I know now know which of

1133
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:54,038
those facing directions I am right now I

1134
01:03:50,528 --> 01:03:55,719
could end it with three here but I don't

1135
01:03:54,039 --> 01:04:00,009
actually need to because I'm gonna end

1136
01:03:55,719 --> 01:04:02,460
it with three here right so I think

1137
01:04:00,009 --> 01:04:04,960
we're pretty good to go there because

1138
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,548
the only bits we care about at the

1139
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,989
bottom two we don't care about the rest

1140
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:10,018
cuz they're all gonna go away no matter

1141
01:04:07,989 --> 01:04:13,630
what happened up there

1142
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:19,348
so I think what I can do is just say all

1143
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:23,858
right bot face +0 bot plate face plus 1

1144
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:26,849
bot place plus 2 dot place bot face plus

1145
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:30,068
3 and I think that just kind of gives me

1146
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:35,109
my answer right it allows me to rotate

1147
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:37,268
around what those movies are and I don't

1148
01:04:35,108 --> 01:04:39,699
have to think about it much harder now

1149
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:44,919
the thing I don't like about that is it

1150
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:48,509
does look like a lot of code the

1151
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:53,588
indexing into an array part I don't love

1152
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:56,588
so what I'm curious to know is there

1153
01:04:53,588 --> 01:05:01,298
some way to directly decrypt that value

1154
01:04:56,588 --> 01:05:08,460
in some other way right because we now

1155
01:05:01,298 --> 01:05:11,559
have a value here that we could use so

1156
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:13,539
if we wanted to look at what this was

1157
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:17,609
we've got zero two five two five zero

1158
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:20,469
and zero zero two five two five right

1159
01:05:17,608 --> 01:05:26,400
what we're basically saying is that 0

1160
01:05:20,469 --> 01:05:31,599
maps to 0 1 maps to 0 2 maps to 0.25

1161
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:34,298
just write this out for you here and 3

1162
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:39,930
maps to 0.25 right I mean that's what we

1163
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:39,929
actually said for the y coordinate

1164
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:49,118
for the x-coordinate we said zero maps

1165
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:55,179
to zero zero 1 maps to 0.25 two maps to

1166
01:05:49,119 --> 01:06:03,419
0.25 and three maps to zero so what can

1167
01:05:55,179 --> 01:06:06,338
we conclude from this you know well

1168
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:19,268
we'll start by expanding it a little bit

1169
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:21,179
this is the bit pattern right so what

1170
01:06:19,268 --> 01:06:24,218
you can see here is actually the

1171
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:27,639
y-coordinate is trivial all we needed to

1172
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:31,809
actually do is just look to see whether

1173
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:34,598
the second bit is one if the second bit

1174
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:41,109
is 1 it's 0.25 if the second bit is 0

1175
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:45,519
its 0 so we don't need an array for the

1176
01:06:41,108 --> 01:06:47,048
y-coordinate we're done the x-coordinate

1177
01:06:45,518 --> 01:06:51,758
on the other hand is a little bit

1178
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:53,708
trickier right or is it if we were to

1179
01:06:51,759 --> 01:06:55,809
take these two bits together what we

1180
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:59,259
could see here is well these two bits

1181
01:06:55,809 --> 01:07:03,880
lead to 0 if they're the same and they

1182
01:06:59,259 --> 01:07:11,380
lead to 0.25 if they're different XOR

1183
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:15,099
them together right so what we can do is

1184
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:17,140
we can eliminate this sort of semi

1185
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:18,579
expensive stuff but I don't know and

1186
01:07:17,139 --> 01:07:21,848
again I'm sort of thinking my header

1187
01:07:18,579 --> 01:07:24,039
towards what I want this on a GPU CPUs

1188
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:25,689
are fine the table lookups table lookups

1189
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:29,469
are oftentimes the best way to do things

1190
01:07:25,688 --> 01:07:32,438
on CPUs GPUs I don't know you you're

1191
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:33,668
starting to get into finicky territory

1192
01:07:32,438 --> 01:07:35,259
there so I don't know that you would

1193
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:36,969
really want to be doing a lot of stuff

1194
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:40,838
like that although in this case a table

1195
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:44,318
is so tiny that probably it's fine here

1196
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:50,889
the bit patterns are so easy it seems

1197
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:51,820
like - well just be done with a direct

1198
01:07:50,889 --> 01:07:55,750
bit

1199
01:07:51,820 --> 01:08:00,220
it seems like reasonable to me so if we

1200
01:07:55,750 --> 01:08:01,510
look at this here we can take what this

1201
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:04,569
bit pattern is gonna actually end up

1202
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:07,720
being and so if we know that the Y is

1203
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:10,900
always whatever the second bit is then

1204
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:13,480
it's really just if we take this this

1205
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:20,680
bot face here what I can do is I can

1206
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:25,989
encode bot face in this case here right

1207
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:30,460
I can shift it down by one so that that

1208
01:08:25,989 --> 01:08:34,059
bit is is lined up right and then I can

1209
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:37,390
just end it with one that gives me for

1210
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:45,010
that particular face a 1 or a 0 as to

1211
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:46,450
whether or not we want the well it gives

1212
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:49,539
us whichever one we want right it gives

1213
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:51,639
us a 0 or a 1 which which we can then

1214
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:55,838
just multiply by the actual value we

1215
01:08:51,640 --> 01:09:02,829
wanted like so right and so each of

1216
01:08:55,838 --> 01:09:05,890
those can be encoded in a pretty simple

1217
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:11,199
routine here right I can basically say

1218
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:15,550
you know cube decode Y and we can say

1219
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:18,729
rotation like that or maybe I want to

1220
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:23,460
say you know face and offset something

1221
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:31,509
like that so it's just face plus offset

1222
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:34,689
and there's the value right supposed to

1223
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:39,338
be you also might want to do this for

1224
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:40,509
like what's the constant or well no we

1225
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:42,850
wouldn't have to because we just put it

1226
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:45,730
in there so I think that's all we really

1227
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:53,730
need we just say cube decode Y and we'd

1228
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:57,489
say that it's the bot face and 0 like so

1229
01:09:53,729 --> 01:10:03,149
and then we don't need the tile look up

1230
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:03,149
anymore at all right oops

1231
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:17,339
so now the only question is what do we

1232
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:19,500
want to do here right and so now we need

1233
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,440
a cube decode X which is basically the

1234
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:42,210
same exact function it's going to take

1235
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:44,129
bot face in the exact same way I and so

1236
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:46,380
it's gonna do the exact same thing so we

1237
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:48,960
have effectively the same function the

1238
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:51,989
only difference now is that it needs to

1239
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:56,279
be able to do an XOR so instead of

1240
01:10:51,989 --> 01:10:58,979
shifting it down being the only

1241
01:10:56,279 --> 01:11:03,359
operation that we're doing what we need

1242
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:06,179
to do is take that right which is this

1243
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:09,829
right here this phrase right here and it

1244
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,829
needs to XOR with itself

1245
01:11:17,989 --> 01:11:23,849
yeah I'm saying so basically we need to

1246
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,470
take the face plus the offset XOR it

1247
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:29,180
with the face flips the offset shift it

1248
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:33,980
down by one and then that will tell us

1249
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:47,030
what we actually needed to know right

1250
01:11:33,979 --> 01:12:00,299
all right leave that will come in there

1251
01:11:47,029 --> 01:12:05,969
all right perfect

1252
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:09,659
so let me also obviously here we got the

1253
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:11,760
wall UV will start UV will end UV so

1254
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,979
these are just ones we are going to want

1255
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,880
like those were ones we defined up here

1256
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:24,539
and we can now encode those into fact

1257
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:27,750
that'll give us a good test so now all

1258
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:30,600
we need to do is finish that off for the

1259
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:33,270
the bottom cube as well so inside and

1260
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:37,590
then renderer here and we don't need

1261
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:40,850
this anymore we can go ahead and encode

1262
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:44,670
this the top ones the exact same way so

1263
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:51,410
if we grab this and say here's our you

1264
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:51,409
know our top version

1265
01:12:59,368 --> 01:13:04,799
it just needs to use the top face and

1266
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:09,538
we're done now you'll note that the

1267
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:14,519
bottom face is probably not really

1268
01:13:09,538 --> 01:13:16,679
correct I guess I don't know how we

1269
01:13:14,519 --> 01:13:36,420
decided to encode those UVs

1270
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:37,828
so so we probably want to look at that

1271
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,908
at some point I don't know when that

1272
01:13:37,828 --> 01:13:40,498
point would be because I don't know

1273
01:13:38,908 --> 01:13:42,118
who's ever gonna use orientation on the

1274
01:13:40,498 --> 01:13:44,158
bottom like I said but you know it's

1275
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:45,988
there the top on the other hand we're

1276
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,598
gonna see right away so that one will be

1277
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:52,649
an easy easy one to play with and get

1278
01:13:48,599 --> 01:13:55,559
right but there we go so I think that's

1279
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:57,268
actually the encoding for everything and

1280
01:13:55,559 --> 01:14:02,038
now it's just correct

1281
01:13:57,269 --> 01:14:08,429
I believe so let's take a look here this

1282
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:11,670
is in the renderer test so that's in the

1283
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:15,590
renderer testbed so that's this and what

1284
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:19,649
you can see here is we have wall runs

1285
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:23,699
going right and so in order to preserve

1286
01:14:19,649 --> 01:14:26,518
those wall runs we want to do here is we

1287
01:14:23,698 --> 01:14:30,538
want to do wall start and end we want to

1288
01:14:26,519 --> 01:14:38,130
get those correct right so I believe a

1289
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:40,529
default wall UV is is actually not zero

1290
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:45,269
it's gonna be the one that's in the

1291
01:14:40,529 --> 01:14:46,800
middle so I think it's actually if we go

1292
01:14:45,269 --> 01:14:52,469
into the render here and look at the end

1293
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:56,809
code so in code cube UV layout this this

1294
01:14:52,469 --> 01:14:59,489
one right here so if we want to do

1295
01:14:56,809 --> 01:15:01,320
encoding for these right what we want to

1296
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:08,299
do here say all right here's our own

1297
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:08,299
coatings here's our wall UV

1298
01:15:08,829 --> 01:15:12,809
we know the bottom we don't care about

1299
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:15,850
the bottom facing we don't care about

1300
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:17,500
the side indices all the slides are

1301
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:21,430
gonna be the same they're gonna be the

1302
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:24,939
one that's two over and then the top

1303
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:26,020
again we don't really care but it has to

1304
01:15:24,939 --> 01:15:27,939
be zero for now because I don't think

1305
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:32,050
there are any other tops in there at the

1306
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:36,219
moment so that would be the wall UV the

1307
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:39,970
wall start UV is gonna be the first one

1308
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:43,240
in so that's gonna be this and the wall

1309
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:46,840
muv would be the final one over so that

1310
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:49,559
would be three and now we can actually

1311
01:15:46,840 --> 01:16:03,420
use the test bed to debug that code so

1312
01:15:49,560 --> 01:16:10,300
that's good I need to delete these and

1313
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:15,609
then I don't want to pass addresses I

1314
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:17,230
just want to pass the actual value all

1315
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:19,089
right and so now this gives us a good

1316
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:21,399
way to debug that so now we can step

1317
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:27,970
through and and and try to get those

1318
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:31,469
correct it looks like we've got our

1319
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:33,610
bottom and top reversed but otherwise I

1320
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:38,289
looks perfect actually

1321
01:16:33,609 --> 01:16:39,880
oh and you know why because we didn't

1322
01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:44,050
add seven five so that's actually

1323
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:47,350
exactly what we'd expect on the top

1324
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:49,449
you'll remember the y-coordinate so in

1325
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:53,940
cubicle black it's just just two two

1326
01:16:49,449 --> 01:16:58,349
five there so you need to offset it by

1327
01:16:53,939 --> 01:17:04,919
the fixed offset to put it up to the top

1328
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:04,920
so that may be it let's see

1329
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:13,319
yeah so let's suppose we wanted those

1330
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,239
runners to go the other way on one of

1331
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:19,558
these so let's suppose we wanted to

1332
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:21,589
encode facing direction for the top just

1333
01:17:19,559 --> 01:17:23,579
to see if it's working since we have a

1334
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:26,639
convenient way to test it here in the

1335
01:17:23,578 --> 01:17:29,849
renderer test so let's say that on the

1336
01:17:26,639 --> 01:17:33,559
end UV and only the end UV let's try

1337
01:17:29,849 --> 01:17:38,610
rotating 90 degrees oops

1338
01:17:33,559 --> 01:17:43,739
let's try rotating 90 degrees that will

1339
01:17:38,609 --> 01:17:47,538
end the top piece of the wall end so

1340
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:47,538
what we should see is it go like that

1341
01:17:48,349 --> 01:17:58,860
yeah and it is right so that's good

1342
01:17:54,029 --> 01:18:02,518
and similarly you know I could do a full

1343
01:17:58,859 --> 01:18:05,549
rotation along on the wall one so then

1344
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:08,340
we would see to counter facing but still

1345
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:12,599
90 degree rotating versions of that same

1346
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:14,010
bitmap is what we should see going along

1347
01:18:12,599 --> 01:18:15,779
the wall run now so that one should be

1348
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:17,849
facing that way and this is facing that

1349
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:21,328
way yeah let's make sure those face

1350
01:18:17,849 --> 01:18:22,980
effects are actually correct I don't

1351
01:18:21,328 --> 01:18:25,738
really know how to pause this in any

1352
01:18:22,979 --> 01:18:28,259
particularly good way but what we can do

1353
01:18:25,738 --> 01:18:34,488
is take a look at the block orphanage

1354
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:37,139
here so if it is just used with no

1355
01:18:34,488 --> 01:18:40,138
modification the bright side should

1356
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:43,670
point down so what that means is in 92

1357
01:18:40,139 --> 01:18:45,779
rotation the bright side points this way

1358
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:47,670
so you know just look at the bright side

1359
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:49,498
right I mean you know what let's do the

1360
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:54,989
dark side instead dark side starts

1361
01:18:49,498 --> 01:19:00,118
pointing up that way so with no rotation

1362
01:18:54,988 --> 01:19:04,589
which I believe we did on on the wall UV

1363
01:19:00,118 --> 01:19:08,038
I'm sorry on the well start UV it should

1364
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:09,328
point up which it does so I think that's

1365
01:19:08,038 --> 01:19:10,349
pretty much all we needed to really know

1366
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:15,599
but I'm just going to double check again

1367
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:17,998
so on the wall and UV right what we had

1368
01:19:15,599 --> 01:19:20,050
was it should be rotated once which in

1369
01:19:17,998 --> 01:19:23,760
this case actually that

1370
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:23,760
rotation looks backwards to me

1371
01:19:36,569 --> 01:19:47,500
that rotation looks backwards to me so

1372
01:19:43,118 --> 01:19:50,439
going around the incrementing by by

1373
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:56,198
forward by one is not actually what we

1374
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:58,448
want we want to subtract by one there so

1375
01:19:56,198 --> 01:20:00,819
there is one other thing I should

1376
01:19:58,448 --> 01:20:03,250
probably do now that we're incrementing

1377
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:08,429
these these probably do want to be

1378
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:08,429
ending so that they won't carry right

1379
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:17,859
because we could get a situate well I

1380
01:20:11,469 --> 01:20:19,389
mean they can't really carry yeah but if

1381
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:28,299
we want to do subtraction we're gonna

1382
01:20:19,389 --> 01:20:30,190
have to okay I think all right so yeah I

1383
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:33,400
think that's all correct but it looks

1384
01:20:30,189 --> 01:20:36,899
like we kind of want to go the opposite

1385
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:36,899
direction I guess

1386
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:01,890
let me see if that makes sense to me I

1387
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:01,890
want to make sure I've got this right

1388
01:21:07,859 --> 01:21:11,729
get a lit up Milton here

1389
01:21:26,069 --> 01:21:30,659
it's time we got left half an hour

1390
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:43,359
so what we said is we said like okay

1391
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:54,130
here are our coordinates it was like

1392
01:21:43,359 --> 01:22:00,549
zero zero 0.25 0.25 0.25 and 0.25 right

1393
01:21:54,130 --> 01:22:03,810
so it's drawing that set of texture

1394
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:06,250
coordinates hopefully for all I know we

1395
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:09,400
did some weirdness in there when we

1396
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:13,569
actually have cubes but it's in theory

1397
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:15,069
in theory doing that in fact let me just

1398
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:17,369
even check to make sure that that is

1399
01:22:15,069 --> 01:22:17,369
what it's doing

1400
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,989
it's yeah I mean it's definitely going

1401
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:37,890
around the in the counterclockwise

1402
01:22:33,989 --> 01:22:40,800
fashion okay so if this is the order in

1403
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:42,450
which we are doing it and we have a

1404
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,010
particular orientation that we're saying

1405
01:22:42,449 --> 01:22:46,769
so we're saying this is the starting

1406
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:50,489
orientation when done in that form if we

1407
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:56,130
wanted to rotate this so it was pointing

1408
01:22:50,489 --> 01:22:59,969
that way right so if this is 0 this is 1

1409
01:22:56,130 --> 01:23:05,310
or let me do it with ABCs if this is a b

1410
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:07,980
c d then rotating it one that way right

1411
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:18,870
if we want to rotate it we would assign

1412
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:26,189
D to here a to here right B to here and

1413
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:29,099
C 2 here so it is true that it is minus

1414
01:23:26,189 --> 01:23:30,419
1 though the value you assign is

1415
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:35,460
whatever the value you were going to

1416
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:45,750
assign minus 1 so I didn't do that

1417
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:50,960
properly right what I want to do in here

1418
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:50,960
is actually this

1419
01:24:00,789 --> 01:24:04,539
and I think that will still do the right

1420
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:06,609
thing because I believe that the binary

1421
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,680
wrapping that goes when you go from zero

1422
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:09,698
to FFF will still produce the correct

1423
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,590
bit pattern cuz they'll still produce

1424
01:24:09,698 --> 01:24:15,639
two ones in the bottom which is what we

1425
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:17,880
wanted when you wrap so I think that

1426
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:23,650
should still give us the correct result

1427
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:27,810
with only that change okay so with the

1428
01:24:23,649 --> 01:24:43,509
rotation just make sure this is correct

1429
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:46,270
so the walls start oh sorry it's

1430
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:48,190
actually not quite that simple i negated

1431
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:50,170
the wrong parameter its face that

1432
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:51,969
actually wants to be negated so it's

1433
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:55,569
really a subtraction is it this way

1434
01:24:51,969 --> 01:24:57,640
right offset is always correct it's

1435
01:24:55,569 --> 01:25:00,849
really just face that subtracts it away

1436
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:03,910
so that was right I bet I'm like that's

1437
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:05,500
that's not gonna be correct that's gonna

1438
01:25:03,909 --> 01:25:06,760
be correct because face is the thing

1439
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,899
that's the rotation parameter and the

1440
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,630
rotation parameter is the thing that

1441
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:15,279
subtracts so let's try that one more

1442
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:18,029
time so again no change and we should

1443
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:22,539
have the dark point facing upwards it is

1444
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:28,539
a rotation of one and the dark point

1445
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:31,060
should be facing to the left right which

1446
01:25:28,539 --> 01:25:32,350
it is and then a rotation of three and

1447
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:34,989
it should face it back the other way and

1448
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:40,420
it is so I think we're good I think

1449
01:25:34,988 --> 01:25:43,959
we're good so I'm happy with that

1450
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:46,899
okay so again this is good because now

1451
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:51,189
we can encode that very very easily

1452
01:25:46,899 --> 01:25:53,738
right now we can encode what we want to

1453
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:56,019
put on cubes in a very concise manner

1454
01:25:53,738 --> 01:25:59,799
that's easy to pack into anywhere

1455
01:25:56,020 --> 01:26:01,630
doesn't cost us hardly anything and if

1456
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,369
we find that our bandwidth usage is

1457
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:05,289
getting too high it gives us a

1458
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:10,420
convenient way to eventually send that

1459
01:26:05,289 --> 01:26:11,939
down imagine all of this and all of that

1460
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:13,890
going away

1461
01:26:11,939 --> 01:26:15,629
it would just send down sixteen bits to

1462
01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:18,719
the GPU which could then expand it out

1463
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:21,199
using the same logic right so that could

1464
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:23,600
save a ton of bandwidth there I'm sorry

1465
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:28,259
I'm a little sick so I'm losing my voice

1466
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:32,850
slowly but surely I could make it

1467
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:35,869
another 30 minutes so um so yeah that

1468
01:26:32,850 --> 01:26:35,870
all seems good

1469
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:50,298
I think that's just a straight-up win so

1470
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:52,488
let's get back then to what we want to

1471
01:26:50,298 --> 01:26:53,929
be able to use that for which is to say

1472
01:26:52,488 --> 01:26:56,388
that we would like to be able to encode

1473
01:26:53,929 --> 01:26:59,269
that so now it would be pretty easiest

1474
01:26:56,389 --> 01:27:02,958
easy for us to encode that so if we take

1475
01:26:59,269 --> 01:27:04,699
a look at the visible piece structure it

1476
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:08,208
would be pretty free now for us to

1477
01:27:04,698 --> 01:27:17,509
encode that as a possible parameter here

1478
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:20,148
for for anyone who puts a cube into the

1479
01:27:17,509 --> 01:27:22,399
pipeline they can now specify how they

1480
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:25,309
would want that to be textured we know

1481
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:28,009
that only cubes would need it non cubes

1482
01:27:25,309 --> 01:27:31,519
wouldn't need it so we may want to kind

1483
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:33,439
of introduce down here something that's

1484
01:27:31,519 --> 01:27:35,719
just going to be extra parameters for

1485
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:42,349
physical pieces that really don't have

1486
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:46,189
to be stored like separately so only

1487
01:27:42,349 --> 01:27:54,048
cubes would need a cube UV layout right

1488
01:27:46,189 --> 01:27:56,659
and similarly something like a I think

1489
01:27:54,048 --> 01:27:58,538
like a light value you know could store

1490
01:27:56,658 --> 01:28:01,429
its emission there so basically any

1491
01:27:58,538 --> 01:28:05,929
pieces can each of the types of pieces

1492
01:28:01,429 --> 01:28:10,009
that might be involved like cube or

1493
01:28:05,929 --> 01:28:11,958
light can can store something extra in

1494
01:28:10,009 --> 01:28:13,309
here if they need to and other that can

1495
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:17,179
be overlapping because we don't need to

1496
01:28:13,309 --> 01:28:23,628
store it for everything so if we look at

1497
01:28:17,179 --> 01:28:25,998
that that should pretty much do it

1498
01:28:23,628 --> 01:28:29,358
because that completely controls the

1499
01:28:25,998 --> 01:28:36,559
that part of the the layout process so

1500
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:38,329
if I was to go and say now let's when we

1501
01:28:36,559 --> 01:28:41,509
add a piece let me add a cube piece

1502
01:28:38,328 --> 01:28:47,108
let's have them specify the cube UV

1503
01:28:41,509 --> 01:28:50,628
layouts in addition so in any that age

1504
01:28:47,109 --> 01:28:55,449
there isn't I thought there was wasn't

1505
01:28:50,628 --> 01:28:55,448
there an add piece where do we put those

1506
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:05,699
in room gender well I guess that does

1507
01:29:01,859 --> 01:29:08,849
make some sense all right

1508
01:29:05,699 --> 01:29:13,229
so inside here where we do an ad piece

1509
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:20,789
to an entity and when we're going to put

1510
01:29:13,229 --> 01:29:28,019
in one that's a cube which I guess we

1511
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:31,399
don't really differentiate much I do

1512
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:35,930
think we kind of want one of those right

1513
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:53,369
so we kind of want one where we say

1514
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:55,380
here's a cube so I don't know I mean I

1515
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:57,510
will see how we want to do that but when

1516
01:29:55,380 --> 01:30:01,170
we do an ad piece we should get back the

1517
01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:02,880
piece right or do we not we should

1518
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:07,350
because you may want to make changes to

1519
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:09,659
the to that encoded version so I feel

1520
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:15,260
like ad piece should actually return to

1521
01:30:09,659 --> 01:30:15,260
you the piece you know I'm saying like

1522
01:30:17,899 --> 01:30:24,319
you should be allowed to to fuss with it

1523
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,320
I would think

1524
01:30:31,889 --> 01:30:43,029
oops so I'm just going to go ahead and

1525
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:45,638
make these all return that information

1526
01:30:43,029 --> 01:31:06,550
to you in case you want to specify

1527
01:30:45,639 --> 01:31:13,510
something in there like so and then the

1528
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:20,250
code for specifying the walls can easily

1529
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:30,489
just set those you these as they wish so

1530
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:45,850
let me think so there's one of the thing

1531
01:31:30,488 --> 01:31:53,609
that we would possibly need so I don't

1532
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:53,610
know it's hard to say but

1533
01:31:54,739 --> 01:32:05,880
akiza's we could also support mirroring

1534
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:08,450
so like instead of allowing the bottom

1535
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:13,289
to rotate we could pack into those bits

1536
01:32:08,449 --> 01:32:19,970
to mirroring so a mirror bit for each of

1537
01:32:13,289 --> 01:32:24,859
the sides if you want to flip that way I

1538
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:38,490
don't know that we actually need that

1539
01:32:24,859 --> 01:32:45,449
for any purpose I can't think of a

1540
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:47,729
particular reason why we would but it's

1541
01:32:45,449 --> 01:32:50,010
worth noting so I'll just throw that out

1542
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:52,709
there in case we'll see if we hit it I

1543
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:54,360
guess what I'd say is if we ever hit a

1544
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:56,760
case where we want to be able to flip

1545
01:32:54,359 --> 01:32:58,909
things then I would say what we do is we

1546
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:01,980
cannibalized those top two bits and

1547
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:03,960
they'll become the way that we do that

1548
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:05,879
because the bottom doesn't really need

1549
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,920
to be spun sorry that's not the top two

1550
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:14,069
bits that's the second two bits in we'll

1551
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:17,039
switch those to be mirror bits I think

1552
01:33:14,069 --> 01:33:19,019
that's about it for that so now we move

1553
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:22,729
on to the tagging part which is kind of

1554
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:22,730
the more difficult part there right

1555
01:33:22,909 --> 01:33:27,269
because now the room layout code could

1556
01:33:25,229 --> 01:33:29,459
just set whatever cube layouts it wants

1557
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:32,490
or anything in there so now the problem

1558
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:35,819
becomes well what are the actual ways

1559
01:33:32,489 --> 01:33:44,189
that this entities this visible piece is

1560
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:45,719
going to get picked right and the way

1561
01:33:44,189 --> 01:33:47,429
we're doing it currently is we're

1562
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:56,699
basically saying look there's an asset

1563
01:33:47,430 --> 01:33:59,250
type and that asset type is gonna tell

1564
01:33:56,699 --> 01:34:02,729
you which texture type to look for and

1565
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:05,270
then you're going to match tags the rest

1566
01:34:02,729 --> 01:34:05,269
of the way down

1567
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:35,250
so what I will say is I do think there's

1568
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:41,909
something to be said for retaining what

1569
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:45,300
amounts to a two-tier system one where

1570
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:48,649
you select sort of the channel of asset

1571
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:56,310
you're looking for and then the other

1572
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:59,099
where you set where you use information

1573
01:34:56,310 --> 01:35:01,520
about the entity to pick an asset from

1574
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,520
the set

1575
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:20,560
so I think what we would want to say

1576
01:35:17,448 --> 01:35:24,138
right because just thinking it through

1577
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:30,820
it does make sense to basically say this

1578
01:35:24,139 --> 01:35:35,719
visual piece is an is an orphanage wall

1579
01:35:30,819 --> 01:35:39,710
so don't ever select anything other than

1580
01:35:35,719 --> 01:35:42,139
an orphanage wall and here's the part

1581
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:45,920
you know here's the which part of the

1582
01:35:42,139 --> 01:35:48,170
orphanage wall it is but then you could

1583
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,118
dump like ten different orphanage wall

1584
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:54,139
tile sets in there and they could have

1585
01:35:50,118 --> 01:35:57,738
stuff to do with like how wet it is how

1586
01:35:54,139 --> 01:35:59,900
damaged it is how burnt it is whatever

1587
01:35:57,738 --> 01:36:03,638
all of those things could all just be

1588
01:35:59,899 --> 01:36:06,439
fed into the system and if there was

1589
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:14,920
artwork to reflect any of those things

1590
01:36:06,439 --> 01:36:14,919
then that is what you would get right so

1591
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:23,360
it does seem like that one is pretty

1592
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:25,730
straightforward and we don't really need

1593
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:27,738
to go particularly far afield to figure

1594
01:36:25,729 --> 01:36:33,049
out what the right situation would be

1595
01:36:27,738 --> 01:36:36,250
there and so adding something into a

1596
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:40,570
table that basically says this is an

1597
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:40,569
orphanage wall piece

1598
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:50,010
is probably what we want and then

1599
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:57,779
anything that further specializes on

1600
01:36:50,010 --> 01:37:00,199
orphanage wall piece you know off off

1601
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:00,199
you go

1602
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:41,000
so I'm trying to think in addition to

1603
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:45,520
that I'm trying to think of ways in

1604
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,520
which this will be problematic and

1605
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:54,920
really the only one that comes to mind

1606
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:57,589
at the immediate moment is that the act

1607
01:37:54,920 --> 01:38:01,119
of searching through the information

1608
01:37:57,590 --> 01:38:08,529
available to find the best match is

1609
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:08,529
itself fairly expensive so if you take

1610
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:16,460
you know the set of entity properties

1611
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:19,489
that are currently you know on that

1612
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:23,930
entity and you want to send them off to

1613
01:38:19,489 --> 01:38:25,729
be matched against the asset system you

1614
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:29,450
probably don't want to do that for every

1615
01:38:25,729 --> 01:38:34,429
wall tile every frame because as you get

1616
01:38:29,449 --> 01:38:36,859
more wall bitmaps let's say the artist

1617
01:38:34,430 --> 01:38:40,520
just goes nuts at some point and decides

1618
01:38:36,859 --> 01:38:43,069
to draw like 30 different bitmaps for

1619
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,480
this particular type of wall tile that

1620
01:38:43,069 --> 01:38:47,929
means you're gonna search through a list

1621
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:53,299
matching a vector on 30 things for every

1622
01:38:47,930 --> 01:39:00,320
wall every frame right I mean every

1623
01:38:53,300 --> 01:39:05,900
visible wall but you know still that

1624
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:08,239
seems unwise so I would suspect that at

1625
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:10,609
the very least that information has to

1626
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:18,159
be cached and only updated when the

1627
01:39:10,609 --> 01:39:22,089
entity properties change I would assume

1628
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:22,090
now maybe that's not true

1629
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:34,359
it's hard to say I mean one thing that

1630
01:39:32,649 --> 01:39:40,119
is true is it's completely paralyzed

1631
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:42,009
Abul you know all eight cores of a

1632
01:39:40,119 --> 01:39:43,989
modern CPU could all be sitting around

1633
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:46,239
doing nothing but matching stuff every

1634
01:39:43,989 --> 01:39:48,750
frame so if you really thought you were

1635
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:51,609
gonna get some leverage out of it in

1636
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:54,100
making it more dynamic and responsive in

1637
01:39:51,609 --> 01:39:56,559
terms of as the environment changes the

1638
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:58,270
graphics change along with it

1639
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,760
then it's not entirely out of the

1640
01:39:58,270 --> 01:40:03,760
question that you could do a bunch of

1641
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:06,520
stuff with that however it does seem to

1642
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:15,070
me that you know caching would possibly

1643
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:17,560
want to be on the table and honestly I

1644
01:40:15,069 --> 01:40:20,529
don't think that's really a big deal

1645
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:22,990
because we need to cache the lighting

1646
01:40:20,529 --> 01:40:24,579
information anyway and we want to cache

1647
01:40:22,989 --> 01:40:26,829
the letting information only for things

1648
01:40:24,579 --> 01:40:28,750
that are recently visible and so I think

1649
01:40:26,829 --> 01:40:31,569
it's been in the back of my head for a

1650
01:40:28,750 --> 01:40:33,579
while but what I want to do is have it

1651
01:40:31,569 --> 01:40:36,429
so that there's basically an entity

1652
01:40:33,579 --> 01:40:39,250
cache that's used that's like an a least

1653
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:42,369
recently used sort of discard scheme

1654
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:45,119
that just stores transient entity info

1655
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:47,769
so basically stuff like lighting and

1656
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:51,550
what the latest matches were for that

1657
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:53,230
entity for bitmaps could just be in

1658
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:55,210
there and that's a scheme that's gonna

1659
01:40:53,229 --> 01:40:58,419
go in regardless

1660
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:58,420
[Music]

1661
01:41:01,809 --> 01:41:23,199
so it seems safe you know it seems safe

1662
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:28,179
to me now if I go look at the file

1663
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:31,750
format stuff here and I'm just gonna

1664
01:41:28,179 --> 01:41:36,279
look really quickly that's sort of how

1665
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:38,738
this stuff was being done so the way

1666
01:41:36,279 --> 01:41:47,738
that it is encoded in the file is basic

1667
01:41:38,738 --> 01:41:49,658
category is you know just encodes

1668
01:41:47,738 --> 01:41:51,098
exactly the thing that I just said which

1669
01:41:49,658 --> 01:41:52,839
is stuff like you know what is this

1670
01:41:51,099 --> 01:41:58,119
thing oh it's like a basic wall piece or

1671
01:41:52,840 --> 01:42:03,239
something like that and so I think we

1672
01:41:58,118 --> 01:42:03,238
can just say that that that's gonna be

1673
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,969
that's going to be something that we

1674
01:42:10,899 --> 01:42:17,788
just defined to have meaning in our

1675
01:42:12,969 --> 01:42:17,788
world and we go from there

1676
01:42:22,729 --> 01:42:34,309
and so it really does seem like we would

1677
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:43,850
be fine with that and off we would go so

1678
01:42:34,310 --> 01:42:46,460
let's take a quick look here was our

1679
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:49,730
original asset type buys ID for v-0

1680
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:55,220
right this is what all this stuff looked

1681
01:42:49,729 --> 01:42:58,879
like and so if I just briefly moved that

1682
01:42:55,220 --> 01:43:01,460
forwards into file formats here and

1683
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:05,960
really I guess what we want to do is

1684
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:07,789
talk about the category now there's just

1685
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:10,520
going to be some concept of an asset

1686
01:43:07,789 --> 01:43:22,159
category right so there would be a thing

1687
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:24,860
that's like something like this and

1688
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:30,579
these are like legacy things right so

1689
01:43:24,859 --> 01:43:30,579
this is all legacy stuff here

1690
01:43:37,869 --> 01:43:44,500
that maybe if we do a full asset rebuild

1691
01:43:40,789 --> 01:43:44,500
at some point we would just get rid of

1692
01:43:58,979 --> 01:44:05,999
we could leave asset and none in there

1693
01:44:02,609 --> 01:44:25,978
for now right so here's all the legacy

1694
01:44:05,998 --> 01:44:31,228
stuff and so I think what I want to say

1695
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:39,349
here is look let's start with some basic

1696
01:44:31,229 --> 01:44:39,349
stuff here let's call this like you know

1697
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:48,389
maybe this is like it's like wooden drop

1698
01:44:46,469 --> 01:44:59,670
wooden drywall is what it looks like

1699
01:44:48,389 --> 01:45:01,708
basically right um so I don't know how

1700
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:02,998
far we want to go down with this but you

1701
01:45:01,708 --> 01:45:03,929
know if we want to say that basically

1702
01:45:02,998 --> 01:45:08,670
like there's a certain type of

1703
01:45:03,929 --> 01:45:10,618
construction it's wooden drywall and we

1704
01:45:08,670 --> 01:45:17,670
basically say like here's an interior

1705
01:45:10,618 --> 01:45:19,880
wall right I guess this is really just a

1706
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:19,880
wall

1707
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:39,969
if we just hmm

1708
01:45:36,689 --> 01:45:42,309
use basic categories like that and rely

1709
01:45:39,969 --> 01:45:43,710
on parameters to get us the rest such as

1710
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:47,440
damage

1711
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:49,689
you know dusty miss moss eNOS those

1712
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:55,119
sorts of things

1713
01:45:49,689 --> 01:45:57,689
I assume that's good enough so basically

1714
01:45:55,119 --> 01:46:07,119
what we would say on here is you know

1715
01:45:57,689 --> 01:46:10,539
the basic category is here and we go

1716
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:14,369
from there right and these would remain

1717
01:46:10,539 --> 01:46:19,380
in effect but now we can like import

1718
01:46:14,369 --> 01:46:19,380
these three things in there right

1719
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:25,890
and then for forest you know we would

1720
01:46:23,619 --> 01:46:25,890
have

1721
01:46:41,210 --> 01:46:44,539
something like this

1722
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:53,220
I mean possibly it could also be that we

1723
01:46:50,909 --> 01:46:56,340
really want the grassiness of something

1724
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:58,260
to sort of be a parameter so we may want

1725
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:00,840
to do something a little bit differently

1726
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:05,039
where we would say something like you

1727
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:08,449
know that's sort of like a field and we

1728
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:11,519
would have a grassiness parameter right

1729
01:47:08,449 --> 01:47:14,130
but in terms of the blocks we have like

1730
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:18,030
that would kind of say which one we

1731
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:23,400
wanted and if we imported those assets

1732
01:47:18,029 --> 01:47:27,929
in and assigned them that way and had

1733
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:34,279
some tags to describe those then I think

1734
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:38,400
we're basically where we want to be and

1735
01:47:34,279 --> 01:47:42,289
so I think that's roughly what we want

1736
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:42,289
let's see here

1737
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:14,000
I think we're just gonna basically

1738
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:17,590
update this enum and there's probably

1739
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,590
not a lot more to it than that

1740
01:48:32,149 --> 01:48:38,360
and now I like that naming better

1741
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:42,439
because asset type was not a

1742
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:45,918
particularly good way of talking about

1743
01:48:42,439 --> 01:48:47,659
assets because the type of an asset

1744
01:48:45,918 --> 01:48:51,288
makes it sound like we're saying bitmap

1745
01:48:47,658 --> 01:48:54,458
or sound whereas category lets us know

1746
01:48:51,288 --> 01:49:00,168
that we're talking about sort of like

1747
01:48:54,458 --> 01:49:03,398
you know a genus like you know is it an

1748
01:49:00,168 --> 01:49:06,229
animal is it a wall is it a you know

1749
01:49:03,399 --> 01:49:08,829
treasure chest type of thing you know

1750
01:49:06,229 --> 01:49:11,090
what's the actual category of it

1751
01:49:08,828 --> 01:49:13,188
so distinguishing between a type of

1752
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:15,828
asset which may be a physical thing in a

1753
01:49:13,189 --> 01:49:17,239
file which may be the asset system

1754
01:49:15,828 --> 01:49:18,590
always needs to know about a basic

1755
01:49:17,238 --> 01:49:20,418
category is more of a matching

1756
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:23,179
information like oh you can restrict the

1757
01:49:20,418 --> 01:49:27,828
matching to this thing you know a priori

1758
01:49:23,179 --> 01:49:42,399
kind of a thing right seems a little bit

1759
01:49:27,828 --> 01:49:42,398
better let me just

1760
01:50:22,529 --> 01:50:27,750
so yeah I think this is reasonable so

1761
01:50:25,738 --> 01:50:29,099
we're really not it looks like honestly

1762
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:32,219
we're not gonna really have to change

1763
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:37,140
things much it looks like we more or

1764
01:50:32,219 --> 01:50:43,350
less had the right idea at least for

1765
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:47,160
this particular version so really I'm

1766
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:52,380
just going to rename that old version to

1767
01:50:47,159 --> 01:50:55,019
a more sensible name then type and think

1768
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:57,569
that maybe all we really need at least

1769
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:59,610
four walls and floors seems like that

1770
01:50:57,569 --> 01:51:04,170
should be fine and then we'll try it

1771
01:50:59,609 --> 01:51:05,759
with something harder like a monster or

1772
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:09,170
the hero

1773
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:09,170
and we'll kind of go from there

1774
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:29,408
[Music]

1775
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:42,079
and really this is just boring busy work

1776
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:47,339
there's nothing to say pretty much just

1777
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:55,050
exactly what it looks like just kind of

1778
01:51:47,340 --> 01:52:06,600
changing the nominator a little bit all

1779
01:51:55,050 --> 01:52:10,619
right so now that that's done what we

1780
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:11,929
should be able to do is tomorrow and

1781
01:52:10,619 --> 01:52:14,488
I'll stop it there

1782
01:52:11,929 --> 01:52:17,699
tomorrow we should be able to go build

1783
01:52:14,488 --> 01:52:21,479
import tables for importing things like

1784
01:52:17,698 --> 01:52:23,789
those block files so tomorrow we should

1785
01:52:21,479 --> 01:52:27,089
be able to basically change this room

1786
01:52:23,789 --> 01:52:32,069
into something that has proper walls and

1787
01:52:27,090 --> 01:52:33,900
a proper floor and unless we hit a snafu

1788
01:52:32,069 --> 01:52:36,719
there that should be what we do tomorrow

1789
01:52:33,899 --> 01:52:38,639
and it should be fine we should also be

1790
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:43,439
able to make it so that if you walk out

1791
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:47,130
here into what should nominally be like

1792
01:52:43,439 --> 01:52:50,359
the other part of the world we got to

1793
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:52,409
eventually do our final camera code too

1794
01:52:50,359 --> 01:52:55,469
once you get out here it should be a

1795
01:52:52,409 --> 01:52:58,590
forest right and and then there's oh

1796
01:52:55,469 --> 01:53:01,198
right we need downward as well so we can

1797
01:52:58,590 --> 01:53:03,690
get dungeons right we've got dungeons in

1798
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:07,069
there right you can go underground and

1799
01:53:03,689 --> 01:53:10,738
stuff you can see them so we want to

1800
01:53:07,069 --> 01:53:11,849
want to make all that happen - so

1801
01:53:10,738 --> 01:53:15,779
tomorrow we should be able to do all

1802
01:53:11,850 --> 01:53:18,360
that and that'll get our art importing

1803
01:53:15,779 --> 01:53:21,000
seeing if that works roughly the way we

1804
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:23,549
think it should so and we can again just

1805
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,779
keep iterating on it so it's good I'm

1806
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:26,779
gonna go ahead and go to the Q&amp;A now

1807
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:55,369
in the render tests the corner blocks

1808
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:57,289
that are on the side of the building

1809
01:53:55,369 --> 01:53:58,970
have their diagonal beams reversed due

1810
01:53:57,289 --> 01:54:00,229
to sharing their texture with the front

1811
01:53:58,970 --> 01:54:02,659
blocks you have a plan for handling that

1812
01:54:00,229 --> 01:54:08,689
yeah that's actually so that's just

1813
01:54:02,659 --> 01:54:12,949
because the renderer test isn't encoding

1814
01:54:08,689 --> 01:54:18,829
that information into its database right

1815
01:54:12,949 --> 01:54:23,269
so if you look in here we just have all

1816
01:54:18,829 --> 01:54:26,779
of them use the same UV right so all the

1817
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:30,950
sides use the same UV if we instead in

1818
01:54:26,779 --> 01:54:35,210
here actually encoded different kinds of

1819
01:54:30,949 --> 01:54:38,869
wall starting right then you know we

1820
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:40,850
wouldn't have that happen so you know we

1821
01:54:38,869 --> 01:54:45,380
could if you wanted to make the renderer

1822
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:50,000
test app a little bit more fancy in that

1823
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:53,000
sense then if you looked here you could

1824
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,640
you could go okay in the test scene

1825
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,090
we've got the test scene element and

1826
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:01,430
it's got these sort of parameters as it

1827
01:54:59,090 --> 01:55:05,690
grasses a tree is it you know it's a

1828
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:08,440
wall whatever right um you could decide

1829
01:55:05,689 --> 01:55:12,009
to make it more explicit here and it

1830
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:16,369
record what encoding you wanted as well

1831
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:19,600
so for example suppose you did that and

1832
01:55:16,369 --> 01:55:19,599
then you did this

1833
01:55:28,429 --> 01:55:45,500
and now we said hey right that would

1834
01:55:43,609 --> 01:55:47,839
give you the ability to encode that

1835
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:49,550
information and then use it later now as

1836
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:52,969
I'm typing that I'm kind of glad you

1837
01:55:49,550 --> 01:55:54,289
asked that question because it again we

1838
01:55:52,969 --> 01:55:56,989
wanted our renderer to kind of be

1839
01:55:54,289 --> 01:55:59,779
something used outside and so what that

1840
01:55:56,988 --> 01:56:05,448
suggests is really this you know should

1841
01:55:59,779 --> 01:56:06,698
be a thing where we you know do

1842
01:56:05,448 --> 01:56:10,879
something a little bit more like that

1843
01:56:06,698 --> 01:56:16,519
because we'd rather have people use an

1844
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:18,770
explicit encoding where it's not just a

1845
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:21,199
you 16 because what if later we decide

1846
01:56:18,770 --> 01:56:24,079
we really need 32 bits to encode our UV

1847
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:26,118
layouts for cubes well now everyone has

1848
01:56:24,078 --> 01:56:28,519
to change their code rather than it just

1849
01:56:26,118 --> 01:56:30,229
working so wrapping it in a struct again

1850
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,670
because we did decide we wanted the

1851
01:56:30,229 --> 01:56:34,058
renderer to be a little bit more of a

1852
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:37,158
first-class citizen something that is

1853
01:56:34,059 --> 01:56:38,779
possibly useful outside or being used by

1854
01:56:37,158 --> 01:56:42,379
multiple people eventually and so on I

1855
01:56:38,779 --> 01:56:45,259
think we want to continue that idea and

1856
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:48,139
and not sort of cheese out when it comes

1857
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:51,400
to making additions to it so you know it

1858
01:56:48,139 --> 01:56:51,400
would look something more like this

1859
01:56:59,020 --> 01:57:03,099
something like that right so then when

1860
01:57:01,779 --> 01:57:05,019
you say encoding uvl you're actually

1861
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:07,599
doing this and when you pass a UV layout

1862
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:27,550
cure what you're actually passing is

1863
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:31,630
something like this so you can sort of

1864
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:32,860
pass something if you want to you can

1865
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:34,599
you can ignore it and it'll just

1866
01:57:32,859 --> 01:57:37,689
automatically construct the one that's

1867
01:57:34,599 --> 01:57:39,489
nothing but otherwise you can you know

1868
01:57:37,689 --> 01:57:40,629
create one here but it's always make

1869
01:57:39,488 --> 01:57:42,428
sure you're actually talking about

1870
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:45,578
layout and not accidentally passing some

1871
01:57:42,429 --> 01:57:47,770
other thing right and so that seems

1872
01:57:45,578 --> 01:57:49,029
pretty good and let me just go ahead and

1873
01:57:47,770 --> 01:57:56,079
quickly update the code for vex think

1874
01:57:49,029 --> 01:57:58,689
that's a worthwhile change right and so

1875
01:57:56,078 --> 01:58:00,578
here where we talk about UV layout all

1876
01:57:58,689 --> 01:58:09,098
of these are actually just the encoding

1877
01:58:00,578 --> 01:58:11,170
on the UV layout right so that's easy

1878
01:58:09,099 --> 01:58:13,420
enough and then everyone else who passes

1879
01:58:11,170 --> 01:58:15,399
something in just kind of has to deal

1880
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:17,380
with that now I don't really want to do

1881
01:58:15,399 --> 01:58:21,339
the render test just yet I'd rather work

1882
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:22,868
on him maybe he rows one first to make

1883
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:23,670
it well alright I'll do the render test

1884
01:58:22,868 --> 01:58:27,939
first

1885
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:29,170
whatevs so here we just need to know

1886
01:58:27,939 --> 01:58:35,019
that we're checking the type field

1887
01:58:29,170 --> 01:58:36,730
instead of the well you get the idea we

1888
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:38,320
just need to use the type field instead

1889
01:58:36,729 --> 01:58:40,658
because we've now said that there's an

1890
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:42,399
actual struct here right so now what

1891
01:58:40,658 --> 01:58:44,259
we're saying is well the scene elements

1892
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:46,089
in this case right equals a particular

1893
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:49,809
element type you can see here we're

1894
01:58:46,090 --> 01:58:51,940
doing like the wall here and here we're

1895
01:58:49,809 --> 01:58:55,900
doing some other part of it you know

1896
01:58:51,939 --> 01:58:58,058
blah blah blah right so in this case we

1897
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:59,649
can just do this although we're gonna

1898
01:58:58,059 --> 01:59:02,789
wanna do something fancier in a second

1899
01:58:59,649 --> 01:59:02,789
here right

1900
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:19,250
and then actually so I guess we can even

1901
01:59:16,970 --> 01:59:21,650
do it well I might as well just encode

1902
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:22,699
it here so two retaining the exact same

1903
01:59:21,649 --> 01:59:24,109
behavior we're not gonna fix anything

1904
01:59:22,699 --> 01:59:27,590
but just encode the exact same behavior

1905
01:59:24,109 --> 01:59:29,479
if we were to put the UV stuff here then

1906
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:31,789
when you place a rectangular wall you

1907
01:59:29,479 --> 01:59:35,929
know here's the encoding for the basic

1908
01:59:31,789 --> 01:59:39,769
wall stuff what we would say is that as

1909
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:42,079
we come through here we're going to want

1910
01:59:39,770 --> 01:59:48,740
to set these elements to something in

1911
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:51,109
particular so we need to do this so

1912
01:59:48,739 --> 01:59:53,000
we're setting both of these to whichever

1913
01:59:51,109 --> 01:59:54,710
one of the element types that we would

1914
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,199
have here it's just gonna be wall in

1915
01:59:54,710 --> 02:00:02,239
this case because now we don't set that

1916
01:59:57,199 --> 02:00:11,050
anymore and then we need to set the UV

1917
02:00:02,239 --> 02:00:11,050
layouts right for each of these

1918
02:00:21,560 --> 02:00:29,610
right so it's actually this statement

1919
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:32,910
here and we don't need this anymore

1920
02:00:29,609 --> 02:00:35,099
because it's not changing so really this

1921
02:00:32,909 --> 02:00:37,948
statement here is the thing that's going

1922
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:46,350
to control how these cube UV layouts

1923
02:00:37,948 --> 02:00:47,939
actually work right right

1924
02:00:46,350 --> 02:00:51,690
but it's even a little bit more

1925
02:00:47,939 --> 02:00:52,979
complicated than that because some you

1926
02:00:51,689 --> 02:00:56,069
we're gonna have to switch the Y's as

1927
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:58,079
well but for right now we won't do that

1928
02:00:56,069 --> 02:01:05,099
right for right now we're just gonna do

1929
02:00:58,079 --> 02:01:06,539
the same one as we did before right and

1930
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:09,929
we're not going to do anything else

1931
02:01:06,539 --> 02:01:12,300
fancy so we're just doing the basics

1932
02:01:09,929 --> 02:01:17,579
here and so for these these are just

1933
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:19,320
element wall so they would be well I

1934
02:01:17,579 --> 02:01:24,439
guess I can actually do it exactly the

1935
02:01:19,319 --> 02:01:24,439
same way since they're both the same

1936
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:37,640
right so that will set you v's as well

1937
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:42,980
now and these of course are now a real

1938
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:44,210
type right so again not doing anything

1939
02:01:42,979 --> 02:01:45,799
different here I just think it's

1940
02:01:44,210 --> 02:01:47,770
something that was done at runtime and

1941
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:50,210
actually just recording it now into the

1942
02:01:47,770 --> 02:01:55,790
database of the test renderer if you

1943
02:01:50,210 --> 02:02:00,170
will um and please random in an occupied

1944
02:01:55,789 --> 02:02:01,609
scene test element type and so here I'm

1945
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:15,020
just gonna go ahead and set just the

1946
02:02:01,609 --> 02:02:18,439
type there and in here we're just gonna

1947
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:21,230
do that although actually so in this

1948
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:22,879
case we don't need to check for all of

1949
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:24,619
these anymore right we could just check

1950
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:27,409
for if it's a wall cuz that's the only

1951
02:02:24,619 --> 02:02:29,149
one we actually needed and then what we

1952
02:02:27,409 --> 02:02:31,309
can do is anytime that we're pushing one

1953
02:02:29,149 --> 02:02:33,889
of these when we look at like the type

1954
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:35,900
and look at what we're pushing we don't

1955
02:02:33,890 --> 02:02:38,810
need to change anything here right

1956
02:02:35,899 --> 02:02:40,519
because now this is encoded in the

1957
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:43,310
database itself so what we can actually

1958
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:46,100
do is say the element cube UV layout

1959
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:48,500
just gets passed directly there and now

1960
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:52,400
we don't have that sort of switch

1961
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:57,529
determination okay so here we would just

1962
02:02:52,399 --> 02:03:00,729
say default cube UV layout because we

1963
02:02:57,529 --> 02:03:03,109
don't care what it is for light and

1964
02:03:00,729 --> 02:03:08,509
there's probably one another place where

1965
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:10,789
that needs to happen as well yeah so

1966
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:11,840
here we wanted that although we actually

1967
02:03:10,789 --> 02:03:14,630
now know what that is

1968
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:16,579
so we Winx cube we want the cube UV

1969
02:03:14,630 --> 02:03:17,750
layout so we can actually just fix that

1970
02:03:16,579 --> 02:03:19,989
piece of code to actually do that now

1971
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:31,550
cuz we know we're going to want that

1972
02:03:19,989 --> 02:03:32,119
eventually and our energy piece and have

1973
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:34,310
that too

1974
02:03:32,119 --> 02:03:35,989
so basically that just cleans up that so

1975
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:39,920
that now everyone is always correctly

1976
02:03:35,989 --> 02:03:41,389
talking about QB view layouts right and

1977
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:43,020
so now if we look at the renderer test

1978
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:47,910
right

1979
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:49,020
now what we want to do is actually so

1980
02:03:47,909 --> 02:03:52,849
that's kind of interesting wonder why

1981
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:56,489
that did I set that wrong or something I

1982
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:59,360
probably did so anyway so now we that we

1983
02:03:56,488 --> 02:04:05,250
have each one of these able to be

1984
02:03:59,359 --> 02:04:07,969
encoded directly when we actually go to

1985
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:12,420
lay out the world what we can do is

1986
02:04:07,969 --> 02:04:18,500
sorry encode the layouts correctly for

1987
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:18,500
every piece now right oh right because

1988
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:33,750
there must be well oh right so this is

1989
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:36,829
why right we want to be able to set that

1990
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:39,359
wall UV to the wall to not the default

1991
02:04:36,829 --> 02:04:40,890
in the case where we're in the middle of

1992
02:04:39,359 --> 02:04:46,500
a wall run because that one doesn't get

1993
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:48,420
any of those pieces right all right so

1994
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:50,399
now we're back to the original behavior

1995
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:53,789
but it's all going through the data set

1996
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:56,099
rather than you know anything else so

1997
02:04:53,789 --> 02:04:58,109
let's go ahead and fix the problem you

1998
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:59,640
were talking about I believe the problem

1999
02:04:58,109 --> 02:05:02,488
timeout is that one right there for

2000
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:06,119
example right and so what we want to do

2001
02:05:02,488 --> 02:05:10,139
is set the correct things on each type

2002
02:05:06,119 --> 02:05:14,039
of the various cubes so for wise you'll

2003
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:16,920
notice these don't ever get that we do

2004
02:05:14,039 --> 02:05:19,590
need them to set I'll show you why in a

2005
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,980
second but let's just focus on these for

2006
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:22,469
now

2007
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:26,729
so what we want to do here is maybe

2008
02:05:22,469 --> 02:05:29,340
change a little bit the way that we're

2009
02:05:26,729 --> 02:05:31,709
doing this so what I want to do here is

2010
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:33,630
say look here's the wall UV and instead

2011
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:36,659
of considering there to be a wall start

2012
02:05:33,630 --> 02:05:39,029
and a wall and UV instead what I'd like

2013
02:05:36,659 --> 02:05:43,260
to do is actually just talk about the

2014
02:05:39,029 --> 02:05:46,550
encoding here directly right so what I'd

2015
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:49,500
like to do is say we're gonna include

2016
02:05:46,550 --> 02:05:51,989
into like the wall start or something

2017
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:54,719
right we're gonna encode the entire

2018
02:05:51,988 --> 02:05:55,359
thing here and the same thing is going

2019
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,520
to happen

2020
02:05:55,359 --> 02:06:00,279
here right and the reason I'm doing that

2021
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:03,940
is because they're going to now be

2022
02:06:00,279 --> 02:06:06,149
different right they're laid out this

2023
02:06:03,939 --> 02:06:06,149
way

2024
02:06:06,179 --> 02:06:11,050
okay we're we're instead of always

2025
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:12,880
setting it to the same thing no matter

2026
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:15,340
who you were they're actually going to

2027
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:19,118
be different now and so I want to encode

2028
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:21,520
for every piece an actual unique set of

2029
02:06:19,118 --> 02:06:24,069
values so that I can do that more

2030
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:26,980
explicitly now I don't know that we

2031
02:06:24,069 --> 02:06:30,189
actually want different rotations here

2032
02:06:26,979 --> 02:06:32,519
I'm gonna leave them as one for now

2033
02:06:30,189 --> 02:06:35,289
because it was kind of a little bit fun

2034
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:36,340
so maybe we're gonna do that but you

2035
02:06:35,289 --> 02:06:39,550
know let's talk about that a little bit

2036
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:42,940
later alright so let's take the min x

2037
02:06:39,550 --> 02:06:44,619
case so the min X case has two cases

2038
02:06:42,939 --> 02:06:46,599
there's the one at the top and the one

2039
02:06:44,618 --> 02:06:49,509
at the bottom on the far sides it's the

2040
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:52,960
left side of a wall the topmost or the

2041
02:06:49,510 --> 02:06:55,179
bottom most one so why goes that

2042
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:56,710
direction generally in our system so

2043
02:06:55,179 --> 02:06:59,139
that means the min Y is the one that's

2044
02:06:56,710 --> 02:07:01,270
closest to us so if we think about what

2045
02:06:59,139 --> 02:07:03,010
sides need to be on there will the side

2046
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:05,080
facing that way it doesn't matter and

2047
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:07,300
the side facing that way it actually

2048
02:07:05,079 --> 02:07:09,279
doesn't matter so it's only these two

2049
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:11,560
right here that we care about the one

2050
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:13,689
that's that way if we think about what

2051
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:15,460
it needs to be on there that needs to be

2052
02:07:13,689 --> 02:07:17,710
the three that needs to be the one

2053
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:20,050
that's gonna like start or run going

2054
02:07:17,710 --> 02:07:21,670
this way and the one that's facing us

2055
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:23,739
needs to be a one because it's gonna be

2056
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:25,719
the one that's facing that way and so

2057
02:07:23,738 --> 02:07:29,138
that's how we would encode that one

2058
02:07:25,719 --> 02:07:31,750
right and so let's look at if that did

2059
02:07:29,139 --> 02:07:34,510
the right thing in the renderer test now

2060
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:36,069
so let me run the renderer test and you

2061
02:07:34,510 --> 02:07:39,820
can see it's kind of coming up on this

2062
02:07:36,069 --> 02:07:42,069
wall here again we didn't change the

2063
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:43,750
encoding of that but here we did change

2064
02:07:42,069 --> 02:07:45,189
so that's poisoning the still point of

2065
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:47,859
entry so we didn't screw it up we want

2066
02:07:45,189 --> 02:07:49,329
to see this side right here and you can

2067
02:07:47,859 --> 02:07:51,729
see now that that's facing the right way

2068
02:07:49,329 --> 02:07:53,649
but that one still isn't right because

2069
02:07:51,729 --> 02:07:56,649
we haven't touched that one so we now

2070
02:07:53,649 --> 02:08:01,269
are our lower left corner wall is now

2071
02:07:56,649 --> 02:08:03,789
correct if you will but our lower right

2072
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:05,199
corner wall isn't and that's really the

2073
02:08:03,789 --> 02:08:07,840
one we want to work on what the heck

2074
02:08:05,198 --> 02:08:10,618
happened there I didn't even know you

2075
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:10,619
could do that

2076
02:08:11,069 --> 02:08:23,340
okay well um yeah that seems wrong are

2077
02:08:18,699 --> 02:08:23,340
we missing our top Oh looks like we are

2078
02:08:27,649 --> 02:08:36,948
how did we that's how sorry I

2079
02:08:34,219 --> 02:08:41,420
accidentally deleted that these both

2080
02:08:36,948 --> 02:08:43,099
need to be set to wall okay so anyway

2081
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:47,179
let's go back to our lower right so this

2082
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:49,010
is our lower right case and so again if

2083
02:08:47,179 --> 02:08:50,630
you think about it two of these don't

2084
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:52,610
matter so the one facing that way is

2085
02:08:50,630 --> 02:08:54,199
like interior we can't see it so it

2086
02:08:52,609 --> 02:08:56,689
doesn't matter what it is and the one

2087
02:08:54,198 --> 02:08:59,238
facing up we can't see either so those

2088
02:08:56,689 --> 02:09:05,509
two are just irrelevant and so that's

2089
02:08:59,238 --> 02:09:07,579
this one here right and this one here we

2090
02:09:05,510 --> 02:09:10,610
don't care about so it's this one and

2091
02:09:07,579 --> 02:09:13,908
this one are the actual ones we care

2092
02:09:10,609 --> 02:09:15,829
about so this one here is the one facing

2093
02:09:13,908 --> 02:09:18,408
out that way that's going to need to

2094
02:09:15,829 --> 02:09:19,908
start the run so that's a 1 the other

2095
02:09:18,408 --> 02:09:23,649
one is a 3 because it's starting a run

2096
02:09:19,908 --> 02:09:27,009
going back the other direction right now

2097
02:09:23,649 --> 02:09:30,439
in neither case if we looked at the max

2098
02:09:27,010 --> 02:09:38,690
Y run so we only did those those first

2099
02:09:30,439 --> 02:09:41,649
ones there excuse me but this side

2100
02:09:38,689 --> 02:09:41,649
should now be correct

2101
02:09:48,050 --> 02:09:53,980
and it is so you can see it there right

2102
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:58,850
alright so we've done those two corners

2103
02:09:53,979 --> 02:10:02,089
now let's talk about the far corners

2104
02:09:58,850 --> 02:10:05,750
perhaps which are the ones that are on

2105
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:10,159
max Y so the maximum wine maximum X

2106
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:12,319
right if we again go around the horn so

2107
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:15,199
the one facing this way is an end tile

2108
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:19,609
that's actually correct the one facing

2109
02:10:15,199 --> 02:10:21,500
up should be a start tile I believe so I

2110
02:10:19,609 --> 02:10:30,949
think this one should actually be a one

2111
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:33,770
these two are interior right yeah so the

2112
02:10:30,949 --> 02:10:35,569
min X is the one on this side again the

2113
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:37,250
one facing up so if we were looking at

2114
02:10:35,569 --> 02:10:40,789
this way it's actually an end so that's

2115
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:44,329
this I'm sorry that's not facing up

2116
02:10:40,789 --> 02:10:45,680
that's facing up so the one facing this

2117
02:10:44,329 --> 02:10:48,109
way we don't care about we can't see it

2118
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:51,260
the one facing up is the end the one

2119
02:10:48,109 --> 02:10:53,059
facing to the outside is a start and so

2120
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:55,190
it should look like this so I believe

2121
02:10:53,060 --> 02:11:02,510
that's everything that we needed to get

2122
02:10:55,189 --> 02:11:04,399
there right and so now I think if we

2123
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:09,739
just were to look all of our exterior

2124
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:11,210
walls would be correct I don't think we

2125
02:11:09,739 --> 02:11:14,659
would have any any more that are wrong

2126
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:16,399
and that's why I did that cube UV

2127
02:11:14,659 --> 02:11:18,409
encoding the way I did it right is I

2128
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:21,469
knew that we had to do this at some

2129
02:11:18,409 --> 02:11:23,149
point and so I made it so that you could

2130
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:27,400
explicitly encode which panel you were

2131
02:11:23,149 --> 02:11:27,399
picking for every single side right

2132
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:41,179
and so now like we just really shouldn't

2133
02:11:36,899 --> 02:11:44,179
see any where it's where it's bogus

2134
02:11:41,179 --> 02:11:44,179
hopefully

2135
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:54,529
that looks right

2136
02:11:57,719 --> 02:12:00,630
and so now the only question would be

2137
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:02,370
like you know what do we want to do with

2138
02:12:00,630 --> 02:12:04,859
interior walls right like what do we

2139
02:12:02,369 --> 02:12:07,079
want to do because you'll notice we

2140
02:12:04,859 --> 02:12:11,789
haven't set any of the interior wall

2141
02:12:07,079 --> 02:12:14,100
pieces to anything at all right like the

2142
02:12:11,789 --> 02:12:19,229
interior wall pieces are are basically

2143
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:21,150
just always blank and so if we wanted to

2144
02:12:19,229 --> 02:12:24,269
have those interior wall pieces also

2145
02:12:21,149 --> 02:12:28,948
have the correct beaming structure to

2146
02:12:24,270 --> 02:12:30,270
them we could do it right let's tick

2147
02:12:28,948 --> 02:12:31,559
when this piece rotates interview by the

2148
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:37,010
way to make sure we've got all of our

2149
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:39,630
themes correct yeah looking good

2150
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:44,400
so those interiors you can see those are

2151
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:48,719
all white with no beams and maybe you

2152
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:50,579
know you want beams in there and so

2153
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:53,219
let's suppose we've wanted to have the

2154
02:12:50,579 --> 02:12:55,019
beams in there what we need to do to

2155
02:12:53,219 --> 02:12:58,980
check for that is we need to look at min

2156
02:12:55,020 --> 02:13:00,840
X like minus 1 and max X like minus 1

2157
02:12:58,979 --> 02:13:07,379
kind of situations right we need to look

2158
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:11,699
at like one inset so here what we would

2159
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:13,710
need to do is repeat this case again

2160
02:13:11,698 --> 02:13:16,319
right there's just a lot of special

2161
02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:21,659
cases but that's just the way it is so

2162
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:25,920
if we were one out or one in then what

2163
02:13:21,659 --> 02:13:27,929
we know is that certain ones now are

2164
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:31,109
going to be visible so let's say we're

2165
02:13:27,929 --> 02:13:35,520
one in from the end then we now know

2166
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:39,559
that while most of the time everything

2167
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:39,560
is just a blank wall right

2168
02:13:43,229 --> 02:13:48,519
so most of the time we're just gonna set

2169
02:13:45,880 --> 02:14:00,670
- oops that's not blank well that's a

2170
02:13:48,520 --> 02:14:03,760
blank wall um so on this each one of

2171
02:14:00,670 --> 02:14:08,289
these will only have one visible strut

2172
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:10,360
and it's only an only one so the rest of

2173
02:14:08,289 --> 02:14:15,189
them should be they should be blank so

2174
02:14:10,359 --> 02:14:17,649
if we look at one in from the left

2175
02:14:15,189 --> 02:14:20,710
so min X plus one is one in from the

2176
02:14:17,649 --> 02:14:24,069
left then we know that the only thing we

2177
02:14:20,710 --> 02:14:27,039
want is the the southward face right

2178
02:14:24,069 --> 02:14:28,229
should start a run so it should be one

2179
02:14:27,039 --> 02:14:32,380
of those

2180
02:14:28,229 --> 02:14:34,089
similarly if we're on the oh sorry no

2181
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:37,750
that's backwards that's on the max why

2182
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:41,050
that's the farthest one on the closest

2183
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:44,260
one the one in it's only going to be the

2184
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:46,750
northward face and that northward face

2185
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:50,100
if we switch around is going to end the

2186
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:53,380
run right it's gonna look like that now

2187
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:56,410
if we're on the max shrunk in so we're

2188
02:14:53,380 --> 02:14:58,569
on the this end if we're on the earliest

2189
02:14:56,409 --> 02:14:59,920
then it's the Northridge face and if you

2190
02:14:58,569 --> 02:15:03,340
think about it that's gonna start the

2191
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:06,069
run and so parallel wise if we look at

2192
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:08,050
the farthest went out we're gonna want

2193
02:15:06,069 --> 02:15:11,259
the South face and that should end the

2194
02:15:08,050 --> 02:15:13,510
run right so that will make it so that

2195
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:16,180
now we have proper interior beaming on

2196
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:17,730
the left and right sides not the tops

2197
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:22,539
and bottoms because that's the other

2198
02:15:17,729 --> 02:15:25,839
path so if you look through here what

2199
02:15:22,539 --> 02:15:27,189
you can see is now if we get the top

2200
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:30,449
well we're not gonna be able to see the

2201
02:15:27,189 --> 02:15:32,619
top are we we need a free look mode here

2202
02:15:30,449 --> 02:15:34,179
we've got to get to a place where you

2203
02:15:32,619 --> 02:15:37,090
can actually see the tops of one of

2204
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:41,320
these hopefully we'll pan to one in a

2205
02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:44,319
second here but now we should have it so

2206
02:15:41,319 --> 02:15:47,109
that that that there's a strut there

2207
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:48,849
okay and the fact there isn't a strut

2208
02:15:47,109 --> 02:15:55,239
there would suggest that I'm totally

2209
02:15:48,850 --> 02:15:57,890
wrong about that not great

2210
02:15:55,239 --> 02:15:59,029
I'm gonna need if we keep down this path

2211
02:15:57,890 --> 02:16:12,579
I'm gonna need a way to do that a little

2212
02:15:59,029 --> 02:16:15,590
bit better so on the max why that's

2213
02:16:12,579 --> 02:16:17,989
right we're facing northward facing left

2214
02:16:15,590 --> 02:16:20,529
we're facing down facing that should

2215
02:16:17,989 --> 02:16:20,529
have done it

2216
02:16:20,829 --> 02:16:26,239
aha

2217
02:16:23,770 --> 02:16:36,319
sorry about that missing an else clause

2218
02:16:26,239 --> 02:16:38,300
there although I don't think that would

2219
02:16:36,319 --> 02:16:46,459
have done it it would cause this to

2220
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:50,019
clear in some cases but not the one that

2221
02:16:46,459 --> 02:16:50,019
I cared about I don't think

2222
02:16:57,218 --> 02:17:05,078
Oh God alright so maybe that was the

2223
02:17:03,099 --> 02:17:12,328
problem we didn't even get a thing

2224
02:17:05,078 --> 02:17:16,658
compiled did we right there we go um

2225
02:17:12,328 --> 02:17:18,549
let's take a look one more time that

2226
02:17:16,658 --> 02:17:19,929
missing else should have created more

2227
02:17:18,549 --> 02:17:21,458
bugs I was wondering why it didn't and

2228
02:17:19,929 --> 02:17:23,679
the fact I guess we just didn't compile

2229
02:17:21,459 --> 02:17:27,880
would have been why I wasn't paying very

2230
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:29,349
close attention there yeah okay so now

2231
02:17:27,879 --> 02:17:32,170
there are the beams I can actually see

2232
02:17:29,349 --> 02:17:34,359
them in the from the right there so I

2233
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:38,289
think both beams are correct on that

2234
02:17:34,359 --> 02:17:41,170
part of the interior now and so now we

2235
02:17:38,289 --> 02:17:51,099
just need one more which is the vertical

2236
02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:52,209
beams right so that that looks right so

2237
02:17:51,099 --> 02:17:54,279
now we just need one more which is the

2238
02:17:52,209 --> 02:17:55,599
vertical beams also I really don't know

2239
02:17:54,279 --> 02:17:58,539
what we want to do about the roof

2240
02:17:55,599 --> 02:18:00,248
thatching like the the tops I'll leave

2241
02:17:58,539 --> 02:18:02,139
those as zeroes for now cuz I don't know

2242
02:18:00,248 --> 02:18:11,738
what else we would do there necessarily

2243
02:18:02,138 --> 02:18:14,198
but yeah they is what they is so all I'm

2244
02:18:11,738 --> 02:18:17,978
gonna do here is just special case

2245
02:18:14,199 --> 02:18:20,229
this one part here and so all we need to

2246
02:18:17,978 --> 02:18:22,840
do is the same thing we were I don't

2247
02:18:20,228 --> 02:18:34,988
know why Fargo to do that so all we need

2248
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:37,988
to do is I special case the Y's and do

2249
02:18:34,988 --> 02:18:40,510
them in the exact same way as I did the

2250
02:18:37,988 --> 02:18:44,859
X's so assume that they're just a normal

2251
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:48,340
wall like they were before and then all

2252
02:18:44,859 --> 02:18:55,029
I'm going to do is say well okay so for

2253
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:59,289
the case for the case where the Y is one

2254
02:18:55,029 --> 02:19:02,039
in from the min right which would be the

2255
02:18:59,289 --> 02:19:08,489
first in there or one back from the max

2256
02:19:02,039 --> 02:19:08,489
I'm doing a run of X's here

2257
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:16,620
right from min to max so if

2258
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:30,950
vx

2259
02:19:38,149 --> 02:19:43,190
wait wait a second

2260
02:20:05,318 --> 02:20:21,648
what did I do here I'm I'm a little bit

2261
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:26,109
confused so I do a loop on the X's and I

2262
02:20:21,648 --> 02:20:26,108
place the X's

2263
02:20:46,510 --> 02:20:53,949
oh okay sir I guess I've been

2264
02:20:52,359 --> 02:20:56,470
programming a little too long today

2265
02:20:53,949 --> 02:20:58,328
I forgot my cut and pasted this code

2266
02:20:56,469 --> 02:21:00,670
from the thing about I'm like what am i

2267
02:20:58,328 --> 02:21:02,170
doing that shouldn't work of course it

2268
02:21:00,670 --> 02:21:03,879
shouldn't I just cut and pasted it and I

2269
02:21:02,170 --> 02:21:05,170
have to update it this is the code I

2270
02:21:03,879 --> 02:21:06,879
should have been looking at and it works

2271
02:21:05,170 --> 02:21:09,578
just fine it uses min and Max I'm like

2272
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:11,589
it should be Y with min and Max X well

2273
02:21:09,578 --> 02:21:15,728
parenthesis it was if you actually

2274
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:16,648
looked at the actual code never mind

2275
02:21:15,728 --> 02:21:20,108
that

2276
02:21:16,648 --> 02:21:27,488
all right so what we actually want to do

2277
02:21:20,109 --> 02:21:30,460
here is this we want to make sure that

2278
02:21:27,488 --> 02:21:32,879
this stuff is presented correctly so in

2279
02:21:30,459 --> 02:21:36,429
here we've got the min X and the Max X

2280
02:21:32,879 --> 02:21:38,259
the min X and the max X and so we just

2281
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:40,779
want to do the exact same thing here

2282
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:45,158
that we were doing before where we just

2283
02:21:40,779 --> 02:21:47,680
say look let's make sure that we put the

2284
02:21:45,158 --> 02:21:49,538
right beam on the right side so in this

2285
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:51,520
case we've got the minimum Y which is

2286
02:21:49,539 --> 02:21:53,829
close to us one up so we're talking

2287
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:58,119
about the two like bottom left bottom

2288
02:21:53,828 --> 02:22:00,398
right interior pieces right the min x is

2289
02:21:58,119 --> 02:22:02,828
the one on the left so that one is going

2290
02:22:00,398 --> 02:22:03,309
to have its first one right here be a

2291
02:22:02,828 --> 02:22:06,879
start

2292
02:22:03,309 --> 02:22:09,219
beam right and then we've got also on

2293
02:22:06,879 --> 02:22:12,068
the other side so the bottom right on

2294
02:22:09,219 --> 02:22:13,978
the interior right don't care about

2295
02:22:12,068 --> 02:22:16,299
anything up till the the one that's

2296
02:22:13,978 --> 02:22:18,908
inside facing so the one that's facing

2297
02:22:16,299 --> 02:22:22,389
into the interior the building that's

2298
02:22:18,908 --> 02:22:25,420
gonna be the end of a run right and so

2299
02:22:22,389 --> 02:22:28,209
then here we also have the exact same

2300
02:22:25,420 --> 02:22:30,520
thing happening where maximum Y is the

2301
02:22:28,209 --> 02:22:33,009
top right one in so the interiors there

2302
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:36,850
so the minimum X is this one that's that

2303
02:22:33,010 --> 02:22:38,469
first one that's that's facing in that's

2304
02:22:36,850 --> 02:22:39,520
gonna be the end of a run there and then

2305
02:22:38,469 --> 02:22:40,478
similar we're gonna have the exact same

2306
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:43,238
thing I'm in here the other one that's

2307
02:22:40,478 --> 02:22:44,769
gonna be an end of a run on the other

2308
02:22:43,238 --> 02:22:46,840
side I'm sorry beginning of a run on the

2309
02:22:44,770 --> 02:22:50,819
other side so I think that should be the

2310
02:22:46,840 --> 02:22:50,818
complete set I believe

2311
02:22:51,090 --> 02:22:55,021
[Music]

2312
02:22:52,771 --> 02:22:57,550
also have to make sure you close your

2313
02:22:55,021 --> 02:23:00,250
brackets or braces I should say if you

2314
02:22:57,549 --> 02:23:02,909
actually want your code to compile and I

2315
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:02,909
think that should be it

2316
02:23:05,771 --> 02:23:10,239
and by the way that's code we can we

2317
02:23:08,260 --> 02:23:11,890
needed to do that because we actually

2318
02:23:10,239 --> 02:23:15,789
need to do that exact same code in the

2319
02:23:11,890 --> 02:23:18,719
actual game as well so it's not wasted

2320
02:23:15,790 --> 02:23:21,010
work we'll just duplicate that logic

2321
02:23:18,719 --> 02:23:22,449
when it comes time to do that inside

2322
02:23:21,010 --> 02:23:25,030
handmade hero because we want to be able

2323
02:23:22,450 --> 02:23:29,820
to do those interior runs properly as

2324
02:23:25,030 --> 02:23:29,820
well that make sense

2325
02:23:30,060 --> 02:23:39,159
looks like that one on the interior was

2326
02:23:33,729 --> 02:23:43,899
wrong looks like I had those backwards

2327
02:23:39,159 --> 02:23:45,760
on the why the oh you know why because

2328
02:23:43,899 --> 02:23:48,039
you can't have something that's only one

2329
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:49,810
long because you can't put both struts

2330
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:51,340
in so I don't so it's not wrong it's

2331
02:23:49,810 --> 02:23:52,959
right it's just that one was too close

2332
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:59,860
together but you can see it now right

2333
02:23:52,959 --> 02:24:01,509
it's all kind of built together when we

2334
02:23:59,860 --> 02:24:06,069
use the new for a coder update um as

2335
02:24:01,510 --> 02:24:09,010
soon as the picker thing is working it's

2336
02:24:06,069 --> 02:24:19,959
too slow right now but it's when it is

2337
02:24:09,010 --> 02:24:22,420
fast I will be updating all right I

2338
02:24:19,959 --> 02:24:24,899
think that's it for today we've done

2339
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:24,899
quite a bit

2340
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:41,620
but that all looks right you know like

2341
02:24:38,510 --> 02:24:41,620
the beams look good there right

2342
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:58,760
alright I'm gonna close it down

2343
02:25:03,809 --> 02:25:07,359
all right thank you for for joining me

2344
02:25:05,949 --> 02:25:09,430
for their episode of handmade hero sort

2345
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:10,659
of pleasure coding with you as always if

2346
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:11,859
you would like to follow along series

2347
02:25:10,659 --> 02:25:13,420
you can always peer to the game on

2348
02:25:11,859 --> 02:25:15,790
handmade hero org and it comes with a

2349
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:18,549
source code so you can follow along at

2350
02:25:15,790 --> 02:25:20,920
home we will be back tomorrow when I'm

2351
02:25:18,549 --> 02:25:21,938
going to start putting that same stuff

2352
02:25:20,920 --> 02:25:23,889
that we were doing in the render test

2353
02:25:21,939 --> 02:25:24,790
we'll just put that into the game proper

2354
02:25:23,889 --> 02:25:25,898
which I think will be really nice

2355
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:29,770
because then we can start to define

2356
02:25:25,898 --> 02:25:32,170
areas of the game better and start to

2357
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:33,250
kind of bring them more into like a to

2358
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:35,529
give a little more of feeling of

2359
02:25:33,250 --> 02:25:38,079
exploration and sort of feeling of the

2360
02:25:35,529 --> 02:25:41,199
actual gamey environment which is always

2361
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:43,779
kind of nice so that'll be fun see you

2362
02:25:41,199 --> 02:25:45,189
back here same time same place until

2363
02:25:43,779 --> 02:25:46,238
then have fun programming and I'll see

2364
02:25:45,189 --> 02:25:48,420
everyone the Internet take it easy

2365
02:25:46,238 --> 02:25:48,420
everybody
