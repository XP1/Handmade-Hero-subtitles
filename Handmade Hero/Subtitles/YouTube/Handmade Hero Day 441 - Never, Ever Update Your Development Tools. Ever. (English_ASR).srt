1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
everyone and welcome to handmade hero

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:09,089
show recode a complete game live on

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:10,619
stream I am going to start today by just

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,879
mentioning something very briefly

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,638
because I get asked this a lot of

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,250
handmade hero and I thought that I would

7
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:20,879
just kind of give this specific example

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,230
so people understand why I take the

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,278
position I normally do on a lot of

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,949
things so if you remember a while back

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:30,929
on handmade hero while we were trying in

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,120
the middle of trying to work Visual

13
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:37,049
Studio popped up a dialog box asking us

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,390
if we want to fill out a survey and so

15
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:41,519
we did fill out a survey and we

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,989
mentioned a bunch of things I was like

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,910
here are all the things that are

18
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:47,280
problematic with Visual Studio and you

19
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,479
know there's a big long list of them for

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,090
the way that we use it which is just as

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,919
a debugger so we didn't have any

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,170
feedback about like project editing or

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,789
any of those or text editor because we

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,320
don't use like that but we use it to

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,270
step through in the debugger because

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,600
it's the most efficient debugger right

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,329
now on Windows so that's what we use and

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,090
so we filled out that survey now oddly

29
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:12,569
enough and this was somewhat shocking to

30
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,540
me because and I suppose but to be

31
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:20,339
honest bowed slightly well at least for

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:24,240
Microsoft they actually called me and

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,000
wanted to talk about it so that's a good

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,129
thing it's the first time they've ever

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,129
listened to anything to the best of my

36
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:34,920
knowledge from somebody who was trying

37
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:38,250
to give them feedback so I guess that's

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,478
a plus I but one of the things that

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,578
happened is they were like could you

40
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:45,090
update to the latest version and I asked

41
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:46,798
like could because they were like you

42
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,990
know some of the things that you're

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,899
talking about we want to be able to help

44
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:54,000
with and they said that like they now

45
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,939
have in the latest version ability to

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,530
take a trace of the state of visual

47
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:59,968
studio so you can submit bug reports

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,978
more easily or things like that so it's

49
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:06,539
like okay so as you know my normal

50
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,699
policy is once I install a developer

51
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,679
tool I don't update it till the end of

52
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,969
the project and the reason that I've

53
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,719
said many times for doing this is

54
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,639
because usually it

55
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,460
so it goes very poorly usually the tool

56
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:21,759
gets worse when you update it oftentimes

57
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,620
the update breaks things and so on and

58
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,239
so what I thought I'd show you is this

59
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,000
is what happened when I went to go

60
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,300
install the latest version I clicked on

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,710
there update button and it couldn't

62
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:38,140
update itself right it's incredibly

63
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,480
simple program Visual Studio all it is

64
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:42,009
it's just an editor and you know it's

65
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,429
just a it's just an editor that's all it

66
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:48,189
is right you know it should be an

67
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,870
executable on a drive that's really all

68
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:51,310
it would have to have two or three

69
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:56,170
executables maybe one for the compiler

70
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,460
once the linker one for the IDE but of

71
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:58,959
course it's not because the way that

72
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,030
it's developed is is this huge sprawling

73
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,719
mass of millions of com components and

74
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,219
dll's and c-sharp and SQL server

75
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,389
I'm not joking there's actually an SQL

76
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,889
server that gets installed just around

77
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:13,509
Visual Studio and as a result even

78
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:15,879
something as simple as updating the

79
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:17,500
application is fraught with peril the

80
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,590
chance that an update will succeed on

81
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,639
Visual Studio is is almost zero most of

82
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,620
the time when I do it it doesn't work

83
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,289
and that was exactly case this time so

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,230
I've only tried to update at one time

85
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:30,669
and here's what happened right so what

86
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,449
did I have to do exactly what you

87
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,729
normally have to do in this circumstance

88
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,549
I had to get rid of the whole thing and

89
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:38,619
reinstall it again from scratch which

90
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:42,459
thankfully worked sometimes that doesn't

91
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,620
even work but it worked this time but

92
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,939
that was just a cautionary tale and sort

93
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,189
of more examples of what I'm talking

94
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,199
about nowadays it's just not safe to

95
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:52,269
upgrade your development tools it will

96
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,109
cost you actual work hours that you

97
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,900
could have been doing something

98
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,370
productive to update your tools and of

99
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,170
course as you will see when we start

100
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,659
using Visual Studio we don't get any

101
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,009
benefit in this case there's perhaps

102
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,479
some benefit to the developers of the

103
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,039
software because now we can report bugs

104
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,109
whether or not they fix them I don't

105
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,489
know so whether or not they'll ever be

106
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,600
any benefit to us is questionable but

107
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,469
there's certainly no immediate benefit

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,608
to us because they haven't upgraded

109
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,298
anything that we need so yeah word to

110
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:21,519
the wise

111
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:23,679
don't ever update your developer tools

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,030
if they're working leave them as they

113
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
are because the chances that you will

114
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:28,759
get anything improved is

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,599
very low and the chances that something

116
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,519
will break very high alright with that

117
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,160
public service announcement out of the

118
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,810
way I'm gonna go ahead and go pop over

119
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,070
here to something that was brought to my

120
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,259
attention on the pre stream but I wanted

121
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:44,149
to wait till the actual stream to take a

122
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:49,129
look at it because I think it's probably

123
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:50,269
something that we that everyone out

124
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:52,399
there will want to download if they're

125
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:55,849
on an nvidia card like we are at the

126
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:58,039
moment which is that i have been

127
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,629
previously using n sites plugin for

128
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,129
visual studio now I don't like the

129
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:03,290
insight plug-in for visual studio not

130
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,629
because I don't like n site I'd like

131
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,400
insight I just don't like the plug

132
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:10,339
individual studio I don't like using

133
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,169
Visual Studio I only use it because it's

134
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:15,099
the only debugger that I really have on

135
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,360
Windows that I found that's effective

136
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,910
but I would much rather have a

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,470
standalone application purpose-built and

138
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,020
more reliable hopefully than visual

139
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,150
studio to do graphs debugging an insight

140
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:28,399
if I remembered correctly and I could be

141
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:31,370
wrong with this used to be that way and

142
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,139
then they changed it to only having a

143
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,930
visual studio plug-in and I've never

144
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,430
cared for that but you know it was the

145
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,769
only way to use it so that's how I used

146
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,060
it but it was brought to my attention on

147
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:44,870
the pre steam that they have just

148
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:49,310
released a new standalone debugger for

149
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,500
NVIDIA cards and profiler and that to me

150
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,530
sounds absolutely fantastic that's

151
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,850
exactly what I would want I don't know

152
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:57,319
if it's any good because I haven't used

153
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,910
it yet but I'm assuming that it's

154
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,279
probably at least as good as the visual

155
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,200
studio plug-in hopefully and it

156
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,639
certainly looks better than the visual

157
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,250
studio plug-in I don't know if that's

158
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,479
any indication of the screenshots so I'm

159
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,160
pretty excited about being able to

160
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,170
replace that so I'm gonna go ahead and

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,730
download that as far as I know there are

162
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,560
no special criteria for you to have to

163
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,750
download it other than having to have an

164
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,310
Nvidia card I don't think there's

165
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,730
anything else you particular would have

166
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,339
to do so I'm just gonna go ahead and

167
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,259
give it a shot here at you can see it's

168
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:29,629
just developer job and video.com and

169
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:33,079
select graphics I hit the download now

170
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:37,159
button this downloads list on the side I

171
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:39,469
assume is all we really need I don't

172
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,939
know we may have to update our graphics

173
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,190
driver because it may

174
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:45,339
we work with the latest version of the

175
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:47,719
graphics drivers so that's probably fine

176
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:51,409
because I think that actually has been

177
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,210
getting updated anyway by itself I'm not

178
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,730
quite sure what's installed on this

179
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:58,370
machine at the moment in terms of auto

180
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,490
updating drivers but I feel like Windows

181
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:06,860
10 tends to install those I could be

182
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:08,420
wrong about that all right well I take

183
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,420
it back I thought it was something you

184
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,590
could just download apparently you can't

185
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:17,600
I do have one of these so I can grab it

186
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:20,419
by logging in on the machine where I've

187
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,930
got a password I don't remember one at

188
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:27,650
the moment so all right well here let me

189
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,449
see if I've got that here I don't

190
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,639
understand why they do that sort of

191
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:34,610
stuff it doesn't make a lot of sense to

192
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:39,680
me seems like you just want everyone

193
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:42,230
getting your program right I don't know

194
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,939
why I put up barriers like what what you

195
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,520
know they're obviously developing on an

196
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:48,889
nvidia card isn't that what you want

197
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,599
I don't know so let's see if I can log

198
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:52,729
in over here on this machine I think I

199
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,680
might have the password because I think

200
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,680
we had to do this for the original one

201
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,720
don't quote me on that but I'm gonna try

202
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:12,469
I seem to have a password written down

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:16,040
here let's see if I can log-in i well

204
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,810
it's not it's not having a problem with

205
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,550
my password but it is having a problem

206
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:25,250
with their login window which apparently

207
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:28,720
just doesn't work on Chrome oh it's

208
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,720
always an adventure isn't it folks

209
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,330
let's try Firefox

210
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:43,130
I am now trying to log in on Firefox

211
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:57,349
and I I cannot login on either of these

212
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,879
browsers and it's not it doesn't like

213
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:04,850
disallow my past or anything it's just

214
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:16,370
you just can't login I don't know what

215
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:19,970
to say is it just broken I don't get it

216
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:25,698
folks well I guess that's the end of

217
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:31,550
that for now I mean like it's not even

218
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:37,309
the dialog box won't even accept it it

219
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:39,318
just won't work well I wanted to try it

220
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:41,000
I couldn't try it I tried to login

221
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:42,409
I couldn't log in let me see what

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,129
happens on this one so if I'm on here

223
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:45,129
and I do login

224
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:57,840
so here's just me typing in ya see it

225
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:02,159
doesn't it doesn't do anything this

226
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,660
login window doesn't do anything so it

227
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,759
doesn't matter I guess it doesn't matter

228
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:10,259
what platform you're on you just can't

229
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:13,679
log in period so what's the deal what's

230
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:17,580
the deal folks hey NVIDIA do you know

231
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:21,620
how to programs website hey here we go

232
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,690
access is denied for this document

233
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:28,860
interesting it looks like someone forgot

234
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:32,850
to set their access control origin let's

235
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,340
take a look at what happened parser

236
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:42,210
blocking cross-site script is invoked by

237
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:44,399
a document right guys don't you know how

238
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:52,980
to do web programming what is wrong with

239
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:53,850
you dear Nvidia how do i refresh that

240
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,920
guy here we go

241
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,920
let's get that login window go in here I

242
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,610
also like you get to hear and it's like

243
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,959
all the stuff goes away where is there

244
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:09,120
okay there's ah so let's take a look at

245
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:14,879
who the offending person was here so

246
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,480
we've got assets dot Adobe TM Adobe DTM

247
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,490
com

248
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,440
so they maybe they must have made this

249
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:24,360
site in like one of those like crappy

250
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:28,710
--the site maker things there so where

251
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,769
is that guy let's see here's the so yeah

252
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,269
you can take a look at these here so

253
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:40,470
where were these scripts getting

254
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:44,870
accessed yes so you can even see here

255
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:47,550
these these these scripts don't have

256
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:54,379
they don't have access control origin

257
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:54,379
set right so you can't you can't yeah

258
00:11:55,198 --> 00:12:00,099
these these scripts are not you can't

259
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:02,139
cross sight these scripts if these

260
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,240
scripts were stored on invidious site

261
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:08,579
they would probably work okay right but

262
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,310
they're coming from Adobe DTM comm and

263
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:16,120
you can't execute things across site

264
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:19,599
like that unless you put the access

265
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,789
control origin header in the response

266
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,759
headers so I don't really know why they

267
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:27,219
ever thought that login would work on a

268
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,039
modern browser because you can't

269
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:37,240
cross-site script like that

270
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:41,318
I don't without installing a plug-in I'm

271
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:45,370
not sure of any way to let that to force

272
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:50,708
it to let me add the access control

273
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:54,240
origin header in there you can like you

274
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:59,679
can't install plug-ins for both Chrome

275
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:03,039
and Firefox to do access control allow

276
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,138
origin by default and then you don't get

277
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,568
because it's a browser side check right

278
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:12,568
so what happened what happens is when

279
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:16,778
the browser goes to execute a script or

280
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:18,519
access anything really it checks to see

281
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:19,990
whether that thing came from the same

282
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,698
domain or not and if it doesn't come

283
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,620
from the same domain it looks in the

284
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:26,139
headers to see whether it has an access

285
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,698
control origin header that says that

286
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:31,509
it's allowed to execute it and I assume

287
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:36,179
that's what's going on here although I'm

288
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,180
not 100% sure because

289
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,308
this part it seems fine this is just an

290
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,428
old certificate but it's not expired

291
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:51,738
it's not out of compliance yet I'm not

292
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:54,850
100% sure that I've seen this exact

293
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,850
error before

294
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:10,879
because that error this is just an

295
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,879
advisory and isn't that specific one

296
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:29,110
so this document here filled through the

297
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,460
local storage property for window axes

298
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:36,060
the nine for this document

299
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,060
where is handler dot J s actually from

300
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:45,129
you can see it in here so here's where

301
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:47,259
we're here's where it's at right so this

302
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:48,939
get window is returning the window from

303
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:50,110
the window handler right and then

304
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,890
they're trying to access this local

305
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:57,639
storage which in theory exists at this

306
00:14:53,889 --> 00:15:00,100
point so it's it's not telling us that

307
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,049
that's an illegal line of code right

308
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,590
what is telling us is that it's not

309
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:07,899
allowed to access it so basically this

310
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,629
handler dot J s which I don't know this

311
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:13,659
came from developer done the video calm

312
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:19,529
I'm not sure why it's not allowed to

313
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:25,990
read it actually because my cross-site

314
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:28,689
assumption here I guess I guess the

315
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:34,180
problem was that it came from CDN auth0

316
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:36,040
I guess because I looked at the Adobe

317
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:37,569
one I thought the Adobe one came up here

318
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,490
but I guess that was just me looking at

319
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,940
this one erroneously I jumped to

320
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,649
conclusions

321
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,050
I looked up at this one but actually

322
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:47,350
this is not this is not the problem

323
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:50,169
right so it looks like this is actually

324
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,620
the problem and it isn't involved Adobe

325
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:57,909
one but they are they've moved this off

326
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,820
0 Minjae s that's on a CDN Deezy off

327
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:01,719
iframe dot J's is not on the CDN so

328
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,390
those are coming from two different

329
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,009
top-level domains I don't know whether

330
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:08,679
or not that specifically what it's

331
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:16,569
complaining about because it's not

332
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:19,539
saying exactly why it simply says that

333
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:23,730
the access is denied so it could be

334
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:30,599
because of that or maybe it's not but

335
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:30,600
let's take a look at the headers there

336
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,970
so again none of none of these have

337
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:46,480
there's there's a lot of weird stuff

338
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:49,419
going on here in fact this is this is

339
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,909
this is kind of this is kind of borked

340
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:53,199
in a lot of ways so I don't really want

341
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:54,819
to go down the rat hole of web program

342
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,350
you know we already kind of have so this

343
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,510
is kind of worked as well because as you

344
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,300
can kind of see here this is not an

345
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:07,119
e-tag resource but it's it's age is very

346
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:09,819
high right so this resource for example

347
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,588
if it got updated the CDN would still

348
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,329
possibly push a really old version or

349
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:14,829
the browser could cache it because as

350
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,449
you can see the cache control is

351
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,549
allowing it to keep it for quite some

352
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,380
time but this is not a tagged file name

353
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:23,588
so typically like what you would do in

354
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,480
this scenario right is if you have

355
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:27,609
something like a script that's being

356
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,059
pushed to a CDN and it's allowed to be

357
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:32,619
cached on this on the client side

358
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:36,399
typically what you do is you set the max

359
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:39,519
age to something very high but then you

360
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,740
tag the name so that if you ever need to

361
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:45,309
change this javascript you update the

362
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:49,569
name to a different name right and off

363
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:51,669
zero Minjae s maybe that's tagged like

364
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:56,710
maybe the zero is the tag but don't look

365
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:58,269
tagged right so I don't know about that

366
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,500
this this looks pretty questionable so I

367
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,389
don't even know if we've got the latest

368
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,529
version of this it could be that one

369
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,060
problem we're having is that we're

370
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:07,180
getting served an old version of

371
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:11,470
something out of the CDN for example

372
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:14,440
right but it's hard to say so so I'm not

373
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,150
really sure about that exactly I'm not

374
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,640
sure what the problem is if this is the

375
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,160
latest one and there's just a you know

376
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,230
mistake there or what's going on but

377
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,180
anyway so it's a bit it's a bit wonky

378
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,009
even to begin with but it also doesn't

379
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,850
have the access control origin header

380
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:32,400
set on it which means that none of these

381
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:35,740
you know none of these things here are

382
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,170
going to allow cross-site scripting of

383
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,609
any kind so I'm not sure how that would

384
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,700
even be meant to work in the first place

385
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:44,699
necessarily it's hard to say

386
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:53,120
where is this other guy DZ off I frame

387
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,320
and keep in mind I'm not a web

388
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:05,700
programmer so take everything I'm saying

389
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:11,668
with a grain of salt here here we go so

390
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:14,788
DZ off iframe yeah also doesn't have it

391
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:16,860
also doesn't have the cross origin

392
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:18,658
headers and it's an in an iframe which

393
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,819
means it needs another header as well

394
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:23,100
the iframe also needs a spot a special

395
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:30,558
thing to tell to tell it that it allows

396
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:30,558
cross site hmm so this is this is rough

397
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:37,829
so I think our best bet since I don't

398
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,600
think we're going to be able to edit the

399
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:42,388
source code here because the source code

400
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,308
isn't the problem it's the access

401
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,959
control that's the problem which means

402
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,178
that in order to get this to work we're

403
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,679
gonna have to inject some authorization

404
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,399
in here in order to click on the login

405
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,250
button and so what I need is I need a

406
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:58,349
way to allow the cross site scripting

407
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,528
you can see I mean it's definitely a

408
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:04,829
cross-site problem even if I fail to if

409
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:06,179
I fail to diagnose it 100% correctly we

410
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,349
at least know that it is a cross-site

411
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,309
problem because you can see that it's a

412
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:13,528
dom exception on access denied

413
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:15,269
right for the particular document so I

414
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:17,759
don't know any other way that that could

415
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:19,798
occur it's not saying that it can't find

416
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,629
that property it's not saying that

417
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,250
something's wrong with the code it's

418
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,440
literally just saying that you're trying

419
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,769
to access the property of a window

420
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,679
that's a that's not in the same access

421
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:33,599
ring as you are right and I don't know

422
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,519
any other way for that particular to

423
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,199
happen other than cross-site me but

424
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,120
there might be right it might be some

425
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,278
more if you were a web programmer you

426
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:47,479
might know some more subtle way that

427
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:54,319
that can happen so the question is

428
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,319
chrome allow cross-site script access

429
00:20:55,029 --> 00:21:04,059
so you know the question is can we just

430
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:08,899
use some simple way to turn it off right

431
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:11,000
and and see what happens so let's see

432
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:15,410
here so if we disable web security

433
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,960
it looks like oops we go

434
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:22,009
if we launch with this flag looks like

435
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,350
maybe it will do it so let's let's give

436
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:27,759
that a shot just to see if maybe there's

437
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:29,959
a way that we can make this work and

438
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:32,349
then I'll do it on the other machine and

439
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,610
actually login I don't know if that

440
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:37,480
switch actually works it's on stock

441
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:41,809
exchange so you know roll the dice but

442
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,279
if we go to Google Chrome here let's see

443
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:46,700
if we can find the startup there's

444
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:49,129
chrome Bugsy so in theory if I go ahead

445
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,500
and close this out here and we do

446
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,580
kromaggs see and we do a paste for

447
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,869
disable web security you know off we go

448
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:58,220
so stability and security will suffer

449
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:03,529
that's a good sign it looks like it

450
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:05,360
probably took our advice right and it's

451
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:07,220
doing that so now let's see whether or

452
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:07,789
not we can get to the login screen so

453
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm going to go ahead and

454
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:11,659
prophylactically open up the developer

455
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,340
tools here again that's f12 if you don't

456
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,220
know if you want to do this at home on

457
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:18,980
Chrome it's also in here in the more

458
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,650
tools area right this developer tools

459
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,680
thing here ctrl shift I I guess also I

460
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:27,769
hit f12 but I guess it's either/or so

461
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,529
now if I type some stuff in here and I

462
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:34,700
click login let's see if anything

463
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:36,410
happens nope still problematic so we

464
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,700
really just don't know what the access

465
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,330
denied for this document thing is

466
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:45,470
telling us here what's the issue if that

467
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:47,960
if it wasn't that if that doesn't turn

468
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:51,110
it off you know what is it so let's take

469
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,710
a look over here in in the sources tab

470
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:58,129
again and let's let's bring up that line

471
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,470
of code so you can see here that it's

472
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,880
it's presumably not getting the new to

473
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,440
the new cookie storage part of things

474
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,990
the other thing I mean I suppose we

475
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,210
could do is the is the this storage part

476
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,849
I mean can we just

477
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,470
can can we simplify this in some way I

478
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:15,689
don't know but let's take a look at

479
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:21,839
these values just you know as they go so

480
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:33,250
window handler is not defined hmm

481
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:35,549
so maybe this is just a regular bug do

482
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,549
you think

483
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:41,329
I don't think so this is I think that's

484
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,429
just the top level being grumpy with us

485
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:45,049
I think this probably I don't know

486
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:49,160
enough JavaScript to say I'm not a

487
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:51,589
JavaScript programmer at all right so I

488
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,690
have no idea but I'm assuming that

489
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:55,849
that's just the fact that for whatever

490
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,529
reason we're not like the exception

491
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:59,209
throughout of this or something here's a

492
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,970
question can we just get right in there

493
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:06,970
and break right if I'm in there can I

494
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:08,690
look at it oops didn't mean to do that

495
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:14,210
definitely didn't mean to do that

496
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:24,710
okay so if I break on that line but no

497
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:26,240
no no no luck there so I don't really

498
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,929
yeah I guess I don't really stand this

499
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,390
this probably takes more JavaScript

500
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:34,970
know-how than I've got to know what's

501
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,620
going on here here's the dis pointer

502
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,750
right which is the thing that's that's

503
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:41,239
active in here if I open it up we can

504
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,880
see what's on it right and it wants to

505
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,920
add these two it wants to add storage it

506
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,809
already added warned which is probably

507
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:55,759
why that one's there right here you can

508
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:58,160
see it here it is and it never was able

509
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,289
to do the storage line now I'm not sure

510
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,400
where window handler

511
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:07,190
I don't know this syntax this require

512
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:10,460
syntax right this looks like it's trying

513
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,410
to say include this thing or something

514
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,870
right but I don't I'm not familiar with

515
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,300
I've never used that in my very limited

516
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:17,779
amount of JavaScript programming time

517
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:21,859
right

518
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:24,740
so what required does in general I

519
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:30,558
couldn't tell you so we might want to

520
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:34,640
look up JavaScript require and see what

521
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,289
it actually does it looks like I mean as

522
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,900
far as I can tell it looks like it's

523
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,549
exactly what I thought it was which is a

524
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,210
way to include a module and it looks

525
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,529
like it's maybe no js' so in terms of

526
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:49,610
the answer of why this isn't working

527
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:50,658
no js' is a very good first first step

528
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,358
because

529
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:54,349
you know it's no js' that's pretty much

530
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:57,348
guaranteed to not be working

531
00:25:54,348 --> 00:26:00,378
particularly well so when we come in

532
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:02,868
here and we see that this thing

533
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:07,398
presumably should have done this require

534
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:10,128
I guess this didn't actually properly do

535
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:12,138
whatever no js' nonsense was actually

536
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:16,098
supposed to happen to get the window

537
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:18,199
handler executed now again since I'm not

538
00:26:16,098 --> 00:26:21,439
a JavaScript programmer I don't know why

539
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,200
so again since this is kind of turning

540
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:27,288
into can we actually hack around the log

541
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,700
in to Nvidia developer site and when I

542
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:30,558
say hack around I don't even mean hack

543
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,470
around like not log in I mean use our

544
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:38,839
legitimate log in with their buggy login

545
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:41,569
code I'm just gonna try coming back here

546
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:44,689
and seeing if I can set a breakpoint on

547
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:47,979
that particular piece of code in order

548
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,509
to and unfortunately it seems to have

549
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:55,788
gotten rid of that though where where

550
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:57,139
did that come from I was gonna see if I

551
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:59,239
Chi said a breakpoint and so we could

552
00:26:57,138 --> 00:27:02,689
just sort of step into it you know and

553
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:06,169
see what happened when we when we did

554
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:07,940
that but I don't actually know it might

555
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:10,538
be that until I do login it doesn't oops

556
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,538
not join

557
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:19,548
let's try login all right

558
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:24,618
so when we go to do our login here let's

559
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:27,200
see do we have some information so

560
00:27:24,618 --> 00:27:29,628
here's that DZ off Moodle iframe bit

561
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,019
right that this is the thing that's

562
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:36,288
getting loaded for the login and I'm

563
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:41,690
just going through here and looking to

564
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:44,569
see what actually gets loaded here so

565
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:47,720
here's that initial off zero Minjae s

566
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:49,638
bit it's a minified piece of JavaScript

567
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,608
right it's well it's been like kind of

568
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:55,398
compressed down to a certain degree

569
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:57,108
anyway let's see about that here's

570
00:27:55,398 --> 00:28:00,528
here's some of the other pieces there's

571
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:02,798
that DZ off iframe part what else we got

572
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:02,798
here

573
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:09,699
symmetric here's webpack so this is some

574
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,259
way of I get I don't even know what this

575
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,990
is but I guess this is this is the way

576
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:19,960
of serving stuff compressed it looks

577
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:23,829
like as a as a as like a bundle of eight

578
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,400
billion you know JavaScript files for I

579
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:29,529
don't don't even get me started on that

580
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:34,000
but you know all right

581
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:40,119
so yeah I don't remember where we were

582
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:47,308
in here there's that cross origin

583
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:47,308
authentication bit where were we on the

584
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,179
where were we I don't remember where we

585
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,480
were where I wanted to set that here it

586
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:56,980
is

587
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,079
so it's hand lured up so here's where

588
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,769
ideas for future reference it's the web

589
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:05,379
pack source helper storage handler j/s

590
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:07,150
and it looks like it even remembered my

591
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,820
breakpoint so that's kind of awesome

592
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,110
right now whether it actually did

593
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:19,418
anything on that breakpoint

594
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:22,269
I don't know so yeah because it should

595
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:24,549
have right but maybe it only executes

596
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:25,900
these once it gets to hear it but it I

597
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:27,220
mean correct me if I'm wrong but it

598
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,769
should have already executed that it

599
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:36,548
doesn't look like it did which is a bit

600
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:38,519
confusing so you can see like it never

601
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:41,168
actually executed this line of code

602
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:42,970
according to the breakpoint but in order

603
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:45,970
for this code to work it would have had

604
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:50,288
to write and so I'm a little confused as

605
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:53,230
to when this nominally got executed

606
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:55,379
because all global variables should have

607
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,960
been executed right before they are used

608
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,760
at very least so I'm not super certain I

609
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,890
understand why that breakpoint never hit

610
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:04,599
I mean maybe that's just a bug in the

611
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,759
debugger and it really did get called

612
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:09,788
but of course if that never got called

613
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:16,048
that would be a pretty good reason to

614
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:16,048
say the least as to why you would not

615
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,099
have it defined when it gets here

616
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,110
because we're pretty sure at this point

617
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:25,500
that it wasn't right

618
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:28,689
it's supposed to have a window handler

619
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,970
thing in here and it definitely doesn't

620
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:35,529
right so let's go ahead and do this one

621
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:44,680
more time and you can see that we do

622
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:48,089
break here just fine right but Wow

623
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:51,460
so there text inputs pretty broken there

624
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:53,980
so yeah if we take a look at this here I

625
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,870
don't know that's just the VM that's not

626
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:59,170
a meaningful location that's just saying

627
00:30:55,869 --> 00:31:00,969
here I think so

628
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,220
if we look at where we were evaluating

629
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,808
this it is trying to evaluate it right

630
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,630
here so I'm pretty certain that this

631
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:09,399
never got initialized right but what I

632
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,890
don't know is why it never got

633
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,120
initialized because again that looks

634
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:22,870
like it should have been the case now

635
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:25,178
let's find out if if well here's okay so

636
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:27,899
here's an interesting question what

637
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:27,900
about these other ones

638
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:40,800
the text input is horribly broken

639
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:47,519
I'm only typing w once but it puts it

640
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:48,960
there twice oh the web world so what's

641
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,240
interesting is like for example this

642
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,470
this doesn't new on this this is just

643
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,740
like reverse engineering how this

644
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:57,029
program programming language works right

645
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,920
so what's interesting is they do a new

646
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,379
on this one so this require here didn't

647
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,360
create one of these right in a sense

648
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,260
because they still had to make one of

649
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:09,809
them so this window handler I'm

650
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:11,819
wondering if there was a reason like if

651
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:13,889
if that actually means that in order to

652
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:17,119
get a window handler does that mean you

653
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,120
actually had to do this

654
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:48,759
so that's pretty interesting to me man I

655
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,579
don't know what they did you can't even

656
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:54,399
type in this thing it's so broken so let

657
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:58,689
me do this Warren here I'm going to do

658
00:32:54,398 --> 00:33:00,548
the same line as was above so this is

659
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:05,288
even more fascinating so at this

660
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:07,269
location I cannot do Warren even though

661
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:10,028
they did Warren that way and they

662
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:12,429
clearly it worked so it must be that the

663
00:33:10,028 --> 00:33:14,138
top level can't access those things

664
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:16,659
properly or something because you can

665
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:18,308
see that this worked just fine or at

666
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:22,700
least it seems to have worked just fine

667
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:25,440
right so I wonder if that's even further

668
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,840
[Music]

669
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,950
evidence I guess that I'm just not able

670
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:36,148
to use the top level to actually do any

671
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,149
testing on this

672
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:59,859
I don't get it I don't get it

673
00:33:50,349 --> 00:34:02,939
I really don't so another question is

674
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:02,939
what if I just got rid of this

675
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,510
can I just get rid of it

676
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:40,970
I mean does that actually count is is

677
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:53,098
that will that actually modify that I

678
00:34:40,969 --> 00:35:03,358
mean we could find out right actually I

679
00:34:53,099 --> 00:35:16,950
guess let me do that here oh it already

680
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:20,548
brought me up here so here's our little

681
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:22,498
like you know attempt to overwrite

682
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:24,329
wherever we are

683
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:26,998
well we won't really overwrite it I

684
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:28,859
guess I don't know exactly what the best

685
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:31,488
way to do it can I do a console dot log

686
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:36,960
actually or something like that

687
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:48,449
JavaScript console output console dot

688
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:50,759
log log so if I do that I'm wondering if

689
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:55,558
there's a way I can tell it I want you

690
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:58,739
to do this thing prop you know is there

691
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:06,569
reinterpret this file please kind of

692
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:10,190
situation but I don't know if I can I

693
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:10,190
probably can't can I

694
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:29,549
so all right so let's just try it so it

695
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:32,250
didn't actually allow my change right

696
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:36,090
you can see that it's you know it still

697
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:42,179
thinks that it's the old line here so it

698
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:44,280
doesn't quite allow me to it doesn't

699
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:46,019
quite allow me to actually replace a

700
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,360
line of code with the line of code that

701
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:52,920
I wanted so let's see if I can do that

702
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:59,789
you know who knows chrome edit

703
00:36:52,920 --> 00:37:02,090
JavaScript and continue so let's take a

704
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:05,208
look

705
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,209
[Music]

706
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:34,000
so do I just have to save it

707
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,639
let's see

708
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,500
hmm so that seemed to only be editing

709
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,809
things from the top level though like

710
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,679
that didn't seem to allow me to actually

711
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:25,739
change this I'll give it another shot

712
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:35,099
and we'll see so let's say I do a

713
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:36,509
refresher and oops you know I also

714
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:40,250
wonder what would happen if we just

715
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,250
loaded this site directly

716
00:38:50,449 --> 00:39:00,929
look if we just did that because that's

717
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:10,769
a lot simpler right

718
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:11,940
oh hey so even though that's pretty

719
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:14,280
weird

720
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,000
what's with the air here no it's just a

721
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,510
post so even though that's pretty

722
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,699
interesting

723
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:25,710
so so when we use this as the only frame

724
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:29,179
because we're not in an iframe anymore

725
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:31,289
that code will work interesting

726
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:34,440
again that suggested it is the

727
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:36,840
cross-site they set the cross-site Flags

728
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,250
run on the iframe because iframes have

729
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,220
to have specific stuff set to be cross

730
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:45,179
frame let's try that over here and see

731
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:48,149
if I can actually log in right instead

732
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:52,919
of of using the pop-up if I just log in

733
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:57,380
instead so let's see this iframe there's

734
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,380
the source let's grab that out

735
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:16,500
I copy it

736
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:19,680
my username password in hey hey I think

737
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,858
that actually logged me in let's find

738
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:21,858
out

739
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:37,559
so now if I like refresh the page in my

740
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:44,278
logged in sadly not it doesn't seem like

741
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:51,359
it ah well you know I tried I tried

742
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:53,130
really hard this is the this is a case

743
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,108
where being knowledgeable about

744
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:58,170
JavaScript would help because I'm pretty

745
00:40:55,108 --> 00:41:00,538
sure this is not hard to work around I

746
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:03,480
just don't have that experience right

747
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:06,480
like I don't know all of the ways in

748
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,548
which people mess up their code and so

749
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,199
when I see a bug like that unlike you

750
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:12,210
and C or something where I often have a

751
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:14,068
pretty good idea of what's going on in

752
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,139
JavaScript I'm like I don't know what

753
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:17,489
that error comes from right I have no

754
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:20,818
idea because I just don't have that

755
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:21,989
experience and I'm not I'm not fast I

756
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:24,838
with the language you know I don't know

757
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:30,358
what a require directive actually

758
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:33,048
doesn't know DJ s I have no idea so

759
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:36,828
let's take a look at what happened here

760
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:40,949
cuz it did it does allow me to proceed

761
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:42,930
but it must not set the login cookie or

762
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:47,298
it sets the login cookie but for the

763
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:47,298
wrong site or something let's see here

764
00:41:54,619 --> 00:42:01,430
it seems like maybe like because it goes

765
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:08,900
to a register callback and but it

766
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:12,219
doesn't it doesn't seem to actually done

767
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,220
anything useful for us you know

768
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:29,579
hmm

769
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,579
what if I inspect this guy right here

770
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:47,900
and paste that in there

771
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:51,949
ah I did it okay so let me tell you how

772
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:54,829
I did it so I did go ahead and put this

773
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:56,659
in its own frame like this I put in my

774
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:58,489
username and password and did the login

775
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,349
which brought me to a callback

776
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:04,699
but that callback didn't do anything so

777
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:09,110
I cut and pasted that callback URL into

778
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:12,909
the iframe on this page so I basically

779
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:16,340
went like this looked at this guy right

780
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:19,909
found the iframe here and I pasted the

781
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:22,280
callback in here that actually did set

782
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:28,190
the cookie properly and now I am logged

783
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:32,990
in ladies and gentlemen the fine power

784
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:38,740
of modern technology at our disposal the

785
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:41,719
future of software no less the future is

786
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:46,309
me having to learn javascript to log

787
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:51,849
into a frigging web page alright let me

788
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:58,389
go ahead and copy onto a thumb drive

789
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:58,389
this program that we wanted to use oh

790
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:08,570
man there's gonna be a man on Mars

791
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:11,358
before the web is even barely usable all

792
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:22,930
right let's see here which one of this

793
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:22,929
it's put on there and hope this works

794
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:37,710
looks like it's still writing and now

795
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:45,990
it's done at long last ladies and

796
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:49,889
gentlemen I am proud to drag I guess the

797
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:54,299
nvidia n site graphics installer to our

798
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:58,529
desktop i think we've earned it here we

799
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:07,260
had to go all the way in and all the way

800
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:11,910
back out again should really put vodka

801
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:14,240
in this thing forget coffee let's see if

802
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:16,529
it works we may have to also download

803
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:20,029
updated drivers hopefully those are

804
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:22,769
available to everybody and not just

805
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:24,210
registered developers but well i since

806
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:33,059
since this thing's got the cookie set

807
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:35,630
hopefully that that's the only thing at

808
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:35,630
that point

809
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:55,989
this doesn't seem to be going too well

810
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:57,279
here we go that all seems good and again

811
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:59,289
I don't know if this includes the graphs

812
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,519
driver so we may need them you know what

813
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:03,838
let's go ahead and just find out which

814
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,838
ones we even have cuz I don't know

815
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:35,840
388 13 and actually let me just look at

816
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:40,279
its it said specifically which version

817
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:44,600
it wanted you to have here required and

818
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:47,660
video display driver which is this okay

819
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:54,460
so yeah we're like definitely not up to

820
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:54,460
date here so we want this one let's get

821
00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:04,969
totally fine totally fine

822
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:09,889
yeah it's cool don't worry about it bro

823
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:15,789
I know how to program JavaScript now not

824
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:15,789
really so let's see if I can grab that

825
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,510
from here because I am logged in over

826
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,060
here there it is

827
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,230
yep perfect so thankfully didn't have to

828
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:35,360
go through that again it remember the

829
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:37,250
cookie thank God for cookies right or

830
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,809
more specifically I suppose you know

831
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:42,710
thanking God God didn't really give us

832
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:47,299
cookies Paul Newman gives us cookies so

833
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:51,050
thank Paul Newman but either way thank

834
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:55,460
you old bearded white man for for giving

835
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:56,660
us cookies because without cookies they

836
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,949
would have had to go through that whole

837
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:59,839
thing again although now that I know how

838
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:05,539
to do it I could do that pretty quickly

839
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:07,550
I suspect all right will we be able to

840
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:08,809
actually run this profiler before the

841
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,570
episode is over that's that's the

842
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:13,400
question at this point right but we're

843
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:16,280
sort of on a mission so I think you know

844
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,090
I think we're gonna make it we've got a

845
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,090
while I got an hour

846
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:30,949
okay

847
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:50,170
off we go actually I probably shouldn't

848
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:52,720
have launched that from the D Drive but

849
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,530
you know too late now I accidentally

850
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:55,529
double clicked

851
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,599
I'm also going to put these in here I

852
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,598
guess

853
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:37,790
and when this is done I'll put it in

854
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,789
there as well

855
00:50:02,588 --> 00:50:06,420
hopefully our system is compatible

856
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:21,048
it's thinking about it all right so we

857
00:50:18,498 --> 00:50:23,929
got a graphics driver that's good a 3d

858
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:25,849
vision control driver I don't know what

859
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:29,058
that is I don't any of this stuff is so

860
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:32,630
let's just get rid of those I don't want

861
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:34,099
an experience and I don't want physics

862
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,019
so I think we're good with just graphics

863
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:38,440
driver and audio driver that's all we

864
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:38,439
want right

865
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:10,390
oh so people say in blocking cookies I

866
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:13,358
don't I do block cross-origin stuff

867
00:51:10,389 --> 00:51:16,839
though but I thought we disabled that

868
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:21,929
with the other cross-origin part right

869
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,930
like this so here in settings

870
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,570
well of course actually doesn't matter

871
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,070
what this one's set to because I

872
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:33,059
downloaded it it didn't work on the

873
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:33,059
other one either

874
00:51:53,869 --> 00:52:00,889
yeah so no I'm definitely not blocking

875
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:02,150
cookie thing I block these which you

876
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:03,739
should always block because that's

877
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,349
basically just advertising tracking

878
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:09,589
right so if your site doesn't work with

879
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:11,269
that thing on your super busted right

880
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:13,070
because you should never need a

881
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:14,690
third-party cookie if you wrote your web

882
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,580
code properly you never need a

883
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:18,880
third-party cookie for any legitimate

884
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:22,340
purpose right you're just being sloppy

885
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,829
but we allow full cookies from everybody

886
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,930
else right and that's the same that I

887
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:28,759
haven't said on the other machine and by

888
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:31,460
the way all other logins work just fine

889
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,260
so no it pretty much is their code is

890
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,579
messed and I think the reason their code

891
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,290
is is messed up is because I think

892
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:38,360
they're trying to do cross-origin cookie

893
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:40,730
it absolutely is cross-origin

894
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,220
it's a cross-origin bug I know this

895
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:46,940
because on one hand the handmade hero

896
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:48,649
site I have to because it gets served

897
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,510
from a CDN now I specifically had to

898
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:54,280
make that work I'm not a web programmer

899
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:56,360
and our site does cross-origin properly

900
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,660
so I can pretty much guarantee you that

901
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:01,880
it's not me it's them if people allow

902
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:03,019
cross-origin cookies all right I mean

903
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,400
maybe you just want to be tracked by

904
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:06,710
advertisers and stuff like that but you

905
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,139
shouldn't and there's no legitimate

906
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:12,829
reason for it it's never something that

907
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:15,589
you actually want on because any piece

908
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:17,750
of code that was written coherently can

909
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:21,160
set its access control properly to make

910
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:24,980
it so that that's not a problem right

911
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:26,029
it's not hard anyway let's see like I

912
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,550
said if I know how to do it it can't be

913
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:29,990
hard uh so let's see here it looks like

914
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,260
we're all good let's go ahead and

915
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:32,259
restart

916
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,559
you

917
00:54:54,670 --> 00:55:01,599
hello so every time you reinstall

918
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:07,730
graphics drivers that breaks

919
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:10,909
unfortunately yeah again modern

920
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:14,389
computing it's fantastic so now in

921
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:18,440
theory after all that work hopefully

922
00:55:14,389 --> 00:55:34,599
this will we'll actually be able to

923
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:34,599
execute find out so here we go

924
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,829
oh and godling said do you want shooter

925
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:58,500
debugging I think that's only in the

926
00:55:55,829 --> 00:56:02,099
insight visual addition but I so like

927
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:04,318
maybe they updated it I don't know but

928
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:06,119
at least in the old version there was no

929
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:10,650
shooter debugging anyway shader

930
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:15,048
debugging doesn't work on 1080s

931
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:17,130
on well on effect um you know ten series

932
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:18,599
graphics cards they didn't support

933
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:23,990
shaded debugging anyway so we didn't a

934
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:27,930
state a debugging the old 600 series did

935
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:30,479
and maybe you know maybe they added it

936
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:33,058
recently I don't know but you know when

937
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,909
we were when we installed it a few like

938
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:38,849
a month or two ago it didn't it you

939
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:41,730
couldn't debug shaders anyway so let's

940
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:44,849
see here here is our Nvidia insight

941
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:47,519
graphics if I like can I put that down

942
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:49,789
here yeah so let's see if we can launch

943
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:49,788
that

944
00:56:56,969 --> 00:57:01,009
of course I don't know how to use it but

945
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:19,079
let's try builds I mean through your

946
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:25,838
handmaid that's not the directory I want

947
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:30,278
handmade data and that should just work

948
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:32,429
I think probably hopefully not actually

949
00:57:30,278 --> 00:57:32,429
sure

950
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:17,440
so

951
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:17,440
[Music]

952
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:32,858
does that mean that it just couldn't

953
00:58:30,068 --> 00:58:41,798
connect to the process or does that mean

954
00:58:32,858 --> 00:58:43,690
it couldn't send the error report let's

955
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:45,130
hope it just means it couldn't send the

956
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,900
error I mean that it couldn't take to

957
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:53,619
the process and that it sent the error

958
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:56,760
report I guess I don't know what to say

959
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:56,759
[Music]

960
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:14,290
so what it mean is that it was that was

961
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:24,599
at the end of the it's at the end of the

962
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:24,599
fun or maybe I'll try making a project

963
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:33,030
here's that legendary startup time

964
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,519
so

965
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,519
[Music]

966
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:10,850
it doesn't even look like it knows about

967
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,850
my process

968
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:20,099
do I have to link with a special

969
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:21,599
something or I should probably read the

970
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:23,969
documentation maybe there's something

971
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:37,710
obvious I'm not doing let's try saying

972
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:39,899
new project handmade hero okay well you

973
01:00:37,710 --> 01:01:00,179
know what let's actually try to put this

974
01:00:39,900 --> 01:01:05,660
in w w and made where would this go and

975
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:05,659
made Nvidia and made hero

976
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:22,579
so here is a our project it's pretty

977
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:26,929
spiffy and I'm getting a feeling that

978
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:29,239
this is gonna be exactly the same as

979
01:01:26,929 --> 01:01:29,960
before but you know is hope springs

980
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:35,299
eternal

981
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:37,760
so there's 132 handmade the working

982
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:41,150
directory is handmade data if I'm not

983
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:44,530
mistaken there are no command-line

984
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:47,360
arguments automatically connect is yes I

985
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:49,550
guess maybe we should set that to no and

986
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:58,030
see if that helps us if we connect

987
01:01:49,550 --> 01:02:01,139
subsequent so that's good

988
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,139
[Music]

989
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:11,199
oh man so no it was actually saying it

990
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:13,329
can't send the error report so not only

991
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,489
is the program broken but the thing that

992
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:18,000
reports how the program is broken is

993
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:18,000
also broken

994
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:46,490
well what if we set the working

995
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:46,490
directory to dislike build or something

996
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,190
let's just look at the welcome page for

997
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:13,660
a while since that's the only thing that

998
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:15,579
works it's got a nice this is nice I

999
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:21,608
like that design it's like a little like

1000
01:03:15,579 --> 01:03:23,849
wireframe with a flat shaded polygons

1001
01:03:21,608 --> 01:03:23,848
there

1002
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:08,539
so here we got some I mean I'm basically

1003
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:13,250
just I give up at this point on the

1004
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:17,390
world vol bus as far as I know not have

1005
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:19,338
the CRT oh you think the fact that we

1006
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:26,629
compiled without the CRT is what makes

1007
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:29,139
it crash because it needs the CRT to be

1008
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,140
there for some reason

1009
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:41,240
she tells q says I think you're getting

1010
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:44,840
the nvidia experience after all yeah I

1011
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:49,309
kind of feel like it maybe run the

1012
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:54,170
profile as an admin so those are both

1013
01:04:49,309 --> 01:04:55,610
reasonable theories I don't feel like

1014
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,950
you have to be an admin makes a lot of

1015
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:59,840
sense but we'll try it link it with a C

1016
01:04:57,949 --> 01:05:02,239
runtime library might be harder I don't

1017
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:09,800
know how easy it is for us to restart

1018
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:20,319
linking with it but we can try anyway

1019
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:22,850
let's go ahead and load that project oh

1020
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:30,559
but we're gonna have to so first we're

1021
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:35,839
gonna have to substance is substant

1022
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:39,320
drives or per user so we've got to

1023
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:48,108
subsidize under the admin user so here

1024
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:50,059
we are an admin no dice and so let's try

1025
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:54,230
the other thing that was suggested like

1026
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:58,340
is it possible that it's just because we

1027
01:05:54,230 --> 01:06:02,599
don't have C runtime library installed

1028
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:06,680
and I don't know that could be here's

1029
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:11,179
the build up app for the C runtime

1030
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:16,879
library if I just forced it to be in

1031
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:22,219
there that is just just the snow default

1032
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:23,690
Lib I think if I get rid of it I don't

1033
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:24,980
know if we can compile that way though

1034
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:26,690
it might be multiplied to find symbol

1035
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,730
problem I'm not sure so that should have

1036
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:30,289
the C runtime library back in let's make

1037
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:33,250
sure because we can't actually check to

1038
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:36,230
see one time libraries giant bloated

1039
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:38,539
pile of poop and so let's just take a

1040
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:40,309
look at whether it actually got stuck in

1041
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:42,829
there I don't think it did so there's

1042
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:46,279
one through two handmade and you can see

1043
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:47,719
that the executable size doesn't seem to

1044
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,560
have changed so I don't think that

1045
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:50,559
actually did it

1046
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:22,750
hmm so what I probably have to do is to

1047
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:36,940
put a - empty D in here as well as get

1048
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:39,280
rid of the no default Lib I know I still

1049
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:45,659
think that's probably not doing it it

1050
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:45,660
doesn't am i doing something wrong

1051
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:53,590
because I feel like normally it makes

1052
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,280
the size of this cutable quite a bit

1053
01:07:53,590 --> 01:08:00,340
bigger if you actually link to the C

1054
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:04,150
runtime library and it's not looking any

1055
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:06,789
bigger oops so I'm not sure that it I

1056
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:09,160
actually can get it to do that I will

1057
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:13,179
have to see if maybe I mean maybe that's

1058
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:19,869
the case we'll see but I got to convince

1059
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:21,838
the compared to a queue that guess the

1060
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:23,920
other question is is it even writing it

1061
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:27,479
dependency Walker can't even load it

1062
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,480
it's not a good sign

1063
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:57,789
so there it is gone we've got - MTD

1064
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:57,789
specified and no default lib is gone

1065
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,980
unfortunately dependency Walker it's

1066
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:13,479
just a bad day for computing it's just

1067
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:13,479
you know trashed unfortunately

1068
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:28,770
and I'm not quite sure why like it

1069
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:31,139
shouldn't take this long for depends to

1070
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:32,910
load in executable it must be having

1071
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:37,230
trouble with something I just don't know

1072
01:09:32,909 --> 01:09:43,970
what does anybody still open here

1073
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:43,969
besides Cortana look at this nonsense

1074
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:58,390
so I couldn't tell you why that's I mean

1075
01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:03,070
that should have built with the C

1076
01:09:58,390 --> 01:10:04,480
runtime library in there it sure doesn't

1077
01:10:03,069 --> 01:10:07,090
look like it did

1078
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:10,329
why on earth we can't run dependency

1079
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:14,529
Walker I don't even want to know but you

1080
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:18,729
know welcome to the future if I come in

1081
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:19,239
here to visual studio I guess if I step

1082
01:10:18,729 --> 01:10:23,049
in

1083
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:24,760
I can look to see where we are I mean

1084
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:27,909
yeah you could see it's not it's not in

1085
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:33,070
here so it's not it's still not linking

1086
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:34,869
us with the C runtime library and I

1087
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:37,149
guess the reason for that is because

1088
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:39,909
even if we're specifying this switch

1089
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:42,939
because nothing in here is asking for

1090
01:10:39,909 --> 01:10:48,819
the C runtime library it just doesn't

1091
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:51,629
get it right it doesn't get pulled in so

1092
01:10:48,819 --> 01:10:54,639
I don't know standard i/o and malloc and

1093
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:55,119
stuff are in here right I mean there it

1094
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,190
is

1095
01:10:55,119 --> 01:11:00,399
so I feel like that should have pulled

1096
01:10:57,189 --> 01:11:05,229
it in if we didn't explicitly turn it

1097
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:07,809
off but but it doesn't so I'm not sure

1098
01:11:05,229 --> 01:11:11,559
how to force it to link that in it

1099
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:15,910
really doesn't seem to want to and I'm

1100
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:19,960
not sure how to tell it you know to to

1101
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:21,430
force it in there because as far as I

1102
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:27,270
could tell that should have told it to

1103
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:30,570
put it in there right so I don't know I

1104
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,570
got nothing

1105
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:48,420
I'm not sure how I would tell it any

1106
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:50,930
more explicitly to do that well that was

1107
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:54,199
a complete waste of time

1108
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:54,200
so there we go

1109
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:21,670
Wow all right fantastic wonderful great

1110
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:21,670
love it

1111
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:26,659
windows it's great it's fantastic

1112
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:31,988
Mountain software it's wonderful the web

1113
01:12:26,659 --> 01:12:31,988
great good everything's super wonderful

1114
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:39,530
this is this is apparently what will be

1115
01:12:36,439 --> 01:12:41,089
running cars in the future is this kind

1116
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:42,500
of mentality as well so that's good I

1117
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:49,369
can't wait to walk down the streets with

1118
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:52,189
that happening so I guess that's see it

1119
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:53,899
for handmade here today while I'm here

1120
01:12:52,189 --> 01:12:55,189
maybe I'll delete standard i/o and

1121
01:12:53,899 --> 01:12:56,589
malloc tat H I don't know why they were

1122
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:58,669
here

1123
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:06,680
we're we actually depending on those in

1124
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:18,590
some way so we're just left over so yeah

1125
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:19,969
great good wonderful fabulous mmm I'm

1126
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:23,840
gonna go to your head and go to

1127
01:13:19,969 --> 01:13:26,210
questions and answers I don't have any

1128
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,279
answers for you other than it's hopeless

1129
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:31,510
give up now the future of software is

1130
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:31,509
doomed don't bother

1131
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:09,730
yeah we could try with the with the

1132
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:12,669
entry point but we don't really bypass I

1133
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:14,948
mean okay so maybe just the fact that we

1134
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:18,039
defined this one bypasses the entry

1135
01:14:14,948 --> 01:14:19,928
point but this is so it probably just

1136
01:14:18,039 --> 01:14:25,000
maybe the linker just removed all the

1137
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:37,869
dead code that could be why right so if

1138
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:40,689
we did this I don't really know what the

1139
01:14:37,869 --> 01:14:42,579
boilerplate for win main is offhand I

1140
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:45,599
haven't typed it since the beginning of

1141
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:45,600
handmade here I probably

1142
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:10,500
all right so that stuff will now make us

1143
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:25,110
not the entry point right so if I do

1144
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:31,470
this now in fact maybe I can do this so

1145
01:15:25,109 --> 01:15:33,469
that in theory should build it there it

1146
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:40,740
is look it's that's what we needed

1147
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:44,130
perfect it's five times its size so now

1148
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:47,699
it's the standard so maybe that's fine

1149
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:54,300
all right so if I load up this situation

1150
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:56,119
again and I load the project that way it

1151
01:15:54,300 --> 01:16:00,930
should be shouldn't be like right here

1152
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:10,430
yeah so here's the project and I hit

1153
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:10,430
launch resounding success

1154
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:27,288
hey that one's sent though before we

1155
01:16:25,488 --> 01:16:33,319
couldn't send it that one we actually

1156
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:34,698
were able to send so that's something so

1157
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:36,828
what ain't that it's not administrative

1158
01:16:34,698 --> 01:16:39,438
rights it's not because we weren't

1159
01:16:36,828 --> 01:16:43,509
looking with a C runtime library anyone

1160
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:43,510
have any more really fun guesses

1161
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:27,799
- usually anything like medipartner to

1162
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:28,670
make modern OpenGL more tolerable yeah I

1163
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,350
do

1164
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:33,880
use a generator to generate like the

1165
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:33,880
function loading stuff

1166
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,900
what is the editor you use the

1167
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,579
simplicity of it appeals to me as

1168
01:17:38,899 --> 01:17:42,259
someone who used to work on a UNIX

1169
01:17:40,579 --> 01:17:44,359
kernel back in the day it's called for

1170
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:50,270
coder and it was actually written

1171
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:53,239
specifically as like a result of Alan

1172
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:57,140
Webster watching me previously use Emacs

1173
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:59,510
which is kind of a pile these days on

1174
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:02,800
stream and you can get it here at for

1175
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:02,800
coder h2o

1176
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:09,710
it's at the incredibly expensive

1177
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:13,760
spensive price of $12 which is a bargain

1178
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:15,819
by any stretch of the imagination and I

1179
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:20,840
highly recommend it

1180
01:18:15,819 --> 01:18:24,710
it's programmable in C and it comes with

1181
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:26,119
my config as well so if you just want to

1182
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,739
use mine you can but it's programmable

1183
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:30,289
and C so you can program it yourself

1184
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:31,729
in C without having to learn like Lisp

1185
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:33,560
or something like you would if you were

1186
01:18:31,729 --> 01:18:36,169
using something like Emacs or some other

1187
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:39,560
proprietary scripting language or Python

1188
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:41,210
or C sharp or whatever so if you're a C

1189
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:43,520
programmer and just wants to program C

1190
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:49,189
you can just program C and it's pretty

1191
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:53,270
nice that way does it still work with a

1192
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:56,589
visual studio plug-in of n site that's a

1193
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:56,590
good question

1194
01:19:12,288 --> 01:19:36,569
let's try so if we were to take our

1195
01:19:27,538 --> 01:19:48,029
current builds and try it here now to be

1196
01:19:36,569 --> 01:19:49,889
fair so the answer is no and but my

1197
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:53,458
other question is since we updated the

1198
01:19:49,889 --> 01:20:04,109
graphics driver do we have to update n

1199
01:19:53,458 --> 01:20:06,510
site again and I don't know so is there

1200
01:20:04,109 --> 01:20:13,198
an update now button or do I have to

1201
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:14,909
turn on updates reboot you know update

1202
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:19,428
oops that's not what I wanted you know

1203
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:19,429
update again I don't know right

1204
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:29,719
wait where's the thing there is

1205
01:20:21,628 --> 01:20:33,498
extensions and updates so interestingly

1206
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:33,498
it's not in here

1207
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:44,909
what what does that even mean

1208
01:20:51,180 --> 01:21:05,890
what is this garbage I don't know what

1209
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:12,100
any of this stuff is and I certainly

1210
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:12,460
didn't install any of it oh boy now I've

1211
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:17,650
done it

1212
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:19,750
I don't okay I hit the what do you need

1213
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:22,029
to know I hit this button just get rid

1214
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:28,960
of it I don't need you to open up some

1215
01:21:22,029 --> 01:21:34,210
other window why is it what is happening

1216
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:36,730
in the world why is it opening this I

1217
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:41,939
don't need like I just told you what to

1218
01:21:36,729 --> 01:21:41,939
do I don't know or want to see any event

1219
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:47,319
all right fantastic

1220
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:49,360
anyway I'm wondering if you have to

1221
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:51,309
update insight so what I'm gonna do here

1222
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:59,759
is I'm just gonna turn on automatic

1223
01:21:51,310 --> 01:22:02,800
updates that start up true true and true

1224
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:05,140
hit okay and then I'm going to see if it

1225
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,090
can update itself because we don't know

1226
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:09,369
if updating the graphics driver may have

1227
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:11,319
that's it now again what did I say it

1228
01:22:09,369 --> 01:22:14,550
was opening this thing never update

1229
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:14,549
anything right

1230
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:21,190
and this is why cuz everything gets

1231
01:22:18,699 --> 01:22:27,119
worse it doesn't work here's a check for

1232
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:27,119
updates button it doesn't do anything oh

1233
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:32,940
it does does it here get latest version

1234
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:43,619
download here it's gonna it's gonna make

1235
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:43,619
me log in again

1236
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:06,349
it's an update what is wrong with you

1237
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:19,100
okay it's fine

1238
01:23:25,779 --> 01:23:41,119
inside Visual Studio I'm scrolling down

1239
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:43,539
I'm clicking downloads I'm downloading

1240
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,539
it now

1241
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:06,770
I'm putting the thumb drive into the

1242
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,770
machine

1243
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:19,850
and now I'm copying the file over to the

1244
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:21,710
thumb drive I'm waiting for the right to

1245
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:27,520
finish before pulling the thumb drive

1246
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:27,520
out so as not to corrupt the right

1247
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:51,080
and now I'm placing the thumb drive back

1248
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:51,079
into the main machine

1249
01:25:32,868 --> 01:25:38,839
so now we know that that option is

1250
01:25:36,979 --> 01:25:40,848
completely worthless because it doesn't

1251
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,920
update itself anyway so these can stay

1252
01:25:40,849 --> 01:25:44,360
false and we just go to the website when

1253
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,800
we want a new version cuz we're gonna

1254
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:53,779
have to do it anyway in the entire

1255
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:56,900
process we'll be manual good to know all

1256
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:59,840
right are we having fun yet

1257
01:25:56,899 --> 01:26:04,908
programming is wonderful such a great

1258
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:08,020
occupation so here is my visual studio

1259
01:26:04,908 --> 01:26:12,259
edition I am going to double click on it

1260
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:15,320
I'm going to allow it to continue to

1261
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:17,030
destroy my development environment since

1262
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:20,649
everyone else has today I don't see why

1263
01:26:17,029 --> 01:26:20,649
it shouldn't be given a chance as well

1264
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:13,220
then we've got I don't know this HUD

1265
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,270
launcher thing is we can play with that

1266
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:17,310
possibly we might want something that I

1267
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:18,930
don't know but let's go ahead and now

1268
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:23,190
see if we can do what we want to do

1269
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:34,490
before or if we're just permanently

1270
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:34,489
screwed now nope

1271
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:58,429
so yeah I guess if anything if there was

1272
01:27:56,448 --> 01:27:59,748
anything that could convince you of why

1273
01:27:58,429 --> 01:28:02,989
you never update your development

1274
01:27:59,748 --> 01:28:05,898
environment we started the day having

1275
01:28:02,988 --> 01:28:07,578
the ability to debug our graphics and we

1276
01:28:05,899 --> 01:28:09,530
ended the day without it and who knows

1277
01:28:07,578 --> 01:28:13,868
what will ever get it back probably not

1278
01:28:09,529 --> 01:28:19,548
but maybe who knows so there you have it

1279
01:28:13,868 --> 01:28:25,308
we have spent two hours trying to update

1280
01:28:19,548 --> 01:28:27,338
and our features regressed that is

1281
01:28:25,309 --> 01:28:33,048
pretty much exactly what I said

1282
01:28:27,338 --> 01:28:36,078
happens and it happened that's about all

1283
01:28:33,048 --> 01:28:38,538
I have to say for today there's really

1284
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:41,748
nothing else you can say it's as if the

1285
01:28:38,538 --> 01:28:45,498
universe just wants to reinforce the

1286
01:28:41,748 --> 01:28:47,898
point don't ever touch your deaf

1287
01:28:45,498 --> 01:28:51,198
envelopment dev environment people it

1288
01:28:47,899 --> 01:28:57,048
can only make things worse and that is

1289
01:28:51,198 --> 01:29:00,259
the end of that I'm not going to take

1290
01:28:57,048 --> 01:29:03,559
any questions because there's really no

1291
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:05,739
point I think you pretty much saw what

1292
01:29:03,559 --> 01:29:08,088
there is to see here

1293
01:29:05,738 --> 01:29:09,648
maybe we'll be back next week maybe we

1294
01:29:08,088 --> 01:29:12,529
won't maybe it's time to just take a

1295
01:29:09,649 --> 01:29:15,289
week off because honestly that was a

1296
01:29:12,529 --> 01:29:16,969
disaster and exactly everything that is

1297
01:29:15,288 --> 01:29:18,078
wrong with software today we started out

1298
01:29:16,969 --> 01:29:20,149
with the fact that Visual Studio

1299
01:29:18,078 --> 01:29:22,698
couldn't update properly then we had

1300
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:24,319
Nvidia couldn't download stuff because

1301
01:29:22,698 --> 01:29:25,668
they have their site set up wrong and

1302
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:28,280
then the software that we try to

1303
01:29:25,668 --> 01:29:31,158
download doesn't work anyway so that's

1304
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:34,578
pretty awesome on so many levels

1305
01:29:31,158 --> 01:29:44,509
everybody just out to absolutely win

1306
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:46,578
today fantastic it's great yeah I'd get

1307
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:47,659
a day job somewhere and just kind of

1308
01:29:46,578 --> 01:29:49,279
phone it in if you want to be a

1309
01:29:47,658 --> 01:29:50,808
programmer don't actually care about

1310
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,358
software because it will absolutely

1311
01:29:50,809 --> 01:29:55,219
destroy you spiritually because

1312
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,469
literally no one else in the world is

1313
01:29:55,219 --> 01:30:00,078
even remotely interested in doing a good

1314
01:29:57,469 --> 01:30:01,969
job that's it for today I'll see you

1315
01:30:00,078 --> 01:30:04,298
back here in maybe two weeks take it as

1316
01:30:01,969 --> 01:30:04,298
everybody
