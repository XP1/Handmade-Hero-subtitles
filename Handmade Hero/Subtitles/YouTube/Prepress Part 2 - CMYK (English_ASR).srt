1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
so that's why see my is what we start

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:07,080
with when we start talking about colors

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,480
for printing but if you've ever done

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,750
print before or you worked in a print in

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,759
a art package and gone into one of the

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,429
print color modes it's never seen why

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,519
it's Oh a CMYK what's the K well the K

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:23,489
actually is for black ink and the reason

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,160
it's not be for black is because RGB

10
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,979
already was like blue for you know B for

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,920
blue and so see my B would be like do

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,530
you mean cyan magenta yellow blue or rut

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,890
right so K was reserved specifically for

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:42,239
black so you know it's it's black not

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:45,170
not blue so the idea behind CMYK as a

16
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:48,149
color model instead of just see my is

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,390
purely based on the practicalities of

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,460
printing so printing is a physical

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,649
process it involves physical inks that

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,989
have real limitations those inks

21
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,789
accumulate on a piece of paper and

22
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:03,089
furthermore when you're doing a print

23
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,540
run you had to pay for them right those

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,609
inks cost real money and it's not nearly

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,799
as cheap as like the electricity that

26
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:12,420
powers a monitor for example so it's a

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,118
real physical good that has a lot of

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,769
processing behind it that it is it's

29
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,900
weighty it has to be delivered on trucks

30
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:22,140
right it's a real it's a much more

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,900
physical involved you know industrial

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,500
thing than just I turned on electricity

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,090
and flowed it through the monitor right

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
so when you're thinking about how you're

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,659
gonna print something and you're trying

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,310
to do an efficient job which printers

37
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,530
always are because it's always about

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,299
cost and quality right they're trying to

39
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,460
balance those two things and get as much

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,960
quality as they can for a certain

41
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:49,709
expense right the reason that you add a

42
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:54,419
black ink is because grayscale things

43
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:57,000
are very common right so things that

44
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,240
inherently don't actually have any color

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,090
in them so for example the text in every

46
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,149
book it doesn't really have much of a

47
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,209
color it's mostly just gray dark gray or

48
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,098
black right and we are very used to

49
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,530
typesetting books this way and almost

50
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,949
everything that involves fonts is this

51
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,959
way

52
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:19,500
and we have lots of greyscale imaging

53
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:23,939
and other stuff like that right so if

54
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:28,709
you were to use a purely CMY process to

55
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:31,530
produce greyscale or black printing then

56
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:36,090
the problem you have is not only do you

57
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:38,159
now have to pay for three inks right so

58
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,479
you have to pay for three different inks

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,930
that you're going to use to ink this

60
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:47,009
particular thing but you also have to

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,019
make sure that they mix right and that

62
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,409
can be incredibly tricky as we'll start

63
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,450
to see

64
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,729
when we get a little bit further down

65
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,919
this discussion and talk about how

66
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:57,209
offset printing or web printing there's

67
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,768
a couple different there's a lot of

68
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,209
different print jargon that we won't

69
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,159
really go into because honestly I'm not

70
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:04,019
an expert in it it's more about like how

71
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,310
printing presses speak amongst

72
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,530
themselves and talk about their

73
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,560
particular processes but when you talk

74
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,659
about I'll use a general description of

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
the kinds we mean here when you use a

76
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,000
print process where the ink is never

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,919
mixed until it hits the paper so you can

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,629
imagine having these inks I could mix

79
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,729
them together first and then I could put

80
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:26,039
them on the page or I can put them on

81
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:29,039
the page one after the other and let

82
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,539
them mix there right so when we're

83
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,239
talking about processes that look like

84
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:36,298
that so there's a successive layerings

85
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,889
of ink that are happening if you don't

86
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:43,379
get the registration just right then

87
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,450
when you're trying to slap down three

88
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,090
different you know CMY to try and

89
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:50,189
produce a black you're gonna get

90
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,879
fringing you'll get color fringing right

91
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:56,310
because maybe the cyan ink was a little

92
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,560
bit to the left or bled into the paper a

93
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,840
little bit chemically more than the

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,670
magenta ink did then the yellow ink did

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,299
and now there's some chromatic

96
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:09,958
aberration right kind of around the this

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:12,810
thing and when you're printing a full a

98
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,549
rich full-color image you don't care

99
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,069
because it's all this this sort of

100
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,650
continuous mixture of ink that's

101
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:22,469
producing like a continuous visual image

102
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:26,319
so you don't mind that the registration

103
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,860
is not you know atomically perfect right

104
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,149
but if you're just printing white

105
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,670
background you know printing black text

106
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:35,889
on a white background well you really do

107
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,590
you don't want to be trying to read this

108
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,110
page you know in a book and seeing all

109
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:44,979
this like cyan magenta fringing you know

110
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,980
all over the place now as I say that I'm

111
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,500
talking about printing in the 1980s or

112
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:54,069
whatever right when people expected

113
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,129
things to look good since Microsoft

114
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:59,290
introduced ClearType technology people

115
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:01,930
are probably now a lot more used to

116
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,580
seeing chromatic aberration around all

117
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,240
of their text so it's all ugly and

118
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,800
colorized on the sides that's just

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,410
something that happened so it might be

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,379
that nowadays you don't care as much I

121
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,510
don't know not for me to say ClearType

122
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,360
still bugs me quite a bit so I don't

123
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,279
want to go back to a see my style

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,170
process where there's always fringing so

125
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,459
anyway

126
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,860
assuming you care about crispness and

127
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:29,379
quality and lack of chromatic aberration

128
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,470
that's another good reason to use a

129
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:35,860
black ink right because it allows you to

130
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,410
lay down black or gray elements on a

131
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,020
page without having registration errors

132
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,360
that may be almost impossible to correct

133
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:46,839
if you're talking about such narrow like

134
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,920
little thin high high contrast things

135
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:55,229
like thin font lines or very fine black

136
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,060
or gray brushstrokes right and there's

137
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,400
potentially even a third reason and the

138
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,819
third reason is it's just more options

139
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,029
and that leads me basically into what I

140
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:10,389
want to talk about next

141
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:12,579
if you imagine trying to produce some

142
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,250
color image or anything you want to

143
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:17,289
produce on a printed page like I said

144
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,839
it's a very physical process it process

145
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,660
it has real limitations and the ink

146
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:27,459
technology that we currently have at

147
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:29,200
least isn't perfect so the see my model

148
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,229
of mixing inks together to produce

149
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,449
colors can't produce all the colors you

150
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,100
can produce on a monitor it's it's just

151
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:40,120
not feasible to do so

152
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,510
okay so monitor tech

153
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,629
the omitting reproducing of images by

154
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:50,469
emitting color our tech is way better

155
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:52,659
now too for that then the printed pages

156
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,210
it's like it's surpassed it

157
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,650
so the gamut which is another way if you

158
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:59,109
never heard that term before of saying

159
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:02,319
all of the colors we can produce the

160
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:07,840
gamut of a modern especially like an HDR

161
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:11,680
monitor is just much wider than the inks

162
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,959
that we have and so throwing a black ink

163
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,250
in there along with the cyan magenta and

164
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:21,579
yellow ink also is just another way in

165
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,319
which you can tune the ink mixture to

166
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:27,519
produce other colors so instead of

167
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,769
having to add cm and Y together to to

168
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,199
darken something you can instead use

169
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:35,859
some black ink to darken it and so on

170
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,168
right so it's just adding an extra

171
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,419
degree of freedom that we wouldn't need

172
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:42,579
if inks were perfect but they're not

173
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:45,310
perfect and so it just gives us another

174
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:47,139
way to potentially attack the problem of

175
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,769
getting a good-looking image on a

176
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:53,379
printed page so coming back to this

177
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:55,180
image this is what anna draws if she has

178
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,949
no printing constraints she will just

179
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,360
make this and the reason that I picked

180
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,329
this page was because you can see

181
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,220
there's a lot of florescent action here

182
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:08,259
right things like rocket engines

183
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,340
radioactive goop like this any sort of

184
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:16,300
stuff an artist is free to make very

185
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:18,579
vibrant glowy fluorescent neon colors in

186
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,939
an RGB color space and that will work

187
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:24,159
just fine this on the other hand oops

188
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:27,250
sorry this and let me just flip that

189
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,910
better here's the the RGB one this is

190
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,099
what that looks like in CMYK and again

191
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,649
this isn't the actual CMYK because I'm

192
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:38,349
not holding a printed sheet right but a

193
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,899
monitors estimation so if we try to fake

194
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:44,080
it by reducing the color space that the

195
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,028
monitor can actually show this is more

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,030
what we could realistically achieve and

197
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:53,080
as you can see up here it just loses a

198
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:55,480
fair bit of that glowy cyan

199
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,350
and that's just a very typical thing

200
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,950
bright neon or fluorescent greens and

201
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:07,000
blues that's just a very challenging

202
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,339
thing for CMYK ink process it just

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,458
doesn't quite work and it's because

204
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:15,940
again we don't tend to really have inks

205
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:19,078
see my inks that can really do what you

206
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:30,610
need to do to get that fluorescent color

207
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:33,759
there's a caveat to that though so take

208
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,680
that with a grain of salt and hope that

209
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,559
I don't forget to tell you more about

210
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,509
that when we get to cover images because

211
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,699
even though I'm telling you right now we

212
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:45,250
don't have inks that can do that well

213
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,050
actually we do have inks that can do

214
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,750
that it's just you probably don't want

215
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:52,500
to use them so we'll talk about that

216
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:55,360
later right now let's focus on CMYK so

217
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,578
hopefully here you can see if I flip

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,620
between these two images a little bit

219
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:03,069
here right can kind of see what those

220
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:05,230
two look like this brings us to the

221
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,470
first thing that you actually want to

222
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,649
make sure that you do to all of your

223
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,750
images in CMYK so we covered the first

224
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,809
step in pre-press which is get your

225
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,958
monitor mid get your monitor calibrated

226
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:22,619
properly but thing number two you want

227
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:25,000
to do is start to correct color problems

228
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,019
so yeah I should say it's the first

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,870
thing you do to your image is not the

230
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:31,539
first thing you do to your setup right

231
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,149
so when you take your RGB images and you

232
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:36,519
convert them to CMYK you're going to get

233
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:38,889
results that may be okay and maybe

234
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,958
aren't okay in this case Anna felt this

235
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:42,759
was fine it's an okay image she liked

236
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,250
the way it looked in other cases she

237
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,929
didn't and I'll show you some of that

238
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,909
later on but what you have to do is now

239
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:51,849
go through all of your artwork and

240
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:55,299
really take a close look at it to see if

241
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,740
the transition from RGB to CMYK created

242
00:10:55,299 --> 00:11:00,669
any problems and if there are problems

243
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:05,589
you have to fix them but now here comes

244
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:06,709
the big but how do you know really what

245
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,060
the color should be

246
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,850
and I just went through this whole thing

247
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:12,559
right of like hey if you want to be

248
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,540
serious about artwork you're gonna have

249
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,549
to get a clerk at calibrated monitor and

250
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:19,069
you'd accept this color profile and now

251
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:23,870
you just said well CMYK and then go look

252
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,330
for problems so 100% true you actually

253
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:30,110
can't start looking for CMYK problems

254
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,930
until you set up a CMYK color profile

255
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,419
and what is this well it's exactly the

256
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:38,479
same thing as you have with the monitor

257
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:40,099
you have with a print process so when

258
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,680
you decide what printer you're going to

259
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,740
go with and you establish a relationship

260
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:48,109
with that printer you need to ask them

261
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,740
what color profile what ICC color

262
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:54,379
profile they they're press most closely

263
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,600
resembles right and they will know this

264
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:58,639
answer all printers will know if if a

265
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,259
printer doesn't know that don't print

266
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,559
with them right any printer who knows

267
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:06,919
anything about printing at all has that

268
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:08,929
information and so then what you will do

269
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,579
is you'll come back here before we

270
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:14,599
talked about this there's this Photoshop

271
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:18,379
color settings this CMYK line that's

272
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,909
where that gets set and so RGB that's

273
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,759
how you set up what your monitor is

274
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:27,049
right and then CMYK this is how you set

275
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:29,509
up what your that's how you set up what

276
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:34,669
your print target is so whatever the

277
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:36,230
actual place that you're going to you're

278
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:38,569
going to print with they should tell you

279
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,019
what it is and you'll see stuff like

280
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,300
this where it says us web coated SW OPV

281
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,710
- you'll see weird stuff like that and

282
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,319
you won't have any idea what it means

283
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:51,259
but actually what these are are just

284
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,150
print terms so us is obviously just

285
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:54,889
because hey in the United States there's

286
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,870
a sort of some different print standards

287
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,019
and there are overseas for example the

288
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,610
like Japan print presses you typically

289
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,710
have a different one and so on so you'll

290
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,350
see different things like that web

291
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:09,350
doesn't mean Internet web is a

292
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,149
description of a type of press so a web

293
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,519
printing process is actually like a

294
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:15,889
description of the press Koated is

295
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,809
talking about the paper right like so

296
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:21,590
what is the coating going to be on the

297
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:24,379
paper is it uncoated paper or coated Bay

298
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,820
and then you've got this WSOP v2 I have

299
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:27,769
no idea where those things come from

300
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,170
don't ask me I am NOT a print

301
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,509
professional like I said it doesn't

302
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:34,549
matter you don't have to know any of the

303
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,279
things I just said what you do have to

304
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:39,559
know is whatever your printer tells you

305
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,600
they're print press uses you want to

306
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:43,909
make sure that you set that standard

307
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,210
because that is the thing that Photoshop

308
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:49,309
will use to try to give you a preview of

309
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,040
what it will probably look like when

310
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:54,139
printed by again by constricting the

311
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:57,409
colors that your monitor can display

312
00:13:54,139 --> 00:14:00,019
down into the range that the press can

313
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:03,519
and also shifting them around based on

314
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:07,069
how it thinks it will get printed right

315
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,919
so that's crucial okay so back to this

316
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,570
so when you do your color conversion and

317
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,549
you've set those things properly you

318
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,440
should see something that gives you a

319
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:17,689
reasonable idea of what it looks like

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,610
and this is your first chance to preview

321
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,890
the artwork and make sure that you don't

322
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,570
see any glaring errors in it because you

323
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,939
want to look at this say oh did anything

324
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,220
in the CMYK conversion really cause a

325
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,750
problem and if it did you need to go

326
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,580
readjust your source source you need to

327
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,379
adjust your layers you need to apply you

328
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,509
know an HSV to it or saying you need to

329
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:38,299
like use photoshop tools to try and

330
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:42,080
correct the color balance to something

331
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:43,399
that you find acceptable okay so let's

332
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,490
take a look at some place where that

333
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,970
happened just to give you an idea of of

334
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:53,419
where that's at so here is an example of

335
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,430
a plate from meow the infinite and I

336
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:57,889
want you to take a look here up at the

337
00:14:55,429 --> 00:15:00,169
great stellar unicorn and what you can

338
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,539
see here is in the original RGB plate

339
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:04,429
this is a very glowy horn with less sort

340
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,689
of like a bright rainbow thing shining

341
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:08,149
out and it's got these kind of wonky

342
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,720
hooves with these little like ridiculous

343
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:14,600
neon colors on them right and when this

344
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,879
gets converted to CMYK what you can see

345
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,909
here is if I flip between them it dulls

346
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:23,330
out a lot right so do you see how like

347
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:25,969
all of the like luster is kind of sucked

348
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,520
out of it to a certain extent so all of

349
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,920
it kind of gets duller and so what Anna

350
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,259
did here as you can see when she went in

351
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:35,639
and

352
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:37,529
changed the the image in CMYK she added

353
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,449
back in as best she could some like

354
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,549
highlighting there she brightened up

355
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,590
this area again because it's not

356
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,789
supposed to be dark up there and it's

357
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,519
it's supposed to have more of a

358
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:49,199
highlight so again there's no there's no

359
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,809
hard and fast rule for this this is

360
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,180
artist preference but the idea is you're

361
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,429
seeing what your comic will probably

362
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,469
look like when it's printed and the

363
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:00,809
artist has to be happy with that I mean

364
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,910
they're the one who designed the page

365
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:05,729
and what it's colored look like and so

366
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:08,549
they look you know should look at it and

367
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,230
say does this represent the image the

368
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:12,089
way I wanted it and if it doesn't that's

369
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,740
you need to fix that you don't want that

370
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,759
to get all the way to the printer and

371
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:21,060
have them be deciding how to fix it okay

372
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:25,049
so next thing we have to talk about is

373
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:28,229
that Kay channel so as you can see from

374
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:31,139
here to here this actually got a lot

375
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,750
less dark it's more like grey right it's

376
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:35,279
more like a sort of a dark grey than a

377
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,090
deep black okay

378
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,500
so what's that about well the next thing

379
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,810
you have to understand about CMYK

380
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,549
process and this is if you really want

381
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:49,739
to do your pre-press well you should

382
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:52,949
understand this is that black once you

383
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,100
put you know fairly full amount of black

384
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:59,340
ink on the page 25 50 75 percent as you

385
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,990
start to get higher right well it's

386
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,149
gonna be black I mean it's gonna be like

387
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,599
a gray it's gonna be at least a dark

388
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:10,470
gray right at some point you will have

389
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:13,078
put as much black ink on the page as the

390
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,569
printing press in one pass can actually

391
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:18,509
put down like that's just how much it

392
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:21,838
can actually deposit in one pass and

393
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:24,779
that's the maximum level of black ink

394
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,899
you can put there that amount of black

395
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:31,529
ink is like this color sort of it's sort

396
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:35,070
of a dark grey but it's not really black

397
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:40,289
like it's not like violent black deep

398
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:43,079
non reflective pure black right so what

399
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:45,000
you can do if you want a more vibrant

400
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,500
black for some reason

401
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,720
like depending on how you're actually

402
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,200
gonna set up a particular image if you

403
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,289
really want like a super super black you

404
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,450
can use what's called rich black so this

405
00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:01,559
where you just have a hundred percent

406
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:05,009
black ink and no see my that's called in

407
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,529
print parlance flat black and flat black

408
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,140
is the darkest black you can get without

409
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:13,889
using other ink rich black is when you

410
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:18,030
add cyan magenta and yellow ink together

411
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,460
to your black ink so all four passes are

412
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:23,069
laying down ink all in the same place

413
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,920
and what that will do is that will

414
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:28,200
reduce the reflectivity even further

415
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,660
right because now not only they have the

416
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,029
black ink taking out all the wavelengths

417
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,620
as much as it can but you have cyant a

418
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,839
king at as much red as it can you have

419
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:38,879
magenta taking out as much green as it

420
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:42,389
can and you have yellow taking out as

421
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,070
much reddit I say that right blue you

422
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,480
have scientic as much red as you can if

423
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,950
you have magenta taking as much green as

424
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,170
you can and you have yellow taking as

425
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,519
much red as you can it's hard to keep

426
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:56,490
them all straight right so that produces

427
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,139
a deeper black color and you can use

428
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,420
that to your advantage when you're

429
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,550
creating a CMYK plate if you really find

430
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,730
you need to get some deep black you can

431
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:08,039
use that but there are lots of problems

432
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,720
with it one is if you do that you're

433
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,089
right back to the problem I was talking

434
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,829
about when I said why we have black ink

435
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,779
in the first place one of the reasons I

436
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:17,970
listed was because you don't want that

437
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,910
chrome at code that chromatic aberration

438
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:23,069
you don't want fringing so for example

439
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,259
if you were to use rich black unlike

440
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:27,480
this text you would be right back to

441
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,849
having those those sort of fringing the

442
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,620
the color fringing on the letters and

443
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:34,109
you don't want that blurriness right you

444
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:35,849
want them to be crisp and the other

445
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:37,500
thing is it's a quirk much more

446
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:39,599
expensive and actually makes the paper

447
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,630
also like more saturated right because

448
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,000
if I'm going to deposit all four inks on

449
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,070
here just load it up well the print

450
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,750
process gets more expensive too because

451
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:51,659
you have to buy more ink for all of that

452
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,429
and the page itself gets like you know

453
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,250
more saturating so there's a limit to

454
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,769
what you can do right and so typically

455
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,259
you need to use

456
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:03,619
you know sort of like some judicious

457
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:05,990
application of if you really need some

458
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,519
rich blacks use the rich blacks if you

459
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,009
don't need the rich blacks don't

460
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,389
necessarily use the rich blacks right so

461
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,039
what we did on me on the infinite

462
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,870
because like I said we did all this by

463
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,700
hand and went through and actually tuned

464
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:19,219
each individual page so we really wanted

465
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,440
it to look good

466
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,200
what we did is said look anywhere

467
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,059
there's text or thin black lines we want

468
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,490
that to be flat black and anywhere

469
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,319
there's like giant regions of black we

470
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,089
don't we want that to be flat black so

471
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,039
doesn't like over saturate the page too

472
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:36,169
much or anything but anywhere that

473
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,569
there's just sort of small patches of

474
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,640
black in the image we'll use rich black

475
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,139
there because it'll make the it'll make

476
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,480
the comic look more vibrant right

477
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,060
because like you know if her you know

478
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,259
eyes here for example are that rich or

479
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,899
black it'll just be a better looking

480
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:52,940
image so that's the way we did rich

481
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,940
black versus flat black on me out of the

482
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,190
infinite and so let me show you what

483
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,720
that actually looks like in practice so

484
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,390
here's another plate from now the

485
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,519
infinite it's a typical plate nothing

486
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,340
particularly fancy going on in it it's a

487
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:11,299
fairly straightforward CMYK plate so

488
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:14,000
this is what the CMYK if you are in

489
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:16,849
Photoshop and you do have an RGB image

490
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,769
and you say make me a CMYK image out of

491
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:21,619
this this is what you're going to get

492
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:23,930
and if we look at the channel breakdown

493
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:26,569
so if we actually go look at the CMY

494
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:29,410
versus the black channels this is what

495
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:33,409
we will see here is the see my channel

496
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:36,800
okay and what you'll notice is in this

497
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,040
see my channel all of the places that I

498
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,930
just said we don't want there to be see

499
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,819
my ink because it'll make for a blurry

500
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:46,850
image it's all there

501
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:48,799
right and again this is why just

502
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:51,259
automatically converting your files is

503
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,450
not the way to get the best results when

504
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,339
you're doing pre-press work because the

505
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,769
automatic conversion it doesn't know

506
00:21:55,339 --> 00:22:00,289
very much it's not like an AI process

507
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,599
yet maybe someday it will be but at the

508
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:05,269
moment it's just stupid it just does

509
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,009
what it does and you end up having a

510
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:08,690
bunch of rich black because that means

511
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:11,420
all of this will be rich black because

512
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:15,049
it's see my inks getting applied and

513
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:18,560
black channel you don't want that so

514
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:21,740
what you want to do is this and this is

515
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,019
what Anna then does by hand with clean

516
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,000
up and again because it's Photoshop and

517
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:27,650
we save all of the layering it's much

518
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,450
easier process she doesn't have to

519
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,790
literally go in and paint it all out she

520
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,559
can like use the layer sets to quickly

521
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,569
set it so thankful it's not as time

522
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,210
consuming but you still have to kind of

523
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:40,639
do it right and say all right remove all

524
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,850
of the parts that were thin black

525
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,620
elements and get those out of the see my

526
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:49,189
channel if that makes sense

527
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:51,559
and so then if you look at the black

528
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,289
channel here's what Photoshop would do

529
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,389
automatically and again that's mostly

530
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,639
right but this is what you probably

531
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,930
actually want which is a little like bit

532
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,090
more black put into like the the the

533
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:07,580
font areas because it's only the black

534
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:12,589
ink now you're not using the CMY to like

535
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:16,369
darken it down further okay so that's

536
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:20,299
the CMYK setup process that you want to

537
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:23,169
do when you you know when you're first

538
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:26,329
doing your pre-press pass so again just

539
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,420
to summarize what you're doing there you

540
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:30,919
need to find out well you need to set up

541
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,450
your color profiles for your monitor and

542
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,950
hopefully you've done that especially if

543
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,269
you're a game developer you should have

544
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,710
been doing that already so hopefully

545
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:39,349
you're doing that if you're not a game

546
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,299
developer though go learn about that buy

547
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:43,459
a color calibrated monitor from the

548
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:46,519
factory calibrated or figure out if the

549
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,110
one you have can be calibrated it's

550
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,519
usually not very much more expensive the

551
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:51,169
ones we use it Mali rocket we're very

552
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,789
expensive they're the cheapest monitors

553
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,500
we actually bought where our factory

554
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:56,779
color calibrated ones that we just used

555
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,880
for previewing like the main monitors we

556
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:00,230
use are typically higher resin and and

557
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,010
more expensive actually so you can buy

558
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,079
them break so it's a couple hundred

559
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:06,019
dollars will get you a monitor that's

560
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,210
factory color calibrated these days so

561
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,500
get a factory color calibrate minor it

562
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,299
doesn't have to be the world's greatest

563
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,069
model just has to be color calibrated

564
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,329
and something you can use as a second

565
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:16,220
monitor in your desk so it can be a low

566
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,779
res monitor even if it needs to be right

567
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,440
but just something can use for that and

568
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:23,210
set that color profile then find out

569
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,890
from your printer what color profile

570
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,600
they use and set that

571
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,090
in Photoshop so it knows what you're

572
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,819
previewing is when you then take your

573
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:33,949
RGB files and convert them to CMYK go

574
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:36,409
through look for any color problems you

575
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,298
see pay careful attention to those neon

576
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:41,058
than fluorescent colors those bright

577
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:42,650
shiny greens and blues those are gonna

578
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:45,349
cause you problems so make sure you

579
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,059
check them and then finally flat black

580
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:49,099
versus rich black figure out what your

581
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:50,420
strategy is for that and figure out what

582
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:52,639
your price is going to be in Photoshop

583
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,400
for taking each individual page and

584
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,020
producing something nice that that will

585
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,460
correctly distribute flat blacks and

586
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:00,619
rich blacks where they should be and

587
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,380
avoid artifacts you might not want like

588
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:05,029
some of that chromatic aberration and

589
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,840
that's pretty much the process of going

590
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:07,839
from RGB to CMYK
