1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,490
okay so this today I wanted to do and as

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,740
you could see from the previous session

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,320
I kind of wanted to do stuff that was a

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,089
little bit more experimental compared to

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,789
last year meaning I wanted to try some

6
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,670
new kinds of sessions so like you know

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,079
the session on muscular and and physical

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,400
problems related to programming I see

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,349
not the kind of thing that you would

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,429
normally necessarily talk about at a

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,260
programming conference but I think

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,518
really important to talk about and you

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,500
know that was that was a fabulous

14
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,809
session so I think that was exactly the

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,668
right thing the other sort of stuff that

16
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,119
I wanted to try we're getting some sort

17
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,919
of discussion oriented things into the

18
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,558
you know sort of the the way that the

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,960
handmade con format works and so what I

20
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:47,009
wanted to do with this session was

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,259
there's sort of this this I don't want

22
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,988
to say that it's like a thing we do as

23
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:54,869
programmers but there's a sort of a way

24
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:57,269
that problems get presented when you are

25
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,858
talking about them and you know

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,930
presenting them to other programmers

27
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,969
it's usually you present them after

28
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,290
they've already been solved so for

29
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,390
example if you went to look at

30
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,680
somebody's blog post on something or

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,629
somebody does or write-up or a

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,580
presentation at a conference typically

33
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:13,859
what happens is they're like okay here's

34
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,989
the problem as you know we solved it

35
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,188
here's how we solved it and sometimes

36
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:18,899
they give you like a little bit of

37
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:20,309
background of like here's you know sort

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,740
of what did work what didn't work kind

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,960
of stuff but rarely do you actually sort

40
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:28,259
of go back to look at what was the

41
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:31,169
actual process by which the programming

42
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,280
happened that got to this solution and

43
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,710
the reason I think this is really

44
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,049
important is because not all programmers

45
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:39,059
in their career depending on where

46
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,250
they're at have had the experience of

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,409
having to tackle a completely new

48
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,909
problem meaning not just something

49
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,899
that's slightly different from what

50
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,159
people have done before but really

51
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,890
something that's completely different

52
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,689
from anything anyone's done before and

53
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,060
having to go through this process of

54
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:57,179
figuring out what the problem even is

55
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,700
and then solving it and this is one of

56
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,280
the most rewarding parts of programming

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,290
in in my experience when you do get to

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,780
have that experience of pushing ahead

59
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,810
somewhere where people haven't really

60
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,990
explored and it's a lot that process is

61
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,939
a lot less about sort of the

62
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,460
perfecting of something and a lot more

63
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,109
about just the like exploration and

64
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,120
figuring out stage and like putting all

65
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,130
of the pieces together so what I want to

66
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,500
do with this session is take a look back

67
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:28,740
at something where this happened in

68
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,990
history which is sort of the the advent

69
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,030
of texture mapping real-time 3d texture

70
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,830
mapping in games and real-time 3d

71
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,870
texture mapping now we sort of take for

72
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,240
granted because a graphics processing

73
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,620
unit in your computer will do it for you

74
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,840
right it's kind of like a purpose-built

75
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,789
thing that does this there's tons and

76
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,650
tons of infrastructure there for you and

77
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,179
there's really no question that nowadays

78
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,280
you know unless you're doing something

79
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,870
very specific you're never really going

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,069
to have an encounter with this part of

81
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,870
the code directly but when games were

82
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,329
still running entirely just on a CPU

83
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,090
they were you know mostly 2d at the time

84
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,980
and they're making the leap to 3d one of

85
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,289
the things that nobody really knew how

86
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,810
to do was to actually do texture mapping

87
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,879
fast enough in games or even really what

88
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,069
texture mapping in games would mean

89
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,930
because again all of this stuff was

90
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:18,359
happening kind of way back and you know

91
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,300
that this is early 90s kind of stuff

92
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,830
when you didn't have an Internet full of

93
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,390
information at your fingertips where you

94
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,890
could just search for texture mapping or

95
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,109
what that is or what all the you know

96
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,789
tutorials on it you literally had

97
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,770
nothing to go on but maybe you're you

98
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,120
know colleges research library or

99
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,270
something like this can we ask how many

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,439
people were at high school or after in

101
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:43,980
the 90s in 1995 how many but most people

102
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,629
are younger than that yes so so what I

103
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,729
wanted to do here was sort of gather

104
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:50,129
some of the folks who actually did this

105
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,989
kind of work and we're part of the

106
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,340
process of the game industry sort of

107
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,159
figuring out how to do this stuff

108
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,960
getting it into commercial games and you

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,520
know getting the process to the point

110
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,439
where it produced like good visual

111
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,630
results at speeds that you could run on

112
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,180
what as we're going to kind of go over

113
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:09,150
we're very very slow machines compared

114
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,219
to the kind that we have today so with

115
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,140
that please welcome Chris Greene Sean

116
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,139
Barrett John miles and Chris hacker

117
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:27,029
so Chris I'll start with you because

118
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,769
you've actually made some slides to this

119
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,500
which I think I made these at 8 a.m.

120
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:35,568
this morning Ellen you are the only

121
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,000
person who's ever brought slides too so

122
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:40,110
why don't you just get a story by giving

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,930
us sort of a little bit of information

124
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,340
about like what where what was your

125
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,340
first encounter with this or what was

126
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,138
the situation like the the period in

127
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,519
time when this sort of work sort of

128
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,650
first started happening from your

129
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,448
perspective so so actually the first

130
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:55,829
time I tried to get something like

131
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,538
texture my working I was working at a

132
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,758
company it doesn't exist anymore called

133
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:02,189
sublogic which was the flight simulator

134
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,830
company I did the a couple of mica

135
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,089
flights and letters and we wanted to get

136
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,589
a little more exciting stuff on the

137
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:10,918
screen we just tried a couple approaches

138
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:13,560
and the first thing I did I did this

139
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,658
really bad texture wrapper that involved

140
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,668
starting a rectangle and recursively

141
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:20,519
subdividing down to the pixel level in

142
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:22,589
the code and then output a 1 or 0 okay

143
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,740
and I managed to get a smiley face on a

144
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:27,839
billboard at a very slow framerate to

145
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,819
tell us a little bit about what so a

146
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,379
flight simulator at that time though

147
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,329
yeah what did it look like before the

148
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,149
texture - oh so this is I guess maybe

149
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:37,589
the second generation of the sub lot

150
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,019
excess Microsoft Flight Simulator where

151
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:41,908
we switched from wire framed everything

152
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,740
actually being solid colored and we had

153
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:46,800
16 different colors in the environment

154
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:51,060
and you know you know hundreds of

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,740
polygons so sometimes you know I think

156
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,030
our I think our plane model you know we

157
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,400
had an exterior plane you could look at

158
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:58,649
I think it I think it was over I think

159
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,568
was over a hundred polygons and we

160
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,579
worked hard to get it to that size and

161
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,848
so largely what you saw

162
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:08,310
there's no guru chaining large you saw

163
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:10,348
just a lot of big blank rings and we

164
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,459
would put vector graphics on the

165
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:13,620
delivery there's a lot of lines and

166
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:16,739
markings to CT something and randomness

167
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,459
in color it didn't look anything like

168
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,620
flying over landscape does and

169
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:24,478
particularly just taking off airports

170
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,759
are full full signs and stuff like

171
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,490
that's actually we wanted that sign

172
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,800
something more important that was

173
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,780
completely impractical it didn't ever

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,579
ship that I tried another one I was

175
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:38,059
trying to get trees or something on the

176
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:39,560
horizon and I guess I'll go way in the

177
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,769
weeds here this is on the Amigo which

178
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,300
had a hardware lined drawer and the way

179
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,250
that hardware lined drawer worked is it

180
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,180
had a pattern register that was you know

181
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,490
to do sniffles or dashing and so what I

182
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,709
did was I I set up a line to draw on the

183
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,870
horizon and I would stuff 16 bits of

184
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:59,120
texture of binary texture into the

185
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,490
pattern register and output like a line

186
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,930
so basically I was running as - I was

187
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,460
mapping it this way he's in a line

188
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,310
drawing hardware and the pattern

189
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:09,409
register - a little more practical if I

190
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,030
understand correctly so using the

191
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,030
hardware line drawing in the Amiga yeah

192
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:18,739
had a number of custom chips over there

193
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:20,209
is a glitter component which was used

194
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,319
for kind of moving bits around I guess

195
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:25,339
it could it could do like a resin hammer

196
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,920
that it was cycle through through every

197
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:30,919
pixel so basically stuff fits into that

198
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,480
and have them show up in Flint okay so

199
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,670
essentially what you do is just draw a

200
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,990
series of lines with the pattern and the

201
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,220
pattern register and that was actually

202
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,350
fast enough but the problem I had was

203
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,270
actually getting the lines - I probably

204
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,560
could make it work now okay but there

205
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:44,000
wouldn't be much to used to make it work

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,569
but I couldn't get the lines to fill the

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,120
space okay gaps okay so this was on the

208
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:51,319
Amiga and you were looking at this sort

209
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,689
of thing and this is generally the

210
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,360
company in general is looking at this

211
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,920
and going we need to figure out ways to

212
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,810
get more visual detail because that

213
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,800
that's the genesis of the why we want to

214
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,750
try and do this yes particularly

215
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,680
particularly landscapes in science now

216
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,269
why did you did anyone there know what

217
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,400
texture mapping was because there is

218
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:11,659
research around yeah there's good can

219
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,310
you give us a little thing about the the

220
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,070
relationship I don't think we ever used

221
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,449
the word texture mapping okay we didn't

222
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,139
ruin again we didn't really understand

223
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:22,370
it the way that I guess a lot of

224
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,399
graphics particularly there were a lot

225
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,230
of ways that may be thicker there we did

226
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,209
the 3d math and transformations and the

227
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:31,580
precision that actually made texture

228
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:33,139
mapping not even if you had a texture

229
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,789
map again we've been hard to fit into

230
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,069
the pipeline because

231
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,959
oh there's a lot of old fixed-point

232
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,240
tricks and I guess I could describe it

233
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,800
as by the time we have a polygon we

234
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,879
don't actually know it's 3d coordinates

235
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,079
and we can't get them back okay because

236
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,360
if you're trying to fit everything in

237
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,910
eight or sixteen bits of precision once

238
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,190
we need a three transform after you've

239
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:57,259
subtracted the origin you can multiply

240
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,030
or shift the result by any old number

241
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:01,159
you want and it's still the same point

242
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,839
on the screen right but it's not

243
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,419
invertible back to what it was before

244
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,530
okay and so our point transform is

245
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,939
always doing that it's always shifting

246
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,289
stuff into in a certain size so we

247
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,310
couldn't actually I couldn't figure how

248
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:11,839
to clip it or do anything like that

249
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:12,799
because it was kind of impossible so

250
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,170
basically what you're saying is that

251
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,279
when you were do cuz I mean I guess the

252
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:19,339
other point we should this is sort of

253
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,129
the discovery of like the floating point

254
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:26,450
math sort of thing is after this point

255
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:34,669
in time yeah I would I mean and this

256
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:36,410
offers originally developed for so the

257
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:40,159
amiga even though the amiga is 16-bit

258
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:42,740
yes not only doing that I mean we're

259
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,929
getting the amiga was amazing because we

260
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,700
had a multiply instruction instead of a

261
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:49,639
giant macro that goes up for four pages

262
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,400
to multiply two numbers is the Bruce

263
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,689
artwork who ran yeah like maybe was so

264
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,250
far ahead like you guys were using

265
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,250
quaternions before anyone even knew it

266
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:07,340
Bruce artworks flight simulator book

267
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,840
from yeah there's a classic old school

268
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,879
would all have you wrote a book guys

269
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:16,009
it's kind of it was a full event down

270
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:17,720
there my computer graphics displays talk

271
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,860
about the Apple and forgive me on

272
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,540
commercial point simulators they'd

273
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,639
worked on and kind of have a lot of

274
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:24,110
esoteric things at the time we used to

275
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,220
joke about the quaternion chapter on

276
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,350
there because like it was the most

277
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,350
impractical useless piece of why did you

278
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,720
put this in there I do understand it why

279
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,129
you know oh it takes more multiplies to

280
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,450
transport by that while you do that

281
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:39,350
versus penned a long time multiplying by

282
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,790
a three by three matrix already okay so

283
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,840
let me pause for a second there so what

284
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:48,829
year is this this would be like

285
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:56,870
okay let me see so 88 let me ask John

286
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:58,490
so in 88 you're at origin yeah when just

287
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,960
so I make sure I kind of oppose it

288
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,889
am I the youngest person on this panel

289
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:15,700
besides you because that's never

290
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:22,159
happened to me I'm 46 yes at what point

291
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:24,650
just so I can at what point did origins

292
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,169
start thinking about 3d graphic stuff so

293
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:30,649
I have that because obviously doing much

294
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:32,779
of ultima stuff was there there was no

295
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,970
3d content and the ultimate is at that

296
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,069
at that point this I was I would have

297
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,620
been working on Altimas 5 transitioning

298
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,680
into Ultima 6 we were finally leaving

299
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:45,259
the Apple 2 behind there was a lot of

300
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:49,069
wailing and gnashing of teeth about that

301
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:51,769
but we got over it the the first the

302
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,540
first appearance of 3d kind of happened

303
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:56,029
shortly after Chris Roberts showed up

304
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:59,120
looking for a looking for someone to

305
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,549
publish a 2d role-playing game that he

306
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,320
was working on oh is this a game that

307
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:04,939
ever got published no that this was a

308
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,640
game called times of lore it's not a

309
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,510
very well known game but it was it was

310
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:14,090
kind of a roguelike

311
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:18,500
okay 2d 2d platformer almost but Chris

312
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,870
really wanted to do a 3d game and he

313
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,279
ended up he ended up pitching Wing

314
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,980
Commander at the execs at origin and no

315
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,569
one really believed it could be done

316
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,539
because you know something like that

317
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,680
almost requires texture mapping and can

318
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,819
you can you give a little bit of a

319
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,339
background for people who didn't see the

320
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,270
original Wing Commander what that

321
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,200
technology was cuz I remember it well we

322
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,779
Wing Commander was kind of an

323
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,480
interesting technological problem

324
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,860
because it wasn't actually it looks it

325
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,500
looks like it was texture mapped it

326
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,090
looks like a you know a game where

327
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,059
you're flying around and you know fully

328
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:58,350
rotated and

329
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:01,139
Aled and oriented bitmapped ships and

330
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:05,100
shooting at other ships you know that

331
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:07,740
look the same way but at the time the I

332
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,050
think a 386 machine was the latest and

333
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,409
greatest thing on the market

334
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:15,719
I remember Chris's Compact 386 20

335
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:17,909
machine I think he paid like fifteen

336
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,060
thousand dollars for that if I remember

337
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:24,449
right basically you know there goes half

338
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:26,669
these royalties from his last game but

339
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,129
but you didn't have you know you did

340
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:31,049
have a multiply instruction but you

341
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:34,200
didn't have much more than that and you

342
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,819
had really slow main memory and you also

343
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,840
more important you had a bunch of people

344
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,700
who really didn't know what they were

345
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:43,740
doing so Chris ended up writing I think

346
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,030
I think it was around fourteen thousand

347
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,990
lines of x86 assembly code to do what's

348
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:54,360
called a forward transform mapper which

349
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,700
which works completely differently from

350
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,379
anything that we've later come to

351
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,940
understand its texture mapping but as

352
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,070
you know conceptually it's another way

353
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,320
to get to the same it's another road to

354
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:08,580
get to the same destination

355
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,220
texture mapping starts with you know do

356
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,629
you need do you want the pen no well

357
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,610
maybe later the the idea is you maps you

358
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,830
map pixels on the screen back to source

359
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,570
pixels in your texture that's what

360
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,950
everybody tends to think of it's texture

361
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,240
mapping and that's that's what you might

362
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:29,820
call inverse mapping forward mapping has

363
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,769
some advantages in that you're stepping

364
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,870
through each you know basically

365
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:36,449
horizontal line in your source artwork

366
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:40,580
and figuring out where it goes on the

367
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:42,740
screen so this ends up being faster for

368
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,759
shapes that have a lot of transparency

369
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,259
because you don't spend a lot of time

370
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,870
jumping around pixels that you're not

371
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:51,000
drawing but it but it turned it

372
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,190
inevitably turns into just this

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,799
hellacious collection of special cases

374
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,810
which is why it was like 14,000 lines

375
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:00,120
and why he looked like he was ready to

376
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:05,000
you know bring into Z to the office you

377
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,000
know he was really on the edge there

378
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:10,179
so that was kind of the first attempt at

379
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,578
texture mapping and it was wildly

380
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:15,219
successful but it's it doesn't

381
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:17,528
generalize as well as as true you know

382
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,528
tech inverse transform texture mapping

383
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:22,448
and that was that was whom we started

384
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:23,889
looking at the strike commander

385
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:25,929
technology that came after Wing

386
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:28,240
Commander and that would have been in

387
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:31,539
there in the very late 80s early 90s

388
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,120
okay so now that I've got this to go

389
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:35,379
through and also so when were the

390
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,879
texture mapping articles Chris because

391
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:39,309
those are kind of the Cap'n's like here

392
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,720
we've come April 95 okay so this is

393
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:44,888
there's a pretty big span of time

394
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,810
actually this is like from okay it's

395
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:48,278
actually seven years before it's kind of

396
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,659
what was it what was SGI doing at the

397
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:52,480
time they had harder text me oh yeah

398
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:54,458
yeah like really nice filtered like a it

399
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,579
was known how to do all these things you

400
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:58,899
just couldn't you didn't have the Flexi

401
00:15:57,578 --> 00:16:00,818
better hardware at the time had texture

402
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:02,769
mapping but it was essentially done on

403
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:05,588
video scan out those machines right

404
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,959
didn't even have polygon rendering right

405
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,850
but towards the early 90s they got they

406
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,888
got extra metal trying yes and iris or

407
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,509
whatever yeah okay towards way anything

408
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,409
I think the early 90s literally means

409
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:16,360
yeah it was right around that time

410
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:18,039
because they I mean we just didn't know

411
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,539
any of those people and we didn't pay

412
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,169
any attention to them and so they knew

413
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:23,259
exactly what they were doing

414
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:26,948
mathematical bit about that actually

415
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:31,539
anybody who's like yeah at that time and

416
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:33,219
possibly the Internet the relationships

417
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:35,318
community so I guess you're saying is

418
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,850
there there were people who had done the

419
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,860
research on this sort of stuff for

420
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,180
hardware or none of the books avila

421
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I would just read that I hadn't read my

422
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:43,028
articles since April 95 Vince I'm sorry

423
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,899
I was while you were trying to get the

424
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,250
PowerPoint of you were going I was like

425
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:48,309
oh I better read some of this and

426
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,078
the beginning talks about the lack of

427
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:51,188
information in books like bullying Van

428
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,649
Damme didn't really cover it very well

429
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:56,528
and it this is Sean subtly without

430
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,789
naming it no no my articles do because

431
00:16:56,528 --> 00:17:00,698
it's like and you can get these text

432
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:01,629
files off like x2 FDP dot oh you like

433
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:04,809
but they're totally incomprehensible

434
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:07,170
with no working code that's John

435
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,819
we didn't know each other at the time

436
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,900
when did you first post the text all

437
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,169
because I'm gonna talk about that later

438
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,170
as well

439
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:18,339
okay so who's that post my name's

440
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:20,949
underworld yes after underworld yeah cuz

441
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,809
it was about the underworld I got into

442
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:26,590
it because of unrest okay these are

443
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:28,089
their LG then I was contracting okay

444
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:32,379
so let's jump back then now so we're

445
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:35,049
good okay so we're in 1988 we are

446
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:41,040
looking for ways to add sort of more

447
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:45,069
detail to the flight simulator yeah and

448
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,109
essentially we at this sort of similar

449
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,939
times people in other industries have

450
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:52,689
been working on tech fire stuff but in

451
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:54,100
general like why is there no understand

452
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,600
there's because you don't even

453
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:56,889
necessarily know that these other people

454
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,419
are working on the sorts of things or

455
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,470
even who you would ask kind of stuff

456
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,910
like give me a little bit about that

457
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,200
because most people can't probably

458
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,509
relate to that because nowadays you just

459
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,279
type in an internet and go right yeah I

460
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:08,319
mean so I mean you're talking about

461
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,750
getting information yeah all my graphics

462
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,669
information at the time I had to get on

463
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,559
my bicycle and drive to Stanford library

464
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,759
and start xeroxing stuff which I

465
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,929
couldn't even generally couldn't even

466
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,309
find I was looking for so I literally

467
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,930
just go and just look through journals

468
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:21,429
and Xerox well I'd come back with a pile

469
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,200
of whatever looked interesting yeah at

470
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,610
the same time and then I didn't have the

471
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
math background to figure out most of it

472
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:29,529
so I would just stare at it over and

473
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,939
over again to like I think that I think

474
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,980
John mentioned that earlier which is

475
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,420
like there's the like oh yeah this

476
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,890
hardware was crap and blah blah but also

477
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,380
we just had no idea what we're doing and

478
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,700
I would be really interesting given the

479
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,520
math knowledge that's pretty standard

480
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:47,559
among engine programmers now to go back

481
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:49,119
with the shitty hardware the important

482
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,009
thing back then was that we weren't any

483
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,579
good at math yeah but neither were

484
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,579
computers

485
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,569
hold-hold goal for you know from the

486
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,399
morning when you got to work you know

487
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:03,710
from the from the time when you leave at

488
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:07,250
night is to figure out a way to avoid

489
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,860
doing math but you can avoid doing math

490
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,779
by knowing math which couldn't you back

491
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,909
things we didn't know enough now to some

492
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,710
extent yeah but but but but it but also

493
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,330
I mean you don't spend a lot of time if

494
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,100
you don't know the right way to do it

495
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:23,559
you don't spend a lot of time beating

496
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:23,559
your head against the machine to do it

497
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:46,370
away from there's an anecdote from the

498
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,200
forum enacting books the numerical

499
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:50,659
methods that usually work book where

500
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,160
he's like these engineers came over to

501
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,960
the beginning like they had to invert an

502
00:19:52,160 --> 00:20:01,070
8x8 matrix over back then in the 40s was

503
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:05,110
like oh my god yeah well they were using

504
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:05,109
rooms of computers which were women and

505
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:12,259
so they so he they came to him as the

506
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,029
numerical analysis guy and he was like

507
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:15,500
they're like we need help with this

508
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:17,240
we're not he can't keep it stayed over

509
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,220
what do we do about this matrix and they

510
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,230
he does a bunch of math and he's like

511
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,920
okay well wait a second it was

512
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,910
orthogonal like it was like he's like

513
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,560
wait the inverses they said they

514
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,000
inverted on the like it takes hundreds

515
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,319
of hours computer time he's like notices

516
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,180
this thing is like if you just had like

517
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,889
actually write out the equation okay so

518
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,180
that kind of thing happens a lot once

519
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,770
you've got the overarching math

520
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,170
knowledge and so I think you could go

521
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,910
back to these texts Ram is way better

522
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,490
well the other thing too one one thing

523
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,330
that's kind of interesting about it is

524
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:56,329
sometimes having a lack of knowledge

525
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:59,029
does lead you to a solution corpus

526
00:20:56,329 --> 00:21:00,980
callosum and like I think there's a

527
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,599
chance that some of us might have

528
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,849
rejected with the solutions we came up

529
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:07,019
with as to imprecise right never work

530
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:09,250
it's - right right

531
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,629
looks way better than nothing yeah yeah

532
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,250
I think that's also a part of the

533
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,450
problem here too is defining what you're

534
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,250
trying to achieve is difficult because

535
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,930
if you look at old games they're super

536
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,670
shuddery and shaky and what I think it

537
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,990
but it's still that's as good as it

538
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,039
could look at the time you know it's

539
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,509
like Christmas saying we just wanted

540
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,369
duffle you scream like that just like

541
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:27,400
you like that line it's kind of grass as

542
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:29,199
long as it moves in 3d I was looking for

543
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,450
screenshots from car and driver this

544
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,150
morning with it some texture mapping on

545
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,190
them and mostly what I saw is like

546
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:40,960
patterns of like colored guys like super

547
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:43,930
low resolution screen but it's so ok so

548
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,269
let's keep going so in 88 looking for

549
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,220
that right you tried sounds like what

550
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:52,319
you've tried doing first is taking

551
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,670
rectangles and subdividing them so yeah

552
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,740
processor if you can remember lecture

553
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,900
was why was that what your guys because

554
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,279
it's because a picture is a rectangle

555
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,630
like a bitmap is a rectangle like how

556
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,859
did what are you trying to do well so

557
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,300
again I've got I've got a

558
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:06,519
two-dimensional image which in the quad

559
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:13,599
and I've got a quad of three dimensional

560
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:15,069
quad and screen and I'm like how could

561
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,319
you even figure out which pixel would go

562
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:31,059
where I know the ones that are in

563
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:34,539
between a verge to find the middle pixel

564
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:38,470
yeah yeah is my rectangle smaller and a

565
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:39,549
pixel right so never occurred to you

566
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,319
like oh it wouldn't actually be the

567
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:42,669
center pixel no I know I know I mean I

568
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:47,259
was wondering even what I would see

569
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:49,090
right yeah but did you know that it was

570
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:52,539
gonna be wrong perspective warp wise or

571
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:54,069
no I drew pictures I said oh well of

572
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:56,079
course no perspective work because these

573
00:22:54,069 --> 00:23:00,759
these edges will shrink and a central

574
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:05,319
still be tall so don't look like that if

575
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:06,640
you've got like I mean everybody in the

576
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,200
room sever's people facing exactly

577
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,580
forward I mean the side of the screen is

578
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,590
smaller than this side of everything on

579
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:13,240
this side and like if you subdivide the

580
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:15,289
screen right in half it's not gonna be

581
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,789
halfway through the quad that is

582
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:18,319
the texture your mapping because their

583
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:19,539
perspective is happening the thing that

584
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,740
the same thing that makes it smaller

585
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:25,750
shifts everything in a certain direction

586
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,559
and this was I guess this was unknown

587
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,859
because you're sort of thinking of

588
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:36,589
moving just sort of putting this work

589
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:38,809
see it cuz the thing right but in I mean

590
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:40,039
it's kind of like the it's kind of like

591
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:41,299
the quaternion thing that you were like

592
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:44,869
you thinkin just average these because

593
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:46,970
that's what the worms not that bad the

594
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:50,119
one is visual you detected a lot more

595
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:52,250
than say of rotation so so continue so

596
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:53,809
you tried that and it works it sounds

597
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,119
like but it's part of the purpose is it

598
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:59,509
saying yeah I showed it to people it's

599
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:02,349
about and then when was the next time

600
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:04,910
you tried I tried the booter thing okay

601
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:07,869
targeting explicitly drawing some hills

602
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,310
or something on the horizon yes I was

603
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:12,199
that's true did you try and pile up

604
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:13,250
lines yeah okay that's what you're

605
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,720
saying you're getting games you didn't

606
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,869
know how to likes offset it right yeah

607
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,220
yeah again I'll go back and go on the

608
00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:25,519
emulator so I'll see if I can make it

609
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:27,110
work because I think I left there I said

610
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,960
a couple of items there and I went out

611
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:31,579
and I worked moved to California worked

612
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,720
for this guy Ned Lerner who was doing a

613
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,500
lot of games I'm sure a lot of you've

614
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,069
heard of him he was one of the

615
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,269
cofounders of Looking Glass and I worked

616
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:43,069
on flight Sims for him for a while and

617
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:48,109
then started doing a not very cold car

618
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:50,779
and driver not good we were trying to

619
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:52,699
get better graphics in it and we wanted

620
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:54,379
lane markings but the big thing was with

621
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,150
the VGA came out because we've been

622
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,310
working the PC the games under before

623
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,280
were these 16-bit color 16 color games

624
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:03,289
and particularly not even the number of

625
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,240
colors but they gotta push me to motive

626
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:06,710
that palette could you you could set a

627
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,019
pallet you said 16 fix colors but

628
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:13,009
another system you it was designed to

629
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:15,589
write scan lines yeah sequential blocks

630
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:17,059
of constant of the same color like it's

631
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:19,159
almost like they designed it to fill

632
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,200
polygons they didn't but it was very

633
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,330
good at feeling solid polygons today and

634
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,970
so particularly there was this crossing

635
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:27,710
point when the VGA came out so EGA

636
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,329
everything before that all the if it

637
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,048
seems

638
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:34,269
you never did any graphics where you did

639
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:35,918
instructions for individual pixels okay

640
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:37,628
you bleed you shifted some bits and

641
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,459
you're right eight pixels on the EGA you

642
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:42,638
wrote to one register and outcome for

643
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:44,229
pixels etc and it was you know it's kind

644
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:46,449
of impractical the process there's a lot

645
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:49,058
of pixels on the screen the six five or

646
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,830
two only is a one megahertz processor my

647
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:53,558
pictures don't wait do it the the

648
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:55,569
original IBM PC has nowhere near but

649
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:57,729
eventually the to a six and the VGA

650
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:00,098
meant that you kind of had to do one

651
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:07,328
instruction per pixel yeah that's them

652
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:09,519
anyway because their bytes so so

653
00:26:07,328 --> 00:26:10,959
basically you know you've nowadays you

654
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,638
kind of think of the graphics card is

655
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:15,099
something you sort of ship instructions

656
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:17,408
and stuff over to it does some work but

657
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:19,479
of course at that time the graphics card

658
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,249
that's in say a PC of some kind is

659
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:23,139
really just something that you're kind

660
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:24,909
of writing to meant the CPU itself is

661
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:27,699
running to memory on the card directly

662
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:29,349
and that writing is happening like a

663
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,239
pixel at a time like I need to set this

664
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:33,759
pixel to this color and this color and

665
00:26:31,239 --> 00:26:37,808
just so you were sort of saying the EGA

666
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:39,399
style or the pre pre VGA yeah you when

667
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:41,288
you did that right to the card you had

668
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,338
to fill a bunch of pixels at a time

669
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:48,969
because that's the way it just got

670
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:50,708
central yeah and yeah and so once you're

671
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:52,538
on the VGA and you maybe have like a

672
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,278
simple memory fill operation that

673
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,118
forever 16 if every pixel in there and

674
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:57,249
you start to think well I could probably

675
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:59,618
fit another instruction in there and one

676
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:01,028
or two more and so we tried to do some

677
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,009
stuff the first thing we did was uh a

678
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:04,569
lot of games of this I don't know I

679
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:07,269
don't think we're the first on this at

680
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:09,428
all but we did scaling where you could

681
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:11,259
basically take an image and size it on

682
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:15,099
the screen directly and we would use

683
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:16,358
that for we used it for clouds we did it

684
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:18,128
doesn't really work in a 3d game because

685
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:19,769
as soon as you start yeah like that but

686
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:22,418
that was our first thing and we

687
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:24,638
basically iterated from that like wait

688
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,519
we could do Goro shading okay because

689
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:30,458
that's only that's only maybe one extra

690
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,108
instruction an ad in a store and cut and

691
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:33,149
then we realize we could maybe do bitmap

692
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:36,118
rotation

693
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:37,439
and at that point it looked like a few

694
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:39,569
more tweaks and just texture mapping

695
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,979
before reverse mapping the bitmap

696
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:46,648
rotation we did we did reverse mapping

697
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:49,558
all the time so instant our bitmap we

698
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:51,898
had high speed bitmap scaling I mean

699
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,190
this is producing itself you know so you

700
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:55,079
gotta you gotta mention your scale to

701
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,929
screen it's still a rectangle all the

702
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:00,509
lines are so straight particularly every

703
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:03,179
lie every scanline its output is either

704
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:05,038
if you're scaling up some of the lines

705
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,109
are copies of the line that you scale

706
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,749
before so when you're scaling up you can

707
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:10,798
save a lot of perf there yes but you're

708
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:12,389
gonna be the scaling pattern where

709
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,128
you're in a sampling like oh I grabbed

710
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:15,478
this pixel that I skipped this one when

711
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:17,278
I grab the next to it and that's gonna

712
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:19,950
be the same pattern on every line and so

713
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:24,028
we wrote so much silver code that

714
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:26,278
basically generated a set of assembly

715
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:28,288
code to generate a cell firing code to

716
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,579
output one line in the current scale

717
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,408
thing and then it would just jump back

718
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,428
to it so let's talk about that for a

719
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,109
second because that's actually something

720
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:35,700
that I totally failed to think about but

721
00:28:34,108 --> 00:28:38,009
it was very common at that time so

722
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,808
nowadays typically because of the way

723
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:42,960
processors work you generally don't want

724
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,940
to change code on the fly because they

725
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,298
have processor cache and all these sorts

726
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,798
of things

727
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:49,469
I'm sorry instruction cache on the

728
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,638
processor so typically when you write

729
00:28:49,469 --> 00:28:52,288
code we think of it as just we write

730
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:53,579
code you know you compile it or whatever

731
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:56,819
and that's the code that's going to run

732
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:58,259
but of course that's because we have all

733
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,269
of these things like hey you know

734
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,700
instructions are cheap enough that if

735
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:04,739
you just have if statements in there or

736
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,889
variables in there that you're accessing

737
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:10,950
it's okay at that time like literally

738
00:29:07,888 --> 00:29:13,558
every little tiny thing you might do was

739
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,659
a cost and so one of the things that

740
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,729
people did and I guess I don't know this

741
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,929
probably predates I don't know when this

742
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:20,548
started being a common thing but

743
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:21,719
self-modifying codes to big deal writing

744
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:24,088
something that would just output the

745
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:26,609
instructions to do a specific bitmap

746
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:28,108
scale rather than a general bitmap scale

747
00:29:26,608 --> 00:29:29,908
would be common so is that was that

748
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:33,478
something you guys have done before or

749
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:34,830
no all right so so basically like this

750
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:36,989
is thing we sat down got you got a

751
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:38,278
bitmap scaling let's just work through

752
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:40,829
the prop like how did how does that

753
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:42,719
process go you just know it was more

754
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:45,228
like we thought about bit mo scaling and

755
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:45,229
thought it was Impractical

756
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:52,858
this okay again we were targeting we

757
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:54,538
were the three six was a high-end chip

758
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,978
that some developers would buy for

759
00:29:54,538 --> 00:30:00,229
developed systems the systems we are

760
00:29:55,979 --> 00:30:00,229
targeting were not eighty three sixes

761
00:30:01,128 --> 00:30:04,798
okay

762
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:06,298
let's know once we said wait a minute it

763
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,940
could probably be fast enough if we did

764
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:11,158
that that we did it okay

765
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,869
similarly talking more about the

766
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,399
hardware the time n shinned we did Goro

767
00:30:12,868 --> 00:30:16,558
she a ting that's that's really simple

768
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:19,978
it wasn't even hard then except for one

769
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,348
thing so nowadays you have when your

770
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:24,239
screen is let's you have any RGB pixel

771
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:26,278
you want any location you want you just

772
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,838
say what color you want you get it the

773
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:30,148
VGA is a chip where you have to six

774
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:32,848
dollars period on the screen total end

775
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:36,418
of sentence and you can decide what TV

776
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:39,298
six you wanted people to choose from but

777
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:40,169
that you and so you could map images and

778
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:42,058
they didn't look really good at

779
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:43,769
necessary it's it's a good compression

780
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,838
thing but it makes it really hard to do

781
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:48,210
calculations involving color you can't

782
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:50,460
say a color 120

783
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,528
you know I've what color is red plus a

784
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,200
little bit of blue you can only do that

785
00:30:52,528 --> 00:30:57,419
by either making lots of mapping tables

786
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,278
or having your pallet be all black

787
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:05,339
people would take their pallet and make

788
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:07,079
it just shades of 16 different colors at

789
00:31:05,338 --> 00:31:09,148
that time all colors were palletized

790
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,189
meaning a color was just an index into a

791
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:12,449
table and that index may have no

792
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,919
relationship to what the color actually

793
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,259
was so you couldn't just take two colors

794
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,690
and blend them together you had to take

795
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:22,019
two color indices if you wanted you

796
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,548
can't lend them together so John was

797
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:30,628
saying like there was no performance to

798
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:33,019
do actual set up these pilots so that

799
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:35,428
they happen to have correspondence or

800
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:38,429
big tables so like underworld had this

801
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,109
thing where it would darken the texture

802
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,669
mapping farther away and it worked by

803
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:43,888
having a bunch of three six entry tables

804
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,769
that were like Oh in this in the palette

805
00:31:43,888 --> 00:31:48,629
the closest color to 25% dimmer the net

806
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,859
color is this one I got

807
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,140
would do that so you kind of look up

808
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:53,669
into the table I have this color what's

809
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,120
the what's this slightly dimmer version

810
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,350
of it and if your palates no it's not

811
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,459
guaranteed to work there would not be a

812
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,409
color that bad but it would just give

813
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,850
you the best yeah I've seen that table

814
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,740
is filled you are that makes that color

815
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:07,500
that we would generate it but someone

816
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,750
had I think our palates people generally

817
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,710
did not choose like I'll make a perfect

818
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:15,119
palate for a game they choose something

819
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:21,750
like 16 green yeah wouldn't exactly Bank

820
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:23,339
dammit correct so somebody would you

821
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,599
generate the darker color but then an

822
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:26,009
artist would go and go like that color

823
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:27,929
is not as good as this other choice or

824
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:35,279
or they don't remember actually I think

825
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:39,240
we just generated in code because at

826
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,879
that point got the bitmap scaling going

827
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,099
yeah and you're sort of like well okay

828
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,870
now well if that's fast enough maybe

829
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,399
what else is fast enough it sort of

830
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:49,079
sounded like yeah so it's kind of like

831
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,120
this mutation of loops where okay wait I

832
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,250
can add rotation to the scalar okay wait

833
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,689
this it's kind of doing two indices now

834
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,039
I could probably could do a little

835
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,509
fancier with that and realizing that

836
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,519
could probably map so it's kind of like

837
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:01,650
a slow step by step process of like oh

838
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,269
well that was fast enough what how can i

839
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,560
it sort of starts with one working

840
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:06,210
example of something that's the most

841
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,009
basic thing and then it it adds a little

842
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:11,009
feature as it goes to see how far I can

843
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:13,259
get okay so what ended up shipping in

844
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:14,789
Car and Driver then so in the car driver

845
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:17,490
we shipped all those things a lot of

846
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:19,879
signs a lot of billboards we tried to

847
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:22,859
put markings on the roads but it wasn't

848
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,410
you know so those guys so if you

849
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:27,299
actually those games use large a lot of

850
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,310
same code that an underworld uses the

851
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,299
same kind of kernels mostly oh really

852
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,679
there's operations yeah Ultima

853
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,599
Underworld and current drivers yeah I

854
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,060
was actually working on current driver

855
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,079
and contracting for a single looking

856
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,099
glass for that and we were selling

857
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:43,470
basically the tech from car driver that

858
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:45,209
basically the texture mapping went off

859
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,860
there was in our assembly language the

860
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,630
engine was taken and put into their

861
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,709
engine so the engine the underlying

862
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,410
engines are very different from each

863
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,600
other but but just a couple of things

864
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,009
yeah interesting okay oh no actually no

865
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,709
bunch of the engine was in there too but

866
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,700
there's this we had this we decided to

867
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,380
kind of base on what we did for flight

868
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,750
simmers which is kind of like your map

869
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,790
format is more like looks like an

870
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:09,059
assembly language file meaning that like

871
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:10,739
there's these up codes like oh if the

872
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:14,429
camera is outside of this region then

873
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:16,500
jump here or 12 this object here and it

874
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:20,070
had all done it so Blahnik by literally

875
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:22,679
my hand okay and it's it's pretty

876
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,090
effective no we in line rule so it's

877
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,550
full it's for like what's a drawn for

878
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:31,590
what but but then under world wanted to

879
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,240
have you know it's okay for fighting we

880
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,429
used a lot of digitized data and Leslie

881
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,049
Heights and stuff but you know

882
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,840
underworld wanting to have a map and a

883
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:42,919
map editor in particular and a map

884
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,720
better to let you change things that

885
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:49,619
just a lot of something not suit up for

886
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,569
that so essentially that and it had

887
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,859
stuff like occlusion yeah we didn't

888
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,570
worry about what was in front of what

889
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,539
about collusion in our games because

890
00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:00,210
mostly was the ground okay and so that

891
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:02,009
was you so basically the the sea and an

892
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:07,500
underworld was changed to generate the

893
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:10,190
opcode stuff what when is so let's let's

894
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,449
jump back to origin here for a second so

895
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,980
what's going on with you sort of we're

896
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:15,809
starting to talk about the strike

897
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,639
commander stuff what where does that

898
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:19,799
line up with Ultima Underworld its

899
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:21,869
release well the big the big thing you

900
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,450
have to keep in mind about what we were

901
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:26,190
doing on strike commander was there's a

902
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:28,049
big difference there's a wide gulf

903
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,789
between what we're calling a fine

904
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:34,010
mapping of keen mapping i'm not sure how

905
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:36,840
you say it and perspective mapping

906
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,790
perspective mapping is what you need if

907
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,309
you want to draw one polygon that shows

908
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:45,980
perspective across you know the single

909
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:48,420
polygonal surface it's much harder

910
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,369
needless to say almost needless to say

911
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,960
it's much harder to do that than it is

912
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:55,799
to just do a simple two-dimensional

913
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,720
bresenhem's solver to to do a simple 2-d

914
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,010
affine map like life flight simulators

915
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:04,169
tended to do we were able to get the the

916
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:07,070
inner loop and strike commanders texture

917
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:11,340
mapper down to like eight or nine cycles

918
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:14,610
on a on an early early pinion or late

919
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:17,900
486 class machine but the

920
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,620
the per pixel divide instruction they

921
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,750
classically you would want for a

922
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,759
perspective mapper that alone would have

923
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:27,469
probably taken four times that time that

924
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,960
that much time just just to do the / Z

925
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:34,559
at each pixel so it just wasn't going to

926
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,940
happen and that's why I mean when you

927
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,820
have to remember that Ultima Underworld

928
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,490
came out around the same time as doom I

929
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:45,330
guess it was how much later was it the

930
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:47,519
world was 92 him was 93 okay was first

931
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:49,590
yeah underworld was actually first and

932
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,710
what was amazing about that is that it

933
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:55,320
was almost right it almost actually had

934
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:58,769
full perspective mapping you know Chris

935
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:03,930
cheated by doing it perspective and and

936
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:04,949
I guess direction but not in it if you

937
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,230
go back and play Ultima Underworld

938
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:09,299
you'll and then position yourself next

939
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,860
to a wall you get this crazy warping

940
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,539
event which some of you may have noticed

941
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,039
too is that not just a street a fine

942
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:22,050
mapper it was something weird it was I

943
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:24,090
thought we would subdivide in 3d it

944
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,740
would do this thing for walls where I

945
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:32,910
would actually calculate the column

946
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:35,879
right there in columns right but I kind

947
00:37:32,909 --> 00:37:37,529
of I didn't even understand actually how

948
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,510
to solve for what columns how the

949
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:41,340
inverse map that so I had this thing

950
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,200
where I'm like wow I know what I'll do

951
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,390
this only matters when things have blown

952
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,369
up right because they're small it's not

953
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,960
that effects not that big so I basically

954
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,130
forward mapped it because I knew how to

955
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,710
divide I knew how to do perspective

956
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:56,760
divides but know how to invert first of

957
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,250
all let's start with one thing which is

958
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,750
that yet so the interesting thing here

959
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,510
is you mentioned doom

960
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:07,380
so doom does not allow you to

961
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,820
effectively correct it but you can't

962
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,240
turn your head right so they think that

963
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,890
kind of line that's a classic Carmack

964
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,250
thing which is like those general

965
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:16,250
problems

966
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,960
we were still at a point in time right

967
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,150
when you warned by not doing man right

968
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,670
so that's completely different now it

969
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,490
was a great knee of the curve like yes I

970
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,809
mean totally the opposite thing which is

971
00:38:29,489 --> 00:38:32,819
like no we have to be able to walk

972
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,199
through this dungeon yes and like you

973
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,460
know you're walking you're high heads

974
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,169
bobbing you look everywhere because

975
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,150
there's that's why I thought those of us

976
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:41,639
who were in the industry were more blown

977
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,410
away by I mean we were blown away by

978
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,989
both doom and underworld but I

979
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:47,759
personally was like having actually

980
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:50,489
tried some of this I was more impressed

981
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,710
by underworld just because they were you

982
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:55,618
know so much earlier than anyone else

983
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,449
doing they were just different I mean it

984
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,530
was an interesting of engineering

985
00:38:57,449 --> 00:39:00,029
approach to do different things I mean

986
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:06,780
under well if you recall was also a tiny

987
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:09,240
window or on a 320 yeah under well just

988
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,590
to be clear on that so in Doom they

989
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:11,969
solve this problem by just fixing the

990
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:15,990
screen and the reason that that's

991
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:17,759
important just you know is if you know

992
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:19,739
that all of your perspective changes

993
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,480
happen in vertical lines obviously you

994
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:24,118
can make a bunch of optimizations in

995
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,039
terms of what you're doing but in

996
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,510
underworld you could turn your head for

997
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,969
real so though the world would rotate

998
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,680
like a modern 3d game rotates which now

999
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:33,750
means that the texture mapper has to

1000
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,429
handle anything it can't assume that

1001
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,800
vertical lines are where the perspective

1002
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:38,819
goes if you care about the perspective

1003
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,250
warping you know the thing is in a

1004
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,539
dungeon crawler both do more this the

1005
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,980
closer you get to the wall the worse the

1006
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,599
affine because the more the distortion

1007
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,889
happens so you just get this like it

1008
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,029
looked like the wall was about flight

1009
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:53,039
simulator which is a bunch of polygons

1010
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,470
on a 3d object the vertices are going to

1011
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,659
be correct so rotating like spaceship or

1012
00:39:55,469 --> 00:40:00,239
or airplane doesn't matter issues a

1013
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:04,139
plane mapping you don't care so but so

1014
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:05,789
it's just impact that so the the problem

1015
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:07,739
when you're looking up and down is now

1016
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:09,539
you don't have these convenience sort of

1017
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:11,159
vertical lines of perspective change so

1018
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,079
when you're doing the mapper for this

1019
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:15,089
yeah they wanted unpack those things

1020
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,710
you're saying you tried so you've got

1021
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,820
these sort of large wall tiles cuz again

1022
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,470
everything at this time has to be very

1023
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,330
low poly because the whole but just the

1024
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:22,829
transforms of the vertices costs you

1025
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:25,739
plenty of work as well so you can't

1026
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:26,969
afford to just have really densely

1027
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:28,259
tessellate stuff because that would have

1028
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,849
solved the problem as well right yeah

1029
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,810
super density tessellated genomics

1030
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,969
would've been fine but then you'd get

1031
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:35,219
killed by the transfer so here you've

1032
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:37,079
got large polygons on the screen you're

1033
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:38,639
trying to sort of get rid of the warping

1034
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,099
that happens there which but you're not

1035
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,569
really necessarily sure exactly I'm not

1036
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,849
exactly sure of where all the warping

1037
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,080
culture I remember it commanded I

1038
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:49,429
remember drawing a piece of graph paper

1039
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,019
and drawing walls and columns on it and

1040
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:53,969
convincing myself that it wasn't a fine

1041
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:57,630
vertically and it was only close there

1042
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:58,829
were some warping there it seems a lot

1043
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,329
more complicated than what I was

1044
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:02,969
assuming I was assuming that you were

1045
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:06,269
always prospectively correct at the the

1046
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:08,069
scanline endpoints because of doing

1047
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:10,380
clipping in 3d actually that helped a

1048
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:11,820
lot because essentially you know you got

1049
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,990
your polygons there halfway off the

1050
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,970
screen you've got to find the corner

1051
00:41:12,989 --> 00:41:16,709
points and a lot of people would do 2d

1052
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:18,719
clipping or hybrid ones where they would

1053
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,530
just kind of like skip you know if some

1054
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,239
probably goes a little bit off the

1055
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,530
screen they don't 3d clip it they just

1056
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:26,479
don't draw the pixels that are off the

1057
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,480
screen but because the texture mapping

1058
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:33,360
then you and equipping if you do that so

1059
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,360
the clipping is actually perfectly

1060
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,950
mathematically correct absolutely but

1061
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,840
this but what ends up on the screen

1062
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:41,369
isn't and so you get these effects where

1063
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,690
imagine there's a wall like this and

1064
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:45,449
it's just sliding off the edge of the

1065
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:47,460
screen and it's it's not quite mapped

1066
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,389
it's got perspective distortion the

1067
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:55,800
problem is that perspective distortion

1068
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:58,469
starts shifting and so we would suddenly

1069
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,820
would take large polygons we'd feel a

1070
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:01,049
big wall like that the first thing I

1071
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,820
would do is I'd say wait there's a big

1072
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,720
wall it's close to the eye that's the

1073
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,630
thing that always looks bad I don't

1074
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:08,939
quite know why but did you guys have UV

1075
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,340
coordinates yeah we did and so I would

1076
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,630
take that and cut into four polygons cuz

1077
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,370
like Sean's original paper didn't have

1078
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,400
you recorded another breakthrough

1079
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:22,230
conceptually was the idea of like I have

1080
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:24,000
the texture what's it yeah yeah this

1081
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,230
idea of like there's you don't have to

1082
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,429
use UV cords you can use a plane

1083
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,429
equation that just describes where all

1084
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:30,839
the pixels are right but I'm just saying

1085
00:42:29,429 --> 00:42:34,829
we didn't understand the math yeah and

1086
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,930
that was a great point was yeah to just

1087
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:39,230
approach it from at

1088
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:40,639
yeah okay so yeah let's so I just want

1089
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,838
to finish this the straight grain apart

1090
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,308
as well though there it's so Shaq

1091
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:47,900
remembers later that wasn't it his way

1092
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:49,430
post later than what oh wait I'm trying

1093
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,039
to place you're saying 46 and Pentium

1094
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:55,399
it's just way before way after we win

1095
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:59,569
commandership tried as as the the 486 is

1096
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,769
work coming out I remember no Wing

1097
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:02,329
Commander I guess would have been around

1098
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:04,579
91 or so yes that would have been a

1099
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:07,818
little pre-owned yeah yeah strike

1100
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:12,318
commander took a long time for reasons

1101
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:13,308
unrelated to texture map it's funny you

1102
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:15,349
say that because it's hard to actually

1103
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:17,690
like it was just the topic you talked

1104
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:19,640
about like you'd be at GDC see GDC back

1105
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,900
then and you betta dinner table with a

1106
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,159
bunch of people and all you talked about

1107
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,048
was texture mapping like okay so we

1108
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:31,338
tried this other than literally the only

1109
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:32,420
problem to solve in yes just so can you

1110
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:35,328
just give us a little bit of background

1111
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,150
because we really talked about how did

1112
00:43:35,329 --> 00:43:41,240
that come about right so you had chris

1113
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,068
roberts had done the crazy 14,000 line

1114
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:45,048
of code affine mapper for wing commander

1115
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:46,068
that shipped I guess potentially a

1116
00:43:45,048 --> 00:43:47,028
little bit before underworld or

1117
00:43:46,068 --> 00:43:48,230
something but obviously has nothing to

1118
00:43:47,028 --> 00:43:51,440
do with the sort of stuff that under was

1119
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,699
doing I guess sort of a little bit more

1120
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,230
like the stuff that was doing a current

1121
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:56,719
driver even though the algorithms were

1122
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,579
different so now you're looking at that

1123
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,989
and going we want to do real 3d I guess

1124
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:01,730
because I guess the thing we didn't talk

1125
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:03,169
about with Wing Commander is with Wing

1126
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,059
Commander yeah you can you can rotate

1127
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,670
the sprites this way and you can scale

1128
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:10,760
them but you can't do anything in you

1129
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:15,548
know rotate this way so what have you

1130
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:18,170
had to capture all these pre based on

1131
00:44:15,548 --> 00:44:20,179
vector to the ship that you're rendering

1132
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:21,950
so what would happen there is you'd see

1133
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:23,568
these you know as the you know be

1134
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:28,368
super smooth rotating this way and then

1135
00:44:23,568 --> 00:44:30,858
a so I assumed is that the impetus

1136
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:32,358
behind sort of this I talked a little

1137
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:33,769
bit like what you were trying to do how

1138
00:44:32,358 --> 00:44:36,139
you approached it what happened there

1139
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,519
around the same time I think if I

1140
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:38,608
remember right LucasArts

1141
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,009
had

1142
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:44,788
game that actually did full texture

1143
00:44:41,009 --> 00:44:46,679
mapping first it didn't have all the

1144
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:50,609
nice shading options and other options

1145
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:52,588
but it basically was like a bucket of

1146
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:54,568
cold water in Chris's face he wanted his

1147
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:56,759
he wanted to do this space game first

1148
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:58,889
and he was he was happy with it as he

1149
00:44:56,759 --> 00:45:00,659
should have been but for doing his

1150
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:03,088
combat simulator follow-up to Wing

1151
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:04,558
Commander he once he saw the I think it

1152
00:45:03,088 --> 00:45:07,469
was it secret weapons of the Luftwaffe

1153
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,329
something like that yeah once he saw

1154
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:11,338
that you realized that you know we're

1155
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:12,960
gonna have to go to texture mapping or

1156
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:15,318
you know this is you know our cool

1157
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,829
combat simulator is gonna look like crap

1158
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:21,630
so that that's when he you know there

1159
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:23,579
was sort of an informal competition that

1160
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,230
kicked off among people at origin and

1161
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:28,289
people who had recently left origin

1162
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:30,179
meaning me to get the you know the

1163
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:32,880
fastest inner loop for a simple affine

1164
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:34,498
mapper that's suitable for you soon you

1165
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,650
know you know texture map flight

1166
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:40,288
simulator so we went back and forth and

1167
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,298
back and forth and the person who really

1168
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:45,028
should be here is Michael a brash whom

1169
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:47,538
I'm sure a lot of you know Michael

1170
00:45:45,028 --> 00:45:50,068
couldn't be here but but Michael had

1171
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:51,539
what what what he really contributed at

1172
00:45:50,068 --> 00:45:55,048
that time was he was writing all these

1173
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:58,440
magazine columns describing for the very

1174
00:45:55,048 --> 00:46:02,248
first time an easily accessible public

1175
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,929
print how texture mapping worked and he

1176
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:05,818
would provide a lot of example code this

1177
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:08,368
was in a defunct magazine called dr.

1178
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:10,278
Dobbs Journal that everyone in the

1179
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:15,059
industry subscribed to at the time

1180
00:46:10,278 --> 00:46:17,130
hugely influential I saw the work that

1181
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:19,140
Michael was doing and I realized you

1182
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,358
know this is how actual general purpose

1183
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,150
you know texture mapping works which is

1184
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,588
something I've never really got before

1185
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:28,019
so that that kind of kicked me off on

1186
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:30,929
the whole you know his sis code takes

1187
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:33,328
like 30 or 40 cycles to do to do one

1188
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:35,338
pixel and then I'm you know eventually

1189
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:37,798
it goes down to 20 when I'm messing with

1190
00:46:35,338 --> 00:46:39,869
it and eventually I get it down to 215

1191
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:42,329
and somebody at origin has it running in

1192
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:44,160
ten and you know we're we're like we

1193
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:46,230
have we have this you know friendly

1194
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,269
little pissing contest going to get

1195
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,250
every last cycle out of that inner loop

1196
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:53,699
and what do you want tell the funny

1197
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:55,230
anecdote about that the said Mike I was

1198
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:57,719
at Microsoft we worked for Mike he was

1199
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:00,240
my boss at the time and right before

1200
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:02,159
that and like he had heard John at a

1201
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,769
nine cycle version and his was like 14

1202
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,059
or something like that I've got it like

1203
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:07,469
you know and he got an eight cycle

1204
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:12,869
version but John didn't ever have a nine

1205
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:16,679
cycle version knowing something is

1206
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:19,199
possible is and there's a whole chapter

1207
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:21,599
in his big black book of graphics

1208
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,759
programming on that taught on that exact

1209
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,380
yeah I experienced that Michael and I

1210
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,590
had you know going back and forth with

1211
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,180
each other and and he makes the very

1212
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,550
good point of you know he wouldn't have

1213
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:34,349
tried yeah if he didn't think someone

1214
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,760
had already beaten him and I wouldn't

1215
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:37,289
have I wouldn't have you know had

1216
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,360
something to shoot for if he hadn't

1217
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:41,699
published you know the forty cycle per

1218
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:44,130
pixel version or whatever so just just

1219
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:48,239
having that existence proof in places or

1220
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:50,730
not for the existing the perception of

1221
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,919
an existence and and then later in a

1222
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,679
file that's that's probably too obscure

1223
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,960
to really bring up on a screen here Ken

1224
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:02,129
Silverman the guy who did the build

1225
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,349
engine most famous for Duke Nukem he got

1226
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:09,930
it down to force was it four cycles per

1227
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:16,619
pixel something like that we could I

1228
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:18,269
don't know how in life so I was kind of

1229
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:21,659
out of the game by them but but there

1230
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:26,880
was kin and there was a Stafford I think

1231
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:28,619
probably Stafford is the one because

1232
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,690
people switch to perspective at one

1233
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:38,219
point and then you had to subdivide and

1234
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:41,099
then the cycle counts went back up but I

1235
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:42,359
I believe you know basically all the

1236
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,159
stuff that I was doing all this

1237
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,170
chest-thumping over getting it down to

1238
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,389
eight or nine cycles or whatever you

1239
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,950
know ken was at this at the same time

1240
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:52,859
more or less Ken was getting it down to

1241
00:48:49,949 --> 00:48:55,319
like half that so there's always another

1242
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,930
cycle yeah whether it's worth going

1243
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:00,360
after you know maybe maybe not

1244
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:02,129
all right so let's let's I guess move

1245
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,079
forward a little bit so eventually

1246
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,500
because I kind of want to talk about the

1247
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,210
second half of this process so Shawn

1248
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,070
tell me a little bit about because

1249
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,539
because Chris was that looking-glass

1250
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,980
earlier and then you came to Looking

1251
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:15,929
Glass I guess around this is around

1252
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,730
system shock time or is that that's

1253
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:20,609
in-between underworld two and system

1254
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:24,719
shock in 94 and system shock was

1255
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:26,579
basically done when I had done all the

1256
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,139
work on like the texture back okay so

1257
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:31,139
let's talk a little bit about that

1258
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:33,690
process so basically like from

1259
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:35,879
underworld to system shock they've kind

1260
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:37,889
of gotten to the point where the

1261
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,660
perspective stuff is under control are

1262
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:41,099
not really like it give me a little bit

1263
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:42,420
of background of like what happens at

1264
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,219
looking glass during this period of like

1265
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,750
okay so Chris has got the first one

1266
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:48,089
going for underworld and then they've

1267
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:50,699
gone through kind of two iterations and

1268
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:52,920
I think Minh was the person who did some

1269
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:54,179
of the work on this I never was able to

1270
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,760
find contact information he's the only

1271
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,889
person I couldn't invite but yeah under

1272
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,290
will - I don't know really any of the

1273
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:02,549
details just as a user I can see that

1274
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:05,250
the mapper was different I don't know

1275
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:06,390
whose work that was it looked like the

1276
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:09,179
main thing was that for the perspective

1277
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:10,769
mapper they split quads into two

1278
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:12,239
triangles and just drew two high fine

1279
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:14,250
triangles okay which way they were all

1280
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:17,219
straight lines across the triangles

1281
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,300
there were no curves but you would get

1282
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:20,849
this weird split one that was a

1283
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:23,039
perspective thing you would have to see

1284
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:24,690
men but you know if you draw a grid the

1285
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,659
grid bond just wouldn't why would I not

1286
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:31,559
crossing the diagonal and then for

1287
00:50:27,659 --> 00:50:33,029
system shock so there was no there

1288
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:34,739
wasn't really a lot of stable technology

1289
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,660
they just kept he was the newest part

1290
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:39,389
thing car that's because you know the

1291
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:41,849
machines kept evolving right they even

1292
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:43,589
the instruction set is changing but even

1293
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:45,299
without that the micro architecture is

1294
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,289
being different met the performance

1295
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,300
trade-offs over different which meant

1296
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:49,980
the thing that was a fast loop on the

1297
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:57,210
386 wasn't going to be the fastest loop

1298
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:59,010
on the 46 god it's a so system shock the

1299
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:01,260
main thing that they did was that they

1300
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:07,190
did have a solid perspective mapper

1301
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:07,190
without warping and without cheating and

1302
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:10,829
which was done with what was called the

1303
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:15,360
lines of constant

1304
00:51:10,829 --> 00:51:17,489
zmapp okay which involved two normal

1305
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,519
battery withdraw scan lines you would

1306
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:22,439
you would do this inverse mapping and

1307
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:27,329
you would process a single scan line of

1308
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,769
the polygon and then because it's when

1309
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:30,599
you had four mappers and wall mappers

1310
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:33,000
though that was a constant step and a

1311
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,559
half line step in the source texture map

1312
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,030
okay you could just trace that along

1313
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,009
very efficient so what you're saying

1314
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:40,260
it's very affected yeah you're saying

1315
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:42,180
that walls and floors are special but

1316
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:47,700
that was the doom the lines of constant

1317
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:54,929
Z on a floor if you can't tilt is you

1318
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:56,579
can't help because the walls the logic

1319
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:58,379
of Z are vertical and if you know that

1320
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,299
that changes right but the wall the

1321
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,160
really the reason that floors and

1322
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,890
ceilings are special that way is because

1323
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:12,599
the rotation is doesn't affect that

1324
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:14,639
plane right that it is the same but so

1325
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,900
walls and floors we're using this

1326
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,239
already I guess is what you're saying

1327
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,059
but so the idea there is that Doom was

1328
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,889
already doing yes all like just relied

1329
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:24,989
on that and that's how it was perfectly

1330
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:27,420
perspective correct by restricting the

1331
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:29,549
world and the player in such a way okay

1332
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,900
so I don't know the exact details Chris

1333
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:32,039
said there were multiple mappers to

1334
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,440
handle those cases so they could be

1335
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:38,789
faster and more correct looking in some

1336
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:42,030
of those cases so in System Shock they

1337
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:45,090
introduced this lines of constant Z map

1338
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:49,080
or where there are some on a polygon

1339
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:51,150
there some act some on-screen line that

1340
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:53,909
is a line of constant Z across that

1341
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:55,740
thing and will be at every effect move

1342
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:57,839
it along that line it never goes into

1343
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:02,579
route any further back or closer to the

1344
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:04,700
same I mean just take a plane in slices

1345
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,630
for your world and there are your life

1346
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:11,609
when you were doing the thing of looking

1347
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:13,140
at looking at the wall and lines are

1348
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,550
still straight lines that are still have

1349
00:53:13,139 --> 00:53:17,839
fine they're just not right the screen

1350
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,840
wall or but you can render in the

1351
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:24,079
and so that's the system shock tech is

1352
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,329
the lines of constant memories I guess

1353
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,010
one thing I should ask this time when

1354
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:29,630
did that concept of having multiple

1355
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,040
mappers start coming out because it

1356
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:33,950
sounds like you were saying for perhaps

1357
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:36,889
our underworld to over 100 even

1358
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:39,500
underworld one had this okay so we don't

1359
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:40,848
really talk about they all you just the

1360
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:47,150
way you did things back then was have

1361
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:49,460
all the keys yeah okay so basically what

1362
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,930
would happen is there's a whole bunch of

1363
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,960
different kinds of mappers there's

1364
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:55,578
something you I'm assuming this process

1365
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,440
comes about because you're optimizing

1366
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:59,690
the code you realize you could make an

1367
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,789
optimization if some one thing was true

1368
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:03,139
so you just like okay can we test if

1369
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:04,338
that's true and then branch two to two

1370
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:06,289
completely different versions of this

1371
00:54:04,338 --> 00:54:08,690
are similar or different loops for long

1372
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:10,309
for little tiny sections of polygons

1373
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:14,240
versus long ones because it's worth in

1374
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:16,630
mining but that's not that's not a

1375
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:16,629
texture mapping

1376
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:26,029
ok so Sean so as far as coming on around

1377
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:28,430
the system shock time one of the things

1378
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:32,390
that you did is this text file that kind

1379
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:33,440
of got oh that's before looking at okay

1380
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:35,239
so can you kind of give me some

1381
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,710
background on that and how that kind of

1382
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,959
because this is one of the first things

1383
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,740
that at least I know if that's like

1384
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,750
publishing it out in the game industry

1385
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:43,699
kind of what texture mapping even is for

1386
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,619
people who you know didn't didn't know

1387
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:48,460
it and along with like sort of a doctor

1388
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,460
job girls I don't know what

1389
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:59,089
so I I'd been reading journals and stuff

1390
00:54:54,650 --> 00:55:01,608
in the library what library back in

1391
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:03,289
Maryland I was mainly following into non

1392
00:55:01,608 --> 00:55:04,969
real-time stuff and it really didn't

1393
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:07,219
have a good understanding of the real

1394
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:11,118
time stuff and and just launched into

1395
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:13,699
that in 92 or so probably got all my

1396
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,619
information from used at like definitely

1397
00:55:13,699 --> 00:55:17,809
read the doctor table stuff that was why

1398
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:23,000
I started doing the 3d program was a

1399
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:25,608
brushed articles and the frustration I

1400
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,588
had was that nobody really explained the

1401
00:55:25,608 --> 00:55:28,568
details

1402
00:55:26,588 --> 00:55:30,009
what you need to do accept the details I

1403
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:32,018
knew from the non-real-time stuff but

1404
00:55:30,009 --> 00:55:34,748
for the real-time stuff I felt like

1405
00:55:32,018 --> 00:55:36,189
there was no real like a brush did have

1406
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:39,278
his thing I don't remember the details

1407
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:41,440
and all of that but it's just like and

1408
00:55:39,278 --> 00:55:43,568
at the time I wasn't scared of math okay

1409
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,369
and so one of the things that I did is I

1410
00:55:43,568 --> 00:55:47,259
just sat down and I said what actually

1411
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:48,969
needs to be happening in the math for

1412
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:50,528
this to make any sense I mean at the

1413
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:52,690
time like you are now or you mean

1414
00:55:50,528 --> 00:55:54,909
compared to everybody else you said at

1415
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:59,739
the time I was not scared I'm now way

1416
00:55:54,909 --> 00:56:11,078
more scared at the time I was in my 20s

1417
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:14,440
and fearless okay so so essentially if

1418
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:16,778
I'm getting this right you've had

1419
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,659
exposure to the actual technical

1420
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:20,679
literature in terms of what people

1421
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:22,028
non-real like like people who are doing

1422
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:24,308
maybe rate tracers or something is that

1423
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:25,900
what you mean by like a lot of people

1424
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:27,430
would recommend like this image warping

1425
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,969
book that like had no useful information

1426
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:33,098
there's like there was a lot of kind of

1427
00:56:30,969 --> 00:56:34,150
bad info okay well I think a lot of

1428
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:35,950
filtering stuff if you cared about

1429
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:39,099
filtering none of which we could afford

1430
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:41,949
to do but MIT mapping and stuff was in

1431
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:46,150
that book but it was definitely very not

1432
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:48,068
yeah like it was weird yeah so I kind of

1433
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:50,950
just said I gonna solve it from first

1434
00:56:48,068 --> 00:56:54,489
principles okay was what's what I was

1435
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:56,978
tackling doing and the article tries to

1436
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:58,449
cover everything so it's like here's the

1437
00:56:56,978 --> 00:57:01,149
math you need to know and here's an

1438
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:03,818
optimized inner loop and well single one

1439
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:06,338
okay you know whatever so it kind of

1440
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:08,259
covers a whole breadth of things and I

1441
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:10,420
was working on doing that work and 93 I

1442
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:11,650
think I put that arc on 94 the whole

1443
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,940
point there was we had used that but

1444
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,739
used that it was actually transitory

1445
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,108
used that was this thing that came and

1446
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:19,809
went it was you the article came on your

1447
00:57:17,108 --> 00:57:21,098
thing and they kept a week of articles

1448
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:22,660
if you were lucky or something like that

1449
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:24,609
and then it was gone again so you had

1450
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:26,978
FTP sites that had various pieces of

1451
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:29,228
information okay and this one guy was

1452
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:30,909
like this is terrible let's like collect

1453
00:57:29,228 --> 00:57:32,528
all the good information that's been

1454
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:34,088
going by and put it in this thing he

1455
00:57:32,528 --> 00:57:36,039
called the PC game programmers

1456
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:38,828
encyclopedia okay all the information it

1457
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:40,280
was probably useless a year later but it

1458
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:41,539
was a you know an attempt

1459
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,100
but something on the FTP sites that

1460
00:57:41,539 --> 00:57:44,900
would have a lot of valuable stuff and

1461
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:48,199
for whatever reason I got drafted to do

1462
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:50,300
the texture mapping article and I don't

1463
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:51,559
know for sure but I bet you is the exact

1464
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,690
same thing adds the a browse articles

1465
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:55,219
and a lot of other columns and stuff

1466
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,450
that you read which is the person is

1467
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:58,279
writing this from a position of

1468
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:59,869
authority but they had no idea before

1469
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,490
they start writing the column how to do

1470
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:09,769
it they just solved it while they were

1471
00:58:01,489 --> 00:58:11,449
writing the column okay experts so what

1472
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:12,590
is that process like for for working

1473
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:14,269
this I thought you said work it out from

1474
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:16,400
first principles like what do you mean

1475
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:17,960
like again coming at this from the

1476
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,610
perspective of like hey trying to solve

1477
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,079
a hard problem you have no information

1478
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,820
to go on really you just kind of know

1479
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:24,799
here's what an inner loop kind of looks

1480
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,840
like it's it's the other side of the

1481
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,519
math was the the issue and so it was

1482
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:32,210
like we know what the 3d transform is

1483
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:35,150
and I can characterize where in the

1484
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:38,570
bitmap a particular point on the polygon

1485
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:40,610
is in math and just run it through the

1486
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:43,730
normal 3d map so the whole thing like in

1487
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:46,280
a 3d perspective transform comes from

1488
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:49,789
dividing by a number divided by Z right

1489
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,110
yes and it turns out that the inverse

1490
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:54,349
transform of the texture mapping

1491
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:57,260
requires dividing by inverse V or

1492
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:58,880
something like that yes yes you know you

1493
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,410
might think the inverse would the divide

1494
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,150
turns into multiply no it turns into two

1495
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:04,069
by right and so the final thing you end

1496
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:06,170
up with is like some math that says you

1497
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:09,140
have to do two divides at every pixel

1498
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,880
one for each going thing I see if you

1499
00:59:09,139 --> 00:59:13,789
just sit there and crank out a bunch of

1500
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,530
math um but as Chris was saying part of

1501
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:17,599
the way of doing that was to actually

1502
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:19,760
formalize the problem in a different way

1503
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,980
than what people were actually doing in

1504
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,780
practice and I don't know where I got

1505
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,519
the idea of doing that from it was like

1506
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,050
maybe the only way I could think to make

1507
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:28,280
the math work don't they have to go

1508
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:30,470
through that and I can explain what I

1509
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,640
mean by that if you want you certainly

1510
00:59:30,469 --> 00:59:34,099
can

1511
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:35,750
so the basic idea in texture mapping is

1512
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:37,190
you have a bitmap and you have

1513
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:40,579
coordinates in the bitmap which we call

1514
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:42,139
UV or St and you say you have this

1515
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:44,569
polygon with vertices and you say and

1516
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:44,989
each vertex what UV coordinate in that

1517
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:47,570
bitmap

1518
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:48,829
you want to map to that point you do

1519
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:52,250
that for all the points in the polygon

1520
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:54,920
and you say you know in purply between

1521
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:58,130
and as soon as you have more than three

1522
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,680
points it's possible for you to specify

1523
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:02,930
a fourth vertex that you can't there's

1524
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:05,089
no normal you can't do a linear

1525
01:00:02,929 --> 01:00:07,159
interpolation and get that result which

1526
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:09,559
is why GP is all use triangles is right

1527
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:11,358
then the those coordinates are planar

1528
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:13,369
they they're purely linear in those two

1529
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,909
points but if you have four it's not

1530
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:18,619
really very well-defined and I in those

1531
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:20,358
in those days because we could only draw

1532
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:22,039
a hundred polygons you didn't turn

1533
01:00:20,358 --> 01:00:23,900
everything into tribal aspect that you

1534
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:25,550
just drew polygons right and so you had

1535
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,280
four or five sided polygons so you've

1536
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:30,769
had this problem of doing this now it

1537
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:34,420
turns out you can take any three and do

1538
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:38,090
the math and get the right results but

1539
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:39,710
you also for when you're trying to do

1540
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:41,269
quality things you sometimes do this

1541
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:43,490
thing where you interdict introduce an

1542
01:00:41,269 --> 01:00:47,300
extra vertex along a line you'll have

1543
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:48,858
three vertices on this edge okay to join

1544
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,359
up with other things cleanly so you

1545
01:00:48,858 --> 01:00:51,199
don't get cracking oh yes okay I see

1546
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:54,409
what you're so you're talking about T

1547
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:56,960
Junction okay so if you do that you have

1548
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:59,000
these three vertices they'll all have UV

1549
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,889
coordinates that are on a line because

1550
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,929
they'll be consistent and if you tried

1551
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:04,309
to do them even when you go to do the

1552
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:06,618
mapping you see I need to do some math

1553
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:08,539
get some stuff yes and you do that math

1554
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:09,980
on this stuff if you pick those three

1555
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:12,619
vertices because they're on a line you

1556
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:14,150
get garbage results I see right so

1557
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:17,030
basically what you're saying is you need

1558
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:18,980
three well for most points to figure out

1559
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:20,690
the plane of this texture mapping if

1560
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,980
they do generate to align I need to be

1561
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:31,300
linearly independent they cannot

1562
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:31,300
asteroids yes matrix afraid of math now

1563
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:37,869
the matrix has to not be degenerate it's

1564
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:37,868
not linearly independent as the cracker

1565
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:42,559
and so for example at looking but after

1566
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:44,030
I did all this anyone to look in glass I

1567
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,099
was talking them they were like yeah I

1568
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:48,109
have to certain I'm trying to generate

1569
01:01:46,099 --> 01:01:50,240
the math for the constant Z perspective

1570
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:52,699
mapper and I'm searching for a set of

1571
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:55,098
three vertices that are not collinear so

1572
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:57,108
that I can get stable math out of it

1573
01:01:55,099 --> 01:02:02,450
there it turns out there's other ways to

1574
01:01:57,108 --> 01:02:07,039
do it so I stepped back from that

1575
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:09,139
problem and I said well I know the UV

1576
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,300
coordinates should be planar in the in

1577
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:13,039
the not on screen button in world space

1578
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,900
right should be plane like they should

1579
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,809
be well-defined they once you've defined

1580
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,250
three there so let's go this thing came

1581
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:21,588
from something in the world that is

1582
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:23,260
supposed to be flat so it's also the

1583
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:25,849
only way the mapper is going to work

1584
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:27,170
only no you do it that's true so let's

1585
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:29,240
assume that they're playing so let's

1586
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:31,550
just start by assuming we have plane

1587
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:33,649
equations for the coordinates instead of

1588
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:36,320
starting with UV coordinates at each

1589
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:38,510
vertex that was the the weird thing

1590
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,920
about one of the several weird things

1591
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:40,970
about my way of doing texture mapping

1592
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,289
that was in this article

1593
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:43,489
okay well the funny thing about it that

1594
01:02:42,289 --> 01:02:45,230
is when I was reading it I didn't know

1595
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:47,329
enough math and even really know what a

1596
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:48,829
plane equation was at the time it's like

1597
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:51,920
what the hell is a weird ass thing

1598
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:53,000
that's what's happening on I mean

1599
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,389
they're all equivalent under the hood

1600
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,820
like they all exactly the same but if

1601
01:02:56,389 --> 01:03:01,190
you don't have the math skills to and so

1602
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:03,010
this this article kind of makes its way

1603
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:05,088
out into the world I guess at this point

1604
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:07,070
some around the system shocked over a

1605
01:03:05,088 --> 01:03:09,349
little bit before it's assumed it was 94

1606
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,490
before I went to looking left so yeah it

1607
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:12,410
would have been before system shock you

1608
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:14,179
know is this the first like it was that

1609
01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:16,309
one of the first ones that was published

1610
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:17,868
in terms of for the game industry for

1611
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:20,299
perspectives though for perspective the

1612
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:21,740
only thought I didn't actually I gave

1613
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,690
the Quartus I didn't try to solve the

1614
01:03:21,739 --> 01:03:24,949
perspective with mapping problem there

1615
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:26,599
was a separate article in the thing

1616
01:03:24,949 --> 01:03:28,879
which proposed doing lines of constant Z

1617
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:30,080
but it wasn't your thing had like to

1618
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,670
point we want a plain equation two over

1619
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,838
another plane equation s yeah you didn't

1620
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:37,130
actually do anything here's the two

1621
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:39,409
divides you have to do yeah

1622
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:40,579
all right and so now Chris this is

1623
01:03:39,409 --> 01:03:42,289
because I kind of think of you as being

1624
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:43,579
the person who could codify a lot of

1625
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:45,170
this stuff only because I remember at

1626
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:48,679
that time those like texture mapping

1627
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:52,570
articles were sort of they're like the

1628
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:52,569
final publication on it that makes right

1629
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:00,289
I was just friends with all these people

1630
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:04,069
because I was at Microsoft and I got

1631
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:05,960
Microsoft to get let me go to GDC okay

1632
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:09,140
and so I met Doug and then through Doug

1633
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,699
I met everybody else well Doug enjoy

1634
01:04:09,139 --> 01:04:13,250
axiom John and John introduced me to

1635
01:04:10,699 --> 01:04:14,929
Doug so what happened was I worked for

1636
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:17,809
Mike so Mike and I learned 3d graphics

1637
01:04:14,929 --> 01:04:19,099
Mikey brushed on Bix this is before the

1638
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:23,059
internet okay I mean the internet

1639
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:24,469
existed in colleges and stuff so right

1640
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:27,588
around the time he was learning 3d

1641
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:29,659
graphics I was on Bix with and we like

1642
01:04:27,588 --> 01:04:31,130
kind of like helped each other learn 3d

1643
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:33,108
graphics together and then I went to

1644
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:35,930
work for him at Microsoft and then I saw

1645
01:04:33,108 --> 01:04:37,309
some flyer that had like computer game

1646
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:39,019
developers conference that was posted in

1647
01:04:37,309 --> 01:04:44,809
the like you know some hallways I'm on a

1648
01:04:39,019 --> 01:04:47,210
bulletin board like literally and then

1649
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:50,690
just because you like games games are

1650
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:52,909
the cool thing but then I went to John's

1651
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:54,380
talk which is about the texture map or

1652
01:04:52,909 --> 01:04:56,899
what Bo is about I've the hold I have

1653
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:59,450
the molder 3 which is a video game that

1654
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:05,358
John does like wrote all by yourself I

1655
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:06,799
think right you just type those in it

1656
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:08,960
was some D&amp;D license something rather

1657
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,839
I'm but you talked about text wrapping

1658
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,608
in there I guess well I think we

1659
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:17,000
actually had a sponsored session at one

1660
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:21,049
GDC it wasn't a sponsored session but we

1661
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,789
thought long story short it looked like

1662
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,830
we were trying to sell our texture map

1663
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:26,539
or at GDC and I think right it wasn't

1664
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:27,769
yeah yeah this is before I was on the

1665
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:29,480
board or anything like that so I just

1666
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:31,400
was like this guy in the audience and

1667
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:33,789
like I think I asked a question or

1668
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,559
whatever and I went up afterwards

1669
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:38,210
and I was like oh my K brush was my boss

1670
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,769
like you know I'd like to talk he's like

1671
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:41,780
oh cool have dinner with us and then he

1672
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,920
needs me to Doug and Chris and Matt

1673
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,240
talks a lot would be to saying all that

1674
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,930
but so anyway I was good friends with a

1675
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:49,429
bunch of these people and so and back

1676
01:05:47,929 --> 01:05:52,699
then when I was writing those columns

1677
01:05:49,429 --> 01:05:54,139
for a game developer I downloaded

1678
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,250
Shawn's article I was you know I'm using

1679
01:05:54,139 --> 01:05:56,690
it and trying to figure all this stuff

1680
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,519
out and like it was kind of a hot topic

1681
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:59,690
like I said it was like just what you

1682
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:00,858
talked about when you were with people

1683
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:02,480
is how to make your texture mapper work

1684
01:06:00,858 --> 01:06:03,409
better and that was right around the

1685
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,119
time that people were trying to figure

1686
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:07,129
out how to go from affine mapping which

1687
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,450
worked if you had small polygons to

1688
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,099
perspective map name which is just

1689
01:06:08,449 --> 01:06:12,169
general okay I'm like there were just

1690
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:14,210
eight billion ways of doing it was like

1691
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:15,769
this Precambrian explosion kind of crazy

1692
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:17,088
lines of constancy and you know like

1693
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:18,139
subdividing this way and so dividing the

1694
01:06:17,088 --> 01:06:19,130
actual triangles and they all had

1695
01:06:18,139 --> 01:06:19,529
different costs in trade-offs and

1696
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:23,010
everyone

1697
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:24,540
figuring out and but I was like it's

1698
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:26,040
similar to Shawn I was just frustrated

1699
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:28,019
because no one actually knew anything

1700
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:29,550
about what was going on like there was

1701
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:31,500
not that much understanding about what

1702
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:34,019
was actually happening on a per pixel

1703
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:36,360
basis so it's kind of trying to solve a

1704
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:38,550
problem without really defining the

1705
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,320
problem quite like I think this kind of

1706
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:42,300
improved the quality is thing because we

1707
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,490
did it and we saw that a lot better but

1708
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:49,650
we didn't necessarily have a you know

1709
01:06:44,489 --> 01:06:51,659
the understand to measure what was there

1710
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:53,940
was no like here's the divide per pixel

1711
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:55,170
perfect code let me optimize that right

1712
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:59,369
that's not the way it happened at all

1713
01:06:55,170 --> 01:07:00,150
right so which I think there's the it

1714
01:06:59,369 --> 01:07:02,759
sounds like there was some agreement

1715
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:05,070
earlier like thank you yes you won't get

1716
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,960
off into these crazy little areas if you

1717
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:08,580
necessarily strictly follow that like

1718
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,750
you want some again your simulated in

1719
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:11,880
the algorithm you want a little bit of

1720
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:13,170
heat to Bob out to a randomization thing

1721
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,519
but at the same time like man if you

1722
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:16,110
have that reference implementation that

1723
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:22,320
you can do so much more and actually

1724
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:25,079
understand what you know here's the slow

1725
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:28,050
perfect thing but some things like how

1726
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:30,779
good are crazy thing is but some people

1727
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:32,430
and this may be true feel that if you've

1728
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,600
got that it's hard I mean kind of mean

1729
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:35,489
that's similar like the note cycle

1730
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,719
anecdote it's hard to pop out of that

1731
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:38,719
because you're always focusing on yeah

1732
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:44,549
but so anyway so I saw Shawn's article

1733
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,539
and I met Shawn years later so this is

1734
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:46,890
the funny thing and Shawn and I shared

1735
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:48,989
an office for a long time but so like I

1736
01:07:46,889 --> 01:07:50,400
but I saw Shawn Barrett like it wasn't

1737
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:51,839
was it P map we're talking figure out

1738
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,610
the name of the text file was okay

1739
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:57,150
there's like P map text or text map

1740
01:07:53,610 --> 01:08:00,780
something anyway but and I just could

1741
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:01,619
not understand a word I believe that it

1742
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,280
was I mean I downloaded from the

1743
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:06,659
internet so it must be all it's on this

1744
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,800
like game programming it sounds like

1745
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:09,269
this guy must know he's talking about

1746
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:12,780
but I literally cannot understand

1747
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:17,880
anything going on here and so I was at

1748
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:23,310
Microsoft then doing this is right after

1749
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:25,260
doom is a pre quake and there was a

1750
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:26,250
couple math guys around who like we're

1751
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:28,260
really good at discrete mathematics

1752
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,130
though the one that the biggest takeaway

1753
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,390
from this talk is you should buy this

1754
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:33,029
book called concrete math man

1755
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:35,640
by Graham Knutson patashnik it's just

1756
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:36,840
the best book for all kinds of likes the

1757
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,760
Fabian was talking about we were both

1758
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,350
talking at rad the other day about how

1759
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,060
awesome this book is like how to think

1760
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:43,530
move things in and out of floors and

1761
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:47,480
seals and like how to get rid of yeah

1762
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:47,479
it's just a great clear floors and seals

1763
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:55,200
it's called concrete because it's

1764
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,409
continuous and discrete that's where

1765
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,909
math that's where game math lives right

1766
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:01,680
it's gonna end up as pixels on the

1767
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:02,760
screen or as a thing is you know and so

1768
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,770
it's just a great book

1769
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,940
but so there's a I got turned out of

1770
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:07,410
this book by this guy who I think his

1771
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:10,979
name was Kurt he worked also work for

1772
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:13,409
Mike at the time at Microsoft and we

1773
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:15,319
were just I had started trying to fumble

1774
01:09:13,409 --> 01:09:18,899
around trying to figure out this thing

1775
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:20,340
and started being more rigorous about

1776
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:21,629
the Phil conventions and Halleck what

1777
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:22,920
should the actual definition the pixel

1778
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:26,390
actually be and then I realized it would

1779
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,390
just be value because I've been writing

1780
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:32,189
so I mean again trying to work through

1781
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:35,670
the mindset of how these sorts of things

1782
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:36,989
happen why does the Phil convention come

1783
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,489
into your brain at all this point is

1784
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:39,779
this because your mother craps things

1785
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:41,429
like give me everyone's trying to

1786
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:42,960
improve the look of their game yes right

1787
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:44,579
so what do you got going wrong you've

1788
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,960
got cracks in the polygons like

1789
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:48,000
underworld had this crazy thing where

1790
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,789
would like fill the buffer with purple

1791
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,739
or pink and then run random cam camera

1792
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:54,479
angles and search the buffer for pink

1793
01:09:52,739 --> 01:09:56,729
pixels and then like print out where the

1794
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,259
camera was no yeah I mean this is like

1795
01:09:56,729 --> 01:10:00,389
no one knew what they were doing like so

1796
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:05,250
I mean that's how you find bugs right

1797
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:06,600
and so so I was just kind of talking to

1798
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:07,920
all these people and like you know if I

1799
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,710
was working games myself but I was were

1800
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,180
gonna win G which was the game library

1801
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:14,730
before direct decks that Microsoft that

1802
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:17,039
we did and so reported doomed to that

1803
01:10:14,729 --> 01:10:18,629
and like it was the thing people were

1804
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,100
trying to improve the quality right and

1805
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:22,500
it was like oh well perspective is a

1806
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,730
huge thing making sure crabs don't you

1807
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,800
know when you if you're ever gonna write

1808
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:27,029
a triangle rasterizer you want to get

1809
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,529
your fill convention right that's one

1810
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:30,329
thing Mike was really rigorous about

1811
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:31,920
early on although he was yes once you

1812
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:34,019
add dimension is just which pixels are

1813
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,609
yeah yeah exactly and when they share an

1814
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:37,140
edge like you don't decide who gets

1815
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:38,549
which pixels and all the stuff it's all

1816
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:41,190
stuff that the hardware mostly handles

1817
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,550
now but like we've got back then when

1818
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:44,519
you were doing

1819
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:46,890
you had to do it okay so people in the

1820
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:48,090
in the industry generally knew that

1821
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:50,670
these were problems because they saw

1822
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:52,020
them right they had these the cracks or

1823
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:55,470
they had a but they wouldn't necessarily

1824
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:57,210
they didn't necessarily know why it was

1825
01:10:55,470 --> 01:11:00,449
a hard problem it was an uninteresting

1826
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:08,909
problem and so we all blew it off and so

1827
01:11:00,449 --> 01:11:10,260
we all had cracks in our right so

1828
01:11:08,909 --> 01:11:12,720
sub-pixel is another thing was once you

1829
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,940
start perfect once you start do we know

1830
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:17,909
why that was because like if so when Mac

1831
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:20,789
was working on this stuff did he just

1832
01:11:17,909 --> 01:11:23,279
not talk about it or did people not

1833
01:11:20,789 --> 01:11:26,159
realize that that solution would also be

1834
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:27,779
something you could okay so it was so

1835
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,159
special case that if you're trying to do

1836
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:34,500
a general map or none of the tricks he

1837
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:38,880
was doing quality was image quality was

1838
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:43,859
a priority friend right right but yeah I

1839
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:46,380
mean it's not he was talking to Mikey

1840
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:49,829
and email occasionally because but

1841
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:51,449
anyway so I mean just in my head just

1842
01:11:49,829 --> 01:11:54,329
because I guess I'm not maybe explain as

1843
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:55,829
well at some point he must have thought

1844
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:57,029
about sub pixel precision I don't think

1845
01:11:55,829 --> 01:12:00,600
he thought he didn't know it was called

1846
01:11:57,029 --> 01:12:02,639
sub pixel how did he end up getting a

1847
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,560
thing like that then you think he just

1848
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,630
kind of was like oh that looks way back

1849
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,160
to the doom code it's not actually sub I

1850
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:11,579
mean I I don't know for sure but I'm

1851
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:13,739
sure no it was way more sub pixel then

1852
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:15,809
not like if you just truncate to the

1853
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:17,010
nearest integers like crawls all

1854
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,750
over the place and it wasn't doing that

1855
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:20,970
because he filtered every line before we

1856
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:22,500
drew it meaning he pre-stretched it and

1857
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:28,350
then did the thing so if you do that

1858
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:31,350
right yeah all right so it could be that

1859
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:33,510
he wouldn't really have known the like

1860
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:37,740
abstraction that will allow you to then

1861
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:39,210
apply the same thought problem because

1862
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:42,029
he also had Wolff before that

1863
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:44,220
Wolfenstein was a similar I mean it's

1864
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:45,420
only like the thing about the break from

1865
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,930
doomed the Wolfenstein was the ability

1866
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:50,689
to have things that weren't just box

1867
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:53,719
which required a little bit more math

1868
01:12:50,689 --> 01:12:55,159
the columns on the floor yeah because

1869
01:12:53,719 --> 01:13:00,649
the floors was hey that line of constant

1870
01:12:55,158 --> 01:13:02,808
Z is moving in the texture map but

1871
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:04,969
anyway so uh so it's just it was just

1872
01:13:02,809 --> 01:13:09,679
it's hard to it's hard to overemphasize

1873
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:12,319
how much mental power and conversational

1874
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:13,519
power graphics took up then it was just

1875
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:15,799
what you talked about if you were a game

1876
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:17,360
programmer right like knowing care I

1877
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,998
mean I'm sure some people did but there

1878
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:21,768
was no game design like it as a thing

1879
01:13:19,998 --> 01:13:23,118
that you talked about there was just

1880
01:13:21,769 --> 01:13:25,579
like how fast can you get your texture

1881
01:13:23,118 --> 01:13:27,799
wrapper okay right and so it's just like

1882
01:13:25,578 --> 01:13:29,899
what people all the hardest core highest

1883
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,550
and all the like everything was just

1884
01:13:29,899 --> 01:13:32,868
talked about it's like everyone license

1885
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,788
smile sound system or whatever was

1886
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:36,438
called hale and then like spent all

1887
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:42,738
their time on their texture mapper and

1888
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:43,760
then so but so in image quality was the

1889
01:13:42,738 --> 01:13:45,078
thing because we had although like i

1890
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,760
mean the computers were getting faster

1891
01:13:45,078 --> 01:13:48,078
and so we had the cycles and it was like

1892
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,639
image quality so it's like fixing your

1893
01:13:48,078 --> 01:13:50,808
cracks and getting some pixel accurate

1894
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:52,099
and like all these things and so I just

1895
01:13:50,809 --> 01:13:53,958
wrote these articles I want to figure

1896
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:55,159
out myself yes and like Sean was saying

1897
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:56,208
the best way to figure things out is

1898
01:13:55,158 --> 01:13:59,538
actually trying write an article about

1899
01:13:56,208 --> 01:14:01,969
it as an expert because they assume

1900
01:13:59,538 --> 01:14:05,179
you're an expert temporarily write the

1901
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:06,349
article and then at the end you start to

1902
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:07,849
be like I really want to be able to

1903
01:14:06,349 --> 01:14:09,229
write an article about this from the

1904
01:14:07,849 --> 01:14:10,219
point of view an expert so I better get

1905
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:11,958
there and there's a deadline on the

1906
01:14:10,219 --> 01:14:19,880
article right you'll attract attention

1907
01:14:11,958 --> 01:14:21,889
from the actual experts right so okay so

1908
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,479
when you're doing this though you're

1909
01:14:21,889 --> 01:14:24,769
you're looking at this and going okay so

1910
01:14:23,479 --> 01:14:26,630
people are saying that they've got these

1911
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:28,159
sort of cracks and dropouts and stuff

1912
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,449
with the pulp fill convention stuff was

1913
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:31,728
handled earlier but I just wanted to

1914
01:14:29,448 --> 01:14:32,808
document it really okay so who I mean

1915
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:35,570
that's all just been like I mean it's

1916
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:37,099
just like pulling been named I think

1917
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:38,988
talk about fill conventions I think I

1918
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:40,458
can't remember that's been that was more

1919
01:14:38,988 --> 01:14:41,808
resin ham is about fill conventions

1920
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:48,198
things like that just like what's in and

1921
01:14:41,809 --> 01:14:50,389
what's out I was like you have to know

1922
01:14:48,198 --> 01:14:52,129
if you're gonna once you're mapping

1923
01:14:50,389 --> 01:14:54,109
something on to a surface you have to

1924
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:55,578
know where the actual how'd you have to

1925
01:14:54,109 --> 01:14:56,658
step to the pixel center from the edge

1926
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:58,009
of the thing so you have to get your

1927
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,658
fill convention right with the floors

1928
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:01,010
and the ceilings so that is that if it's

1929
01:14:59,658 --> 01:15:01,759
right if the lines right on a pixel

1930
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,019
center then what

1931
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,659
what do you do and just there's just a

1932
01:15:03,019 --> 01:15:07,429
whole bunch of little math there that is

1933
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:09,500
not a lot of code once you know the math

1934
01:15:07,429 --> 01:15:11,029
it just all drops out into like I add

1935
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,960
one in the low significant bid on this

1936
01:15:11,029 --> 01:15:14,479
thing and it worked

1937
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,439
but getting figuring that a lot of

1938
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:18,678
people would just literally have a

1939
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:21,738
second to somebody I it's a couple days

1940
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:22,849
ago I was like oh yeah we owe it was we

1941
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:24,138
were talking about so under Kelling moon

1942
01:15:22,849 --> 01:15:25,819
was another game that had a crazy

1943
01:15:24,139 --> 01:15:28,368
advanced texture members it was really

1944
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:30,738
garbage he really crawly but like it was

1945
01:15:28,368 --> 01:15:32,598
full general and it was like 10 frames a

1946
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:35,750
second maybe yes they were doing lots of

1947
01:15:32,599 --> 01:15:40,699
polygons and lots of it right so it's

1948
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:42,710
like but Jeff was just saying that Bruce

1949
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:48,979
Bruce Hartwick but Bruce doll increased

1950
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:51,788
awesome no it wasn't Bruce Johnson that

1951
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:54,678
he just had like a magic number he added

1952
01:15:51,788 --> 01:15:55,788
literally he just had like a 1 in the 16

1953
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:58,069
you know in the fruit foot in the

1954
01:15:55,788 --> 01:15:59,929
fixed-point like and like he just I

1955
01:15:58,069 --> 01:16:02,058
don't know why this fixes it and like so

1956
01:15:59,929 --> 01:16:03,559
my one of my articles is like and what

1957
01:16:02,059 --> 01:16:05,059
it was doing it was converting a floor

1958
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,769
to a seal or whatever like you add none

1959
01:16:05,059 --> 01:16:08,538
and then truncate and then boom it was a

1960
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:09,800
seal and that was a sleepy Friday plus

1961
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:11,238
one I was like hey yeah yeah whereas

1962
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,010
this guy I think his name was Kurt but

1963
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:14,718
concrete mathematics talks about like if

1964
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:16,010
you and you the concrete graphics

1965
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,050
doesn't like the artwork look words I

1966
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,980
doesn't talk about like fixed-point and

1967
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:20,659
whatever but like you know if you

1968
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:22,250
realize what's going on you can see all

1969
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:24,109
these floors and seals and you just

1970
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:26,090
write out the math and then you grind it

1971
01:16:24,109 --> 01:16:27,589
through in the right way and then like

1972
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:28,849
oh you should add one here you should

1973
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,739
subtract one there and then you should

1974
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:32,090
you know truncate or whatever so I just

1975
01:16:30,738 --> 01:16:33,229
wanted to document all that stuff cuz

1976
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:36,529
there's all this stuff in lots of

1977
01:16:33,229 --> 01:16:38,268
different places and as we went towards

1978
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:40,189
image quality it seemed like to me you

1979
01:16:38,269 --> 01:16:42,110
know coming from a basis I mean I just

1980
01:16:40,189 --> 01:16:43,339
reread the intro to my article just

1981
01:16:42,109 --> 01:16:44,630
onstage here while you're doing the

1982
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:47,300
thing and it was like if there's one

1983
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:52,340
thing 3d video games have to have now

1984
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:53,288
it's a perspective texture map err words

1985
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:57,019
to live by

1986
01:16:53,288 --> 01:16:58,429
I know this sounds like I'm trying to

1987
01:16:57,019 --> 01:16:59,510
pin down something specific everybody's

1988
01:16:58,429 --> 01:17:01,368
still not quite sure

1989
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:03,260
so I'm dodging on the fact that I don't

1990
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:04,098
remember any of this I'm trying to like

1991
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:06,949
bob and weave

1992
01:17:04,099 --> 01:17:10,489
I just wanted just to see though if I

1993
01:17:06,948 --> 01:17:12,279
can get it which is again people are

1994
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:13,689
having problems with these

1995
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:15,939
in other words games in general are not

1996
01:17:13,689 --> 01:17:18,219
necessarily doing the right things for

1997
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:21,250
their fill convention so at some point

1998
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:23,500
somebody and maybe it's you know was

1999
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:26,079
other people or something but had to go

2000
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,430
wait a minute there's this information

2001
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:29,380
in these other places that's about how

2002
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:31,030
to fix that so I'm just asking what

2003
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:32,920
happened there was that talking to

2004
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:34,750
people at Microsoft I mean think it's

2005
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,279
like lose net and look to everybody

2006
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:41,109
talked about this all the time so some

2007
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:44,859
people connect right but the thing about

2008
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:46,719
the the so the fill conventions of how

2009
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:47,679
to fill triangles was well understood I

2010
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:50,470
mean Mike and written about eight years

2011
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:53,409
before like not I mean it was my kiddin

2012
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:57,430
I mean it's like that's just in early

2013
01:17:53,409 --> 01:18:01,630
graphics of textbooks do it it's just

2014
01:17:57,430 --> 01:18:03,130
like right well yeah I mean right and

2015
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:04,150
then just but when you add texture

2016
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:05,319
mapping all that stuff gets worse

2017
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:06,819
because you have to be on pixel centers

2018
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:09,429
so all of a sudden makes you could have

2019
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:11,049
had a crappy like Paul and solid polygon

2020
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:12,579
filler or even a gross shaded one and

2021
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:14,199
not notice that you are off though if

2022
01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:15,489
once you've got texture mapping on there

2023
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:22,389
there's just this high frequency

2024
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:24,880
you're an idiot which is the the floor

2025
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:26,560
mappers scanned scan converted

2026
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,859
horizontally and the wall mappers can

2027
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:31,960
convert it vertically okay actually hard

2028
01:18:29,859 --> 01:18:33,189
to make consistent right like that was a

2029
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,840
subtlety that no one talked about

2030
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:36,579
because it was a unique thing we were

2031
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,400
trying to write probably there's an easy

2032
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:41,680
math solution to yeah yeah yeah but

2033
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:43,809
nobody right also in the in general

2034
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,600
outside the walls and geometry people

2035
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:52,030
generally used T junctions without even

2036
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:53,770
caring Yeah right yeah or bowties is a

2037
01:18:52,029 --> 01:18:55,779
similar yeah and also we rendered

2038
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:57,100
concave we rendered concave polygons who

2039
01:18:55,779 --> 01:18:58,389
can afford to break those things up

2040
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:08,500
right and it's really hard to get that

2041
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:10,119
so yeah I just remember just the final

2042
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,520
state of the articles they're so well so

2043
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:14,590
the perspective correct part of that I

2044
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,430
guess was kind of something that came

2045
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:19,300
about partially it was just what was

2046
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:20,860
happening then like people trying to

2047
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:23,470
figure it out or figure it out and so

2048
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:24,299
Mike had written the a fine ones but you

2049
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,980
couldn't make a game

2050
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,929
very successfully because things would

2051
01:19:25,979 --> 01:19:29,339
just warp it was cool

2052
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,929
and he had its little like you know you

2053
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:32,550
had polygons 3d stuff going on the

2054
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:36,719
screen and so we were friends and you

2055
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:38,579
know work together then and so and doom

2056
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,109
it was just clear that perspective had

2057
01:19:38,578 --> 01:19:43,859
to happen for it to be general enough to

2058
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:45,179
use yes and so so yes it was just

2059
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:46,380
documenting that and figuring out and we

2060
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:50,399
worked on the assembly code and like

2061
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:51,630
like you know the math behind it and

2062
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:53,368
then how to write the assembly code to

2063
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:55,440
make it work and how was getting the

2064
01:19:53,368 --> 01:19:57,269
math behind it a question of cuz again

2065
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:58,710
Sean had written the articles which you

2066
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:00,030
saw so those were all plain equation

2067
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,198
based like there are UV coordinates in

2068
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:02,908
his articles so like the way you

2069
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:05,039
actually do a pipeline with this stuff

2070
01:20:02,908 --> 01:20:06,808
the way you actually the way it's more

2071
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:08,039
intuitive nowadays maybe it's a six 1/2

2072
01:20:06,809 --> 01:20:11,460
knows the other cuz I know more math but

2073
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:13,198
back then for me like the idea of like

2074
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:15,989
you've got some source bitmap and you've

2075
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,250
got a triangle and the triangle has got

2076
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:18,629
coordinates in the source bitmap that

2077
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,828
you then want to put on the screen made

2078
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,940
a lot more sense so I wanted to figure

2079
01:20:19,828 --> 01:20:22,500
out from there that's actually the way

2080
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:23,759
the hardware ended up working ok you

2081
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:28,889
know I mean that's the way it's actually

2082
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:30,239
before this two guys that's so yeah so I

2083
01:20:28,889 --> 01:20:31,289
wanted to derive the math from there but

2084
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,509
if you look at the articles it's a ton

2085
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:36,809
of plain equations yeah if you have to

2086
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:43,739
be able to detect them and you just yeah

2087
01:20:36,809 --> 01:20:49,199
yeah I would like but most of whose name

2088
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:57,269
we think is Kurt well I think he's not a

2089
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:59,039
game he's not Kurt but but that was that

2090
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:00,690
stuff came mostly that's not what's more

2091
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:03,809
eye-opening for the fill conventions for

2092
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:05,308
the for the subpixel like gradient

2093
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:07,500
stepping stuff that was basically like

2094
01:21:05,309 --> 01:21:09,570
if you if you're off by like one bit

2095
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,130
like you're you're gonna find little

2096
01:21:09,569 --> 01:21:13,590
bugs yes if you just you can get it

2097
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:15,840
exactly right in fixed point even to

2098
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:16,650
match the correct math if you just do

2099
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,880
all the stuff that was really

2100
01:21:16,649 --> 01:21:19,589
eye-opening to me cuz that stuff that I

2101
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,809
still use now like it really is so

2102
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:25,909
that's just real math and say we're like

2103
01:21:21,809 --> 01:21:28,500
math carries across you know like I

2104
01:21:25,908 --> 01:21:29,789
haven't written on ssee kind of assembly

2105
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,069
language in a million why would you ever

2106
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:33,350
write that right I just don't need to do

2107
01:21:32,069 --> 01:21:36,479
that anymore

2108
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:37,829
but but that math is useful everywhere

2109
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:41,759
now that you know that like a floor and

2110
01:21:37,829 --> 01:21:42,750
a seal like seemed impenetrable like you

2111
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,730
can't get anything out of here because

2112
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:46,859
it's changing the number but you can

2113
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:49,919
like you just have to know it's a

2114
01:21:46,859 --> 01:21:52,198
concrete mathematics it's a it's gram is

2115
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,010
the first author and Knuth and patashnik

2116
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:54,750
got it

2117
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:57,000
it's a great book well we have to break

2118
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:58,800
for lunch I think we probably got to the

2119
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,948
end of it just about

2120
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,949
[Music]

2121
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:14,738
[Applause]
