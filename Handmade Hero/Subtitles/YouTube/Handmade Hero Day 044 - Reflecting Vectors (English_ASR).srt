1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,669
and start okay hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,189
welcome to handmade hero the show where

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:11,969
we code a complete game live on twitch

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,620
from scratch no libraries no engine

5
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,750
because basically our goal is to figure

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,429
out everything that happens sort of

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,929
examine everything that happens in the

8
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:20,399
entire pipeline on a game from how you

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,439
draw the pixels all the way up to how

10
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,629
the game code operates and decides

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,750
what's going to happen at a logistical

12
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:30,390
level so right now we're kind of in the

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,668
middle of our week of sort of starting

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,380
to use vector math in the code and

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,169
vector math is very important because

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,290
it's in sort of the same way that you

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,030
could think of C and C++ as getting you

18
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,439
a level above assembly language so that

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,300
you can start to think about things at a

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,579
slightly higher level while still

21
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,099
retaining most of the performance

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,289
benefits and the sort of direct access

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,579
that you're used to vector math is kind

24
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,410
of like that for the scalar math that

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,939
we've been doing it basically allows us

26
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:58,288
to do the same sort of operations we

27
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:00,149
were doing when we were manhandling the

28
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,250
x and y-coordinates of things and this

29
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,390
sort of stuff but it gives us the

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,368
opportunity to start thinking about

31
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,959
those as a pair and start defining

32
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:08,969
operations that work on them as a pair

33
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,069
which we can still use to get very

34
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,658
efficient code but it allows us to sort

35
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:14,250
of beat up at a slightly more a higher

36
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,840
semantic level and sometimes you still

37
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,000
have to go down there and muck with the

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,530
individual values in these in these

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,909
vectors but most of the time you can

40
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,978
start thinking of them conceptually and

41
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:27,509
it allows you to do a lot more powerful

42
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:28,859
stuff now we already did some of that we

43
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,890
already did some of that yesterday in

44
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:34,680
fact but before I dive into that let me

45
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,109
quickly go over as I always do how you

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,880
can be coding along at home if you are

47
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:40,200
someone who has period of the game at

48
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,618
hand made hero org you should have

49
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,490
gotten a link in your email in that

50
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:48,000
download page that you would get a link

51
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,289
to you can download both the test assets

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,659
that we use for development here on the

53
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,579
stream and you should have had the

54
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,740
ability download a zip file in which are

55
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,989
a bunch of other zip files you want to

56
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,640
grab the zip file for day 43 because

57
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,978
that is what I am starting with here on

58
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,840
day 44 so you always start with the

59
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,968
previous day zip if you unzip that into

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,890
a directory and start coding with it you

61
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,618
will be exactly where I am right now

62
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,539
okay so let's talk a little bit about

63
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,039
what we had just done in the

64
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:17,878
and then let's talk a little bit about

65
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:20,098
what we are going to do today to kind of

66
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:23,158
continue along in our and our vector

67
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:25,500
sorts of sorts of experiments here okay

68
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:27,239
so we had just finished implementing

69
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,789
simple equations of motion for our

70
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,039
little guy here and basically what we've

71
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:33,419
done so far is we had made a little tile

72
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,158
map right that the guy could walk around

73
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,089
on we had this we don't really have

74
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:37,679
there's just sort of a static background

75
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,000
sitting in here now so we haven't gotten

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,230
to how we're gonna render our tile map

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,759
yet but we do have the ability to kind

78
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,888
of draw these you know the sort of white

79
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,019
walls and the the doors and stuff so he

80
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:47,700
can go up a virtual staircase he can go

81
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,500
out the side of the screen and so on and

82
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:51,839
we just implemented the equations of

83
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,068
motion for him so basically he has you

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,700
know sort of more of what you would

85
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:58,259
expect a objects movement to be when you

86
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:00,658
are moving him around right and so as

87
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,729
I'm moving him around I can kind of feel

88
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:04,798
that momentum that we added and he stops

89
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,568
he has it he has a little bit of a sort

90
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,579
of a glide to a stop and he has a little

91
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:10,649
bit of acceleration when he picks up and

92
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,780
that just makes all the difference in

93
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,889
terms of feeling good about the

94
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,299
character motion when you're moving

95
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,739
around he's already much more engaging

96
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,959
to move around than he was even with

97
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,849
just that simple change and so that's

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,408
more that's sort of what we need to be

99
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:24,358
focusing on what we need to be doing for

100
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:25,560
our player movement code certainly but

101
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,150
we're also trying to learn about vectors

102
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,979
here so what I want to do is is perhaps

103
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,900
talk a little bit more about some stuff

104
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,609
that we can do with the vector code to

105
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,620
sort of see how it works a little bit

106
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,859
starting to think about it in terms of

107
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,579
slightly higher level stuff okay so one

108
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,169
of the things that we we did in terms of

109
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,120
using the vector math may actually have

110
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,010
not been all that obvious and I sort of

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,180
mentioned at the end of last stream but

112
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,698
I want to mention it again because it's

113
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,260
very important is you'll notice that

114
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,909
when I did all that talking about the

115
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:57,539
equations of motion yesterday and I sort

116
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:59,429
of was talking about how a little bit of

117
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,900
a fat finger type is there when I was

118
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,060
talking about how we were gonna do the

119
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,289
equations of motion and then we typed

120
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,060
them in and we did the equations of

121
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:07,289
motion just like I derived them and they

122
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,219
work the first time we just typed them

123
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,138
in and they worked perfectly it was

124
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,669
great and then we tuned the constants to

125
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:13,530
make the motion be what we wanted it to

126
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,930
be in terms of how fast accelerates and

127
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,759
how much drag he has that sort of stuff

128
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,918
well what turns out to be the case is

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,199
all of that derivation that I actually

130
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,159
did I just kind of did it as if it was

131
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,860
scalar right when we did

132
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,150
integrals and stuff and we did the work

133
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,650
on the equations of motion never did I

134
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:33,029
actually ever say that we were working

135
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,919
in vectors at all we were basically just

136
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,059
working with scalars and so when we

137
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,500
typed in this equation we essentially

138
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,149
just typed in a scalar equation right

139
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,560
all we did was just solve you know we

140
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:42,659
basically worked out some scalar

141
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,009
equations in Crete there right when we

142
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,620
were when we were drawing them out and

143
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,689
then we typed them into something that

144
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,480
is essentially a 2d process right this

145
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,160
guy can go in you know in any direction

146
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,319
he wants in this 2d plane here right

147
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,060
he's totally smoothly moving in 2d and

148
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,519
we didn't have to really account for

149
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,810
that at all right we we totally just

150
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,250
were able to work with those equations

151
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,019
just like they were scheduled at scalar

152
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,310
equations and then we plugged them into

153
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,139
something that was using vectors and

154
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,810
they just worked and that's kind of

155
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,789
again just a little bit of a slight hint

156
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,740
about why you should always care about

157
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,330
things like you know sort of these more

158
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,579
powerful math objects it's just because

159
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:19,229
they allow us to do things like that

160
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:20,849
where we can simplify thinking about

161
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,170
stuff instead of having to think about

162
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,420
the X's and the Y's and the Z's and

163
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,879
whatever we can just think about sort of

164
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,290
abstract quantities and know that they

165
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,089
will apply now there's some times that

166
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,860
we have to think about things and know

167
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:32,909
that they're actually vectors and so

168
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,379
there's things we have to learn in the

169
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,150
math that actually depend on the fact

170
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,439
that things are vectors but for a lot of

171
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:38,909
the time you can actually think about

172
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,490
scalar and vector interchangeably and

173
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:47,730
that's very powerful so yeah so there

174
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:49,439
you go so what I thought we might do

175
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,580
today and someone actually mentioned

176
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,860
this on the stream so that was kind of

177
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:56,339
fun is I was thinking that it might be

178
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,800
useful to a good a good thing to learn

179
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,689
about vectors would be to sort of see

180
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,970
how we would do a bounce how we would do

181
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:04,319
a like a bounce off the wall for example

182
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,300
so when this guy comes down here if you

183
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,610
were to bounce and his velocity would be

184
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,780
reflected you know in the other

185
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,280
direction right

186
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:16,079
and so what I was thinking about is

187
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,668
maybe we'll just construct I mean

188
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,959
there's a couple things we could do but

189
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,569
I think maybe we'll just construct that

190
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,789
case we'll just say when our hero here

191
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,949
hits the wall we want him to bounce off

192
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,240
of it as if he were you know sort of a

193
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,649
bouncing ball that was one thing I was

194
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,210
thinking we could do and another thing

195
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:33,599
that I would like to do maybe is make an

196
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:35,668
actual jump for him where even though I

197
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,100
don't anticipate this character jumping

198
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:39,779
on command he is going to have to hop

199
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,800
and so coding in a jump

200
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,939
it's gonna be interesting as well

201
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,350
because that kind of involves this

202
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,550
concept of height off of the ground

203
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,170
which is something I also want to get

204
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,720
into so you have a couple of things we

205
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,770
can do and I think maybe the bouncing

206
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,300
would be an interesting one of those

207
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:53,370
because it allows us to talk about some

208
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,720
of the vector math now we probably won't

209
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,699
actually want the character to bounce

210
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,870
off the walls in the future because that

211
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,289
doesn't make a whole lot of sense for

212
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,329
him to do but we will want things to

213
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,740
bounce off walls almost certainly and so

214
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,459
we need to learn how to do this code one

215
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,509
way or the other

216
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,889
all right so if I go over here and start

217
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,810
to construct the case so we can start

218
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,610
talking about that let's think about

219
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,970
what we have right so let's say I've got

220
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,860
a wall here right there's my wall and I

221
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,290
want to start to think about what's

222
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,270
gonna happen when this fellow bounces

223
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,090
off of it right and so I'm gonna imagine

224
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:29,069
just for sake of simplicity here I'm

225
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:30,810
gonna say that the bounce point is that

226
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,879
the origin of the world right this is at

227
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,589
zero zero right it doesn't really matter

228
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,060
because that's a free translation I

229
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,439
could move everything in the world such

230
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,180
that that were true for the purposes of

231
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,399
doing this computation right and then

232
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,720
move it back afterwards so translation I

233
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,189
can always translate things to a

234
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,229
convenient location if I want to so I'm

235
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:47,490
just gonna simplify things by saying

236
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:49,439
that that's what's going to happen and

237
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,728
so what I want to do is I want to say

238
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,500
that there's going to be some kind of

239
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,959
inbound vector here right there's going

240
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,279
to be an inbound vector and what we want

241
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,500
to do is we want to take this inbound

242
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,699
vector and we want to reflect it well

243
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,220
it's hard to draw today for some reason

244
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,050
I can't seem to draw good lines today we

245
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,729
want to reflect it out the other way

246
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,620
right the the sort of the notion of

247
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:10,909
what's gonna happen when you do a bounce

248
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,199
is something coming in is going to get

249
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,810
reflected at almost as if this thing was

250
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,719
a mirror right and so we want to think

251
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,089
about the incoming vector as somehow

252
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,100
giving us the information that we would

253
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,489
need to compute whatever the outbound

254
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,410
vector is right and so what exactly is

255
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,590
happening here in in terms of this

256
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,330
impact in response right well there's

257
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,740
some things that we probably aren't

258
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,389
going to think about really like I said

259
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,830
we're not doing deformable dynamics so

260
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,509
like the fact that some when something

261
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,589
hits something else that makes a dent or

262
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:42,418
things like that we're not really gonna

263
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,680
think about at this point but we are

264
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:46,139
gonna think about is the fact that

265
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,179
whatever is sort of the the velocity

266
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,699
that comes in here in some sense that

267
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,838
velocity has to be conserved right

268
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,190
there's there's a certain amount of

269
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,690
physics involved

270
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,970
we've got a certain amount of velocity

271
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,790
coming in we do expect that amount of

272
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,800
velocity to be the same leaving right

273
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,169
because of conservation momentum and so

274
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,209
on all of your your nice physics laws -

275
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,759
however much energy goes into this

276
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,070
impact right so there is probably going

277
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,750
to be some amount of energy lost in the

278
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,790
fact that you do make a dent and so on

279
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,429
and so we may want to simulate that as

280
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:20,459
well that loss of energy that that comes

281
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:22,439
in here in addition to what's going to

282
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,440
happen otherwise even if we don't

283
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,760
simulate modifying the wall we may want

284
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,200
to make the bounce more realistic by

285
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,419
saying that it doesn't bounce off at

286
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,060
full speed it loses some of its energy

287
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,099
in that impact right now what's

288
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,529
happening when this thing hits this wall

289
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,360
right well one of the interesting things

290
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,459
about this is this case starts to talk

291
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,110
about vectors in terms of their

292
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,410
components and it's kind of interesting

293
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:49,139
to sort of see what's going on there

294
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:51,089
well what's going to happen is if I look

295
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,559
at I know that this vector is composed

296
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,450
of two pieces right because we've talked

297
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,459
about this quite a bit it's composed of

298
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,580
its Y portion and it's composed of its

299
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,600
exporter right and if I think about what

300
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,990
happens to this vector

301
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,970
well the wall is only stopping one of

302
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,850
those portions right it's only stopping

303
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,370
the Y portion right so if I wanted to

304
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,399
reflect this guy I really don't want to

305
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,019
stop his X motion at all his X motion

306
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,720
could continue just as it was because

307
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,220
there is no wall horizontally here to

308
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,420
prevent him from going somewhere it's

309
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,830
only this this wall here that's

310
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,899
preventing him from moving vertically

311
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,180
right and so I could think about taking

312
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,980
this vector this velocity vector this is

313
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,349
the speed at which he's coming in right

314
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,300
and I could take that velocity vector

315
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,620
and just think about flipping it right

316
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,629
because this is the vector you know I'm

317
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,339
if it was based up here that's that's

318
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:41,370
that's not really the vector right the

319
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,020
vectors actual value is whatever these

320
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,310
two components are so if I think of the

321
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,980
vectors being really at the origin it

322
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,359
actually looks like this right and so

323
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,820
what I want to do is preserve this

324
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,399
amount right so this outgoing vector

325
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,470
here is going to have this amount right

326
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,569
here this X amount it's going to have

327
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,710
the same as the incoming the outgoing

328
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,530
velocity is going to have the same as

329
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,629
the incoming right but it's it's Y

330
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,189
component is gonna actually just be the

331
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,899
negative right you can kind of see that

332
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,459
whatever we thought however

333
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,818
faster moving in that direction we're

334
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,768
gonna flip it up to here right and again

335
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:15,899
we could after we compute this vector we

336
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,879
could do various things to to talk about

337
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,799
like treating it as if some energy was

338
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,688
absorbed in the impact we could lessen

339
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,278
the amount that it that it bounces this

340
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:25,019
way we could just lessen that speed and

341
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,088
in general if we want to go in the same

342
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,409
direction but lessen it so we could

343
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:30,660
think about various things to do here

344
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:32,749
and that is how we would do that bounce

345
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:35,789
right but there's something interesting

346
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:37,139
that I've baked in here and this is the

347
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,549
part where it starts to get because I

348
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,110
mean if you were to look at this you'd

349
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:41,639
say oh well based on that description KC

350
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,318
it's pretty easy to understand what's

351
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,119
going on if this is the incoming

352
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:46,498
velocity so this is the old velocity and

353
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:49,050
I want to complete compute that new

354
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:50,850
velocity right what would I do

355
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:54,269
well I just told you what to do right if

356
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,860
V right is equal to V X V Y right it's

357
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,539
got two components got the X component

358
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,579
the last seen the Y component I just

359
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:02,399
said well the new ones gonna have the

360
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:05,188
same X and it's just gonna have a

361
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,328
negative Y I I mean I just I pointed

362
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:07,919
that out in the diagram it's kind of

363
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:09,419
obvious right that's not what you do so

364
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,740
why are we talking about this and in

365
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:11,759
fact it doesn't even look like a vector

366
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,068
operation it just looks like we're

367
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,240
operating on the scalars again you know

368
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,248
and at this point you're just like I'm

369
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,568
gonna go watch John play nuclear thrown

370
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:20,278
on the other channel because frankly

371
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,299
you're not teaching about vectors at all

372
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,389
you're teaching about scalars and I

373
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:29,639
already know about scalars fair enough

374
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:32,490
but there is a rub here what I drew was

375
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,139
the convenient diagram where the axis

376
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,990
along which we were doing this

377
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:41,789
reflection was aligned with one of the

378
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:45,568
primary axes right X happens to be the

379
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:48,208
wall and that is why it is why that can

380
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:51,599
simply be negated what were to happen if

381
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:55,018
we had the same situation right even

382
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,199
still at the origin let's say but now I

383
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,688
have a slightly inclined wall right and

384
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,938
so I'm actually talking about a wall

385
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:06,058
with this normal to it right this is the

386
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:07,558
sort of it'd be the the surface pointing

387
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:09,539
out of the surface of the wall right

388
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:11,458
whereas here the Y axis was supporting

389
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,428
out of the surface of the wall and now

390
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,469
I've got this incoming thing right well

391
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:18,688
now if I were to take that incoming

392
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,209
thing and put it put it here right and

393
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:23,309
look at what I want to have

394
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:25,528
in terms of that reflection about the

395
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,259
wall because this is the wall right this

396
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:29,129
is no longer the wall this is the wall

397
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,708
well what am I going to do

398
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:33,208
that's not the y-component anymore right

399
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,679
these things have drastically different

400
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,969
like components there's the y component

401
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,039
of that one there's the Y component this

402
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,370
one ain't no negative gonna fix that

403
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:42,569
problem right you are not the man now

404
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,440
dog if you think that you're going to do

405
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:48,890
this right to solve this problem and so

406
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,910
this presents us with our first sort of

407
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,750
point where we have to start thinking

408
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:57,419
about vectors in terms of actual in

409
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,708
terms of the actual structure of them in

410
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,990
terms of the actual fact that they are

411
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,278
vectors and not just scalars because now

412
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,470
we have to start thinking about how do

413
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:07,439
we work with vectors in ways that do not

414
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:10,080
involve falling back to the scalars when

415
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,820
we need to do something on just one part

416
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,250
of them in just one piece of them right

417
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,370
and so the answer is simply that we need

418
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,559
to get familiar with remember I don't

419
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,909
know if you guys if you guys were with

420
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,049
me the whole time then you remember me

421
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:24,569
talking about something called the

422
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:26,099
Hadamard product right and I don't

423
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,200
remember if I is it two DS I don't even

424
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,540
remember is it that way

425
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,770
or is it that way I don't actually know

426
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:33,328
but I talked about the head of my

427
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,250
product and I said well that's what

428
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:37,169
happens you know if I have two vectors

429
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,250
and I want to multiply them together I

430
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,649
don't really want to right cross them to

431
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,539
write that if I have two vectors and I

432
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,339
want to do some kind of operation

433
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,199
between them that's multiplication well

434
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,630
one way to do it right is to multiply

435
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,450
the components together like so write a

436
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,070
times C and that goes in the X component

437
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,079
right and B times D goes in the Y

438
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,329
component that's called the Hadamard

439
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:00,059
product and that results in another

440
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:01,620
vector well that's really like I said

441
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:03,569
not that useful for a lot of the stuff

442
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,429
that we want to do so now it's time to

443
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,079
get acquainted with something that is

444
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:11,099
very useful for the things we want to do

445
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,899
and that is the inner product or better

446
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,220
known often times in game development

447
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:18,659
circles as the dot product okay that is

448
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,000
what is going to allow us to solve these

449
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:23,000
kinds of problems with relative ease

450
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,000
you'll notice I don't have almond milk

451
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,779
today I've got tea I'm doing some some

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,339
Bengals price

453
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:39,850
is that spacing what's happening right

454
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:41,170
now all right so excuse me let's take a

455
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,909
look at the dot product try to remember

456
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:44,259
these diagrams I don't have room for

457
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:48,519
everything so let's take a look at the

458
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:51,039
dot product what I wanted to do right is

459
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,240
I already showed you how to solve the

460
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,879
problem if everything were access

461
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,399
aligned and so what I really want to do

462
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,278
is I want to kind of have the ability to

463
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,350
make my own axis systems right like if I

464
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:04,600
could have just created a new axis

465
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,610
system that happened to be aligned with

466
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,850
the wall then I could have used the same

467
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,980
solution that I used before right

468
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,269
but I don't know how to do that and so

469
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,409
what we're gonna look at now is we're

470
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:16,419
gonna look at how to use the inner

471
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:19,149
product to do those sorts of things so

472
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:21,818
what is the inner product okay so if I

473
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:24,220
have two vectors right here's one vector

474
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:26,349
and then I'm gonna do this magical thing

475
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,589
the dot product I'm going to you the dot

476
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,050
product here if I have a B and I'm going

477
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:35,199
to do the dot product of a B with some

478
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:38,019
other vector CD right then what this

479
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,088
actually does is instead of producing

480
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,350
another vector meaning instead of

481
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,240
producing something like the Hadamard

482
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,620
product where it had two elements and it

483
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,198
was another vector just like the two

484
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,720
that came in this is actually going to

485
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:51,938
produce a single value as a result it's

486
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,730
going to contract these two vectors down

487
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:57,849
into a scalar and the way that it is

488
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,699
defined right is it is defined to be the

489
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,029
members multiplied by each other and

490
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:09,250
added right so it's a times C plus B

491
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:12,428
times D right it is a times C B times D

492
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,409
now this jumps ahead a little bit for me

493
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,538
to explain really how this is working

494
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,120
exactly because we haven't quite gotten

495
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:21,129
into matrix math yet but one thing that

496
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,259
is interesting to note and I'll kind of

497
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,510
show you how this this works is the way

498
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:27,669
matrices are multiplied it's actually

499
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,769
very easy and I alluded to it on an

500
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:31,899
earlier stream in fact but if we were to

501
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:34,418
think about these as matrices and we

502
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:36,189
were to think about this first the first

503
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,409
part of the dot product here this this

504
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,690
this fellow right here as being turned

505
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,460
from a column into a row so if we were

506
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,130
to think about it being aligned this way

507
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,230
right and then we take this guy

508
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,720
and we leave him as his columnar form

509
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,740
and we construct the multiplication of

510
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,000
these two in vector in matrix notation

511
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,250
while matrix multiplication is actually

512
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,288
very simple for each element that you

513
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,269
want to compute in the result you simply

514
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:03,730
it's basically just as easy as drawing a

515
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:05,769
line to find out where in each vector

516
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,900
you hit for the element now of course

517
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:10,058
there's only one element in this result

518
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,548
here if there was two matrices here we'd

519
00:18:10,058 --> 00:18:14,440
have more of them but then you just work

520
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:17,109
your way down starting from the outside

521
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,259
first right a and C you multiply them

522
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:23,859
together and then you add you go to the

523
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:27,099
next one down D and B right there we go

524
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:29,439
and that is the dot product right now

525
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:31,689
this works for vectors of any size it

526
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,640
doesn't matter how long they are right

527
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,230
it doesn't matter at all you still would

528
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,370
know exactly how to produce them because

529
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:43,659
as many as I have here de F right G H I

530
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:46,058
J okay well I just take the first ones I

531
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:49,299
multiply those together G a I take the

532
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:51,339
second ones right B H and I just

533
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:55,329
multiply an ad multiply an ad all the

534
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:57,579
way till I get to the end fnl right and

535
00:18:55,329 --> 00:19:01,529
that is how you can produce the product

536
00:18:57,579 --> 00:19:04,269
right very easy and so often times

537
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:06,038
there's the the operation of changing

538
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,079
something from a row oriented

539
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:10,029
orientation to a column orientation like

540
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,460
that it's called a transpose and so

541
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,319
oftentimes you will actually see the dot

542
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,990
product and it's called the inner

543
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,210
product as well like I said because of

544
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,859
this exact look how it looks like that

545
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,980
you're getting the sort of the the inner

546
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,908
portion here right it's I mean it's hard

547
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,990
to say without the mixture because

548
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,700
there's a thing called an outer product

549
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,980
as well if I were to flip these the

550
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,330
other way it would produce more values

551
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,769
in fact let me just show you cuz it's

552
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:38,349
kind of interesting if I were to flip

553
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:40,119
these the other way c/d a/b right I can

554
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,798
produce the outer product and again I

555
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:45,788
follow the same rules do that

556
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:47,288
intersection right C times a and that's

557
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:49,119
it there's nothing more to do in either

558
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:52,000
that row or the column right so that's

559
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,519
one entry in my resulting 2x2 matrix do

560
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,259
it again here D times a right there's

561
00:19:54,519 --> 00:20:01,619
another one C times B D times B

562
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,000
right you can learn matrix math in no

563
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,469
time because basically just learning

564
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,089
that is all you really need to know and

565
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,910
you can compute any matrix product that

566
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:10,230
you want but again until we actually

567
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,580
learn what any of these things do not

568
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,839
particular useful I just want to show

569
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:14,069
you that this is an outer product that's

570
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,029
an eery product you can kind of see why

571
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:17,009
it's called that because these two

572
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:18,899
things like kind of form the the smaller

573
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:21,839
space there and the larger space here

574
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,700
but anyway that's neither here nor there

575
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,409
all right so the inner product dot

576
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,298
product are oftentimes called the scalar

577
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,610
product as well because it produces a

578
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:32,700
single value no matter how big the

579
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:35,519
vectors are is something that is of

580
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,750
great utility and it may not seem like a

581
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,339
very useful thing right now because

582
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,710
you're looking at that going why would I

583
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:43,048
ever care about that at all

584
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,730
but the truth is it's actually quite

585
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:46,889
useful and the reason that's quite

586
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,500
useful is because this value despite its

587
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,290
innocuous look actually computes to

588
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,058
something very handy based on what these

589
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,740
vectors actually are so let's take a

590
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:57,089
look at what that actually is and I

591
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,519
won't probably go through the trouble of

592
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,990
proving it on because math proofs are

593
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,019
only interesting to some people

594
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,029
sometimes but point being I'll show you

595
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,470
the sort of the intuitive stuff and how

596
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:09,808
to think about it and if you want to

597
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,710
know the proofs I can actually maybe we

598
00:21:09,808 --> 00:21:13,649
can talk about the on forums or

599
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,740
something like that anyway so the dot

600
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,880
product if I have two vectors so I'm

601
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,519
going to go ahead and say that my

602
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:27,780
vectors are now a equals ax okay Y right

603
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:30,769
and B equals BX and B Y right these are

604
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,289
my two vectors and somewhere in space

605
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:35,849
right I'm gonna think about these guys

606
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:40,710
here's my coordinate system and I've got

607
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:42,569
two vectors okay like so now when you

608
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,429
compute the dot product again often

609
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,259
written as as this because of that

610
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,850
transpose the T means the transpose

611
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,250
remember I'm turning one on its side and

612
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:52,079
then multiplying to get that thing

613
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,089
oftentimes written like this can also be

614
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,349
written just as a dot and so on there's

615
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:57,599
there's lots of different ways to notate

616
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,189
it I tend to use that one a transpose

617
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,109
because that's just the same in matrix

618
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,289
notation so that's the dot product there

619
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:07,859
right so that which again is just going

620
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:10,759
to be ax BX + a YB Y that's the entirety

621
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:12,178
of it right that's all it is that

622
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:14,220
quantity

623
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,639
actually equals something rather useful

624
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,220
it turns out that it's equal to however

625
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:21,808
long and this is one way that length is

626
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,960
often written so I'm just gonna write it

627
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:26,940
that way for now however long a is right

628
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,480
and so I'm gonna call this a and this B

629
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:35,070
over here however long a is scaler wise

630
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,860
right times however long B is scaler

631
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:41,220
wise right so that length here so this

632
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:44,609
this guy is that length and this guy is

633
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,190
that like there right times the cosine

634
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:49,769
of the angle between them so these two

635
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,409
guys here they've got this angle here

636
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:54,388
you're right let's call that theta the

637
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:56,429
angle between the two vectors whatever

638
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:58,349
its cosine is times the length of B

639
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:59,759
times the length of a that equals this

640
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:01,109
quantity because remember this is a

641
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,909
scalar because this is a scalar like

642
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:05,548
that's how long a is this is how long P

643
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,980
is and this is how long and this is the

644
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:13,980
cosine of the angle between them right

645
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:16,618
well again if you want to prove this you

646
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,909
use the law of cosines if you know

647
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:19,230
geometry I'm not going to do it right

648
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,909
now but basically you can prove this

649
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,079
using the law of cosines if you're

650
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:26,039
interesting that you can go check it out

651
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:28,648
but anyway that this quantity constructs

652
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:31,528
that actual identity right it actually

653
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:34,589
this scalar value equals this scalar

654
00:23:31,528 --> 00:23:36,839
value and with just that just that one

655
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:39,599
relation we can do some incredibly

656
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:42,269
powerful stuff actually

657
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:45,329
so what stuff can we do well for

658
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:47,579
starters what if we wanted to know the

659
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:50,788
length of a vector like I want to know

660
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:52,168
how long a is right well there's two

661
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:54,778
ways we could think about doing that

662
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:56,340
right one is that I told you about the

663
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:58,919
Pythagorean theorem the other day right

664
00:23:56,339 --> 00:24:01,408
so we could take here's a X here's a Y

665
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:05,038
we want to know this length here we

666
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:07,409
could do ax squared plus ay Y squared

667
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,319
equals whatever the length of a is

668
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:11,820
squared right and so that is how we

669
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,368
would compute that length we would route

670
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:16,888
this so we would go okay route ax

671
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:19,038
squared plus ay Y squared equals length

672
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:22,048
of a right that's what we would do and

673
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,940
that is one way to compute the length of

674
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:24,358
a in terms of thinking about how it's

675
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,370
done

676
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:28,048
right another way we could think about

677
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,269
it's done is just by using this equation

678
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:34,200
we have something in it with the length

679
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:37,589
of a right so what if we were just a

680
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,788
take instead of doing a transpose a and

681
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:40,199
take I'm saying instead of taking a

682
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:42,419
transpose B and taking the dot product

683
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,600
with B what if we just take the dot

684
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,640
product of a with itself right well if I

685
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,399
take a transpose a just following this

686
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,770
equation I would get the length of a

687
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,298
time's the length of a again times the

688
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:56,220
cosine of the angle between it and

689
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:59,519
itself now we know that the angle

690
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,100
between itself is 0 right so what's the

691
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,859
cosine of 0 well for those of you who

692
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:06,538
don't remember your sines and cosines

693
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:08,639
all right you know who you are out there

694
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,288
I'm gonna draw the circle you could

695
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,149
always draw the circle if you get scared

696
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,220
right you could always draw the circle

697
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:18,058
this is the starting point on the circle

698
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,850
right we wind up to here right that's 90

699
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:24,119
degrees we wind to here that's 180 we

700
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:26,609
wind to here right that's 270 line to

701
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,829
here and that's 360 again right this is

702
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:30,000
0 similarly if you're doing this with

703
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:33,148
radians if you guys remember your

704
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,740
radians it's 2pi out here right so this

705
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:36,989
is gonna be PI over here and this is PI

706
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,319
over 2 right and this is 3 PI over 2

707
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,298
remember the circle as we work around

708
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,950
the circle right the cosine is the

709
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:45,538
x-coordinate of the point of the circle

710
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,548
and the sine is the y-coordinate of the

711
00:25:45,538 --> 00:25:50,009
circle so if I was at 0 which is right

712
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:51,509
here right well there ain't no

713
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:53,190
y-coordinate there's just the

714
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,919
x-coordinate and the x-coordinate is all

715
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:59,759
the way out right so the cosine of 0

716
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:03,419
equals 1 right cosine of 90 equals 0

717
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:06,179
cosine of 180 negative 1 right comes

718
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,320
back around and so on hopefully your

719
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,940
guys are all familiar with that if

720
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:14,730
you're not get used to your unit circle

721
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:18,298
unit circle is the man now dog is is

722
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:20,940
good ok unit circle good all right

723
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:23,069
so if I do this and I know that this is

724
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,048
one because there's no angle between a

725
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:27,178
and a is always 0 right it sits right on

726
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:28,589
top of itself I know that falls out and

727
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,548
I just get length of a times like today

728
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:35,129
which means a ta equals a squared right

729
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:38,279
so the square root of the dot product of

730
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,230
a with itself is the length of a not

731
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,329
surprising because guess what

732
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,890
this is the equation for the dot product

733
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:46,019
right what would happen if these were

734
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,630
AIDS it'd be a x squared plus ay Y

735
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,160
squared exactly what was on inside my

736
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,480
Pythagorean theorem the Pythagorean

737
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,308
theorem the dot product are very

738
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,150
intimately related right and you can see

739
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:58,529
that okay so what else can I do with

740
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,759
this surely I did not spend all that

741
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,990
time teaching you how to do something

742
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,190
that you already knew how to do and that

743
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,669
we already did yesterday and that's

744
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,410
correct

745
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:08,610
I didn't there's a lot more stuff in

746
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,910
here that we can use all right what is

747
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:12,209
it

748
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:15,390
ooh whoops didn't mean to quite get that

749
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,950
over zealous all right there we go all

750
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,360
right so what is it that we can do with

751
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,140
that right what is it that we can do

752
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:26,579
with a transpose a equals length of a

753
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:28,559
length of B cosine theta well the cosine

754
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:34,678
theta is the part that really comes in

755
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:37,769
particularly handy right the reason that

756
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,019
that comes in particularly handy is

757
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:41,490
because when we start to think about the

758
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,679
cosine of the angle between those two

759
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:48,240
vectors right if we start to think about

760
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,280
what that actually means well what if we

761
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,079
could take one of these guys out of the

762
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,200
equation essentially what if we could

763
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,869
just say a priori let's take B and let's

764
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,298
say B is a unit vector right a unit

765
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:05,879
vector is a vector with length 1 right

766
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:08,759
so if I said the length of B was 1 it's

767
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,150
one unit long then it would drop out of

768
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:15,440
here right and if B is length 1 then we

769
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:18,419
get a transpose B equals a cosine theta

770
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,019
right that's what we're actually going

771
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:24,690
to get so what does that actually do for

772
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:25,650
us why would I care about that well the

773
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,900
reason I would care about that is

774
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,090
because imagine that now we have our

775
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,600
wall again right that well we were

776
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:35,699
talking about

777
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:38,428
suppose we had write a unit vector that

778
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,860
was pointing the direction away from the

779
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:44,460
wall right just suppose that's something

780
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:47,159
we had well now if I have some other

781
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,470
vector right I've got this vector here

782
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,740
that's you know this guy's doing his his

783
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,610
incoming bounce right and so this is the

784
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,259
vector that

785
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:59,000
that incoming velocity this is that

786
00:28:55,259 --> 00:29:01,829
incoming velocity so here's my vector B

787
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,390
right in this case and I guess in this

788
00:29:01,829 --> 00:29:04,859
case I want to say that this is a for

789
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,009
our equation right so I didn't come lots

790
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:09,389
of these a well if you take a look at

791
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:12,029
what actually happens to these two

792
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,710
vectors I know that the length of B is

793
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:16,079
out of it so the result is going to be

794
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,579
however long a is which is this with it

795
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,490
which is this length right here right

796
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:22,470
but multiplied by the cosine of the

797
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,839
angle between the two vectors right and

798
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,569
that cosine again is going to be this

799
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,709
this right here right and to see this a

800
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:30,240
little bit better maybe it's kind of

801
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,340
hard on the diagram let me do it with a

802
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,740
more you know perhaps a slightly more

803
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:40,168
acute way let me put it up bring it out

804
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:42,359
here right so that we don't have to have

805
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:43,530
it sort of be bent back let's suppose

806
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,418
that they were more like this so they're

807
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,069
a little easier to see right so I know

808
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,960
my result my result is gonna have the

809
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:51,869
length of a in it but I also now the

810
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,700
cosine of these these that's between

811
00:29:51,869 --> 00:29:58,319
these is now gonna multiply it out and

812
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:00,419
what does the cosine of M of a triangle

813
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,069
do for us right what does the cosine of

814
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,419
a right triangle do for us now you

815
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,849
should remember this again from your

816
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:07,679
from your grade school trig right what

817
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:10,199
does the cosine of a right triangle give

818
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,130
us right well it gives us this it gives

819
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,558
us this edge right here

820
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:16,500
if this is the hypotenuse right then

821
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,779
this is cosine theta H and this is sine

822
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,190
theta H right that's that's exactly what

823
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,259
that gives us it gives us the length of

824
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,330
that side and the sine gives us the

825
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,160
length of the other side right times the

826
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,240
hypotenuse however long it was again

827
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,890
this is stuff you should hopefully all

828
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,589
remember from your grade school trig

829
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,929
well what did that construct up here if

830
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:36,959
I was to build that right triangle right

831
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:39,480
that's built off of this angle I'm

832
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,880
getting this I'm getting this amount

833
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,069
right here right that's what I'd be

834
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,020
getting because I know that I've taken

835
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:48,298
the length of a into account it's right

836
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,460
here and I know I've taken that cosine

837
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:53,940
ratio into account right here so this is

838
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,829
just like here just like H cosine theta

839
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,450
gives me the length of this side in that

840
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:59,759
standard right triangles are used to

841
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,370
length of a cosine theta gives me

842
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,579
however long this guy is projected

843
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:06,268
effectively on to this vector so a

844
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:08,189
transfer

845
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:10,319
B is actually extraordinary powerful

846
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,080
because what it lets me do is it lets me

847
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:16,079
take any unit vector that I want anyone

848
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:17,788
and then for any other vector no matter

849
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,678
how long it is or what its shape is or

850
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:21,929
what its direction is and project it

851
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,048
down to see where it would land on that

852
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:27,419
vector right now you can imagine this

853
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:30,989
getting even more powerful what if I had

854
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,479
another orthogonal vector right that was

855
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,759
perpendicular to B also unit length

856
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:37,769
let's say this was C so C is also unit

857
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,739
length if I took the dot product with

858
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:43,979
that I would now know both coordinates

859
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:46,409
of this a in a new fictional space that

860
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:48,659
I've constructed right instead of the x

861
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:51,119
and y axis being how things are measured

862
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:53,009
by taking both dot products I would

863
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:55,378
essentially create new coordinates for a

864
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:57,808
new coordinates in a in a coordinate

865
00:31:55,378 --> 00:32:00,238
system that I set up so essentially this

866
00:31:57,808 --> 00:32:03,269
a transpose B allows me to measure any

867
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:06,028
vector that I want on any axis system

868
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:07,828
that I want just by setting up two unit

869
00:32:06,028 --> 00:32:08,759
vectors that are orthogonal to each

870
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,788
other that are you know that are

871
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,828
perpendicular right so imagine I want to

872
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:15,749
do this what are the coordinates of a in

873
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:16,979
this new magical reference frame this BC

874
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:18,989
radical reference frame the knife that

875
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:21,119
I've constructed right well I just said

876
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:23,190
what they were they're a transpose B for

877
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:24,689
the x coordinate if this is my new x

878
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,548
axis I don't know maybe it's not maybe

879
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,349
that's this should be the x axis because

880
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:31,108
it's right hand rule right going that

881
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:32,999
way so this is actually not quite right

882
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:35,398
let's say that that's a transpose C

883
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:37,469
right is my x coordinate and a transpose

884
00:32:35,398 --> 00:32:39,808
B is my y coordinate that's the new

885
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:43,548
vector and that tells me the coordinates

886
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:46,348
of a in this space makes sense right

887
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:49,679
okay so hopefully you're clear on that

888
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:51,989
and again you know I work through all of

889
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,429
it to show you how that actually happens

890
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:55,950
giving you the right triangle and so on

891
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:57,389
but what you really again you want to

892
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:58,558
internalize that and you want to spend

893
00:32:57,388 --> 00:33:00,208
as much time as necessary to get

894
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,608
familiar with these guys but the

895
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:05,459
important takeaway conceptually right is

896
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:07,888
that measuring process okay it's that

897
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:15,058
measuring process it's saying that a

898
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:17,638
vector right dot a unit axis equals the

899
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:19,049
coordinate of that vector along that

900
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:22,359
axis

901
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:24,789
makes sense now this works even for the

902
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,379
axes we already have so if we were to

903
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:28,720
actually take the x-axis and the y-axis

904
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,750
and do this we'd get the right answers

905
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,880
why because what is the x-axis right

906
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,829
what is the y-axis well if we

907
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,510
represented them as vectors we'd get 0 1

908
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:39,730
for the y-axis right there's no X

909
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:42,250
component and it's going 1 and Y and for

910
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,230
the X we'd get 1 0 well what happens if

911
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,710
I dot product those with some vector in

912
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,990
the space right if I have a X here and a

913
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,670
Y what happens if I dot that with one of

914
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,670
these well you should be able to do that

915
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,400
right away you know it's ax times 1 so

916
00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:00,070
that's ax and a watt plus ay Y times 0

917
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,660
which is 0 so it's just ax which is the

918
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:03,609
x coordinate of the vector in that space

919
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,580
same is true if you did it for Y right

920
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:08,319
so this is like the universal measuring

921
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:10,139
operator it has a lot of other uses

922
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,010
besides that and we'll see them later on

923
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,450
but that's the one that we're going to

924
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,240
talk about right now because with that

925
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:17,859
in mind with that power the old thing

926
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,089
that looks so complicated where how are

927
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,990
we going to deal with this arbitrary

928
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:25,000
wall becomes trivial right totally

929
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:27,099
trivial now so let's go back to our

930
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,329
diagram that we had before and see if

931
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,940
with the dot product we can now solve

932
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:34,659
the problem that was so sort of weird

933
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:37,090
before and difficult hit that in there

934
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:39,340
right so what I'm going to say is for

935
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,840
any wall in order to do a reflection off

936
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,250
of it all I need to know is I need to

937
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,169
know a unit vector that points out of

938
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:47,199
the wall right also called the normal of

939
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:49,269
the surface oftentimes right so there's

940
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,099
my there's my reflection and I'm just

941
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:52,690
gonna call that I'll just call that W

942
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:54,759
for now right we'll call that our wall

943
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,740
vector maybe I'll call it a reflection

944
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,940
vector trying to call it R I don't know

945
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:00,009
it's kind of cells like rotation we'll

946
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,769
call it our and what we have to say is

947
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:05,740
are the length of R is going to be 1 R

948
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:07,179
is a unit vector ok so now I take

949
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:09,759
anything that comes in that I want to

950
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:12,099
reflect any vector right so this is my V

951
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,390
this is my velocity right and again I'm

952
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:15,429
drawing it coming in here because that's

953
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:17,679
the physical version of the diagram but

954
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:19,000
really any vector is you know if we

955
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,309
think about it it's at the origin right

956
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,809
so this is actually my V and now what I

957
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:24,460
want to do is I want to reflect that

958
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:26,320
around here I want to reflect that

959
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,170
around here so what do I need to do to

960
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,700
reflect it well I said before that what

961
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,730
I need to do reflected isn't a gate its

962
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:34,009
y-component

963
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,260
was lined up with the y-axis right so

964
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,390
all we need to do now is figure out what

965
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,320
part of it we actually would need to

966
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:44,629
negate in this new axis system right if

967
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,109
this were the y-coordinate so how do we

968
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,760
do that

969
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:50,659
well I just said I can measure any

970
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,820
vector along along a you know another

971
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:55,879
unit vector which is what I have so if I

972
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:59,510
take the transpose R right if I take

973
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:03,740
that that will project me onto that

974
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:05,450
vector right so V transpose R gives me

975
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:07,189
this vector

976
00:36:05,449 --> 00:36:09,460
well actually it gives me a scalar right

977
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:12,650
it gives me a scalar which is how long

978
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,170
this actually is along that along that

979
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:17,389
vector right so now the question is

980
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:20,750
that's the quantity I need to negate

981
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:23,349
right I need to make sure my feet my new

982
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,730
V my V prime right my new velocity

983
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,409
basically is the negative of that it's

984
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,539
going upwards but this is a scalar

985
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:32,420
quantity it's just a number it's the

986
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:34,250
measure along here how do I actually I

987
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,200
need a whole vector for reflection I

988
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,920
need to construct this whole vector so

989
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:40,460
what do I do

990
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,940
well it's pretty easy right if I were to

991
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,409
start

992
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:49,760
mm-hmm if I were to start by saying well

993
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:51,799
alright I have my V right I now need to

994
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,660
change it so that I'm going to get it so

995
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,670
that it reflects through here I just

996
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:57,500
need to add something to it right that's

997
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,990
going to move it up so that it will have

998
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,530
that reflection and I know exactly what

999
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:05,779
that quantity is my V transpose R is the

1000
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,950
length along R that this was right and

1001
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,210
that's going to be negative obviously

1002
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:11,239
because we know it's going into the wall

1003
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:15,019
so that's going to be negative so if I

1004
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:17,599
multiply that scalar times R times the

1005
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:20,389
actual did the the actual wall

1006
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,670
reflection direction right that gives me

1007
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:25,400
a vector that gives me essentially this

1008
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:27,019
vector right here right that's that's

1009
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,570
actually the vector now not just the

1010
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:32,179
length so all I have to do to reflect

1011
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:35,480
this across it is just subtract two of

1012
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:37,819
those right just to move it up to here

1013
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,769
first and then up to here a second if I

1014
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,359
just subtract two of those I will flip

1015
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:43,460
the vector around and have it go out in

1016
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,730
the other direction right so again just

1017
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,800
constructing it very much like it just

1018
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,530
what I want to do with it so I take the

1019
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,900
old V and I subtract two times this

1020
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:57,220
quantity over here right where I've got

1021
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:59,380
my V transpose R times R right that will

1022
00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:00,669
start at my V that will figure out how

1023
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,490
long it is along the reflection vector

1024
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,960
it'll move me back to the even line this

1025
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,899
will move me back to the wall this first

1026
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,820
one right and then by doing two I then

1027
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,680
move myself basically to the mirror

1028
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,789
position and this was a bad drawing of

1029
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,049
where that would be it would actually be

1030
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:17,289
like over here or something right

1031
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,970
so my new V prime is just that that's

1032
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:21,190
the entirety that's all I have to do I

1033
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:23,799
have to take my incoming velocity I just

1034
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,920
have to subtract twice

1035
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,810
whatever that measure was along along

1036
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,730
the reflection vector and then move it

1037
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:33,670
in that direction along the reflection

1038
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,840
vector right makes sense that is of

1039
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,519
course if I've done the math right like

1040
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,800
I said I'm horrible at math so anytime

1041
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,630
we compute something like that we need

1042
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,830
to then go test to see if I'm right

1043
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:52,000
because a lot of times I'll just make a

1044
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:56,619
straight-up mistake okay you know I just

1045
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,260
realized I just realized my my Linux has

1046
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:00,750
hung completely which is unfortunate to

1047
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,340
say the very least

1048
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,710
all right well that's all right we'll go

1049
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,120
ahead and get that rebooting and has not

1050
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,889
been a good week for a Linux ladies and

1051
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,909
gentlemen it has not been a good week

1052
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:17,019
for Linux my Linux crashes all the time

1053
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:18,759
now it's very unfortunate anyway so this

1054
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:20,199
is what we need to implement and all we

1055
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,150
really need to do is anytime we want to

1056
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,549
bounce something we can just go ahead

1057
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,079
and say let's go ahead and define some

1058
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,460
unit vector in the direction we want to

1059
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,340
bounce and we can bounce and now we are

1060
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,099
not restricted to just bouncing off of

1061
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,900
things that are going to be you know

1062
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:36,940
aligned with an axis system which would

1063
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,800
have gotten this a certain you know a

1064
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,380
certain degree of the way certainly

1065
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,690
right we totally could have bounced off

1066
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,910
just just you know the tile map edges

1067
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,769
using that but as soon as we want to do

1068
00:39:45,909 --> 00:39:49,029
something fancier it would not have

1069
00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:50,380
worked right because if we want to have

1070
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,720
a slant if some kind of a slanted wall

1071
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,610
in there or anything like that you know

1072
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,739
we'd be out of luck all right I'm gonna

1073
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,230
go ahead and take one second here to go

1074
00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:01,629
ahead and start the hex chat back

1075
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,469
up so I will actually be able to see

1076
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:08,680
questions at the end so sorry about that

1077
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:14,500
again not not the best situation for

1078
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:18,339
Linux let's see is it so hard people is

1079
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,630
it so hard it is apparently so hard okay

1080
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,960
hopefully that'll stay up long enough

1081
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:25,210
for me to answer the questions okay so

1082
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,130
let's go ahead and do that let's go

1083
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,840
ahead and just implement this so I now

1084
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:32,019
want to do a thing where I compute that

1085
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,280
bounce and in order to do that I know

1086
00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:37,869
that I need a dot product so we'll open

1087
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,050
up our math routines and add one so in

1088
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:44,950
line again it returns a scalar value

1089
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:46,180
inner product it takes two things and I

1090
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:47,949
might just call this inner because if

1091
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:50,108
you use it so often it's pretty obvious

1092
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:52,059
what it actually is and so the result

1093
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:55,590
here again very straightforward

1094
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:59,500
it's just ax times BX mmm

1095
00:40:55,590 --> 00:41:02,950
plus a Y times dy okay there we go

1096
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,539
I'm out there and so that's our that's

1097
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:06,460
our dot product inner products together

1098
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:07,719
product whatever you want to call it and

1099
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,699
that is what we're going to be computing

1100
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:12,429
to do our reflection code and so if we

1101
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:14,169
want to reflect here basically this is

1102
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:16,089
in the case of the tile point not being

1103
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,460
empty I guess what we could do is say

1104
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,140
alright then if the tile point is not

1105
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,970
going to be empty then we basically have

1106
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:23,949
to figure out what direction the wall

1107
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:25,179
was actually in which we haven't

1108
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:26,829
actually done yet but let's pretend that

1109
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:29,289
we do have that so we basically have our

1110
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:32,108
our again this is going to be some some

1111
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:34,239
value here which again is that our from

1112
00:41:32,108 --> 00:41:36,549
this equation and what we need to do is

1113
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,909
take our velocity which again we have is

1114
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:42,670
the game say D player P and what we need

1115
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:44,199
to do is reflect it about there so we

1116
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:47,320
need to do is say okay we've got the

1117
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:49,929
deep layer P and the new deep layer P

1118
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,150
for this frame or I guess have we

1119
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:54,339
actually retired the point yet for this

1120
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,500
frame we did the test so I guess it'll

1121
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,820
just be for next frame this is count so

1122
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,500
we take that deep layer P we're gonna

1123
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,530
have to work on this player motion code

1124
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,150
a bunch to say the least but anyway

1125
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:06,790
we're gonna take that old deep layer P

1126
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,700
we're going to subtract two times the

1127
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:12,759
inner product of whatever it actually is

1128
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:13,118
and our wall vector right and then we're

1129
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,680
going

1130
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,170
to multiply that by the wall vector

1131
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:19,929
itself right so there we go that's the

1132
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:22,358
actual equation that we need to use and

1133
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:23,498
oops those were lowercase they should

1134
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:26,460
not have been I wonder if I should make

1135
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:29,348
those lowercase that's a good question

1136
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,818
it lines up better with the shader code

1137
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:32,680
if you make them lower case because

1138
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:35,710
shaders have dot X dot Y of that sort of

1139
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,778
thing if that makes sense all right so

1140
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:38,858
what we need to now know is what

1141
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:41,139
actually is that

1142
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:42,608
so let's hard code it first to make sure

1143
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,058
that we actually have our stuff working

1144
00:42:42,608 --> 00:42:45,130
at all

1145
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:49,180
so if we actually want it to bounce off

1146
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:52,329
that bottom wall that bottom wall is

1147
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:54,338
going to be obviously just the just the

1148
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:55,749
y-axis so this should do this should do

1149
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:58,150
the initial thing that we just sort of

1150
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:59,409
said was what we would do if we didn't

1151
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,798
actually have the dot product or any of

1152
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:05,909
that stuff

1153
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:09,489
so let's see there we go of course

1154
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:11,768
that's pretty funny yeah so there we go

1155
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:13,979
no problems there seems to work pretty

1156
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:13,979
good

1157
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:19,568
of course I'm accelerating against it so

1158
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,088
I kind of do there we go

1159
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:22,960
yeah so that's pretty straightforward

1160
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:24,369
nothing much to see there now of course

1161
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,019
the problem would be if we actually do

1162
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:31,420
that we we would have the wrong we would

1163
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:33,368
have the entirely wrong behavior because

1164
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,499
we're not actually computing the wall

1165
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:37,269
correctly so we do need to do is figure

1166
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:39,639
out some way to actually figure out what

1167
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:41,738
the direction of the wall is that we ran

1168
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:43,900
into and I don't think we really know

1169
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:46,778
very much about how to do that at the

1170
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,180
moment I guess we would have to sort of

1171
00:43:46,778 --> 00:43:51,369
say well when we check these points

1172
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:53,558
right the new player P the player left

1173
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:56,670
and the player right we need to figure

1174
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:59,200
out which ones of them are are not

1175
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,519
actually allowed because we don't really

1176
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,838
have much in the way of collision code

1177
00:44:00,518 --> 00:44:03,459
at the moment we'd have to figure out

1178
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,558
which ones of those were

1179
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,409
interpenetrating and for whichever ones

1180
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:10,869
were interpenetrating we would then have

1181
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:14,078
to figure out which direction the step

1182
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:15,640
was between the current position and the

1183
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,259
new position like which which which

1184
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:19,328
direction we stepped in the tile map

1185
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:21,219
would tell us where the wall is and this

1186
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:22,480
is one reason why you know like I said

1187
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:23,858
later on I don't think we're gonna be

1188
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,028
doing any collision protection on tile

1189
00:44:23,858 --> 00:44:25,409
maps because it's just kind of annoying

1190
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:27,269
and

1191
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:28,769
I don't think there we probably want to

1192
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:33,210
have like a more interesting boundary

1193
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:37,199
around things so yeah so I wouldn't I

1194
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:39,840
wouldn't yeah I wouldn't basically I

1195
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,189
wouldn't basically put much much much

1196
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,990
weight into this this particular stuff

1197
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,119
but the bounce code is correct and so

1198
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:47,489
let's keep going with that anyway so

1199
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,309
let's say that what we do here is we

1200
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:52,639
take a look at these guys I guess we

1201
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:54,900
could just say whichever one of these

1202
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,190
yeah this is kind of ugly but let's just

1203
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,309
do it because we might as well we're

1204
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:04,200
here so we've got a bull 32 that's going

1205
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:06,179
to say you know I guess well you know

1206
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:07,319
what I don't even need one of those well

1207
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:10,079
I do yeah I do okay

1208
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,490
so we'll just say collided again this is

1209
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,809
really bad this is not at all what I

1210
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,159
would advise doing but I just want to

1211
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:16,349
we're working on the wall code right now

1212
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,719
so I don't really want to spend any time

1213
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:20,039
thinking about it I just want do

1214
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,109
something where we can get our wall out

1215
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:23,219
and go and since we know we're not going

1216
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:24,840
to be doing closed objective this way

1217
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:27,750
eventually it's not particularly

1218
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,030
interesting to me to think about it much

1219
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,440
more so basically if the tile map is not

1220
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:35,490
into their I'm gonna say collided equals

1221
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,550
true right like this and then I'm just

1222
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:43,649
essentially going to do that same thing

1223
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:46,200
here so player right right and player

1224
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:48,900
left so I'm just gonna take a look at

1225
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:50,339
those collided and if I did collide then

1226
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,519
what I'm gonna do here is see if there's

1227
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:58,380
a tile map position call P or whatever

1228
00:45:53,519 --> 00:46:00,150
and that's gonna equal that's gonna

1229
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,309
equal in the case of collision whatever

1230
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,880
we actually found was the collision and

1231
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:09,900
trigger right whoever actually collided

1232
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,420
and this will let me know what actually

1233
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,900
caused us to not move right and so this

1234
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:19,320
now becomes collided if we did not

1235
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,539
collide right then we can we can go

1236
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,820
ahead and do yeah we can go ahead and do

1237
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:25,440
our stuff and so that shouldn't change

1238
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,789
anything as it is right we should still

1239
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,789
be able to do whatever we were doing

1240
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:31,619
before but now we can compare and figure

1241
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:33,570
out what our where our wall actually is

1242
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:35,549
right so if we want to see where the

1243
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:37,710
wall is now we can essentially say well

1244
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:39,000
we know we collided right and so in some

1245
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,920
sense we could reverse the

1246
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,119
the sense of these so that we can get

1247
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,340
rid of that not there so you can

1248
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:46,349
actually see more cleanly if we collided

1249
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,390
with something we just need to figure

1250
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:51,000
out what our wall is to figure out what

1251
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:53,129
our wall is we then go all right

1252
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,679
we know coal P is the thing that

1253
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:58,920
collided so what we need to do is take

1254
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:03,419
whatever the player P is right whatever

1255
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:06,450
that whatever the player P currently is

1256
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:09,000
which is this guy and we just need to

1257
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:13,039
see what direction he was trying to go

1258
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,530
in the tile map right so if you remember

1259
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:19,170
here we have the tile map position we

1260
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:22,470
have ABS tau XY and Z so we just need to

1261
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:25,320
look and go alright if the ABS tile X is

1262
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:29,639
less than the abs tight X here then we

1263
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:33,000
know that this wall was a wall going in

1264
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:36,239
in sort of in descending the player was

1265
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,739
moving from a look to the left right the

1266
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,869
play the player hit hit a wall to the

1267
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:41,969
left and we could do the same stuff in

1268
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:46,289
all the directions if it's if it's

1269
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:48,509
greater than and if it's fat so on

1270
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:49,860
and since we can't really make anything

1271
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,670
collide diagonally at the moment we

1272
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,490
don't guess we don't really need to

1273
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:56,280
worry about that case but anyway here we

1274
00:47:53,489 --> 00:48:01,669
go we can basically do I think people

1275
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:04,800
were saying we can do this right yes so

1276
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,570
given that we've got what was it oh yeah

1277
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,890
sobayed given that we've got that we

1278
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,420
basically need to find the wall for each

1279
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:11,429
of these motions so in this case I'm

1280
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,619
moving to the left so that means the

1281
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:15,359
wall is like it's normal pointing out to

1282
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:17,940
the right in this case I is moving to

1283
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:21,570
the right so I have the wall pointing to

1284
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:24,090
the left in this case I am moving up and

1285
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:27,920
so the wall is pointing down right is

1286
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,920
that correct yes

1287
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,170
wait no it's less than so it's moving

1288
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,539
down so it would be up right right and

1289
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:41,119
then and then that I believe that is all

1290
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:45,019
of them potentially I'm just like all P

1291
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:48,039
is used well if it collided we know that

1292
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:52,460
well all right fine we'll just do this

1293
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:53,869
yeah and we know that this we know that

1294
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,369
these cases can't actually happen but

1295
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:57,529
the compiler isn't being a bit

1296
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:58,969
persnickety there so in theory that

1297
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:05,900
should give us bouncing off of all the

1298
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:08,209
walls yeah there we go right and so now

1299
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,210
we're just a bouncy little fellow who's

1300
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:12,170
pretty happy about his lot in life very

1301
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,300
determined to go around bouncing along

1302
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:15,800
things and the faster we go the harder

1303
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,880
we bounce which is exactly what we

1304
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:21,320
wanted in terms of our behavior now like

1305
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,849
I said if we wanted to we could make him

1306
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,230
bounce a little softer off things by

1307
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:25,389
basically adding a coefficient in there

1308
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,590
it's called a coefficient of restitution

1309
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:29,839
the coefficient of restitution would

1310
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:32,329
would basically be some number less than

1311
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:35,990
one that we would multiply our vector by

1312
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:38,469
to reduce how far out it went and so

1313
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:43,250
that's that's really all that is yay

1314
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:44,750
bouncy fellow okay all right sorry I'll

1315
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:49,699
stop bouncing around a second puts kind

1316
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:51,679
of fun yeah now in theory we don't

1317
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:53,449
really handle the diagonal very well and

1318
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,679
you can kind of see that so you can see

1319
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:56,389
what kind of happens up in there and

1320
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:58,489
that's because we only really handle

1321
00:49:56,389 --> 00:50:00,529
bouncing off of one or the other at the

1322
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:01,699
time and that's because again like I

1323
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,590
said I don't think the towel maps are

1324
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:05,389
really that interesting way to do stuff

1325
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,130
so I don't think we'll handle that

1326
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:08,659
eventually that way anyway but what we

1327
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,280
could do if we really wanted to start

1328
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:11,629
doing if we really wanted the tile map

1329
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,000
collision to be the way we did collision

1330
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,710
what we could do is round those off a

1331
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,329
little bit pretend they were rounded in

1332
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:19,220
there a little bit and have a nicer

1333
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:20,750
collision there but but it's still it's

1334
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:26,509
fine I mean it works it's just it's not

1335
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:29,269
pretty right yeah all right so now I got

1336
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:30,800
another question for you because I've

1337
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:33,590
given you I've given you everything I

1338
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,240
give and I give stream I've given you

1339
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:37,180
everything now it's time for you to give

1340
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:42,829
back all right you're the man now dog

1341
00:50:37,179 --> 00:50:44,389
what I want to know is basically I told

1342
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:45,528
you all this stuff

1343
00:50:44,389 --> 00:50:47,028
told you about the dot product right

1344
00:50:45,528 --> 00:50:48,739
instead of keeping it a secret it could

1345
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:50,298
have been only me that knew the dot

1346
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:51,439
product this whole time and only I can

1347
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:52,028
do all these awesome things and now you

1348
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,849
know it too

1349
00:50:52,028 --> 00:50:58,159
so tell me with that power how would you

1350
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:00,740
now do something else with the collision

1351
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,598
response let's say what I want to do is

1352
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:04,338
have him have the standard the more

1353
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,849
familiar kind of quake style movement

1354
00:51:04,338 --> 00:51:09,710
where if my guy runs into a wall then

1355
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:12,230
basically he just runs along the wall

1356
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,659
like that so instead of him bouncing out

1357
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:17,929
like this he just kind of goes like that

1358
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:26,588
right smoothly along it right how would

1359
00:51:17,929 --> 00:51:28,730
I do that now there's a trick to this

1360
00:51:26,588 --> 00:51:29,719
one part of it I expect you to get and

1361
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,880
the other part II don't expect you to

1362
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,259
get because one does a programming thing

1363
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,630
and we haven't talked about that yet but

1364
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:41,960
you should be able to do the math part

1365
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:43,220
of this does anyone know anyone well

1366
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,690
you're behind on the stream anyway I

1367
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:46,459
know that so I can't really expect you

1368
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,869
to answer right away but the reason that

1369
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,829
I think this should be easy and if you

1370
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,309
want to pause the screen try to figure

1371
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:50,390
out yourself

1372
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:53,150
I saw highly suggest it because it

1373
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:55,308
should be is that I already told you

1374
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:59,568
essentially exactly what you need to do

1375
00:51:55,309 --> 00:52:01,789
to do this instead of - in - you could

1376
00:51:59,568 --> 00:52:03,018
just subtract one version of this and

1377
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,400
that would bring you right up to the

1378
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:06,018
wall right that would bring your

1379
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,500
velocity so that was just along the wall

1380
00:52:06,018 --> 00:52:11,959
so what we could do is instead just

1381
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,960
instead of it being - - right I could

1382
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,190
just make it be minus one now like I

1383
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,699
said there's another trick to this

1384
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:19,700
though

1385
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:20,838
so if I do that there's another problem

1386
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:22,038
that we have to solve that it will

1387
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:24,980
expose that we've really should have

1388
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:26,240
solved before but you know we don't

1389
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,849
really we didn't really have to in that

1390
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:32,268
case right now you'll notice when I come

1391
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:33,500
on here right you can kind of see well

1392
00:52:32,268 --> 00:52:35,419
you know it's not as pronounced as I

1393
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,588
thought it would be it sort of happened

1394
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:41,539
a little bit there but it's not as bad

1395
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:43,009
as I thought it would be yeah all right

1396
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:45,109
I take it back maybe we don't have to

1397
00:52:43,009 --> 00:52:46,940
fix it I felt like we would have to fix

1398
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:48,199
it but I guess we didn't but you can

1399
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,119
kind of see now what happens is exactly

1400
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,588
what I expect to happen which is that if

1401
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,298
I'm going diagonally down you get that

1402
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:54,588
grindy wall thing that you're supposed

1403
00:52:53,298 --> 00:52:55,699
to get in video games where you're going

1404
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,230
little slower against the wall when

1405
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:58,069
you're pushing into it and you go faster

1406
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,809
if you let up

1407
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:01,430
right which is exactly what we want to

1408
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:04,340
feel that that's like a good game feel

1409
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:06,349
thing and so that's right like totally

1410
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,250
trivial but what I thought should have

1411
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,509
had to happen

1412
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,369
and there you can see him kind of

1413
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,350
sticking a little there we go I was I

1414
00:53:10,369 --> 00:53:13,609
was gonna say should happen I hopefully

1415
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:15,799
you could sort of see how he was

1416
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,730
sticking there a little bit occasionally

1417
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,090
there we go

1418
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:21,740
right there see how he's stuck so that's

1419
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,970
that's the problem that I was alluding

1420
00:53:21,739 --> 00:53:24,349
to that we had to fix so I was kind of

1421
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,730
glad that that happened how that's like

1422
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:26,659
well I told you there there it is they

1423
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:29,719
read it again right you see that

1424
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:31,250
sticking why is he sticking what's going

1425
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:33,559
on right what's going on with the

1426
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:37,460
sticking I can hear you saying it what's

1427
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:40,039
going to sticking so the problem that we

1428
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:41,480
have and this is a gets sort of to the

1429
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:43,489
heart of collision detection at some

1430
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,139
level and and we'll never totally escape

1431
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:47,509
this I will show you the ways in which

1432
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,889
we solve these problems in practice but

1433
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:54,440
we will always have to keep thinking

1434
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:57,799
about it there's no magic bullet is that

1435
00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:00,079
in the real world collisions aren't some

1436
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,970
instantaneous thing everything is

1437
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,259
happening kind of continuously and again

1438
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:04,839
it's all atoms and they're all working

1439
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,010
together and this sort of stuff and

1440
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,630
collisions are this elastic thing where

1441
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,970
something deforms a little and dents a

1442
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,230
little and moves that whatever right

1443
00:54:09,969 --> 00:54:14,779
we're simulating collision like it's

1444
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,880
this fixed step thing right and so what

1445
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,940
we wrote our code to do way back when

1446
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,170
this is not something we wrote today but

1447
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,170
what we wrote our code to do way back

1448
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:26,389
when was go okay I'm I'm here you know

1449
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:29,450
here's my dude right so here's the hero

1450
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:31,670
and he wants to go to here right but

1451
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:33,619
this is inside a wall and so what we did

1452
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:36,139
is we disallowed the move that's what we

1453
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:38,359
did but what that means is now oops

1454
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,980
when we have our code that's trying to

1455
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,590
do this stuff when we skate along the

1456
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,510
wall we get into a problem where if the

1457
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:47,660
user is pushing down into the wall like

1458
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:50,270
that right we can correct that velocity

1459
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:52,009
but we've already denied the move so the

1460
00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:53,539
hero essentially doesn't move on that

1461
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,760
frame even though we've corrected his

1462
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:57,559
velocity right so what we really want to

1463
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,180
do is we want to see if you would have

1464
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:00,860
collided and if you would have collided

1465
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:03,379
we want to correct this velocity and

1466
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:05,120
then try to move them again and you can

1467
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,590
see why this is a bit of a nasty cycle

1468
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,359
because then your very next question

1469
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:10,460
should be and legitimately should be

1470
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,170
mind you what happens if he collides

1471
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:15,199
then so you're kind of in

1472
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:16,548
this nasty situation where you have to

1473
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,529
deal very specifically with the

1474
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:20,210
discreteness of everything and go oh

1475
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,680
I've kind of got this nasty problem

1476
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:24,710
where I've got a lot of different sort

1477
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:27,318
of concerns there right and so what we

1478
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,880
could do is very simply like you know we

1479
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:29,900
could try twice and then give up or

1480
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,048
whatever like there's different things

1481
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,190
we can do we'll be looking for there's a

1482
00:55:33,048 --> 00:55:35,659
very there's a really interesting way I

1483
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,159
solve this on the witness that I haven't

1484
00:55:35,659 --> 00:55:41,298
actually seen anyone talk about before

1485
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:42,710
that I I've sort of considered doing in

1486
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:43,849
handmade hero but I don't know if it's

1487
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,409
the most appropriate thing for it so I

1488
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:47,420
don't know if that's a good solution not

1489
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:48,828
but we will look at various solutions

1490
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,420
later when we do our full collision

1491
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:52,880
detection but for so for now we'll have

1492
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:55,490
to do something you know that somewhat

1493
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,930
somewhat not does somewhat janky right

1494
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:58,909
that's not that's not the nicest thing

1495
00:55:56,929 --> 00:56:01,308
in the world and so basically what we

1496
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:03,078
would do there is say okay if we correct

1497
00:56:01,309 --> 00:56:06,079
our velocity let's try using that

1498
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:08,990
velocity on this frame right and again

1499
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,660
that's not exactly correct either okay

1500
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:13,608
so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this in a

1501
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:15,348
four I loop we are going to do the new

1502
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:17,630
player P right we've got the player P

1503
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:21,079
offset that comes in here which we try

1504
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:23,088
adding and then we go ahead and say once

1505
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:26,240
we've actually computed that D player PE

1506
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:28,730
we're going to write okay and so what we

1507
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,289
need to do now is say alright now that

1508
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:32,809
we've actually compute a new D player P

1509
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:37,369
we need to be able to try again this

1510
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:39,650
basic process right so I'm trying to

1511
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:41,390
think this is a reflected vector that's

1512
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:43,639
happened after the acceleration was

1513
00:56:41,389 --> 00:56:47,750
tried and do we really want do we want

1514
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:49,608
to do how do we want to do that exactly

1515
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:52,369
after we've clipped that velocity I

1516
00:56:49,608 --> 00:56:56,298
guess we just want to move him by that

1517
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:57,950
velocity that we actually have left so I

1518
00:56:56,298 --> 00:56:59,030
guess I don't want to solve this in this

1519
00:56:57,949 --> 00:57:01,098
stream because here's what I actually

1520
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:03,230
want to do and so maybe we should save

1521
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:04,880
this for tomorrow because we just don't

1522
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:07,490
have enough time left what I actually

1523
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,380
want to do is I want to actually sort of

1524
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:11,929
show a slightly more correct collision

1525
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:14,059
response here which is when we have this

1526
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,980
motion and we find that we intersect I

1527
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:18,230
want to back up to the point where we

1528
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,940
hit and put the guy there and then

1529
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,260
correct his velocity and then step it

1530
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,970
forward right I want to do something

1531
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,970
like that

1532
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:35,659
and so I would rather do

1533
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:37,098
that potentially such a it's such a

1534
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:39,170
tough choice here guys

1535
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:41,570
or maybe I'll do the thing I didn't is

1536
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,920
alright so you know what let's table

1537
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:45,050
this till tomorrow because we don't have

1538
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,750
any time left let's get ready for the QA

1539
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,710
and let's just say this is a to be to

1540
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,239
continued that we will talk about

1541
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,820
tomorrow and I'm gonna think about which

1542
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,959
way I want to solve it right now because

1543
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,190
I think I might want to actually try the

1544
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,240
witness way because it's actually kind

1545
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,369
of cool and I think we can just do it

1546
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,659
here and then whether or not we can

1547
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:01,160
actually do it a little later on I'm not

1548
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:02,210
sure because there's more to the witness

1549
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:04,009
way than the way that I would be able to

1550
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:07,159
do here so well it's this table this for

1551
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:11,240
now it's a 59 and we will pick it up

1552
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:16,190
again tomorrow so we can start the Q &amp; A

1553
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:18,019
and basically what I would like you to

1554
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:19,940
do is if you could write in and put your

1555
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:23,030
questions with a Q : in front of them so

1556
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,139
I can see them and also please keep your

1557
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,640
questions to stuff we did on today's

1558
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:27,589
stream or on a previous stream if you

1559
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:30,079
want to ask off-topic questions we can

1560
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:31,640
handle those during pre stream which is

1561
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,049
basically come 15 minutes before the

1562
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:34,338
scheduled start time and I answer

1563
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:38,780
whatever questions come up on the stream

1564
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:40,338
at that time but not at this time you

1565
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,200
will note that if you ask questions that

1566
00:58:40,338 --> 00:58:43,820
are not related to the programming that

1567
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:47,618
we've been doing I will just skip over

1568
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:58,849
them it's like they didn't even exist

1569
00:58:47,619 --> 00:59:00,619
okay uh let's see here obviously was

1570
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:02,480
bouncing now you need to add those

1571
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:05,960
annoying bouncy enemies and deadly

1572
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,099
spiked walls pits later you know I don't

1573
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,240
really know what we're gonna do with

1574
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:10,250
bouncing I haven't thought too much

1575
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:12,108
about that but we should have something

1576
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,699
bounce off at the very least at some

1577
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:15,259
point you should be able to get some

1578
00:59:13,699 --> 00:59:16,848
kind of projectile bit bounces because I

1579
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,290
like bouncy projectiles those are always

1580
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:21,349
fun so we're gonna have salton that

1581
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:23,358
bounces we just don't know what it will

1582
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:25,690
be I mean we coded it we've got to use

1583
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:25,690
it right

1584
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:34,509
can you explain again why the hero will

1585
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:37,960
stick against the wall I didn't get it

1586
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:39,750
the first time okay yes I can so the

1587
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,420
reason is this piece of code right here

1588
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:44,980
so what happens is the code says did we

1589
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,019
collide right

1590
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:50,710
remember we compute the new location for

1591
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:53,018
where the hero is right when we compute

1592
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:55,088
that new location we then test to see

1593
00:59:53,018 --> 00:59:56,889
whether he could stand in that new

1594
00:59:55,088 --> 00:59:57,940
location that's all we were testing

1595
00:59:56,889 --> 01:00:00,009
remember because this is really old this

1596
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:01,539
is this is just simple code that we've

1597
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:03,519
been playing with so we didn't try to do

1598
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:04,750
anything fancy we just said can he stand

1599
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:08,528
in the new location that's all we're

1600
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:11,829
going to test if he cannot stand in the

1601
01:00:08,528 --> 01:00:14,829
new location right he can't then what we

1602
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:16,568
did is we said all right he won't we

1603
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:18,460
won't take a step remember this right

1604
01:00:16,568 --> 01:00:20,469
here is the thing that actually puts the

1605
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,929
player in the new location so if we

1606
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:24,578
enter the collided branch we will update

1607
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:26,469
his velocity properly but we will never

1608
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:30,309
update his position at all so that means

1609
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:34,838
as long as the game great that's good

1610
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:38,079
thank you for that I needed that as long

1611
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:40,028
as the game is in a situation where he's

1612
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,519
trying to move and stand in a position

1613
01:00:40,028 --> 01:00:44,230
on the other side of the wall it won't

1614
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:46,929
move him at all even though it corrects

1615
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:51,039
his velocity on the next frame it may be

1616
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:52,838
such that that velocity is is put right

1617
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:53,950
like you could almost let me let me

1618
01:00:52,838 --> 01:00:54,940
actually show you exactly what's

1619
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:57,578
happening if you could if you could

1620
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:59,740
think about it he's got a velocity these

1621
01:00:57,579 --> 01:01:01,480
built up using the acceleration that has

1622
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:03,729
been generated from the user input right

1623
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:05,259
so he's moving along moving along that

1624
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:07,809
acceleration has built him up to have a

1625
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:09,730
velocity he slams into the wall okay

1626
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:12,220
with this velocity he should step across

1627
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:14,409
the wall he doesn't because we test and

1628
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:17,288
see that he can't move there we correct

1629
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:19,808
his velocity to be the bounce right so

1630
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:22,240
I'm sorry not the bounce we correct the

1631
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:24,160
velocity to be along the wall directly

1632
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,209
now he still got a little distance to

1633
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:26,379
the wall cuz remember we haven't done

1634
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:27,789
anything to move him right up to the

1635
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,048
wall so he might be a little bit away

1636
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:31,539
from the wall and now his velocities

1637
01:01:29,048 --> 01:01:33,038
this so on the next frame we have his

1638
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:34,778
acceleration his acceleration is still

1639
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,400
into the wall but it's only an

1640
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:38,679
acceleration so it only moves this

1641
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,108
vector down a little bit so now he can

1642
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:42,578
actually move here so he won't stick on

1643
01:01:41,108 --> 01:01:43,509
the next frame but on the frame after

1644
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:45,220
that he

1645
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,930
right right because he's now

1646
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:49,839
accelerating more and more into the wall

1647
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:51,129
and so he's constantly in this situation

1648
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,900
of kind of trying to drive back into the

1649
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:55,119
wall and if he drives directly back into

1650
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:57,039
the wall he will stick so what ends up

1651
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,719
happening is as he moves along the wall

1652
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,279
he's actually constantly getting to

1653
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:01,599
these stick scenarios where it's like up

1654
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,010
he was into the wall overcorrect the

1655
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,079
velocity up he was into the wall correct

1656
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:07,870
the velocity so what we want to do to

1657
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:10,840
prevent that is say okay if the player

1658
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:13,359
accelerates into the wall right we don't

1659
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:15,160
want to just deny the motion entirely we

1660
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,050
want to just correct the motion so that

1661
01:02:15,159 --> 01:02:18,429
he moves to like here and correct the

1662
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:20,980
velocity he should always still be

1663
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:22,509
moving as far as he would have moved in

1664
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:26,320
this direction right so he should move

1665
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:27,160
there basically right he should so he so

1666
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,240
that's what we need to do to correct

1667
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:30,239
that hopefully that makes some sense

1668
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:49,960
when we scale down the hero um possibly

1669
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:51,100
for next week we don't really have to

1670
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,420
care at the moment because we're not

1671
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:54,639
really doing anything particularly

1672
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:56,500
touchy about that but when we start to

1673
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:58,480
do the like hopping code we'll probably

1674
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,550
want to have him scaled properly so

1675
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,280
probably for next week I'll maybe update

1676
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:12,910
the art assets file with with stuff

1677
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:15,280
that's scaled properly have I considered

1678
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:18,579
using sine zero to sine 90 as a

1679
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,380
nonlinear inertia curve no we haven't

1680
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:22,960
really talked about any sorts of curve

1681
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:24,910
interpolation yet so save that for

1682
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,079
thinking down the road that's I don't

1683
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:28,449
know that that's the one I would use

1684
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,519
because sine is more expensive to

1685
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:32,379
compute usually than other things that

1686
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:33,880
would be essentially the same so I if I

1687
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:38,260
was trying to do an inertia curve I

1688
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:43,470
would probably just use a Bezier but you

1689
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:43,470
know that's just off the top of my head

1690
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:56,598
will you eventually handle both the

1691
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,910
player and monsters uniformly with some

1692
01:03:56,599 --> 01:04:01,818
kind of physics engine so I don't really

1693
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:03,618
want to use the term physics engine but

1694
01:04:01,818 --> 01:04:05,239
we will obviously have movement code

1695
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:08,568
that is designed to handle what the

1696
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:10,068
player and the monsters do together but

1697
01:04:08,568 --> 01:04:11,900
the word physics engine suggests that

1698
01:04:10,068 --> 01:04:14,028
it's actually trying to simulate physics

1699
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,380
which is not really the goal here we

1700
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:17,329
basically have a bunch of rules that we

1701
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:19,250
want to do and some of them are based on

1702
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:21,528
the underlying equations of motion which

1703
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,838
are physical and so some of it is

1704
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:33,199
physics II but physics engine usually

1705
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:34,460
denotes a sort of different objective do

1706
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,108
you need to code in different collision

1707
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,519
detection for the enemies no our

1708
01:04:36,108 --> 01:04:39,199
collision detection will probably just

1709
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,759
be one set of routines that works

1710
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,129
relatively uniformly but we may have

1711
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,990
special casing because we may want to

1712
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:47,000
fine-tune how collision detection works

1713
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:48,769
differently for enemies than the player

1714
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,869
and depending on how we want to do it I

1715
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:52,489
mean so there may be there may be some

1716
01:04:50,869 --> 01:04:53,960
things that are specific to the player

1717
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:56,858
versus the enemies but in general

1718
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,858
they'll go through the same path

1719
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:13,829
this code is largely commented by video

1720
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:16,710
will you be commenting it in the source

1721
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:18,839
later for those who pre-ordered we only

1722
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:20,699
will really do comments in the source

1723
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:23,038
code once we've finished a section of

1724
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:24,689
code and are kind of baking it away

1725
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,640
because otherwise the comments just get

1726
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:28,440
out of date even the to dues are already

1727
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:29,759
out of date a lot of times so adding a

1728
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,858
bunch of comments is usually a bad idea

1729
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,599
you really only want to comment code

1730
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:35,219
when you are actually ready to kind of

1731
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,660
bake it because otherwise the comments

1732
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:37,858
usually end up being worse than not

1733
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:40,048
having comments because they actually

1734
01:05:37,858 --> 01:05:41,130
say the wrong thing and they'll confuse

1735
01:05:40,048 --> 01:05:46,469
people who are trying to understand

1736
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:49,079
what's going on do you plan on having

1737
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:50,730
non axes lined walls in the maps well I

1738
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:53,490
don't actually plan on having non axis

1739
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:56,010
aligned walls in the maps but I do plan

1740
01:05:53,489 --> 01:05:58,439
on having like what I want to do is

1741
01:05:56,010 --> 01:06:00,839
essentially say we're a tile map game in

1742
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:03,150
terms of how the like generation goes

1743
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:04,980
but like once the generator says you

1744
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:07,230
know oh this is the structure of

1745
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:09,900
something right like here's you know

1746
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:13,108
here's here's how the you know this is

1747
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:15,358
walkable in here and this is not then I

1748
01:06:13,108 --> 01:06:17,068
actually want to do like the way I want

1749
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,710
it was hoping to do it is to sort of say

1750
01:06:17,068 --> 01:06:21,420
well then what's gonna happen is we're

1751
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:23,220
gonna start placing things like if this

1752
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:26,250
was a forest you know we'll start

1753
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:29,459
placing trees and the trees make up the

1754
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:31,108
wall right but then instead of collision

1755
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,940
detecting with the wall will actually

1756
01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:35,759
collision detect with the trees so that

1757
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:38,190
when the hero walks along them they

1758
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,960
actually feel like the trees instead of

1759
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:41,730
feeling like a tile map jus know what I

1760
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,528
mean so I don't know that we're gonna

1761
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:45,059
have we're not gonna have like walls

1762
01:06:43,528 --> 01:06:46,949
that are like diagonal or something but

1763
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:48,569
we will have tons of like crenelated

1764
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:51,750
surfaces potentially or other things

1765
01:06:48,568 --> 01:06:53,759
like that and we may also have entities

1766
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:55,730
in the game that behave like walls that

1767
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,440
could be angled depending on how they go

1768
01:06:55,730 --> 01:07:00,659
so we will have stuff where we will need

1769
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,940
to be able to compute stuff that bounces

1770
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:05,219
off of arbitrary surfaces it will not be

1771
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:08,358
as straightforward as just doing the

1772
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:08,358
four cardinal directions

1773
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:16,940
what do you think about position based

1774
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:18,619
dynamics leaving out velocity and

1775
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,300
forests in doing physics directly using

1776
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:25,789
the current and previous positions I

1777
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:28,519
think it's good I mean we are sort of

1778
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:31,250
already doing that in some sense because

1779
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:33,139
really you're not really leaving out

1780
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,969
force and velocity in those systems a

1781
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:39,920
lot of times what you're actually doing

1782
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:41,209
is you're just not trying to how should

1783
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,349
I say that you still have to have a

1784
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:46,639
notion of how fast something is going so

1785
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:48,710
position based physics still does have

1786
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:50,150
to take into account velocity right but

1787
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:51,588
what you are doing typically in those

1788
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:53,119
sessions that makes them position based

1789
01:07:51,588 --> 01:07:54,710
instead of velocity based or set of

1790
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,318
acceleration based is where you choose

1791
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:59,358
to resolve basically the the actual

1792
01:07:57,318 --> 01:08:01,358
stepping of the time step instead of

1793
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:03,828
actually doing it as an integration

1794
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,000
taking many samples of velocity and so

1795
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:07,369
on as opposed to doing it directly on

1796
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,900
the physics on the positions so you

1797
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:11,150
still have to know all the equations of

1798
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:12,588
motion it's just about where you resolve

1799
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:14,660
that stuff and so at this point we

1800
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:18,469
almost are really doing that because we

1801
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:21,048
don't ever do anything we don't really

1802
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:23,920
do any ever any numerical integration at

1803
01:08:21,048 --> 01:08:23,920
the velocity level or anything

1804
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:37,570
let's see will the stream tomorrow

1805
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:43,930
morning be coding or QA it's both we

1806
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:45,489
always do coding and QA are we going to

1807
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:47,170
make continuous collision detection well

1808
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:49,719
there's no real such thing as continuous

1809
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:52,480
collision detection I mean obviously

1810
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:53,829
we're all discrete in computers but if

1811
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,139
you're just talking about whether we

1812
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:58,510
will check to see whether or not the guy

1813
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:11,109
along a vector has intersected things

1814
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:12,579
yes we will is the computational cost of

1815
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:13,930
different functions something you only

1816
01:09:12,579 --> 01:09:16,269
learn through experience or are there

1817
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:17,890
good references for C++ well the

1818
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:19,270
computational cost of things doesn't

1819
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:21,820
actually have anything to do a C++ it

1820
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:24,550
has to do with the the CPU instructions

1821
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:26,649
that get generated by the C++ and so

1822
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:28,270
typically what you want to do is yeah

1823
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:30,489
you have to learn by experience what

1824
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:32,230
those are and how they tend to affect

1825
01:09:30,489 --> 01:09:34,088
performance but really what you want to

1826
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:35,739
do is spend time profiling you want to

1827
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:37,359
spend time timing different things in

1828
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:39,069
your code and learning how they work

1829
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,810
because that is really the only way so I

1830
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:42,399
only have a rough idea in my head in a

1831
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:44,140
given time of what the cost of a

1832
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:45,429
function is but once I need to act start

1833
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:47,200
optimizing you have to be very specific

1834
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:48,940
in profile things which is not something

1835
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:57,550
we've gotten to yet we will do that much

1836
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:59,139
later yes I agree with the person who's

1837
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:01,600
saying that the cursor in Krita is hard

1838
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:04,990
to see and I'm not sure how to make it

1839
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:10,630
do something more visible I know you can

1840
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:12,250
do this thing I don't know if that if

1841
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:14,199
that would help at all

1842
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,810
I also don't know if krita's saves any

1843
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:19,029
of my settings it didn't seem to I would

1844
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:20,350
like it to but it didn't seem to want to

1845
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:23,409
do that I don't know if I have to do

1846
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:28,329
something else to make it do that but

1847
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:30,760
basically yeah it doesn't ever seem to

1848
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:32,170
say save the size of the brush but it

1849
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:37,560
guess it will save the cursor so that's

1850
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:37,560
fine so that's something anyway right

1851
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:52,510
let's see are there any situations in

1852
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,369
which other angles are more useful than

1853
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:56,199
quaternions okay we're definitely that's

1854
01:10:54,369 --> 01:10:57,880
that's definitely a question for much

1855
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:59,260
farther than the future and first of all

1856
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,400
I don't know that we'll ever that will

1857
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:02,770
ever be a question for the stream

1858
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:05,109
because quaternions are only really

1859
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:10,120
necessary for 3d rotations which we

1860
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:11,229
won't really have to deal with will you

1861
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:13,090
end up running into problems when

1862
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:18,839
walking into a corner after the sticking

1863
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:18,840
fix tomorrow it depends on how we fix it

1864
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:30,670
possibly it depends will there be

1865
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:32,170
minimum distance to the wall where any

1866
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:33,670
input towards it is similarly replaced

1867
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:36,520
with partial parallel correction vector

1868
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:39,159
without looping over possibilities well

1869
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:41,380
so it like I said it depends on how we

1870
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:43,809
implement it I'm toying with may be

1871
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,430
doing the witness thing but I just if we

1872
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:46,780
were gonna stick with tile map collision

1873
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:50,170
I would definitely do the witness thing

1874
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:51,489
but I don't know based on where we're

1875
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:54,090
gonna go with it I don't know if that's

1876
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:54,090
a good idea or not

1877
01:12:03,368 --> 01:12:07,389
we're computing a vector that moves the

1878
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:09,189
player just above the wall but still

1879
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:14,260
along it solved the stopping problem in

1880
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:15,698
collision well so the problem is not

1881
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:17,710
computing the vector because we did

1882
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:19,988
compute that vector right that's what

1883
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:23,609
this does this computes exactly that

1884
01:12:19,988 --> 01:12:26,500
vector the problem is that we only

1885
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:28,210
compute that vector after we know that

1886
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,329
we collided and when we know that we

1887
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:36,010
collided we don't accept the the new

1888
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:38,529
position right does that make sense so

1889
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:40,599
we have a bunch of work to do here to

1890
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:42,969
figure out how we're going to make it so

1891
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:44,980
that we can test the position and accept

1892
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:47,260
the position while doing correction in

1893
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:49,500
between was the problem right if that

1894
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,500
makes sense

1895
01:12:55,020 --> 01:13:00,390
oh my god I'm am I reading this right I

1896
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:02,220
feel like the moderators of the stream

1897
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,700
are now arguing over you're the man now

1898
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,699
dog

1899
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:19,029
I get the projection of V onto our but

1900
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:21,190
don't you end up just pointing back on

1901
01:13:19,029 --> 01:13:23,380
negative R by multiplying the projection

1902
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:26,859
by negative 2r where is the other

1903
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:29,199
component of the bounce handled I see I

1904
01:13:26,859 --> 01:13:31,659
see the question and that is a good

1905
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:34,659
question so let's go ahead and answer

1906
01:13:31,659 --> 01:13:37,359
that question all right so I'm gonna

1907
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:38,949
draw it orthogonal e4u all right I'm

1908
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,299
gonna draw it without an axis system so

1909
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:46,239
that we don't have the axis system in

1910
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:48,130
there right here's our okay it extends

1911
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,349
infinitely in all directions but it's

1912
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:52,989
length is only one so you know it's it's

1913
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:55,990
this direction but you know length of R

1914
01:13:52,989 --> 01:13:57,369
equals one right and so now we have

1915
01:13:55,989 --> 01:14:00,460
something that's coming in and it's

1916
01:13:57,369 --> 01:14:03,579
hitting here and so here is the vector

1917
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:07,510
right that is hitting this is the

1918
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:10,630
velocity vector so this is V we want to

1919
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:13,360
compute a new V right we want to compute

1920
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:15,869
V prime that is up here and so what we

1921
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:19,029
are trying to do is perform this flip

1922
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:21,579
now what you will notice is this

1923
01:14:19,029 --> 01:14:22,899
component right whatever this axis is we

1924
01:14:21,579 --> 01:14:24,309
don't even know what this axis is we

1925
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:28,869
didn't even give it a name it's the wall

1926
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:32,500
axis right but that portion of this

1927
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:35,470
vector we don't want to touch right this

1928
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:38,890
and this both map to the same location

1929
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:41,650
on this other axis so we don't need to

1930
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:46,780
modify that coordinate all we need to do

1931
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:48,639
is flip this guy around you know all we

1932
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:50,469
need to do is handle this coordinate

1933
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:54,670
that Y we don't need to touch the other

1934
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:57,340
one so that's why we did V plus our

1935
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:59,770
bounce expression right and I mean

1936
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:04,360
technically V - right we did B minus 2 V

1937
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:07,210
T our R right it's because we start at

1938
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:08,619
the existing velocity and all we're

1939
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,449
doing is applying the correction that

1940
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:12,819
does the flip that's why we don't have

1941
01:15:10,449 --> 01:15:15,579
to handle this specially now we could if

1942
01:15:12,819 --> 01:15:18,549
we wanted to handle it specially right

1943
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:21,609
we could have another thing here which

1944
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:24,690
would basically be W right and how would

1945
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:26,710
we do that well then our V prime right

1946
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:28,750
we would construct it

1947
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:30,310
by saying what's our V prime well we

1948
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:32,619
know that our V prime should have this

1949
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:35,970
vector in it right it should have that

1950
01:15:32,619 --> 01:15:38,199
right so it's it's it's length along R

1951
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:41,770
should be the negative of whatever it

1952
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:44,649
was right and so we're like okay so we

1953
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:47,140
know we want to subtract V transpose R R

1954
01:15:44,649 --> 01:15:49,509
to sort of start by getting us up to

1955
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:52,480
here right because this is V transpose R

1956
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:54,460
right this length so negative B

1957
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:56,469
transpose R would get us up to here and

1958
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:58,659
now we need to add this part back in

1959
01:15:56,470 --> 01:16:00,850
right we need to add we need to add this

1960
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:03,699
W well what's that well that's just

1961
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:06,640
going to be V transpose W right so it

1962
01:16:03,699 --> 01:16:09,399
would be V transpose W times W and

1963
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:12,280
remember these are scalars and these are

1964
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:16,929
vectors right hopefully that makes some

1965
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:20,170
sense this would be our new this would

1966
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:21,820
be our new vector and we could compute

1967
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:23,380
it that way if we wanted to it just

1968
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:25,389
means we have to have a second vector in

1969
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:28,930
here which is this W vector now what do

1970
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:30,190
we know about the W vector right well we

1971
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:33,909
know that the W vector is perpendicular

1972
01:16:30,189 --> 01:16:38,019
to the R vector right so we know

1973
01:16:33,909 --> 01:16:40,000
basically that that that and this is

1974
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:42,520
jumping ahead a little bit but we know

1975
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,350
that this is true about their inner

1976
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,360
product why do we know that's true

1977
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:50,160
because what was that equation I showed

1978
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:50,159
you before I showed you the equation

1979
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:55,840
length of a length of B cosine angle

1980
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,949
between them right well what's the

1981
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,369
cosine of the angle between two

1982
01:16:56,949 --> 01:17:03,309
perpendicular vectors it's 90 degrees

1983
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:06,670
right if it's 90 degrees the cosine of

1984
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:08,140
90 is zero that means it doesn't matter

1985
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,789
what anything else is this is zero

1986
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,260
because these guys no matter what they

1987
01:17:09,789 --> 01:17:13,930
are can't multiply 0 to be anything

1988
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:18,909
other than zero right so we know that W

1989
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:20,950
transpose R is zero right so if we

1990
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:23,079
looked at this extra expression that we

1991
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:25,899
added here we've got a negative VTR and

1992
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:30,809
then we've got a positive V T W right so

1993
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:34,569
we've got V T W times W right and so

1994
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:36,130
this we know you know if we're if we're

1995
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:38,409
going to basically say well you know

1996
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:40,859
we're gonna try and make we're going to

1997
01:17:38,409 --> 01:17:40,859
try and

1998
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:46,029
sorry but I lost my trans off there for

1999
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:47,800
a second oh we're gonna try and say well

2000
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:51,699
well you know these two things should be

2001
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:55,119
equal right well negative V to V T RR

2002
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:56,889
you know V minus V this and this if they

2003
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:58,840
should be equal I should be able to set

2004
01:17:56,890 --> 01:18:01,090
up that equality right if I'm if I'm

2005
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,710
telling you this is true right and so

2006
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:06,239
what I'm what I'm saying there is that V

2007
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:09,609
this this oval squares of to VTR are

2008
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:14,889
that should equal this equation negative

2009
01:18:09,609 --> 01:18:16,659
VTR r+ v tww right and you can kind of

2010
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:18,400
start to see okay well if I transfer

2011
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:21,220
this to the other side I would get V

2012
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:24,639
minus VT R R that goes away right

2013
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:28,240
because it adds one to that and V tww

2014
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:31,690
right that's what that is so what that's

2015
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:34,779
telling me is V transpose W times W must

2016
01:18:31,689 --> 01:18:37,179
be equal to V minus V transpose R R

2017
01:18:34,779 --> 01:18:40,389
right and we actually can see that

2018
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:43,450
that's true right V which is this term

2019
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:46,000
minus V transpose R R right which is

2020
01:18:43,449 --> 01:18:50,019
this distance times this vector which is

2021
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,170
this right here right is equal to this

2022
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:54,760
point V transpose W times W that is

2023
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:57,279
exactly what we expected to see and it

2024
01:18:54,760 --> 01:19:02,860
is what we see right and so that's where

2025
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:04,329
that comes from there yeah so there's

2026
01:19:02,859 --> 01:19:05,889
not a whole lot else I could really show

2027
01:19:04,329 --> 01:19:08,079
you about this without going into too

2028
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:09,579
this and substituting in basically what

2029
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:12,369
we have to do is say well let's break up

2030
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:15,130
V into the sum of two vectors one of

2031
01:19:12,369 --> 01:19:16,479
which is going along R in one of those W

2032
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:18,279
or whatever and then see how they died

2033
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,569
out and blah blah blah but you get the

2034
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:27,099
idea so hopefully that makes it a little

2035
01:19:19,569 --> 01:19:29,109
bit clearer is there a way to speed up

2036
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:31,750
the drawbitmap code i'm trying it on my

2037
01:19:29,109 --> 01:19:33,429
laptop and it doesn't hit 33 FPS um

2038
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,949
there are a lot of ways you could speed

2039
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:36,970
up the draw a bit Mac code I don't

2040
01:19:35,949 --> 01:19:39,039
really know that I want to talk about

2041
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:40,780
them right now though because one of our

2042
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:42,729
very first tasks after we sort of

2043
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:45,759
finished getting our basic movement

2044
01:19:42,729 --> 01:19:47,739
basic you know gameplay stuff in over

2045
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,890
the next couple of weeks is to write the

2046
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:52,269
renderer so I'd like to save it for then

2047
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:53,020
because we're going to actually write a

2048
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,850
whole renderer and

2049
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:56,920
that'll be the time when we look at it

2050
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:59,530
if you're looking at just the basic

2051
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:01,149
thing that you might want to do if you

2052
01:19:59,529 --> 01:20:02,590
haven't already done it if you're just

2053
01:20:01,149 --> 01:20:04,809
trying to make it run faster what you

2054
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:07,960
could do is is turn on optimization

2055
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:09,490
right so if you go in here and you you

2056
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:12,909
look at this it's the optimization

2057
01:20:09,489 --> 01:20:15,219
switches o2 if you put that o - if you

2058
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:17,739
just if you just put an o2 in here that

2059
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:20,560
would compile it to probably run quite a

2060
01:20:17,739 --> 01:20:26,619
bit faster so if you haven't already

2061
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:28,600
done that you'd want to do that alright

2062
01:20:26,619 --> 01:20:32,739
it looks like we are done with questions

2063
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:35,650
do I have any more questions if so we

2064
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:37,210
yeah this is an early Q&amp;A I don't know

2065
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:38,529
if that means nobody knows what I'm

2066
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:41,439
talking about when I talk about the math

2067
01:20:38,529 --> 01:20:43,149
fact that that might be the case that

2068
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:45,519
might be the case that would be too bad

2069
01:20:43,149 --> 01:20:47,289
I hope that's not true but it might be

2070
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,090
we had some good math questions so some

2071
01:20:47,289 --> 01:20:51,369
people obviously know totally get what

2072
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:52,510
the math is doing but I hope it's not

2073
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:54,069
too much math sometimes people just

2074
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:56,590
their eyes glaze over when we go to the

2075
01:20:54,069 --> 01:20:58,569
math but it's really easy to understand

2076
01:20:56,590 --> 01:21:00,850
if you always just think back to what

2077
01:20:58,569 --> 01:21:03,789
the actual stuff is doing and and you

2078
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:06,070
can get it trust me I am really bad at

2079
01:21:03,789 --> 01:21:07,569
math so if I can do it you can do it you

2080
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:09,009
just got to be willing to kind of dig in

2081
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:17,769
a little bit and actually start

2082
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:19,390
practicing with those things oh yes

2083
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:21,070
whoever just suggested removing the

2084
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:22,390
background yes that's a good point so if

2085
01:21:21,069 --> 01:21:24,219
you are having trouble we're basically

2086
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:27,190
bleeding a giant background here for no

2087
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:29,079
reason so if you wanted to you could

2088
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:32,710
totally you could totally do that just

2089
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:35,170
just comment out this code right and and

2090
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:37,300
that would be you know an easy way to

2091
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:39,670
get it to run faster if you want to put

2092
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:43,470
a clear in there as well you could but

2093
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:43,470
you know sometimes it's fun

2094
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:54,550
yeah

2095
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:15,938
Oh No I drew the triangle wrong I'm

2096
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:18,109
sorry let me draw the triangle again

2097
01:22:15,939 --> 01:22:20,059
it's bound to happen when I'm drawing

2098
01:22:18,109 --> 01:22:21,348
stuff quick math wise well actually it's

2099
01:22:20,059 --> 01:22:23,269
usually the case that I'll make an

2100
01:22:21,349 --> 01:22:26,119
actual math mistake it's a miracle that

2101
01:22:23,269 --> 01:22:27,920
I haven't made one yet okay when I drew

2102
01:22:26,118 --> 01:22:30,170
this someone was saying I put it on the

2103
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,689
wrong side I was I was trying to write

2104
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:36,078
this but I think I must have inverted

2105
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:37,969
them right so just to be clear on the

2106
01:22:36,078 --> 01:22:39,469
right triangle this is how it should go

2107
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:41,328
and we did everything else right like

2108
01:22:39,469 --> 01:22:42,800
the dot product when we drew it was you

2109
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:44,029
know working correctly but yeah sorry I

2110
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,610
don't I don't know why I did that

2111
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:50,868
sometimes I get carried away so yeah so

2112
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:53,768
it's it's it's this guy it's this side

2113
01:22:50,868 --> 01:22:57,768
and so that's why again dot product wise

2114
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:59,748
when you've got the two guys in here

2115
01:22:57,769 --> 01:23:00,679
when you're doing that mapping dropping

2116
01:22:59,748 --> 01:23:03,408
it down

2117
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:05,229
here's that that guy you don't get this

2118
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:08,839
length right that would be sine theta

2119
01:23:05,229 --> 01:23:10,130
what you get is this length now there is

2120
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,510
something that does give you sine theta

2121
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:13,510
right that's called the cross product

2122
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:18,948
but but we haven't gotten to that yet

2123
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:20,389
and we probably won't do much of that

2124
01:23:18,948 --> 01:23:26,558
actually because you don't really need

2125
01:23:20,389 --> 01:23:26,559
it in 2d very much it's more of a 3d

2126
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:43,579
maybe you can mention formal keywords

2127
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,350
like projection transformation and

2128
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:50,899
spaces so people can look things up if

2129
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:51,950
they need to yeah so I don't know that

2130
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:54,619
we've played gotten to some of those

2131
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:58,279
things yet but yeah I mean if you think

2132
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:59,659
that is I mean we haven't really gotten

2133
01:23:58,279 --> 01:24:01,279
to matrices or all those sorts of things

2134
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:03,050
so I don't know if they'll be a little

2135
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:06,489
too confusing for people to kind of jump

2136
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:09,949
straight into that but in general

2137
01:24:06,489 --> 01:24:13,219
essentially matrix math when you

2138
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:14,929
actually do transforms matrix transforms

2139
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:17,270
they are actually a series of dot

2140
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:20,140
products and so you can't actually go

2141
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:23,060
look up like he was saying spaces and

2142
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:24,740
transforms those are things that we'll

2143
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:27,920
talk about this sort of behavior but a

2144
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:29,420
lot of them it's really hard to I don't

2145
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,069
even know what to point you to to look

2146
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:32,449
up for more information I don't know who

2147
01:24:31,069 --> 01:24:34,579
explains these sorts of things in a good

2148
01:24:32,449 --> 01:24:35,569
way necessarily so maybe go to the

2149
01:24:34,579 --> 01:24:36,920
forums if you're having trouble with

2150
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:38,449
stuff and ask and some people who are

2151
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,590
more math inclined there might have some

2152
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:41,179
good resources that explain these in

2153
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:42,350
nice intuitive ways and so they're just

2154
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,789
throwing tons of equations at you and

2155
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:46,120
hoping that you know what they're

2156
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:46,119
talking about

2157
01:24:53,448 --> 01:25:00,029
was the witness collision trick to try

2158
01:24:55,948 --> 01:25:02,038
and maintain the distance traveled no

2159
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:04,349
the witness collision trick is to do

2160
01:25:02,038 --> 01:25:08,300
movement as a search problem instead of

2161
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:08,300
as a as a physics problem

2162
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:22,729
let's see here

2163
01:25:23,238 --> 01:25:27,868
why does wall bouncing not seem to cause

2164
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:30,299
cause sticking but wall sliding does

2165
01:25:27,868 --> 01:25:32,729
well if you think through the way that

2166
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:35,730
code works hopefully you can kind of see

2167
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:38,939
what's actually going on there so let's

2168
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:40,859
take the situation with bounce right so

2169
01:25:38,939 --> 01:25:43,049
I got this situation and I'm going to

2170
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:44,908
deny this move but I set the velocity to

2171
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:46,380
here so that means on this frame the guy

2172
01:25:44,908 --> 01:25:48,118
doesn't move at all which we just can't

2173
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:49,739
see cuz the frame rate so high if the

2174
01:25:48,118 --> 01:25:51,868
frame rate was like you know ten frames

2175
01:25:49,738 --> 01:25:54,479
a second we'd see him stick just at

2176
01:25:51,868 --> 01:25:55,889
every bounce right so one frame he

2177
01:25:54,479 --> 01:25:57,419
doesn't move but on the next frame his

2178
01:25:55,889 --> 01:25:59,520
velocities pointing in this direction so

2179
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:01,289
he's definitely gonna move now so he

2180
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,960
could never stick on the wall for more

2181
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:07,109
than one frame right but in the other

2182
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:10,230
scenario where all we do is do that then

2183
01:26:07,109 --> 01:26:13,259
if he gets close enough to the wall in

2184
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:15,750
floating point math for the amount of

2185
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:18,420
acceleration that we add every frame to

2186
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:20,010
make it so that every frame it's

2187
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,630
constantly we correct it but then on the

2188
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:22,860
next frame it moves the acceleration to

2189
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:24,359
here and he tries to go into the wall

2190
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:26,130
again he could just stay there

2191
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:28,769
constantly trying to get into the wall

2192
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:30,389
right and never move anywhere that's

2193
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:31,949
never gonna happen with this because if

2194
01:26:30,389 --> 01:26:33,328
he's pointing into the wall on the next

2195
01:26:31,948 --> 01:26:34,769
frame he's pointing out of the wall but

2196
01:26:33,328 --> 01:26:37,500
this will never make him point out at

2197
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:39,960
the wall right he'll only point even or

2198
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,550
in in fact it's always slightly in

2199
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:43,260
because if you're if I'm holding down

2200
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,579
the keys trying to push him into the

2201
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,230
wall he's always having acceleration

2202
01:26:44,578 --> 01:26:49,250
added to him that pushes his velocity

2203
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:49,250
vector into the wall

2204
01:26:56,899 --> 01:27:01,649
abner yes we will have debug info

2205
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:03,119
rendered on the game itself that is

2206
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:08,369
something we will be doing once our

2207
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:09,448
render is kind of up somebody says that

2208
01:27:08,369 --> 01:27:11,849
you can look up a lot of these things on

2209
01:27:09,448 --> 01:27:13,619
Khan Academy so I don't know if that's

2210
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:21,329
good or not but that's maybe one place

2211
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:23,010
to look for a more mass stuff well the

2212
01:27:21,329 --> 01:27:24,539
rendering code be able to squash the

2213
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:25,679
bitmaps for example to signal the

2214
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:27,119
collision yes

2215
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,600
well I don't know that will necessarily

2216
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:34,229
do squashing into a collision but we

2217
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,630
will allow bitmaps to be squashed and

2218
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:37,529
stretched yeah

2219
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:39,060
in fact that's kind of interesting

2220
01:27:37,529 --> 01:27:41,988
problem actually that people don't talk

2221
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:45,060
about very much there's an interesting

2222
01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:49,459
there's an interesting part about bitmap

2223
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:51,870
squashing and stretching that that is I

2224
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:54,899
guess I would say is I've never seen it

2225
01:27:51,869 --> 01:27:57,630
actually just put forth as bluntly as it

2226
01:27:54,899 --> 01:28:01,339
probably should be and so when we get

2227
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:01,340
there I will be bluntly putting it forth

2228
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:07,289
could you would you benefit from

2229
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:09,810
unrolling the collision check loop using

2230
01:28:07,289 --> 01:28:11,819
a predefined number of segments along

2231
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:14,580
the movement vector we don't actually

2232
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:20,880
have a collision check loop at the

2233
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:22,890
moment but unrolling loops nowadays is

2234
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,679
usually not particularly useful

2235
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:26,850
depending on the circumstance so it

2236
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,920
depends what you're talking about since

2237
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:31,650
we don't have a collision loop yet I

2238
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:36,119
can't really say if there'd be any

2239
01:28:31,649 --> 01:28:38,069
benefit to unrolling it all right I

2240
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:41,929
think that is the end of the questions

2241
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:45,689
so that is the end of the stream event

2242
01:28:41,929 --> 01:28:47,489
there we go so thank you everyone for

2243
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:49,619
joining me it was a pleasure coding with

2244
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:52,229
you for a very mafia handmade hero

2245
01:28:49,619 --> 01:28:55,198
tonight if you would like to follow

2246
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:57,839
along at home you can pre-order the game

2247
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:59,189
on him hero org and it comes with all

2248
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,600
the source code so you'll get a link in

2249
01:28:59,189 --> 01:29:02,399
your email that allows you to download

2250
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:04,050
every night after I finished coding I

2251
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:06,210
upload the source code you can go ahead

2252
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:07,770
and and grab that and play around with

2253
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:09,119
it which is a great way to learn because

2254
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:09,840
you can try out different stuff and see

2255
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:11,519
what

2256
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,489
if you want support the video series we

2257
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,870
do have a patreon as well and we've got

2258
01:29:14,488 --> 01:29:17,669
a news and forum site that's pretty cool

2259
01:29:15,869 --> 01:29:19,019
to go to it's got a lot of useful stuff

2260
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,789
on it like the schedule for the week is

2261
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,140
up there there's an episode guide if you

2262
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:24,420
want to catch up with old episodes got

2263
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:25,800
time coded videos up there for you if

2264
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:27,539
the coding resources page with ports to

2265
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,460
Mac and Linux and other stuff that's

2266
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:31,109
pretty handy and the code discussion

2267
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:32,640
forum you can ask questions on if you

2268
01:29:31,109 --> 01:29:34,109
would like to ask questions so if you

2269
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,250
try to learn from the stream I highly

2270
01:29:34,109 --> 01:29:36,269
recommend going there it's great place

2271
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,619
to check out and there's a lot of very

2272
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:41,700
helpful people very nice people up there

2273
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:42,869
who answer questions and stuff so thank

2274
01:29:41,699 --> 01:29:45,840
you very much for joining me we will be

2275
01:29:42,869 --> 01:29:49,470
back here again not too long from now at

2276
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:51,600
9 a.m. tomorrow morning to do some more

2277
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:52,829
work on the player movement code I'm not

2278
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,420
sure what we'll do after that I think I

2279
01:29:52,829 --> 01:29:56,760
want us maybe start getting into jumping

2280
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,779
and bouncing that sort of stuff and so

2281
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,590
that's probably what we'll get into I

2282
01:29:57,779 --> 01:30:00,119
don't know if we'll get into tomorrow

2283
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,319
but certainly starting next week we will

2284
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:03,180
get into that because that's what I'd

2285
01:30:01,319 --> 01:30:06,179
like to do as our next step that we're

2286
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:07,560
going to do with vectors so again thank

2287
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:10,020
you very much for joining me and I hope

2288
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:11,100
to see you all tomorrow and if not if

2289
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,260
it's too early in the morning I

2290
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:16,460
understand I will see you Monday so

2291
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:16,460
thanks for tuning in everyone
