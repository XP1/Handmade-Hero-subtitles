1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,099
okay hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:07,139
handmade hero the code the code that's

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,000
good show are we code a complete game

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,039
live on stream except for when we're on

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,650
our side break which we are right now

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,048
and so what I've been doing rather than

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,250
just being off the air completely is

8
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:22,469
taking questions from people like we do

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,028
on the normal show but instead of having

10
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:25,858
the programming we just have questions

11
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,289
since I can write just fine with my

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,250
right hand not a problem it's really

13
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,730
only the left hand that's busted so

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:40,049
without further ado I will talk about

15
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:43,459
something that I got a question on in

16
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:46,649
email which is pretty straightforward to

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,878
explain but is somewhat complicated to

18
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,620
implement due to really the ambiguity of

19
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,409
it and I'll try to explain why that's

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,269
the case although certainly it's a lot

21
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:03,948
better understood now that it used to be

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,949
anyway Elvin was asking about inverse

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,849
kinematics

24
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:16,450
and essentially his question was very

25
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:18,938
broad it was like I don't know what this

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:22,659
is like what does that mean what's like

27
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:24,489
explain tell me tell me about this what

28
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,490
is it how does it work why do why do we

29
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:29,199
care about it right and I think that's a

30
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,699
pretty reasonable question if you've

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,310
never worked on character animation

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,930
before or robotics you probably don't

33
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,750
really know what this is and you have

34
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,250
some vague notion of what it is perhaps

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,409
because you use it in some kind of a

36
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,939
tool like an art tool or something but

37
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,710
it's not really clear what that means in

38
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:50,469
code or where the term comes from or any

39
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:52,359
that stuff all right so inverse

40
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:55,209
kinematics is actually exactly what its

41
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,799
name implies it's just if you don't know

42
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,679
what this term means then you wouldn't

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,420
know why inverting that makes any sense

44
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:03,640
so let's start by talking about the term

45
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,209
kinematics and what it means in this

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,759
case so the term kinematics in this

47
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:14,110
context is talking about the concept

48
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:16,389
that for many of the things that we care

49
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:21,690
about in computer graphics or robotics

50
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:21,689
where you have what would be called a

51
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:30,879
multi-link assembly which you might

52
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:35,169
colloquially refer to on your own body

53
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,569
as an arm let's say or a leg right

54
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:40,569
something that sort of got multiple

55
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:43,750
pieces to it which can move independent

56
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:47,500
of each other in some ways but dependent

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,759
on each other in other ways this is what

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,439
we are talking about when we talk about

59
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,469
kinematics we're talking about taking

60
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,889
one of these things and figuring out

61
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:59,560
where it is when we know it's joint

62
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:03,578
angles or rather the parameters that

63
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,750
describe its state so for example if I

64
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:10,329
was to imagine sort of my arm right

65
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,329
here's Casey and here's my shoulder and

66
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:16,420
I was to imagine my arm coming down here

67
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:17,049
to it to my elbow coming up here to my

68
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:21,219
hand

69
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:23,010
yeah if I was to talk about that we

70
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,740
could say that this was a two linked

71
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:28,840
assembly right

72
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:32,750
here's link 1 and here is linked to

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,729
right link 1 is for the purposes of this

74
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,629
discussion if we're just talking about

75
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:38,509
just the arm

76
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:41,180
it's rigidly attached right here right

77
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:43,669
meaning it can't there's nothing I can

78
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,990
do to move my my shoulder out of its

79
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,299
socket that's not going to be incredibly

80
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,340
painful and very dangerous to me so for

81
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,950
all intents and purposes my elbow I'm

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,229
sorry my shoulder socket is like a fixed

83
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:58,310
location and the arm comes out of that

84
00:03:54,229 --> 00:04:00,369
right and it's a rigid bone but it comes

85
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,849
down to an elbow and the elbow can bend

86
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,289
right so there's another thing there's

87
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,299
another degree of movement that can

88
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,620
happen here so this you know as we all

89
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,719
know my shoulder is kind of like a ball

90
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,450
and socket joint so it's it's locked in

91
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,469
position but it can it can rotate around

92
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,988
and then the same thing is true here

93
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:20,600
it's this is connected fairly rigidly it

94
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:23,810
can't be separated but it can be rotated

95
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,900
in in at least one way and sort of to a

96
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,280
limited extent in another way right so

97
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,289
this has got some degrees of freedom on

98
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,939
it as well and by the way I should

99
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,560
define that term we talked about that a

100
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:39,500
bunch in this context so I'm going to

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,079
talk about what that means in a second

102
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,879
here so let's put that on the board so

103
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,879
if we're to talk about this in isolation

104
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:55,819
here is the hand here's the shoulder

105
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:58,699
here is the elbow then what do we need

106
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:01,819
to know to figure out where the hand is

107
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,139
well if we you know simplify this for

108
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:05,540
the sake of the diagram although this

109
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,189
does not simplify or it doesn't change

110
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,270
the Nama klaich or anything else but if

111
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,939
we just simplify for say good diagram

112
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:14,479
and say this is 2d we might say that

113
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:16,610
well we need to know the angle that the

114
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,770
shoulder is coming out of the arm socket

115
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,980
right like maybe we need to know how

116
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:25,519
much I've lifted my arm right so as I

117
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,730
come this direction and similarly I

118
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:32,569
would need to know how wide my elbow is

119
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,700
opened you know so I've got a certain

120
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,139
angle here that I need to know in a

121
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,699
certain angle here that I need to know

122
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,680
but at that point

123
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,689
for this very simplified model of an arm

124
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,569
we've constructed if I know these two

125
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:46,910
things then I know for any position of

126
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:49,129
the shoulder that you give me I know the

127
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,410
position of the hand because these links

128
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,969
don't change length right I know this is

129
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,770
a certain length here I know this a

130
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,000
certain length here so all I have to do

131
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:59,689
is start at the shoulder

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,850
take the this angle walk out along it

133
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,610
until I go this distance and I get to

134
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,100
the elbow I then again rotate my

135
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,400
direction using this angle and then I

136
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,689
walk out this length here until I get to

137
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,009
the hand and then I know the hands

138
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:18,850
position that process of figuring out

139
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:21,289
where something is based on an initial

140
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:27,610
location and a series of parameters that

141
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:30,970
describe the assembly that is kinematics

142
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,889
so we would describe the process of

143
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,210
taking a state vector essentially

144
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,189
because you can imagine we now have a

145
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:41,239
state vector of this thing right we have

146
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:43,730
two angles the theta and the Phi that

147
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,550
describe the state of our arm and at any

148
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,379
time we can take knowing this that the

149
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,949
constants in fact let me let me be a

150
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:54,379
little bit more explicit here we could

151
00:06:51,949 --> 00:07:00,379
think of this as having sort of

152
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:03,980
constants and variables right the

153
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:07,339
constants are the l1 and the l2 right

154
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,770
and the variables we might say R theta

155
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:12,679
and Phi but I might also include the

156
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:14,269
position of the shoulder right because

157
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,100
if this can move around then technically

158
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:18,589
that's that's an input now maybe that's

159
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,840
a constant maybe that goes here but you

160
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:23,029
know it doesn't matter point being the

161
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,619
the arm is completely described by these

162
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:26,029
things and which ones you wanted to be

163
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,480
constant and which ones you want it to

164
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:31,609
be variable is you know is up to you

165
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,620
when you're describing the problem but

166
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,020
the point is taking one of these state

167
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,850
vectors right so you know whatever we

168
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:39,560
want to call this right maybe we have a

169
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,660
state vector we call that s let's say

170
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,360
taking one of the state vectors and

171
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,330
saying we've got P hand out here I want

172
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,000
to know what P hand is taking that state

173
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:55,849
vector and producing the location of the

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,100
hand that's kinematics okay now let's

175
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,590
talk about this right here

176
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,870
degree of freedom well degree of freedom

177
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:05,779
is the term that's used in this Naumann

178
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:10,389
clay Chur really to talk about this

179
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:14,269
state vector right however many scalars

180
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:16,519
right and remember for those of you who

181
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:18,319
are who are math and paired which I'm

182
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:23,089
not condescending I am NOT a good

183
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,310
mathematician a scalar is just a single

184
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:28,219
floating point value basically right a

185
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:36,169
scalar is a single value not a vector

186
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:38,920
just a value however many independent

187
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:42,169
scalars we have to describe our system

188
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:51,469
that is how many degrees of freedom we

189
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:54,169
have right and so in this case right

190
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:59,330
it's kind of a little bit complicated if

191
00:08:54,169 --> 00:09:02,179
if I were to move this guy over here so

192
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,790
that we have the constants l1 l2 and the

193
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:07,219
position of the shoulder then this is a

194
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:09,860
very straightforward system it's very

195
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,090
easy to understand and the reason I say

196
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,700
that is because we have two we have two

197
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:19,100
variables here and those two variables

198
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:23,300
as I move them allow this arm to move

199
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:26,060
around in space right so we have two

200
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:27,859
degrees of freedom and it's very clear

201
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,809
that we do because the number of

202
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,950
variables and the number of actual

203
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:37,369
effective ways I can move this thing is

204
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:40,129
is coincident right I have two axes of

205
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,620
motion right I can move on the x and y

206
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,389
axis the hand by changing these joint

207
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,269
angles and I have two joint angles it's

208
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:51,799
clearly t2 DOF throughout the system but

209
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:54,919
that's not always so clear right because

210
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:57,579
if for example I did this the other way

211
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:00,889
right I said no this is a variable again

212
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:03,139
now it's very unclear because it would

213
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:04,080
appear that we would have four degrees

214
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,500
of freedom right

215
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,480
I can set this angle this angle and this

216
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,179
X&amp;Y right there's an X here and a Y

217
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,750
right of the shoulder so that would look

218
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:18,329
like I had 4 degrees of freedom and in

219
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,070
some sense depending like again there's

220
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,230
a certain nominal Eicher there's a

221
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,090
certain formalism to the way that these

222
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,519
things are talked about in certain

223
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:32,460
circumstances you might say that this

224
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:35,039
had 4 degrees of freedom ok but in

225
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,310
actuality if you're talking about the

226
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,379
the result the thing we care about the

227
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:42,109
position of the hand there's still only

228
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,129
two degrees of freedom because

229
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,919
regardless of which of these things you

230
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:50,100
change you're always only changing the X

231
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,500
or the Y or both of this arm the X&amp;Y

232
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,840
position of the hand is the only thing

233
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,669
you can affect so yeah you can change

234
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,840
for different variables but the outputs

235
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:01,110
only going to end up changing two

236
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,820
variables right so the apparent four

237
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,649
degrees of freedom that we look like we

238
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,260
have when we talk when we modify our

239
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,509
state vector end up coming down oops

240
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:12,539
sorry that's our constants end up coming

241
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:16,950
out in our in our output there's only

242
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:19,139
two degrees of freedom okay and

243
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,420
incidentally Eve it's not even as simple

244
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,149
you might say well well KC you have the

245
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:28,919
position of the hand I know that that is

246
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:31,110
a vector that's like P you know pH x ph

247
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,370
Y or whatever I can clearly see by

248
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,620
looking at the output there's two

249
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,590
degrees of freedom right so Y you know

250
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,899
that makes it easy still not easy right

251
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,360
and the reason for that is let's suppose

252
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,789
that we constructed a different type of

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,590
arm assembly let's suppose that the arm

254
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:50,159
assembly that I gave you was an arm

255
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:56,280
assembly that looked more like this okay

256
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:58,949
and now what I do is I say you don't get

257
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,259
fada and Phi anymore the inputs to the

258
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,840
system are Theta and some function of

259
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,179
theta which this is set to right so

260
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,720
basically I'm only giving this my state

261
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:11,969
vector here is only the theta that's it

262
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,860
and I'm gonna solve I'm gonna write an

263
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,800
equation for this that makes it so that

264
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,190
whatever theta I input here I

265
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,899
automatically

266
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,880
slide this arm along the x-axis right so

267
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:28,199
it never leaves the x-axis no matter

268
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:30,929
what I do okay if I were to do this this

269
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,160
link assembly would now appear to have

270
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:35,429
two degrees of freedoms because the

271
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:39,629
position of the hand does look like a

272
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:42,599
vector PHX PHY but in reality we know

273
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,549
that pH Y is constant no matter what I

274
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,680
set this to it will always just slide

275
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,509
back and forth along a fixed position in

276
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,120
Y right

277
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:53,159
so again degrees of freedom can be very

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,500
complicated and deceptive depending on

279
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,779
how complex your system is you may have

280
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,490
to think a little bit to figure out how

281
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:05,610
many degrees of freedom the system

282
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:06,720
really has okay so hopefully that's

283
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,220
relatively clear again we're not

284
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
implementing this in hand-made here or

285
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,160
anything like that this is just to give

286
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,680
you an overview of it so you don't have

287
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:17,069
to understand of the specifics all that

288
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:19,349
much but hopefully that gives you a

289
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,190
little bit of an overview of kinematics

290
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,659
which is taking a state vector that is

291
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,430
describing sort of almost you can almost

292
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:29,189
think of it as a mechanical assembly

293
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:31,259
thinking robotics tends to help like you

294
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,910
know there's a motor and we can set it

295
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,490
to various positions or whatever you

296
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:37,049
know and it you know can rotate left or

297
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,580
right or could rotate up or down or both

298
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,049
or whatever and so you're literally

299
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,840
talking about what are the positions of

300
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:45,209
these motors right and given those

301
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,720
positions of the motors where is the end

302
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,160
of this thing okay

303
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:55,410
so I'll give you one more term here and

304
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,909
that is end effector and I know since we

305
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,439
have an effector on the chat

306
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,838
I feel like he'll be happy to see that

307
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,580
his name is a formal term in robotics if

308
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,860
he didn't know that already which maybe

309
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:09,870
he does so typically what we call this

310
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,519
this thing I was following the hand

311
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,379
right I was saying the thing the thing

312
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,659
that we care about where it actually is

313
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,789
when we're doing our kinematics that is

314
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,379
called the end effector and it's called

315
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:20,610
the end effector I suppose I don't

316
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:23,070
really know I don't know the history

317
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,009
because in robotics where this stuff was

318
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:28,050
originally sort of formalized you you

319
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:29,789
cared a lot about like a grasping arm

320
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:30,809
right you were trying to like grab

321
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,939
things or

322
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:35,250
position a robot's appendage somewhere

323
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,500
to do some mechanical thing like put

324
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,419
together a car or who knows what pick

325
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,009
something off an assembly line and so

326
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,629
end-effector it was the thing at the end

327
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:44,309
that you were actually trying to do

328
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,990
stuff with and that's what you actually

329
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:49,109
cared about so that's where inverse

330
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,419
kinematics and kinematics sort of you

331
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,490
know started having this terminology

332
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:55,409
built around them as far as I know again

333
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,259
not a historian so that's just my

334
00:14:55,409 --> 00:15:02,509
assumption could be wrong all right so

335
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:05,519
that's all great but that's kinematics

336
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:07,319
so what's inverse kinematics well

337
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:13,289
inverse kinematics is exactly what it

338
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:15,870
sounds like if kinematics is taking a

339
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:23,669
state vector and producing an end

340
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:27,230
effector position I should say end

341
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:34,049
effector let's put it this way let's say

342
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:40,680
if it takes a joint state and goes to an

343
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:43,259
end effector state right that is

344
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,659
kinematics we input the joint state v

345
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:47,069
theta fi whatever we get out an end

346
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:52,439
effector state which is the position of

347
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:54,330
the hand inverse ah why why does it do

348
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,300
that I need to disable this why does it

349
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:00,060
have that function it's so that is so

350
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:06,269
annoying stop okay

351
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:08,489
anyway inverse kinematics is exactly

352
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:13,470
what it sounds like reverse this process

353
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:17,039
take the end effector state as your

354
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:21,180
input right this is the input this is

355
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:23,779
the output and instead tell me what the

356
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,779
joint state is

357
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:33,269
now why do we care about this right well

358
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:35,278
we care about this because almost all

359
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,299
the time when you actually are dealing

360
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,958
with these sorts of things

361
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:44,159
this kinematics right is the part that

362
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:45,419
the render loop does right whatever the

363
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,578
whren directions they render loop I

364
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,469
should just say the renderer right in a

365
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:50,789
3d renderer or 2d renderer or any

366
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,600
renderer that wants to deal with

367
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:56,610
articulated bodies these by the way

368
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,899
these things are often called

369
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,129
articulated bodies don't ask me why

370
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,120
because they articulate and they're made

371
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:07,380
up of rigid bodies

372
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,990
I guess anyway this is what the renderer

373
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,059
does the renderer has some kind of a

374
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,890
state like what the joints are and it

375
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:16,078
has to produce the 3d positions of

376
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,909
everything so it can render it so the

377
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,948
kinematics problem we deal with all the

378
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:21,929
time and we even dealt with this on

379
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:25,890
handmade here we had the concept right

380
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:27,900
of the hero you know it had a ground

381
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,059
point and then its head was like up

382
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,000
somewhere offset from the ground point

383
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:35,308
that's basically a kinematic chain it's

384
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,589
saying I know this and I know that

385
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:39,990
there's an offset that puts me here well

386
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,769
I need to find out where here is that's

387
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,450
kinematics

388
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:46,529
it's simple kinematics but its

389
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:50,759
kinematics right so that's what the

390
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:54,418
renderer has to do but if you want to do

391
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:57,529
modeling work right if I want to specify

392
00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:01,880
what's supposed to happen and find out

393
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:05,210
what my multi-link assembly looks like

394
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,710
then you need inverse kinematics because

395
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,798
if I'm an animator or something like

396
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,720
this or we're on an assembly line and

397
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:15,210
the robotics vision computer thing says

398
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,009
hey I got to pick up that package and I

399
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,620
know where the package is the location

400
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:21,450
of it it's got to get the arm there and

401
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,089
the same is true for animation the

402
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,960
animator might say oh yeah I've got this

403
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:29,788
this arm assembly right and I need it to

404
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,720
touch this point I need it to go reach

405
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:32,759
out and grab this thing

406
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,769
well the animator doesn't want to have

407
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,539
to fuss with these joints and like use

408
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,279
the rotation tool to like eventually get

409
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,690
it there

410
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,279
the animator just wants to say here's

411
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,710
where it should be and then it wants the

412
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,660
computer to solve for what those joint

413
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,579
angles would be so that it touches it

414
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,960
directly again same thing with the

415
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:50,000
assembly line if this was something that

416
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,920
the robot had to go out and like you

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,440
know it has to weld at that point or

418
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,750
something it needs to solve for what it

419
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,039
has to set its step motors to so that it

420
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,259
knows that it's going to actually be

421
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:04,029
there and actually be touching the point

422
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,029
that it needs to touch okay

423
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,590
so inverse kinematics is very literally

424
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,240
that thing it's the act of taking an end

425
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:13,250
effector state and producing the joint

426
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,380
state from it such that other parts of

427
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,779
the system whether it's a renderer in

428
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,230
the case of game development or an

429
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,849
animation system or if it's something

430
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,680
realistic like in the real world like a

431
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:28,519
robot that actually needs to set its

432
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,769
motors to do something we need to know

433
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,900
what that joint state is because it

434
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:37,609
needs to feedback into the other parts

435
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:41,509
of the system okay so how do we do that

436
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:45,319
right how does that actually work well

437
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:51,170
it's really really really nasty right I

438
00:19:45,319 --> 00:20:00,439
K as it's abbreviated is a nasty nasty

439
00:19:51,170 --> 00:20:04,759
nasty problem and the reason it's a

440
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,370
nasty problem is because well I

441
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:10,099
shouldn't say because the reason it's a

442
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:14,319
nasty problem is for two really really

443
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:18,500
tricky nasty little nasty nasty reasons

444
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,970
and really if we're being generous or

445
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,140
start being pessimistic we could say

446
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:31,029
three reasons number one you know

447
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:31,030
inverse trig is always harder than trig

448
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:47,428
some degree that's the basic one number

449
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:55,950
two it's typically over determined and

450
00:20:47,429 --> 00:21:03,559
if it's not it's discontinuous and

451
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:10,100
number three there are there are usually

452
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:14,038
joint limits so let's talk about these

453
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:17,538
all right so first of all you know what

454
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:20,429
can I say even in the most simple basic

455
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:22,950
scenario that you might imagine it's

456
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:25,019
always harder to construct something

457
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,999
that reverse solves for a bunch of trig

458
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,739
stuff than it is to take some input

459
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,960
angles and just produce what the thing

460
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:33,778
is right the inverse problem is always

461
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,639
almost always harder than the original

462
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:38,669
problem and you see this pretty much

463
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:40,349
everywhere right you know a matrix

464
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,749
multiplication is a lot easier than

465
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:46,378
matrix inversion right I mean it's just

466
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:49,038
inverting things as is tricky and so

467
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:51,868
just to start off with you can imagine

468
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,608
I'll just give you a very very

469
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:55,709
straightforward example in that

470
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:58,138
situation we were talking about where I

471
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,970
said okay let's pretend that we have the

472
00:21:58,138 --> 00:22:02,128
position of the hand the position of the

473
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,629
shoulder and we just have a theta here

474
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:09,028
and a Phi here okay knowing only what

475
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:11,398
you know from handmade here oh you can

476
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:15,929
produce the kinematics equations for

477
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:19,469
this easily okay all you have to do is

478
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:22,649
write the cosine theta sine theta vector

479
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:26,669
equation right that rotates you theta

480
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:28,498
from down you have to go you know this

481
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:30,600
is the L 1 this is the L 2 lengths you

482
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:33,419
just multiply that vector by L 1 that

483
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:36,509
you get and you would be here okay

484
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:39,059
that's like that and then you then know

485
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:41,128
well okay so if I want to know where

486
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:42,839
this thing is I just need to take this

487
00:22:41,128 --> 00:22:45,628
Phi it's on the inside and I'm pointing

488
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:46,709
that way so I would just do you know PI

489
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:48,869
minus Phi

490
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,420
right to get because this is this right

491
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:53,759
here is 180 degrees right and I want to

492
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,519
know how much to rotate this vector by

493
00:22:53,759 --> 00:23:00,990
that way right you would then take this

494
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:03,690
vector rotate it that way by PI minus

495
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:08,220
Phi and then you would go l to along it

496
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:10,610
and you'd go here so doing forward

497
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,589
kinematics really not very difficult

498
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:15,689
okay it doesn't matter how many links

499
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:17,669
there are in the chain it doesn't matter

500
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,039
how many dimensions the problem is in

501
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,680
really it doesn't matter anything at all

502
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,109
it's just very straightforward to start

503
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,539
somewhere and have a prescribed route to

504
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:29,909
get to where you're going now the

505
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,339
inverse problem we've never done

506
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,140
anything like it on handmade here oh

507
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:37,799
okay if you want to try it for homework

508
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:40,110
it's actually pretty difficult I you

509
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:42,119
maybe give it a shot sometime if you're

510
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:43,740
interested it's not something that will

511
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,989
probably ever come up on handmade here

512
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,490
oh but it's it's difficult we've never

513
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,109
shown how to do anything like it it's

514
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,650
not something I would expect you to just

515
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:54,990
know how to do even if you're a

516
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,310
confident 3d programmer if you have

517
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,259
never thought about inverse kinematics

518
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,240
or it's a little tricky and this is the

519
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:05,430
simplest possible case it's just a -

520
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:08,599
link this is called - link I k2d - link

521
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:12,600
I K right because just two links and

522
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:14,789
it's kind of hard so just for starters

523
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,349
it gets annoying and the reason it gets

524
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:18,509
annoying is because even in the simplest

525
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:20,490
possible cases it's harder than the

526
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:22,680
forward problem so it's a little bit

527
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:25,170
nastier just right off the bat even if

528
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,910
we don't introduce anything else but

529
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,160
then we get into the bad stuff like this

530
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,750
is not so bad right that's not too bad

531
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,279
you tell me you got to solve this it's

532
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,710
like okay I can solve it I'm not gonna

533
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,319
cry myself to sleep at night over that

534
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,940
but this starts to get bad so I say

535
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:42,149
typically over determine and if not it's

536
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,080
this continuous right so let's talk

537
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,120
about this one first

538
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:51,929
so typically over determine what that

539
00:24:45,119 --> 00:25:01,769
means is so let's say under determined

540
00:24:51,930 --> 00:25:04,620
and overdetermined okay so if something

541
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:08,309
is under determined or over determined

542
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:14,189
right and us realized this is the wrong

543
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:17,039
phrase that's what I actually wanted to

544
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,470
say this is typically under determined

545
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:24,420
and if mass is continuous sorry about

546
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:27,750
that just brain fluttering off into

547
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,000
space okay so I'll be determined in over

548
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,980
determined what are these mean

549
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,440
well over determined is not such a

550
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,000
problematic situation for us in ikb cuz

551
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,140
it wouldn't really be something we'd

552
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,720
ever have to care about so I'll tell you

553
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:43,470
what it is over determined is when you

554
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,079
have a system that has more requirements

555
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,569
for how it has to be set up then it has

556
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:53,339
variables to actually satisfy them right

557
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:55,230
so an over determined system is I can't

558
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:57,269
really think of a way to describe what

559
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:05,099
it might mean in ikb cuz it never really

560
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:07,049
comes up I don't really know it would it

561
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:10,169
would be it would be like if I said

562
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:13,649
something like the hand has to be here

563
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:14,820
and here right like this is the position

564
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,050
of the hand and this is the position of

565
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,059
the hand it's like well the hand can't

566
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,919
be in two places this is over determined

567
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:22,200
right that systems over determined

568
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,789
you've you've given me so many

569
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,640
requirements that I can't possibly hit

570
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,440
them and now you might say well what

571
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,060
that's just dumb like why do we even

572
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,470
have a name for that and it's because a

573
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,269
lot of times you actually do deal with

574
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:37,110
systems like that just not in AI K and

575
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:38,910
an example if I had to extend this bogus

576
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:40,949
example into something you might

577
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:42,779
actually do you could imagine that what

578
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,090
a graceful failure of the system would

579
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,950
do in an overdetermined context would be

580
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:49,169
to place it like in between the two of

581
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,120
them or something so that it's as close

582
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:55,320
as possible it minimizes the degree to

583
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:56,909
which each one is unsatisfied right so

584
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,559
there's a lot of other contexts where

585
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,790
overdetermined systems make sense to

586
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,769
talk about and you care about them I

587
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:02,680
cannot so much I mean maybe there is but

588
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:04,869
I don't ever

589
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,390
I've never seen that like myself so I

590
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:09,219
don't know but underdetermined is where

591
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,080
it's usually at now the reason that it's

592
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,120
usually there is because normally with

593
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,129
AI K you're dealing with systems that

594
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,809
have a lot of links so for example one

595
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:20,230
thing that I might want to do in a video

596
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:24,759
game very common is if we go back to

597
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:30,279
anatomically correct KC right obviously

598
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:31,900
this is exactly what I look like okay if

599
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,149
we were to talk about this and we were

600
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,860
to say I need to position KC's hand

601
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,590
somewhere and I want to position it over

602
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:40,000
here right so my eye case salep is

603
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:42,429
trying to figure out what I would need

604
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,829
to do to put the hand here okay

605
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:48,370
now in the case where it's only a two

606
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:49,480
link arm all right I'm gonna go back now

607
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,939
because this is where we need to start

608
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,099
talking about this

609
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,900
remembering degrees of freedom in a two

610
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:58,839
link arm the number of degrees of

611
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,259
freedom which were two happens to be the

612
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:04,480
same as the output okay there was an X

613
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:06,400
or Y output of the hand location and

614
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,710
there were two degrees of freedom that I

615
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:13,630
could use to position it so if it was a

616
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:16,059
2d two linked arm in a plane okay and I

617
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,460
want to put it somewhere well that can

618
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:20,829
be solved exactly all right it is not

619
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,240
over determined or under determined the

620
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:24,069
number of degrees of freedom and the

621
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,329
output space are the same the degrees of

622
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,740
freedom in the input space and the

623
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,990
output space of the same might be a way

624
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,880
to phrase it right so if we're talking

625
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,680
about how many different variables there

626
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,510
are in the state vector and how many

627
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,230
variables there are on the output target

628
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:40,660
they're equal and so hey great two

629
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,579
equations and two unknowns this is

630
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:48,180
simple mathematics it's exact I solve it

631
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:52,449
we're all good right so that works but

632
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:56,039
if I were to then say okay not anymore

633
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:59,440
now I'm gonna include all these joints

634
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:01,149
right I'm gonna say that KC can stand on

635
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,400
this leg right you're gonna put his

636
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,800
weight on this leg so these this stuff

637
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,600
has to be fixed but this joint this

638
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,789
joint this joint this joint and this

639
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,730
joint are all allowed to move to hit

640
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,319
this goal well even if each of these

641
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,028
joints only had

642
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,710
one angle which really in a real

643
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:19,929
situation they have more even our to

644
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,519
link our quote-unquote to link one would

645
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:23,200
have had more right because the shoulder

646
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,460
could be thought of as having two

647
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,470
degrees of freedom because it's a ball

648
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,870
and socket so it can really rotate in

649
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,759
two along two axes right it's got it's

650
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,969
got a whole sphere of movement there

651
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:36,099
right but all of these even if they each

652
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,808
only have one degree of freedom somehow

653
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:40,089
which is a not realistic thing they all

654
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:42,638
have more than that we would have one

655
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:43,119
two three four five six degrees of

656
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:46,778
freedom

657
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,579
to play with on the input right but our

658
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:50,079
output would still have only two degrees

659
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,769
of freedom or if this were 3d three

660
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,720
degrees of freedom

661
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:55,359
right if it's a 3d we'd only have three

662
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,690
you have XY and Z to specify but we'd

663
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,939
have six joint angles to solve for and

664
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,440
that is an underdetermined state that is

665
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,610
a system that's under determined we

666
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:15,159
don't have enough equations to solve

667
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:17,740
right so what do we do okay no math no

668
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:20,889
amount of direct solving math is gonna

669
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,319
get you out of this scenario because as

670
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:25,719
you know with you know the mat the

671
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:28,210
algebra that you've been taught in in in

672
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:32,019
you know junior high school or wherever

673
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:36,429
else grade school math right you know

674
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:39,940
that you need one equation for every

675
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:42,250
unknown and in our system we have

676
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,548
degrees of freedom which are essentially

677
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:49,210
unknowns right we have the state vector

678
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:51,908
on this side here right we have these

679
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,700
these variables that describe our arm

680
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:56,649
each one of those is an unknown and we

681
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,740
have to solve for it so if the degrees

682
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:02,469
of freedom in the output are less than

683
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:05,048
this we will simply not have enough

684
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,419
equations right assuming that each one

685
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:10,750
of these things does something right has

686
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:12,220
as a separate thing we won't have we

687
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,500
won't have enough equations to generate

688
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,149
now like I said before sometimes you can

689
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,398
get lucky and sometimes you can get

690
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:20,528
situations where like remember I drew

691
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,509
this thing where you can say oh you know

692
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:27,069
let's say there's only one input to my

693
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:28,179
system right or uh let me put you that

694
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:31,058
way let me let me

695
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:33,460
a slightly different way let's say I

696
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:35,740
only have one input right so I have like

697
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,419
an X here right that's I'm going to

698
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,220
specify and so you might say well

699
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,538
there's there's two angles here right

700
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,009
how am I gonna solve for that well

701
00:31:40,538 --> 00:31:43,269
sometimes you get lucky and like I said

702
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:45,669
if you're if the description of your

703
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,259
assembly is that this is theta and this

704
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,879
is some other function of theta that

705
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:50,740
forces it to always be on the line well

706
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:51,638
now even though this appears like it's

707
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,069
got two degrees of freedom because

708
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:56,439
there's two joints really those joints

709
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,878
are dependent so now you still only have

710
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,470
one thing to solve for you're just

711
00:31:57,878 --> 00:32:01,240
solving for theta and so you have one

712
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,179
input one output everything set

713
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:11,649
everything good right you can solve that

714
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:14,048
not a problem okay so when we end up in

715
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:15,939
a situation where we have a state vector

716
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:18,819
that has more things we can set in it

717
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,860
then our output has information that we

718
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:22,839
can use to solve for those things that

719
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:24,819
is an underdetermined system and that's

720
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:30,819
where i care gets really nasty because

721
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:32,618
now you need some way of making up what

722
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:35,048
the joint angles should be that has

723
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:38,349
nothing to do with the fact that you

724
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:41,618
need to end on this position so what do

725
00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:44,798
you do well one very typical thing you

726
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:47,079
might do is say I want whatever is the

727
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,829
thing that moves me the least from my

728
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:52,808
current location right that's that's one

729
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:55,449
way of doing it because then I say well

730
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:57,579
okay I know that I can try to solve for

731
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,200
something that hits here and I can now

732
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:01,538
subject subject it to a minimization

733
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,659
criteria of try to do something which

734
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:07,089
moves me the least from where I am

735
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,690
that's now a way that I can perfectly

736
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:12,668
determine my system there is only one

737
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,860
smallest movement or family of movements

738
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:17,080
that would do that and so now I have a

739
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:19,778
shot at solving this right typically I

740
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,609
can't solve it directly still I may have

741
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:23,648
to solve it iteratively or do other

742
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:27,368
kinds of fanciness but you know I could

743
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:30,788
do that another one might be solve it

744
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:32,678
where there's some rest state and I want

745
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:34,749
to be as close to the rest state on each

746
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:40,798
of my things as possible another one

747
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:40,798
might be try to I don't know

748
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,250
I'm not thinking of a whole lot other

749
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,259
ones to be completely honest with you

750
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,179
try to distribute the motion evenly

751
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:52,089
among all the joints might be another

752
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:54,130
one right so I don't want to like do

753
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:56,349
everything on the last joint and hit it

754
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,850
or the last two joints I want to spread

755
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:58,449
the motion out over all the joints

756
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:00,819
evenly

757
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,440
that'd be another way to do it so you

758
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:04,178
start to introduce these artificial

759
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,750
criteria that are sort of based on other

760
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:09,128
things right and then that's how you get

761
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,500
out of the undetermined system thing

762
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:13,299
because if you had to produce an exact

763
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,608
solution with no other information you

764
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,889
would be like I can't solve it right you

765
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:19,299
need some other information to say you

766
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,128
know you could just give some random

767
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,269
solution there are ways of solving the

768
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,889
problem so that you know that you'll hit

769
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:26,230
it and it's just a random mathematical

770
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:27,669
thing but usually even those they have

771
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,929
something that they're actually secretly

772
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,969
doing like if you look at what the math

773
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:33,190
is you're like oh it actually always

774
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:37,388
produces the solution that does blah or

775
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:39,639
whatever right okay so that's really

776
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,980
nasty because it takes it from a problem

777
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,899
that's that would just be a series of

778
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,869
equations that you can just solve to

779
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:48,730
something that's this kind of fuzzy

780
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:50,740
requires minimization possibly iterative

781
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,619
algorithms like it takes it into a whole

782
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:56,918
nother realm of problem solving right

783
00:34:52,619 --> 00:35:00,250
and similarly even if you don't have

784
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:03,969
that problem for some reason you if you

785
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:07,329
if you don't have the the over

786
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:10,209
determined thing sorry under determined

787
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:11,230
thing you have typically another problem

788
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,570
which is that often times it's

789
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,490
discontinuous and what that means is if

790
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,980
you were to write equations that do

791
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:19,689
solve it directly so they are actually

792
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,190
like you have a situation where you have

793
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:27,490
the two linked I K right and you you

794
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:29,380
know you wrote to the equations for

795
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:31,598
solving for the end effector in terms of

796
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,940
these two angles directly typically

797
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,820
those direct solutions end up being

798
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,980
discontinuous so like when you move this

799
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,740
thing smoothly so I move it like here

800
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,829
here here and here right it moves it

801
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:49,029
like it does like this this and then it

802
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:51,250
like pops to that right because usually

803
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:53,080
there's some positive negative term in

804
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,389
here because you can almost see it if

805
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,449
you just think about the problem right

806
00:35:55,389 --> 00:36:00,219
if I told you to put the thing here

807
00:35:57,449 --> 00:36:02,649
right here's the the position of the

808
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:06,099
hand here's just the shoulder right well

809
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:09,340
for any solution that I give right yes

810
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:12,039
there's only one solution in this

811
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,620
quadrant that can satisfy this but I

812
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:17,949
could always take the negative flipped

813
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:20,409
version and that also solves it so even

814
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:22,539
though it's basically a solution usually

815
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:25,000
and this is because of the trigonometric

816
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:28,389
nature of it right there's a positive

817
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,340
negative possibility in there all the

818
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:33,190
solutions will can have a positive

819
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,920
negative choice in them and so typically

820
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,809
you end up in situations where even

821
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,159
they'll they'll be like a singularity in

822
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:40,900
here where there's no way to really make

823
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:43,029
its move smoothly through that point

824
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,710
without having it flip and you just have

825
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,700
all these other nasty misses again

826
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,079
that's something you need to really

827
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:48,519
think of too hard about I'm just kind of

828
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,329
pointing them out as things that happen

829
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,009
in AI K and finally if all of that

830
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:56,769
weren't nasty enough

831
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,180
we've got nasty number three and nasty

832
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:00,280
number three is that usually nobody

833
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:02,049
wants you to actually solve this problem

834
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,390
in such a clean fashion as what I just

835
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:07,390
suggested normally it's not oh hey

836
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:08,710
here's just some some joints and here's

837
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:10,989
the theta and theta could be whatever

838
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,449
you want it's like that theta cannot be

839
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:15,159
whatever you want typically really what

840
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:18,489
normally happens is something more like

841
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:20,799
this we built this robot right and it's

842
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:24,039
got you know a range of motion that's

843
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,039
like this or something so the joint that

844
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:29,860
comes out of here cannot go past this

845
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,659
point this is like a hard limit and it

846
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,400
cannot go past this point and that's

847
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:36,279
true of the human body too right you

848
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,930
can't rotate your arm any further than

849
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,090
this right I can't rotate it through

850
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:41,739
here okay that's just that's just the

851
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,440
way physical things work they hit stuff

852
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:46,059
so you know if you're animating a human

853
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,429
you've got all these joint constraints

854
00:37:46,059 --> 00:37:51,159
similarly here right this elbow it can't

855
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:52,480
bend past here right it's got to be up

856
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:55,000
and it can come all the way back here

857
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,400
but then it can't bend pass there okay

858
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,679
so now not only do you have this problem

859
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,970
of over I'm sorry you can see keep

860
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:04,509
saying over terming underdetermined

861
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:06,369
systems and the nasty inverse problem

862
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:08,200
you got to solve but now you also have

863
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,190
to deal with boundary conditions that

864
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,899
are basically saying

865
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,909
like oh okay you know there's

866
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,940
constraints on this problem where you

867
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:18,759
that the answer is constrained to lie

868
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,470
within this value and this value so you

869
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,150
can't just solve it for anything you

870
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:25,328
have to solve it in the space that's in

871
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:27,490
there and so that interacts with this

872
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,410
determination problem where you kind of

873
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:31,750
have to do these systems that go like oh

874
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:33,368
okay try some things and it early try to

875
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,659
figure out can I move it here do I need

876
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,670
to move this joint over there bla bla

877
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:38,828
bla it could be really nasty because

878
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,659
math tradition was pretty bad at dealing

879
00:38:38,829 --> 00:38:41,800
with these sorts of things they turn

880
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:45,219
into these things

881
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,780
they're called well actually I think the

882
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:53,679
entire domain is called operations

883
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:55,690
research right and what's the general

884
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,348
name for the problem if you actually

885
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:03,329
solve these directly it's called I can't

886
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:03,329
believe this is not something I remember

887
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,990
this is gonna drive me nuts

888
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,750
so in operations research there's a name

889
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:16,858
for this kind of problem where you're

890
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:21,338
doing solves that are it's a nonlinear

891
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:27,900
it has constraints and it's got a

892
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:27,900
minimization criteria and it's called

893
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:36,130
this is why getting old is awful do not

894
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:38,858
ever like basically like stay 27 or so

895
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:42,099
for as long as you possibly can do not

896
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:44,920
ever hit 30 try to have an asymptotic

897
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:46,809
age so that every year you get older by

898
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,849
like half as much as you got older the

899
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:50,440
previous year so that you net you just

900
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:55,300
never you can live like the rest of your

901
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,220
life and never get past like 29 it's not

902
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,460
so there's a special case of it called

903
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:05,679
Danzig's algorithm that's not the one

904
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:07,980
that I mean this is a special one that

905
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:12,568
has constraints that has additional

906
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,568
qualifications to it it's called

907
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:31,460
a linear complementarity problem so I

908
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,929
believe a linear complementarity solver

909
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:37,610
is the one that does all these things

910
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:40,239
and they're very complicated let me see

911
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,240
if I remember that

912
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:53,799
yes I think this is it

913
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:03,760
yeah so I'm pretty sure Lemke's

914
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:08,089
algorithm is the one I was thinking of

915
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,100
and this is the mere compass okay I may

916
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,230
have just fished that one out we'll have

917
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:13,279
to wait for the chat to referee it to

918
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,990
know if it's actually wrecked but I'm

919
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,750
pretty sure that that's called a linear

920
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:19,519
complementarity problem and so you need

921
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:21,650
a linear complementarity problem solver

922
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,000
if you're going to solve it Lemke's

923
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,800
algorithm sounds really familiar to me

924
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,869
so I think this is that I'm correct in

925
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:34,789
the name here so that is really big bad

926
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:36,880
ugly math it's it's it's pretty tricky

927
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:39,199
there like basically these iterative

928
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,820
solvers some of them are direct solvers

929
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,219
but they still operate iteratively

930
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,320
essentially and others are like solvers

931
00:41:43,219 --> 00:41:46,879
that are converging solvers that that

932
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:51,670
you that you run over time and their

933
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,750
answer gets refined and yeah you know if

934
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:56,000
basically anything that we do on

935
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:59,929
handmade Hiro that in terms of math

936
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,619
solving is nothing close to how bad

937
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:05,210
these guys are they're just nasty and

938
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:06,920
thankfully like lately I think if I

939
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:08,570
remember correctly they've gotten kind

940
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,070
of better at doing iterative versions of

941
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,960
them that aren't so complex and aren't

942
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,150
so numerically unstable as they used to

943
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,480
be so it's probably better now than it

944
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,250
was but point being not what you want

945
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,920
for a cakewalk like you don't really

946
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,929
want you don't want to hear someone say

947
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,789
if you can avoid it that we need a

948
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:28,639
linear complementarity solver for this

949
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:31,369
thing so really nasty and a lot of times

950
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:34,009
in AI K they just cheese it they don't

951
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:35,960
actually use anything like this they'll

952
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:39,020
actually just use some kind of cheesy

953
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,909
half-baked iterative thing that just

954
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:44,269
kind of moves joints generally towards

955
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:45,949
the goal and that tends to be good

956
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:47,449
enough sometimes you can do sort of

957
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:50,389
cheesy stuff there are some pretty

958
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:52,629
simple algorithms that work okay and

959
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:54,799
that is actually what people often use

960
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,000
instead of like trying to do things that

961
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,050
are extremely mathematically rigorous

962
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,608
for them so yeah so nasty nasty nasty

963
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:06,830
problem it's just a really bad problem

964
00:43:03,608 --> 00:43:10,699
as I alluded to there though if you need

965
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:11,750
to use it the good news is that usually

966
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:15,529
most

967
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:18,739
of the time and I you know not all the

968
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,120
time so you know I apologize for those

969
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:24,169
of you or not in this circumstance but

970
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:27,650
most of the time you don't really need

971
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:31,099
to mathematically accurately solve I

972
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,750
cape problems in that sense right

973
00:43:31,099 --> 00:43:34,779
because if you think about it in like an

974
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:38,030
animation context or something like this

975
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:41,090
it's not really about getting a precise

976
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:43,430
mathematical answer right and so you're

977
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:47,240
just looking for something that achieves

978
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:49,779
the goal of positioning a leg or I mean

979
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:54,229
a foot or a hand at a location

980
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:57,620
reasonably well and so even though this

981
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,929
problem specification is super nasty as

982
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:02,119
I sort of said just moments ago there

983
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:05,329
are some cheesy algorithms that work

984
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,949
reasonably well so you can use it in a

985
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:09,980
game context and not be too worried

986
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:13,639
especially if you're just using it for

987
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:15,139
fix up right so for example if you're

988
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,179
just trying to take an animation that

989
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:18,559
somebody made and adjust the position of

990
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:20,629
the hand so that it hits something

991
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,949
exactly that's like on the ground or

992
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,840
whatever like it's a pickup animation

993
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:26,389
and I want to adjust it so that it hits

994
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,769
whatever it's picking up exactly that's

995
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:30,170
not so hard

996
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:32,239
a simple iterative thing that moves the

997
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,190
joints a little bit which and there's

998
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:39,679
been a number of papers on this sort of

999
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:41,210
thing will work so yeah I just wanted to

1000
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,980
get across that NASA the problem was but

1001
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,539
I don't want you to like go cry and

1002
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,429
despair or anything if it is something

1003
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:49,070
you need to do there are lots of

1004
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:51,469
approximate sort of things that look

1005
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,660
fine when you do them that maybe aren't

1006
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:55,309
really rising to the level of qualifying

1007
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:57,259
as solving the problem in the

1008
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:59,690
mathematical sense but that's not really

1009
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:01,850
what you mean needed you usually only

1010
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,909
need to solve in the visual sense and

1011
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:07,519
there are plenty of options there so

1012
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:11,230
that's the good news if that makes a

1013
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:11,230
sense so that's about it

1014
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:23,329
hopefully that gave you some background

1015
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:25,700
on the inverse kinematic situation and

1016
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:28,279
yeah we're pretty much out of time so if

1017
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:31,219
you have questions on it we can always

1018
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,230
take them tomorrow but that's pretty

1019
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:34,699
much what there is to it you know if we

1020
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,050
were to go any further into it we'd have

1021
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:38,149
to start talking about actually how you

1022
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,680
solve it right like you'd actually start

1023
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:42,019
coding a solver or something from here

1024
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:52,339
and talking about the different stuff

1025
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:54,530
but so yeah all right uh so I'm gonna go

1026
00:45:52,340 --> 00:46:00,530
ahead and wrap up so wait I have a

1027
00:45:54,530 --> 00:46:01,820
question here mister fourth dimension I

1028
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:04,040
would think boundary conditions would

1029
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,930
help to move towards being more

1030
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:07,969
determined so why don't each of those

1031
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:11,539
two problems reduce the severity of the

1032
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:16,730
other so the reason is because math is

1033
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:20,590
really bad at inequalities right so if I

1034
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:26,539
tell you to solve the equation 2x plus y

1035
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:29,809
equals 4 and X plus 3y equals 6 this is

1036
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:33,529
what math excels at really really well

1037
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:37,639
right if instead I tell you to solve the

1038
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:43,850
problem 2x plus y equals 4 and you know

1039
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:46,940
X plus 3y is less than 6 well this

1040
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:49,039
doesn't really help all that much right

1041
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,869
kind of what this did is just make

1042
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,699
things more complicated for you because

1043
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:57,829
now you have to sort of talk about a

1044
00:46:52,699 --> 00:47:00,349
family of solutions 1/2 space right and

1045
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:00,949
carving spaces in half doesn't really

1046
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:02,469
help you

1047
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:05,509
it actually makes things more difficult

1048
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:07,609
because now instead of having a free

1049
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:12,200
variable you have a free variable up to

1050
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:13,910
a point right so it's really just the

1051
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,099
difference between this which is always

1052
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:19,969
helpful and this which is really just

1053
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:21,139
further complicating and it's not to say

1054
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:23,119
that it doesn't limit the space of

1055
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,829
solutions it obviously does but it

1056
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,639
doesn't limit them limit them in a way

1057
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,889
that math

1058
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,179
advantage of very easily and sometimes

1059
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:31,068
it's actually a way that makes math

1060
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:33,889
harder because now you can't just solve

1061
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:36,199
for variables or reduce to a single

1062
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:38,989
variable that varies because now there's

1063
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:40,608
actually like a hard cut in the space of

1064
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,989
solutions that nothing can be on one

1065
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:44,000
side up but if everything could be on

1066
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:46,298
the other side of hopefully that makes

1067
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,298
some sense

1068
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:55,900
elven thanks for the awesome answer I

1069
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,970
was intending to use AI K to sell for

1070
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,798
foot placement on uneven terrain so we

1071
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,328
have an animation of the dude moving and

1072
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:04,108
want to places foot correctly on the

1073
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:08,079
ground is that hard no it's not too hard

1074
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:11,259
I don't know what the latest

1075
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:15,690
state-of-the-art in AI K on in easy ika

1076
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:19,838
is but you know there's like recursive

1077
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:23,470
descent versions that are super trivial

1078
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:26,498
to implement and I think they're called

1079
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:27,939
possibly iterative descent maybe but

1080
00:48:26,498 --> 00:48:29,978
like the super trivial wants to

1081
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,440
implement that actually work fairly well

1082
00:48:29,978 --> 00:48:37,149
for stuff like that is you know I've got

1083
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,670
the leg let me do the side view so the

1084
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:41,559
problem right is the animation place the

1085
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,088
guy's leg here and that's just obviously

1086
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:45,519
totally wrong because it's underneath

1087
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:48,068
the ground right this is the ground this

1088
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:51,248
is the foot so I want the foot to be up

1089
00:48:48,068 --> 00:48:53,429
here so what the iterative descent ones

1090
00:48:51,248 --> 00:48:58,748
do they're really really straightforward

1091
00:48:53,429 --> 00:49:04,169
what they do is they say well okay if I

1092
00:48:58,748 --> 00:49:06,478
needed to move this guy to here right

1093
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:14,499
try to remember exactly what this does

1094
00:49:06,478 --> 00:49:18,038
it's I think what it does is it says

1095
00:49:14,498 --> 00:49:21,879
like the vector from me to the end

1096
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:25,528
effector right whatever that is try to

1097
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,528
rotate that so it faces

1098
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:36,520
I cannot remember this so basically you

1099
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,710
run this multiple times I think it's

1100
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:40,539
that you take the vector from the

1101
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,608
location of the joint you're gonna work

1102
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:44,590
on so you start at you start it like the

1103
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:46,690
route let's say and you say alright I've

1104
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,789
got a vector from here to here okay

1105
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:52,119
I rotate it so that it's in line with

1106
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:52,630
this thing right so basically it points

1107
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:55,809
like that

1108
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:58,059
then I take the next joint right and

1109
00:49:55,809 --> 00:50:01,269
I've got that line from here to here and

1110
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:02,590
I rotate it so that it points along so

1111
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:04,989
the you know it's coincident with this

1112
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:07,559
thing then I just start again so I come

1113
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:10,479
back up here now my end effector

1114
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:12,579
Direction is here right so now I rotate

1115
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,119
it again so I gotta rotate it this way

1116
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:20,219
right so that my my line is here and

1117
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:29,320
then it just not drawing this very well

1118
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:30,849
let's do it one more time okay so I want

1119
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:35,289
to move this foot up target is here

1120
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:37,868
right so I first take this vector and I

1121
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:40,179
say I want this vector to point all

1122
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:42,640
right so this is the vector from the the

1123
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:45,039
end effector I'm sorry from the the

1124
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:47,379
joint we're on to the end effector I

1125
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:49,210
want to rotate so that this points

1126
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,550
directly through there right so that

1127
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:53,440
moves me up a little bit here right then

1128
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,730
I've got this guy it's out here and I

1129
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,039
look at that I say well I want to rotate

1130
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:58,809
that in right because I want again I'd

1131
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,608
move to this joint and I do this joint

1132
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:02,650
so it points in that direction I then

1133
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:04,329
start again here and I would see the

1134
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,250
same thing I see it down there I got to

1135
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:07,989
move it up so it rotates up a little bit

1136
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,849
and then again it's out so it moves it

1137
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:12,039
in a little bit right and eventually it

1138
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:14,170
will hit so you just do you know you do

1139
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:16,389
like ten iterations of that thing or you

1140
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:19,030
can iterate up to like a thousand times

1141
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:20,500
or something but stop when you get close

1142
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,300
enough to your goal you can choose how

1143
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,820
you want to budget your time or however

1144
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,200
you want to do that right but within you

1145
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,119
know ten iterations or something like

1146
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,049
this it's gonna be pretty darn close to

1147
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:33,280
the goal and then you could stop and

1148
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:34,660
that's really easy to implement joint

1149
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,800
constraints in because then when you do

1150
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,909
your rotation you just never let

1151
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,490
yourself rotate past the joint

1152
00:51:36,909 --> 00:51:41,858
constraint this is pretty good for Ike a

1153
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:43,839
fix ups it's not so good for whole body

1154
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:46,029
Solutions whole cloth

1155
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,680
because it it'll hit joint constraints

1156
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:49,269
and not realize it should kind of rotate

1157
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,389
out of them so it can get it gets caught

1158
00:51:49,269 --> 00:51:58,559
in local minima right or local Maxima

1159
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:58,559
should say so yeah let me see

1160
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:08,349
cyclic coordinate descent that's what

1161
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:10,030
it's called I forgot the name of it

1162
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:13,049
cyclic coordinate descent is the thing

1163
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:15,610
so silly coordinate descent is like

1164
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,990
totally fine so I think I would suspect

1165
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:21,460
because I haven't done character

1166
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:23,709
animation work in since 2003 or 4 right

1167
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:26,500
I would suspect that by now there's a

1168
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:29,409
better so there's a better simple

1169
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,960
technique at even signal Gorgon scent

1170
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:33,250
was not the best technique for AI K even

1171
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,960
though in its time but it's the easy

1172
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,639
it's very very easy and produces

1173
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,409
reasonable results there might be ones

1174
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,389
that's similarly as easy now that people

1175
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:42,190
have figured out that produce good

1176
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:44,259
results so you might want to do a survey

1177
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:47,110
of the literature really quickly because

1178
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:52,540
you know you might get lucky I don't

1179
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:54,730
know but anyway there you go all right

1180
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:55,750
I'm gonna close it down cuz we are out

1181
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:59,860
of time

1182
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:03,699
and yeah that's really all I have to say

1183
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:09,160
about that that's really all I have to

1184
00:53:03,699 --> 00:53:10,149
say about that so thank you everyone for

1185
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:11,139
joining me for another episode of

1186
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:14,559
handmade hero it's been a pleasure

1187
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:17,769
coding with you as always if you would

1188
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:20,130
like more chats until we're off RSI

1189
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:24,250
break I will be back here tomorrow 5:30

1190
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:26,769
Pacific Standard Time I'd love to see

1191
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:30,579
you I hope you'll be able to make it

1192
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:33,849
until then my friends have fun coding

1193
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:36,389
and I will see you on the Internet take

1194
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:36,389
it easy everyone
