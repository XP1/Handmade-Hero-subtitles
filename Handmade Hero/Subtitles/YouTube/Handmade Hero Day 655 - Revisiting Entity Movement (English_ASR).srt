00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:08,080
hello everybody and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
hero i wanted to take a look well you

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,718
know there's there's two things we could

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,399
do today and and i think i'm just gonna

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:13,759
pick um

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
one of them

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,160
uh because i don't actually have a lot

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,118
of experience with the other and i was

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,118
going to be yeah i mean

10
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,039
let me show you what what we're doing

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:28,320
here so if you take a look at the

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,359
currently running version of this game

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,439
uh

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
which is oh uh i should probably put it

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840
in release mode because we don't

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:39,280
actually care right now um

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,040
uh about debugging anything and i think

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,439
i had it in debug mode because i was

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,878
doing that remedy bg

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,280
um

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,799
a lot of people saw that remedy bg uh

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
video i don't know how many people were

23
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,279
actually convinced to give it a try i

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,120
hope

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,679
a fair number of people were but like i

26
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,519
did this video if you didn't see it on

27
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,960
the molly rocket channel

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,520
um but there's like basically a a video

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,760
up here that i did where i i put yeah it

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
had like 15 000 views which is a you

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
know it's not a huge number of views but

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,920
it's pretty good for like a weird you

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,118
know niche programming channel like mine

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,799
is

35
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,200
that's still a lot you know the average

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,640
videos maybe only get about half of that

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
you know what i mean

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
so uh

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
hopefully like some people maybe got

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,960
interested in remedy out of that but i i

41
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,478
did a video where i basically said

42
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,118
here's a bunch of stuff that i think is

43
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,879
cool about remedy that's like stuff you

44
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,560
you know maybe aren't going to do in in

45
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,078
visual studio or whatever and that was

46
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
kind of cool

47
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,478
but

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,478
in general

49
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,679
back to handmade hero

50
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,399
uh we are at a stage where uh at some

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
point i would like a glow shader uh when

52
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
when you get these like little like uh

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,680
panels that are gonna light up on the

54
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,719
floor

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,560
um i want them to kind of glow and so

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,920
when we do the final resolve we're gonna

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,439
need like a pass uh over that that does

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,840
some bloom

59
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,889
um probably no halation

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,118
because

61
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,239
[Music]

62
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,120
you know there's two things that cause

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,080
the

64
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
the

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
light to

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,879
appear outside of the region where the

67
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,280
light actually is so if you have a

68
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:21,199
bright thing like this right

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,959
in a darker area

70
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,399
uh there's two things that people are

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,959
used to seeing and they come from film

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,680
they're not really real things that

73
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,439
happen in

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,200
i mean one of them sort of maybe is the

75
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,959
other definitely isn't

76
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,318
uh that happen in the real world with

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,759
your eye but film when you film things

78
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,719
that are bright

79
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,679
uh you get two effects that happen one

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,000
is a thing that's very specific to film

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,480
it's called halation

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,159
and what halation is is film is like a

83
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,119
stack of

84
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,000
sheets

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,599
uh that respond to color

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
uh wavelength of light there's a blue a

87
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,280
green and then a red sheet from the top

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
to bottom

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,800
and then there's a thing called an

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,360
antihilation layer and then there's the

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
actual like film substrate the back like

92
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
the back piece

93
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,719
and what happens is when you have a lot

94
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,519
of photons striking the film

95
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,519
not all of them actually get absorbed

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,400
not all of them strike the silver halide

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,480
particles in the actual like

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
uh layers that are supposed to receive

99
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,959
them

100
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,238
and get it that would get exposed like

101
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,759
the negative you know that would get

102
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,599
exposed

103
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,759
and those photons hit this thing called

104
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,359
an antihilation layer which tries to

105
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,878
absorb as many photons as it can it's

106
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
like as pure black as it could be in a

107
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,120
way like it doesn't reflect anything but

108
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,798
even that isn't perfect so if you have a

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,879
really bright exposure on a film what

110
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
happens is some of those photons bounce

111
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:56,079
back up

112
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,840
and expose the red layer sometimes the

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
green layer rarely ever the blue

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,080
layer of film

115
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,519
and so what you'll see in film is

116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
there's like a orange red

117
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,039
because you know the blue layer is not

118
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,919
really getting affected a

119
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,598
orange at the brightest to red dark red

120
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,599
at the outside

121
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,839
fringe around things and that's called

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,320
halation

123
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,478
that's one of the effects and it's very

124
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,918
specific to film and wouldn't really be

125
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,439
appropriate in this game like i'm

126
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,519
probably not going to add like film

127
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,000
grain to this game because it's kind of

128
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,079
cartoony looking i probably wouldn't add

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,319
vignetting which is something that you

130
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,519
see sometimes i also wouldn't

131
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,360
add red green blue distortion which is a

132
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,120
lens distortion thing these are lots of

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
things you see in indie games now that

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,720
try to make things look better for low

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
end art or whatever

136
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
um

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
i wouldn't add most of those and i

138
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,639
wouldn't add hilation either because

139
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,919
those are all very film specific effects

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,319
and i don't think they're very

141
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,159
appropriate here so really what we'll be

142
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,519
talking about adding is what's called a

143
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
bloom

144
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,560
filter although it's a really bad name

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
because there's another thing called a

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
bloom filter that has nothing to do with

147
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,159
visuals

148
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,198
uh what it actually is simulating is

149
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
light

150
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,038
scattering errantly in the lens

151
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
apertures in the in the actual like uh

152
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,439
camera assembly

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,960
so what happens is photons when you have

154
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,719
a lot of them

155
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,319
like a very bright layer

156
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
or if you're just shooting in the sun i

157
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,478
don't know if you've ever seen

158
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,439
one of those uh things where you put

159
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,599
like a

160
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,839
you know cameras have these snouts

161
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
that like there's a thing after the lens

162
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:41,119
that's just like a hood that goes over

163
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:43,038
it that's long

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
really what all that kind of stuff is is

165
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,478
it's to prevent

166
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
stray photons from bouncing around

167
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,120
inside the lens assembly and hitting

168
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,038
random places on the film back right

169
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,319
but even if you do that so that you have

170
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,680
a narrow channel and you're just

171
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,000
receiving light from the thing you're

172
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
actually pointing at very bright light

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
can still hit imperfections

174
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,638
in the lens

175
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,680
uh aperture and the camera assembly

176
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,639
and scatter when it scatters it will go

177
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,360
outside of where it's actually supposed

178
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,199
to be exposing the film because it has

179
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
it's you know the lens

180
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,759
is not perfect curvature there might be

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
particles in it that will deflect the

182
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,759
photons there might be just like

183
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:28,079
imperfections in how in its radius right

184
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,680
and all of those things combine to

185
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,198
scatter a little bit of light outside of

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,879
the actual place that the light is

187
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,680
supposed to be focused even when

188
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,478
something is in focus what that means is

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,918
that very bright light sources will

190
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,839
produce you'll see some of that haloing

191
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,038
and that's what a bloom filter is meant

192
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:52,318
to uh you know basically

193
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,318
uh simulate right

194
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,638
so

195
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,038
the

196
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,038
while not really appropriate in a way

197
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,000
because it's not real

198
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,719
um

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
it doesn't really exist it's it's

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,800
something that only happens when you

201
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,918
take a picture of something

202
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
um

203
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,439
it's not really there in the real world

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,639
right

205
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,680
uh

206
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,160
it's it's a way that we currently now

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,918
have grim it's a it's a semantic thing

208
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
that we have accepted in our brains from

209
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,758
watching movies

210
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,679
um

211
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,720
and looking at photographs

212
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
in our

213
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
lives

214
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,959
that we know that something is bright if

215
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,960
it has that halo around it like we've

216
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,359
now like kind of like internalized that

217
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,318
as like a grammar for this thing is

218
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
bright

219
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,039
and so what we're really doing when we

220
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:46,478
introduce a filter like that in a video

221
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,159
game that isn't photorealistic right

222
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,478
that that's not doing all those other

223
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,840
things what we're doing is borrowing a

224
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:56,800
shorthand mentally that humans have now

225
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,239
grown up to understand because of their

226
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,240
exposure to mass media

227
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,439
is just saying this is very bright and

228
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,840
so when you light these up right

229
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,399
right now they don't look as bright as

230
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,878
they should because we don't have any

231
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,120
other of those signals in there and so

232
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,879
eventually what i'd like to do is put

233
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,319
those signals in

234
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,840
so a bloom filter would be nice to add

235
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,160
and the other thing that would be nice

236
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,239
to add would be some participating media

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,000
which means like some dust

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,320
in here right

239
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,799
uh so that you will see the light

240
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,200
uh so basically some particles

241
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,559
so uh that's the thing i said there's

242
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,599
two things i might do today that's the

243
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,679
thing i think i'm going to

244
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
delay till later

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,039
um the main reason for that is that i

246
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,278
don't really think i need it anytime

247
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,278
soon it's just going to sell these

248
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,600
scenes a lot better but it's not

249
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,399
actually going to change anything

250
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,480
material about what i'm doing right so i

251
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,559
think we can safely postpone that the

252
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,159
lighting looks great currently

253
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,679
um and and i really have no need for

254
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,838
anything better for most of the

255
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,919
development of this game so i think i

256
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,519
can safely postpone those two features

257
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,759
even though they are going to be pretty

258
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,320
important to making the game look cool

259
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,240
uh and should happen right

260
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,560
so the thing i'd like to focus on today

261
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,720
is just building some basic interactions

262
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,079
here like you know this is what happens

263
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,399
currently if you try to do anything in

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,839
handmade hero you get wedged between

265
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,278
some enemies and because we don't

266
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,880
actually have any combat mechanics in

267
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,120
there i can't kill them and they can't

268
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,000
kill me so we don't really have a way to

269
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,799
particularly do anything like play-wise

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,720
uh in the game right and similarly we'd

271
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,240
like to work on the hopping mechanics

272
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
like we have these pressure plates

273
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,759
because so we you know proved that we

274
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,440
can put those in there

275
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,278
but they don't actually work right and

276
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,040
also they're kind of buggy like they you

277
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,519
can keep pressing them down further and

278
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,719
further and they go right into the earth

279
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,399
right

280
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
um

281
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
so we definitely have a bunch of work

282
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,039
that we would want to do here and so

283
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,200
what i think we might do for a little

284
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,759
while is just go clean up some of this

285
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
code uh put a little bit of like combat

286
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,200
stuff in there clean up the glove i i

287
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,720
haven't thought hard about how we want

288
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,720
like the glove is just on this like

289
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,800
physics spring right here

290
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,800
and i need to think about how i want the

291
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,078
glove to work or like what it's supposed

292
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,240
to do

293
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,239
um this is largely game design stuff

294
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,919
uh so it's not really something that i'm

295
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,440
going to be talking much about or

296
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,120
pretending that we actually are going to

297
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,360
really solve it's more just like me

298
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
putting in something that's vaguely okay

299
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
right

300
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,200
um and i'm just gonna assume that those

301
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,919
who out there who are game designers uh

302
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,839
would if you were working on um

303
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,519
your own handmade hero code base i'm

304
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
just gonna assume that you're gonna go

305
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
ahead and do something

306
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,519
uh more intelligent here than whatever

307
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,278
it is that i'm gonna do uh but that's

308
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,720
your problem and if you have a problem

309
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,399
with it go talk to jonathan blower

310
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,759
somebody who knows game design i don't

311
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,958
want to hear about it because it's not

312
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,120
my job

313
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,719
um so basically like like i said

314
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,320
everything looks good to me i'm really

315
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,240
liking moving around in this world so i

316
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
think it's good enough now that i'm

317
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,639
happy to just say i'll just go like make

318
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,720
a world that i can walk around in and i

319
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,240
can do some stuff in and there's a bunch

320
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,480
of code that i have to write to support

321
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,000
that anyway because we decided to do

322
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,759
basically just keeping everything in

323
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,159
flat 2d

324
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,559
like it is now without things stacked on

325
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,759
top of each other so i would also like

326
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:38,479
um to you know i i'd like to go ahead

327
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,480
and make something where i can um

328
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:45,278
you know hop into like a dungeon to go

329
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,278
like down dungeon levels right

330
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,720
sort of like uh

331
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,078
you know like just

332
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,000
i don't know i mean basically what i'm

333
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,919
saying is i'm to start just doing some

334
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
random stuff here to try and build out

335
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,000
the world because i don't really know

336
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
uh what we're going to do there exactly

337
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,399
and i just want to start to just like

338
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,639
polish that stuff up

339
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,639
because now things look pretty good and

340
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,000
i would like to sort of like have some

341
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,120
experiences in the world because it

342
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,440
looks cool

343
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,278
um and also generate some art asset

344
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,560
lists because we also you know at some

345
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,120
point we'll need some more art for the

346
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,719
game uh and without knowing what's going

347
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,399
on there's really not a lot of ways for

348
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,160
us to request art assets because we

349
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
don't know what our assets we would

350
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,399
actually need furthermore we can also do

351
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,560
stuff like we actually have the ability

352
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,639
to talk to npcs and stuff now but

353
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,399
there's no reason to talk to npcs and no

354
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
reason for them to tell you anything or

355
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,480
to do anything with them and so again we

356
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,879
just we have a lot more features in this

357
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,278
engine that were used than we are using

358
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,919
and so at this point it just seems like

359
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,439
uh logical to build that out again why

360
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,958
hasn't that already been done because

361
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,600
i'm not a game designer and don't really

362
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,479
know what to do so i don't have um you

363
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,120
know one of the things that you'll see

364
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,959
uh if you watch john stream or something

365
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,399
or someone who is a great game designer

366
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,039
there aren't very many of them but you

367
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,839
know uh john at least streams and he's

368
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,439
very good uh he you know he has ideas

369
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,279
about what's going to happen there right

370
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,800
like he one of the things that drives

371
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,320
him forwards when he's working on things

372
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,479
is not the technical excellence of the

373
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,360
thing that he's working on but rather

374
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,278
like some end goal that is a game design

375
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,278
goal that he has right and that's very

376
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,879
valuable when you're working on games if

377
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,879
you're working on them

378
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,879
as a sole practitioner

379
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,879
that's extremely valuable and what you

380
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,799
would love to have if you were such a

381
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,559
person uh i don't really have to do this

382
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,000
in my day-to-day life thankfully most of

383
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,399
the time

384
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,879
but like on handmade hero i'm in the

385
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,519
unfortunate position of having to do it

386
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,399
what you would like there like i said is

387
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,078
some strong idea i mean you know i i'm

388
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,480
able to do this for code like i have a

389
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,239
strong idea of like what

390
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,720
uh i want

391
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,720
to accomplish code wise when i'm working

392
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
on technical things and i think what you

393
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,920
want to have right if you're a game

394
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,278
designer is you want to have that strong

395
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,360
motivation

396
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,600
of what you're trying to

397
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,440
uh move towards right

398
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,959
uh because it's the same you know it's

399
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
the same with game design as it is with

400
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,319
technology and so you know i'm at a

401
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,198
disadvantage there

402
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,199
but uh what i'm not at a disadvantage as

403
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,639
is just wanting to like do basic stuff

404
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,399
in the world and move around it so what

405
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,120
i'm gonna do is basically just let that

406
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,679
guide me like what i want to see in here

407
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,399
just as an experience i'm just going to

408
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,719
make and i'm just going to assume that

409
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,958
the game itself will not be particularly

410
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
good because i don't really have that

411
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,000
kind of a skill

412
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,879
set

413
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,720
but we can make an interesting world

414
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,519
and we can make like some interesting

415
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,600
experiences in it

416
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,399
again and just kind of let that drive us

417
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
so

418
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,519
uh the biggest thing that i would say uh

419
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,679
just to start with is i'd like to sort

420
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,679
of work on the glove stuff a little bit

421
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,198
um and maybe like i

422
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,439
you know

423
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,719
i i'd like to figure out how i want this

424
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
thing to feel

425
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,120
and you can see

426
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,320
with what's in there currently um i did

427
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,879
a little bit of work on this so

428
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,959
uh right now you can kind of see if you

429
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,639
if you hop around the world

430
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,319
we did this a long time ago just kind of

431
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,360
like basic control stuff when we put it

432
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
in

433
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
um the idea

434
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,879
basically behind this quote-unquote game

435
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,278
design

436
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,278
is that if you had a bunch of tiles in

437
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,480
the world not probably like the ones

438
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,039
here because these are just randomly

439
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,120
generated as a test uh but if you had a

440
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,639
certain pattern that you had to like do

441
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,120
in order to open the doors to uh in the

442
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,120
room that you're in so maybe like you

443
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,879
hop into the room and the door is closed

444
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,440
like i said very standard legend of

445
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,120
zelda binding of isaac um it's just a

446
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,560
trope at this point it's a very standard

447
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
game design thing

448
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,278
that you go into a dungeon room and the

449
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,278
doors close and in order to open the

450
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,278
doors again you have to hop on a series

451
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,120
of tiles that's just the central conceit

452
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,360
of the game it's very simple it

453
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,679
shouldn't be that complicated to

454
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,278
produce something reasonable there right

455
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,958
um and so

456
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,278
one of the things that i wanted to do

457
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,958
was make it so that when you hop that's

458
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,799
very important that's why this game is

459
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,958
grid based and you hop is because it's

460
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,319
important where you're hopping

461
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,239
now the

462
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,040
uh when you hop and you land on

463
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,560
something um what i would like to do

464
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,958
is i would like to make it so that you

465
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,518
can also potentially dodge

466
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,518
and so i i was one of the things you can

467
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,679
do right currently is you hit the space

468
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,039
bar and then you can still push in a

469
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,679
direction you can see that represented

470
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,639
by the movement of the head here right

471
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,439
and i don't really again super know

472
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,519
exactly how i want that to work but

473
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,320
that's like part of it so you come you

474
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,000
come on here look at i i can dodge and

475
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,199
we'll have to make it so that you move

476
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
more than this right um

477
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,078
that's not enough of a dodge right uh

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,759
and you can see the glove is just this

479
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,278
weird stupid spring and i don't really

480
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,400
like that i thought maybe there'd be

481
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,558
some interesting things with that but

482
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
the more i see it the more i think

483
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,639
you know it's out of place in this game

484
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,319
um

485
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,319
a little bit

486
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,078
maybe what i really want is the glove to

487
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,318
be very procedural so that you just you

488
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,838
push you know you push a strike and it

489
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:24,159
does that strike and and that's it right

490
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:24,159
um

491
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,479
and again i i don't really know all

492
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,240
these things i'm saying are just like

493
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,400
not real thoughts they're just kind of

494
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,400
like that's basically the idea

495
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,559
so the glove originally was more of a

496
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,880
procedural thing and i wonder if that's

497
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,720
more what we want here i don't know i

498
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
don't know that this game really wants

499
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,558
any

500
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,640
um dynamic stuff in it like that

501
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,629
we may just want everything to be based

502
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,240
on the fact that you are going to

503
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,520
[Music]

504
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,440
um

505
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,240
be standing on squares and stepping on

506
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,679
squares and maybe when you strike

507
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,519
like the strike pattern just

508
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,440
you know one way to think about the way

509
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,240
that strikes work is to make them to be

510
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
very concrete

511
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,240
and so for example one way that this

512
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,399
might be concrete is saying look

513
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
it could be that a glove has a

514
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,080
particular attack pattern and of course

515
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,599
you know there can be glove upgrades and

516
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,119
downgrades and things like that in the

517
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,639
game that you find

518
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,879
was kind of expected to be something

519
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,360
that would happen

520
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,799
and so if you took for example a glove

521
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,719
strike pattern and the glove strike

522
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,359
pattern is like it goes out through

523
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,720
there comes over here back and then in

524
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,839
right like it's like that kind of a

525
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,360
thing

526
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,399
um it could be that like you know

527
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,159
that

528
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
pattern is

529
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,840
is fixed so when you do a strike the

530
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:54,000
glove does that pattern and returns

531
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,480
and the reason that that's sort of

532
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,558
interesting to me is because if the game

533
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,519
is sort of about these geometries that

534
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,599
are formed by tiles in the world

535
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,440
then different glove patterns would have

536
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,639
different ways that you had to approach

537
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,558
different rooms in the game right

538
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
and different enemies would be harder or

539
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,119
easier for different glove patterns and

540
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,520
things like that right

541
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,399
and so i don't really know at the end of

542
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,480
the day that i want it to be really uh

543
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
like the reason that i think it's kind

544
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,599
of interesting to be able to manipulate

545
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
the glove like i'm doing now where it

546
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:31,519
can kind of go in these sort of fanciful

547
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,120
um dynamic physics based patterns

548
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,720
i just don't know that that makes any

549
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,558
sense in this game

550
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,000
one way to look at that would be to say

551
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,678
that it does make a lot of sense in this

552
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,798
game because the game is going to be

553
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,519
about movement being very discreet but

554
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,798
punching being very fluid and physics

555
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,519
based

556
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,720
um that's totally valid i don't know

557
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,440
that there's any way you could argue

558
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,839
that that was like arbitrarily

559
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,840
wrong

560
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:58,639
but

561
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,119
uh

562
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,679
i question whether that's the game

563
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,918
that i would want to be making like like

564
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,900
thinking about it i don't know that that

565
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,969
is what i really want um

566
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,969
[Music]

567
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,079
you know because

568
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:21,440
i feel like what i want is more

569
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,240
something that's that's more about those

570
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,880
tiles that's more akin to like a tactics

571
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,640
game that's just it's not a tactics game

572
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,640
right but it has a little bit of that

573
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,720
sort of i understand what's going on

574
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,480
because i can see where the tiles are

575
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,038
kind of feel

576
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,319
so my sense is that like that might be

577
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,879
more what i want to see happen and so

578
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,119
you know um

579
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,600
it could be that really like we just

580
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,599
don't have

581
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,360
like like one thing that i that i might

582
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,678
one thing that i think could be a valid

583
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
path forward in this game and maybe it's

584
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,360
just good enough for now because you

585
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,038
know i don't

586
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,199
i don't know how to do anything

587
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,480
particularly smart here

588
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,240
um

589
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,640
one thing that might be a good path

590
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,599
forward is just to say okay what's gonna

591
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,840
happen here is

592
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,279
everything is about tiles

593
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,158
always

594
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,399
so

595
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,559
there's no such thing like these heads

596
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,880
can't float like they're floating here

597
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,000
they have to move along actual grid

598
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,280
things

599
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,880
there won't be projectiles that can go

600
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,879
like diagonally

601
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
projectiles are only horizontal and

602
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,720
vertical right

603
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,720
um

604
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,480
and that is both limiting meaning that

605
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,558
okay so you know that that cuts out a

606
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,558
bunch of possibilities but um

607
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,279
uh

608
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,038
it it makes a space for design

609
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,038
that

610
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,240
guarantees that we'll be exploring

611
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,240
something

612
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,279
sort of interesting and unique right

613
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,759
because

614
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,960
rather than just always falling back to

615
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,879
the same

616
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,279
things that you would normally see in

617
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
this kind of game like just projectiles

618
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,038
and other stuff

619
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
we would be forcing ourselves to look

620
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,319
specifically at a subset of game design

621
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,559
that's about

622
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,240
cardinal directions

623
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,960
and that at least seems more interesting

624
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,519
so that maybe we would compensate for

625
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,000
our lack of design skill

626
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,400
by at least being in a space that's not

627
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,960
maybe as well tread so we might come up

628
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,080
with a few things that are interesting

629
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,240
uh that aren't just totally trite you

630
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:48,000
know that aren't just totally the same

631
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,000
as as everyone else right

632
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,840
um so that's kind of my thinking like

633
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,839
maybe that's just how that is and so

634
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,839
that we just don't have

635
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,839
um

636
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,840
like we just don't have things that are

637
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,918
like we almost just don't have a

638
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,319
collision system the collision system is

639
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,559
entirely transactional right

640
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,240
it's it's always about tiles and so when

641
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:27,440
you resolve collisions the collisions

642
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,440
are on tiles and only on tiles right

643
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,759
um

644
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,480
and to me that just seems like the

645
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,720
smartest way to go like at some point

646
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,319
especially if you're weak at game design

647
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,839
i think at some point you just have to

648
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,158
pick something and say this is what the

649
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,000
game is because if you're not super

650
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,039
skilled at game design you're just you

651
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,599
can't

652
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:50,079
you can't

653
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,719
give yourself a complete freedom because

654
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:56,079
freedom is too difficult like

655
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,558
for for unskilled people right you you

656
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,639
need to arb

657
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,960
if you don't have

658
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
gay it's the same in programming right

659
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,159
if you're an expert programmer you can

660
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,679
give yourself complete freedom to do

661
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,840
whatever you want because you will

662
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,159
quickly be able to identify the proper

663
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,519
set of constraints based on the problem

664
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,600
that you're trying to solve because

665
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,440
you're really good right

666
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,399
and you just know how to make those

667
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
decisions

668
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
but if you're not

669
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,599
a very good programmer giving yourself

670
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,359
complete freedom is a disaster because

671
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,240
you just spiral out of control and make

672
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,759
all this stuff and you get nowhere right

673
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,519
and so

674
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,640
based on your skill level i think you

675
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:36,558
need to be willing to like narrow in and

676
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
give yourself artificial constraints

677
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,399
constraints that you don't know if they

678
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,079
were even the right constraints

679
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,679
and the reason for that is just because

680
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,038
like you need to be able to finish the

681
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,159
thing and

682
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,158
and uh

683
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:54,798
and it's too hard a problem without the

684
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,759
constraints for you to be able to solve

685
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:57,918
right

686
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,519
you've you've given yourself a problem

687
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,559
that is outside of your ability space

688
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:07,278
and you need you need those constraints

689
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,038
to give you an easier problem and you

690
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,798
know like in this case i'm saying up

691
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,158
front it probably won't therefore be the

692
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:14,158
best game design you could have done

693
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,640
with this game but we already knew that

694
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,919
was true because of our skill level so i

695
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,200
think that that

696
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
i guess i'm willing to just go ahead and

697
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,919
say let's just do it this way

698
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,240
because i know you could make a good

699
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,240
game that way like i'm sure jon could

700
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,919
make a good game with these constraints

701
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,759
so i don't think we're designing

702
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,559
ourselves out of a good game by making

703
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,558
them

704
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,639
and by picking them arbitrarily it's

705
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,319
sort of saying look this is just going

706
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,159
to be we're

707
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,000
we're putting training wheels on this

708
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,679
design because that's how good we are at

709
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,400
riding a bike right

710
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,440
sure we'd love to ride a 10 speed

711
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,559
you know

712
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
um

713
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,399
but if you can't even stay on the bike

714
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,240
like what are you doing on it what what

715
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
why are you trying to like do the tour

716
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,200
de france right

717
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,120
so i think that's what i'll say is like

718
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
look we're just not gonna do that

719
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,959
entities are gonna have to have move

720
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,719
patterns and we're just gonna say that

721
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,960
like we'll make the best game design we

722
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,120
can within those constraints but those

723
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,200
are the constraints there's no other

724
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,959
options that you get

725
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,798
so figure out how to make the best game

726
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
design you can given the constraint that

727
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,639
everything has to be a transactional

728
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,600
movement exactly like it would normally

729
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,159
be in a tactics game however unlike a

730
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,199
regular tactics game this game happens

731
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,840
in real time so it's kind of like

732
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,480
borrowing the ideas from a tactics game

733
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:38,639
about tiles but not actually having um

734
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,400
any like you know

735
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,278
not actually having

736
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,720
uh

737
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,720
the turn-based nature

738
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,798
you can still move around and do things

739
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,839
as fast as you can figure out how to do

740
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,240
them

741
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,918
and the enemies will as well uh and

742
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,319
that's how that goes so i think what

743
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,240
that means is like effectively we have

744
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:02,240
sort of this move entity call right

745
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,599
and basically what we want to do is we

746
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,960
looked at this and and this was going to

747
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,399
be a bunch of work that we would have to

748
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,679
do too to like finish up collision

749
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
detection

750
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,200
we had some in there but it wasn't as

751
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,440
good as it should be

752
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
again it reduces the work for us we

753
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,880
already did the work of having a

754
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,480
transactional movement system

755
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,480
and so by removing this we would also

756
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
save ourselves some time because now we

757
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,880
don't have to go down this rat hole of

758
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,038
how do we want to handle our collision

759
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,880
and how do we get that up to

760
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,558
a particularly good level so what we

761
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,200
could do is say all right let's just

762
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:36,158
remove this stuff

763
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,000
entirely uh and then we don't have to do

764
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,840
you know the movement displacement or

765
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,480
any of this stuff right we would just

766
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,319
have transactional occupy and we will

767
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,480
have to like improve that

768
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,678
system a little bit because right now it

769
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,079
it it's

770
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,278
we need to get like the leading the the

771
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,079
edge transitions uh working correctly

772
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,278
um

773
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,798
i've done a lot of programming in these

774
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,159
kind of systems before and just just

775
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,359
give you a little bit of a perspective

776
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,880
on it

777
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,240
when we look at the edge transitions

778
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
here there's like

779
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,640
transactional occupy is basically saying

780
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,158
okay if we were doing a move based game

781
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,320
like a tactics game like you would

782
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,200
normally do

783
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,558
um

784
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,360
what would happen

785
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:20,000
on the move when entity x makes this

786
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,000
move right

787
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,839
but in this it's not going to be a

788
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
tactics game it's going to be a real

789
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,480
time game

790
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,558
and so we have this notion of a movement

791
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,558
edges what that means is for example

792
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,319
let's suppose we already see in fact let

793
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,918
me let me just show you because i don't

794
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,759
have to tell you we've already got it

795
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,520
watch very carefully what happens in

796
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,359
fact i'll help you you don't even have

797
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,079
to watch very carefully because we have

798
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,240
a time step adjustment here let me set

799
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,879
it down to one tenth speed watch what

800
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,440
happens when i hop from this square onto

801
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
the tile

802
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:59,199
do you notice how it lit up immediately

803
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,880
which is totally not what we want to see

804
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,240
right it feels wrong

805
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,399
what was happening there well what

806
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,079
happens there is currently our system

807
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,158
just all works on the leading edge of a

808
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,839
transaction when you decide that you're

809
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,600
going to move from one square to another

810
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,359
square all of the events that would

811
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,240
happen from you landing on that square

812
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,479
happen

813
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,399
one of those events is that you will

814
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,200
light up a floor switch right

815
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,798
so

816
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,759
we don't want that

817
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,038
we now be if if we're going to go down

818
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,480
this route right and we're saying

819
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:31,038
everything's going to be transactional

820
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,480
we need to add like basically three

821
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:36,640
stages if you will to the transactional

822
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,480
system it will still work basically like

823
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,799
it currently does but there needs to be

824
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,038
a notion of a leading edge

825
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,960
a sustaining action and then a trailing

826
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,319
edge kind of attack sustain and release

827
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,798
if you will from music nomenclature and

828
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,879
what i mean by that is we have events

829
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,480
that will take place at the leading edge

830
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,480
we will have events that take place

831
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,240
during and events that will take place

832
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,038
at the trailing edge

833
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,038
for

834
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,519
the example of someone hopping onto a

835
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,000
switch that is a trailing edge event

836
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,398
meaning even though the event is more or

837
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
less going to be inevitable because we

838
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,918
know that the hopper is going to land

839
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,679
there

840
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,080
we don't want to trigger it until he

841
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,880
actually lands and furthermore it's

842
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:21,038
still not quite true that is inevitable

843
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,760
because maybe this person for example

844
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:27,038
gets shot right like suppose there is a

845
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,640
projectile that comes to hit me or or

846
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,119
maybe this is an enemy that's hopping on

847
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,360
there my glove like punches them

848
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,519
in the middle of the sustain then the

849
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,959
trailing edge part wouldn't actually

850
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,798
take place so our system will be a

851
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,000
little bit different than what you would

852
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,679
think of when you normally think of a

853
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,919
transactional movement game such as a

854
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,798
tactics game because

855
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,520
unlike a tactics game where the move is

856
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,879
a foregone conclusion when the initiator

857
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,480
initiates it

858
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,120
and really the only concern you have is

859
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
how do you wish to draw it in our game

860
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,879
we really will probably have basically

861
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,678
the equivalent of like what magic the

862
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,679
gathering for example calls an interrupt

863
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,200
where somebody can interrupt the flow of

864
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,360
what's actually going to happen we will

865
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
be having that because it's going to be

866
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,199
an action game um which sounds great i

867
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,038
mean to me that just sounds interesting

868
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,120
so i think

869
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:23,679
again i'm very i'm fine with this uh

870
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,479
approach i think it will yield

871
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,880
reasonable game design results right

872
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,558
so i'm going to get rid of this voxel

873
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,519
stuff that's in here currently and the

874
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:36,158
shape collision uh things that are there

875
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,759
uh and like the voxel stack stuff like

876
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,080
we don't really need that anymore i

877
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,000
don't believe uh and so we're just gonna

878
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,439
get rid of it i

879
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,880
believe like we've got just a bunch of

880
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,679
yeah like all of this stuff we just

881
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,960
don't really need anymore

882
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,000
um and also this align to movement voxel

883
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,480
i don't think we need either

884
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,159
so we can eliminate a bunch of code and

885
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,399
that at least is good from a technical

886
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,840
standpoint because it means that

887
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,518
again we're reducing the workload and

888
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,918
reduce reducing the variability uh

889
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,919
the the sort of like degree that we have

890
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,320
to bulletproof this stuff

891
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,278
uh and so hopefully uh this is like a

892
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,720
plus

893
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,720
in in that respect right

894
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,120
um

895
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,159
[Music]

896
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,918
i think that's all of it right and so uh

897
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,440
all we would really be doing here for

898
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,960
the most part is for starting we would

899
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,558
just say look there's no such thing as a

900
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,798
floating entity

901
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,158
um that just cuts out that entire

902
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,599
movement mode

903
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,440
now these movement modes are kind of

904
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,959
stupid and we probably now want to clean

905
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,640
those up and regularize them now that we

906
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,038
know what's going on but really that was

907
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,200
it right so that's all it takes to

908
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,759
remove that code from the game and now

909
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,319
we can see that like the glove and also

910
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,839
um like the floating heads are now

911
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,200
basically just dead in the water because

912
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,639
they're set to

913
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,919
have that floating moving movement mode

914
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,440
um which we've now said doesn't exist so

915
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,640
uh they

916
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,399
need to

917
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,759
now have some code for how they're

918
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,599
actually going to move

919
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,798
but otherwise this isn't

920
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,480
you know there's no real uh

921
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,158
there's no real magic to it right it's

922
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,240
not uh

923
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,880
it's not rocket surgery

924
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,880
so let's take a look at

925
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,158
yeah you know like this stuff right um

926
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,440
this stuff is

927
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:36,158
is is where we're gonna be living for a

928
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,159
little while right um we kind of need

929
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,360
like some ideas about what's supposed to

930
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,240
happen here

931
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,240
uh and

932
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,398
you know

933
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,399
we're gonna need some

934
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,880
we're gonna need to like basically redo

935
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,480
this whole thing i like

936
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,840
how we're conceptualizing of like the

937
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,159
glove and that sort of stuff

938
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:06,199
now there are some

939
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,200
issues here like

940
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:17,199
i mean i guess one thing we could say

941
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,200
uh is

942
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,119
is is any of this stuff

943
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,638
really what we want so if you look at

944
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,039
how this stuff is working right you've

945
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,639
got this idea of this movement mode

946
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,239
and i think maybe what we're sort of

947
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,159
going to say is look there's like no

948
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,039
such thing as a movement mode anymore

949
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,200
there's just tile to tile movement right

950
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,559
so really these are animations

951
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,559
like that's really all we're talking

952
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,320
about here is like how do i animate the

953
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,480
fact that you're moving you know what i

954
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,800
mean

955
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,440
and so it may be the case that really

956
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,079
what we can do is is

957
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,639
spread

958
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,639
is sort of break this up into just an

959
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,200
animation of how you move from one tile

960
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,280
to another which is sort of what these

961
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,799
actually are now

962
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,280
i think these got

963
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,680
removed by the way let me put this back

964
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,560
in for just one quick second

965
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:14,358
um and see because i think these are not

966
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,358
actual things anymore

967
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:31,599
um

968
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,719
so yeah

969
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,200
when i look at that that's what i'm

970
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,118
thinking right so in my head what i

971
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,039
would want to say is

972
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,240
this is more like

973
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:45,279
we will still want these codes

974
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,039
for the the animation mode like look

975
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,359
what kind of animation is this thing

976
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,599
playing basically we we have pretty much

977
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,838
just procedural animation in this game

978
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,079
and so when you see somebody says i'm

979
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,759
hopping from this square to this square

980
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,839
that's going to be like a particular

981
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,680
animation that's being played

982
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:05,039
that's that's more like what this enum

983
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,000
is right

984
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,960
so it's not a movement mode it's an

985
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,280
animation it's just entity animation

986
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,679
that's all it's going to really be

987
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,839
and then movement will no longer have a

988
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,838
mode associated with it at all there's

989
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,759
just you're going from this tile to this

990
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,679
tile that's it

991
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,079
and some entities will go from one tile

992
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,559
to the next tile meaning like we we move

993
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,560
directly

994
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,039
they can only go to tiles next to them

995
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:40,078
is what i'm trying to say poorly

996
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:42,000
other entities that maybe hop big jumps

997
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,480
could go differently like you know think

998
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,358
of a knight on a chessboard maybe they

999
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,519
can go you know with a big hop um sort

1000
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:52,159
of from one place to another without

1001
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:56,880
touching the tiles in between right

1002
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,879
um so there's going to be sort of like

1003
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,920
there's going to be two ideas there

1004
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,040
right one is just here's the cells that

1005
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
i'm going to touch here's the square's

1006
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,079
going to touch that now can just i think

1007
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,680
be regularized that's just there's just

1008
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,280
basically like

1009
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,358
this is the sequence of squares i'm

1010
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,519
going to hit right

1011
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,199
and everyone can share that same code

1012
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,639
because it's literally just the like

1013
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,759
transactional thing and that's it right

1014
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,559
um

1015
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,720
then this is just the animation style if

1016
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,440
you want to see a hop

1017
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,919
right because this is a hopping entity

1018
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,679
then it sets the animation to hop when

1019
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,760
it hops right

1020
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,159
if you want to see it just float along

1021
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,280
then it sets it to float right so this

1022
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,559
becomes not a movement mode but rather

1023
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,160
just a

1024
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,599
you know

1025
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,519
it's just a

1026
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,720
an animation trigger just like you would

1027
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,400
in any other game normally you'd just be

1028
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,319
loading like an animation off disc in

1029
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,000
this case we're we don't have animations

1030
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,838
off this but we have like procedural

1031
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,920
stuff so really all we're doing is like

1032
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,799
picking what that procedural animation

1033
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,039
is

1034
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,039
right

1035
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,680
um and that to me seems like very sane

1036
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,480
uh

1037
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,000
so

1038
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,838
you know

1039
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,239
i think we can just kind of go forwards

1040
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,679
with that and say like maybe let's start

1041
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,078
by renaming this so it's a little

1042
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,519
clearer and we just say this is entity

1043
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,440
animation

1044
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:25,759
um and we have like animation planted

1045
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,000
right animation hopping

1046
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,800
and animation floating

1047
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,679
and so we just preserve pre preserve

1048
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,280
nice

1049
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,480
we just preserve what we have right now

1050
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,240
but we're going to name it something

1051
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,119
else and move it kind of into a

1052
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,519
different

1053
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,000
place in the code kind of conceptually

1054
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,358
so that now we know that that all this

1055
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,119
is doing

1056
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,639
is driving like that the visual of it

1057
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,680
but it but it has

1058
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:54,559
no like what you set this to

1059
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,440
will have literally no bearing on the

1060
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,880
game

1061
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,800
at all right like it's literally just

1062
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,480
going to be about what you see

1063
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,599
when you

1064
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,719
look at the game

1065
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,720
right

1066
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,719
um

1067
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
i apologize

1068
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,560
for the allergies

1069
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:33,679
um and then the movement will be totally

1070
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,200
different uh so so we won't have yeah

1071
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:36,799
like we're not gonna have like any of

1072
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,759
this stuff or any of that stuff the

1073
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,320
movement's just gonna be a list of cells

1074
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,079
and the transition speeds that you go

1075
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,640
through so basically like

1076
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,480
how long does it take you to

1077
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,078
uh begin your transition how long does

1078
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,760
it take to transition and then how long

1079
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,280
does it take to end right so basically

1080
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,240
those like edges that i was talking

1081
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,240
about

1082
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,078
um like starting hopping hopping and

1083
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,319
then finishing hopping or whatever

1084
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,320
right

1085
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,880
okay so if we go ahead and start

1086
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,199
changing these up uh and we just

1087
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,880
basically go through and and

1088
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:12,318
uh change movement mode here to

1089
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,079
animation

1090
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,279
in fact we could change

1091
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,240
the literal

1092
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,040
word

1093
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,039
movement mode

1094
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,440
and now i just go through and change

1095
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:26,318
that so

1096
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,440
uh

1097
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,440
i think we can do like a

1098
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,200
a replace i don't remember how to do a

1099
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,318
replace i basically never do a replace

1100
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:39,199
is there a place uh query replace

1101
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:41,920
i guess

1102
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,879
replacing all buffers

1103
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,880
movement mode

1104
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,639
with animation

1105
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,720
um

1106
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:55,519
and think that's really all we did yeah

1107
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,279
so i replaced that

1108
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,639
and now it's it's you know called

1109
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,599
animation

1110
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,759
and so now what we would want to do is

1111
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,559
uh go through and

1112
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,640
sort of separate out those two

1113
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,880
pieces right

1114
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:13,358
uh and if you remember

1115
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,960
which you don't i mean

1116
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,039
who am i kidding

1117
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,960
if you remember uh

1118
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,960
when we're doing like

1119
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,519
update and render entities there's

1120
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,838
basically like this code that does that

1121
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,519
sort of breakout

1122
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,599
not the video game breakout but

1123
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,599
basically like this animation loop so

1124
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,240
you can see it right in there

1125
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,960
uh this right here is sort of the thing

1126
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:40,959
that handles like how some how something

1127
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,960
is supposed to animate right

1128
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,000
and

1129
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,000
what i'd like to do here is

1130
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,240
i would like to make the animation be

1131
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,559
something that's just driven off of a tv

1132
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,609
variable which it currently is that's

1133
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,679
controllable directly by the game

1134
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,400
[Music]

1135
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,719
i and that just the transactional

1136
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,000
movement system will just drive that t

1137
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,439
variable

1138
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,318
right

1139
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,599
um and so i'd like to basically move i'd

1140
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,599
like to move this out

1141
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,318
i don't remember that um

1142
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,078
i guess

1143
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,679
you can stomp the enemy

1144
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,560
uh i i do remember vaguely adding that

1145
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,639
um

1146
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,480
i should change internal to function one

1147
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:32,318
of these days i now just type function

1148
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,318
there like i now just use that

1149
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,280
there are reasons why that's not as good

1150
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
but

1151
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,839
you know

1152
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,480
mainly the reason is because it's a

1153
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,480
it's actually a

1154
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,079
pragma

1155
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,760
for

1156
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,800
visual studio to define like

1157
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,760
um intrinsics like memset

1158
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,920
so

1159
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,920
you know

1160
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,838
so if i want to have this animation

1161
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,559
stuff uh now that we kind of know that

1162
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,159
it

1163
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,400
or not no but i believe i sort of know

1164
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,118
how it's going to break down a little

1165
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,039
bit better here what i'm going to do is

1166
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,200
i'm going to grab the animation stuff

1167
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,318
you can actually see like

1168
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,519
yeah there's a bunch of things about

1169
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:24,318
this but um if i just go ahead and grab

1170
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:28,000
this animation stuff here and

1171
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:30,639
grab it out to here

1172
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
in this sort of separated function what

1173
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:34,719
i'm going to do is now just have like a

1174
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,440
a

1175
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,679
an idea a place here where we say

1176
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,519
uh how this stuff is supposed to go and

1177
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,719
we'll probably

1178
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,759
uh not do this anymore

1179
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,759
so

1180
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,720
what you can see is the way that this is

1181
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,319
li the way that this

1182
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,799
code is written

1183
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,239
is it effectively assumes

1184
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,839
you can see a lot of stuff that's

1185
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,679
happening here right

1186
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:01,519
but what you can see is that this

1187
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,679
animation stuff

1188
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:07,199
is basically structured

1189
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:11,759
so that the animation itself controls

1190
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:14,000
how fast like this is actually occurring

1191
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,000
um

1192
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,240
sorry there was a question from a

1193
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,920
simulator right now and i just want to

1194
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,679
see could you please at some point

1195
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,760
explain what internal external function

1196
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:32,000
and static

1197
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,000
uh sure yes i can um

1198
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,920
so this is what is the actual

1199
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,599
uh

1200
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,800
c code

1201
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,599
internal or function is just a pound

1202
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,760
defined to be static

1203
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,880
the reason for that is that static

1204
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,520
itself is used in multiple places

1205
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,440
and it can mean very different things

1206
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,358
so

1207
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,838
here are the three ways you can have

1208
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:01,838
static

1209
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,200
one is in front of a global variable

1210
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,159
one is in front of a function

1211
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,519
and

1212
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:13,519
one is inside a function

1213
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,838
the primary reason for pound defining

1214
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,599
static to something else is i don't ever

1215
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,480
like to type it in

1216
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,880
because

1217
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,920
it does not let me search

1218
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,119
conveniently for this usage specifically

1219
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,920
this one

1220
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,240
this usage is generally you should never

1221
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,838
use for any reason

1222
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:38,318
this is a usage which says that this ver

1223
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:39,599
value persists inside this function

1224
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,639
as a

1225
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,119
persistent value when the function

1226
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,960
when you were inside the function right

1227
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,119
and it persists to the next call of the

1228
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,400
function as well right it's a global

1229
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,920
variable but that's local to this

1230
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,800
function

1231
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,318
um these are extremely dangerous

1232
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,760
and they're dangerous for a number of

1233
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,119
reasons

1234
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,880
the first reason they're extremely

1235
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,559
dangerous

1236
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,200
is because the definition of the sea

1237
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:07,440
spec and seas plus specs is full banana

1238
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:10,318
cakes and says that this variable will

1239
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,318
not actually get initialized until you

1240
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,159
call the function

1241
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,920
the reason that's full banana cakes is

1242
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,519
that because it means that depending on

1243
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,280
what the compiler that you're using

1244
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,960
happens to decide to do

1245
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,920
it might introduce code that's

1246
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,838
completely nuts and bad to guarantee

1247
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,079
that that happens

1248
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:29,440
and you end up in a situation where you

1249
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,359
have weird multi-threaded race

1250
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,440
conditions about who updates the very

1251
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,358
who uh starts

1252
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,679
the initialization of the variable or

1253
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,039
you add extra code to prevent that

1254
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,399
because the compiler's adding code to

1255
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,679
make sure that that works properly and

1256
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,119
that code is bad or like slow or at the

1257
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,118
very least locks up your threads

1258
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,800
uh similarly once you have it here if

1259
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,879
you're calling this from multiple

1260
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,880
threads now you don't really have any

1261
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,119
guarantee that this line of code for

1262
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,280
example in here what's going to happen

1263
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,559
it's not going to yield an atomic so it

1264
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,000
means that your increments of this

1265
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:03,440
variable are wrong if multiple threads

1266
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,358
call the function

1267
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,280
so this is a very bad thing to have

1268
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,358
happen and you really don't ever want to

1269
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,200
do it unless you were very very

1270
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,199
intentional about it and you'd want to

1271
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,279
know everywhere in your code that did it

1272
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,039
so the goal of pound defining static is

1273
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,160
to make sure that you no longer use it

1274
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,519
and you use something like

1275
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,679
this

1276
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,199
which is our pound defined for static

1277
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,879
that we would use in this scenario so

1278
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,639
that we could search for it anywhere

1279
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,640
that it actually happens right

1280
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,079
now

1281
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,079
why do we need to put static in front of

1282
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,079
either of these because otherwise you

1283
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,359
really wouldn't need to right i mean

1284
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,680
what's the difference between that and

1285
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,799
that like for our purposes very little

1286
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:44,799
right

1287
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,760
well the answer is that

1288
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,280
when you are compiling something

1289
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,559
the c and c

1290
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,319
spec again being bad uh

1291
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,680
they have really bad problems with

1292
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,079
linking

1293
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,039
most programs take forever to link if

1294
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,039
you were to look at something like the

1295
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:02,480
unreal engine or

1296
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,279
you know

1297
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,880
some large code base

1298
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,960
like llvm

1299
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,519
or something like this

1300
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,318
they have massive link times

1301
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,639
like

1302
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,880
it takes forever to link

1303
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,838
and a lot of the work that's being done

1304
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,119
is in exporting a crap ton of symbol

1305
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:22,880
names

1306
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,720
out from the compilation process to the

1307
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,680
linker

1308
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:31,279
gathering those up in the linker

1309
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:34,239
merging comdats like doing stuff like

1310
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,240
link time code generation or or you know

1311
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,799
inlining

1312
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,719
and just processing all this garbage

1313
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,000
it's complete waste of everyone's time

1314
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,358
none of it should have happened it's

1315
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,440
just because the spec is bad and

1316
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,558
continues to be bad and nobody really

1317
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,318
knows what they're doing so it never

1318
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,599
gets fixed as a result putting static in

1319
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:54,400
front of these

1320
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,880
is a fast way to tell the compiler not

1321
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,960
to export any of these symbols

1322
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,280
because we use a single translation unit

1323
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,440
build for the most part it means that we

1324
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,400
don't need to export basically any of

1325
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,200
our symbols so we can quickly alleviate

1326
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,559
that burden on the compiler of producing

1327
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,399
the symbol table that it's going to

1328
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,920
export to a linker

1329
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,358
because we can tell it that we're not

1330
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,519
exporting anything to a linker right

1331
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:20,880
and so it just helps keep compile times

1332
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,800
down

1333
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,559
by ensuring that you don't actually have

1334
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,680
this problem

1335
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,400
uh if that makes sense

1336
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:33,440
so really all of this stuff is just to

1337
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,079
make sure that all that stuff goes well

1338
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,318
and really it's all about managing

1339
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,359
arbitrary compiler stuff

1340
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:40,880
um

1341
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,759
because

1342
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,640
just the history of c and c plus plus is

1343
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,119
such that you should never ever trust

1344
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,960
the compiler

1345
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,559
you can never trust the people who write

1346
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,000
the spec or the compiler ever

1347
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,839
even if they happen to be doing

1348
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,960
something okay now they probably will

1349
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:03,199
screw it up next time right

1350
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,289
so really what you're trying to do is

1351
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,480
just make sure

1352
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:07,599
[Music]

1353
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,240
um

1354
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,359
that you are in a position to work

1355
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,479
around whatever latest garbage they end

1356
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,239
up doing

1357
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,400
right

1358
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,000
so that's what we do here and again it's

1359
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,639
just to make sure that we're doing the

1360
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,480
best possible thing that we can

1361
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,159
to try and help the compiler know that

1362
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,159
it doesn't need to send anything to the

1363
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,159
linker

1364
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:47,200
so martin's what does c plus plus 11 and

1365
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:49,440
up do with multiple threads that go into

1366
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:52,239
a static variable

1367
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,240
like what do they do

1368
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,720
what did they expect would happen now

1369
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,719
i'm i shudder to ask

1370
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,880
yeah but putting locks around it's

1371
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,839
terrible

1372
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,440
right

1373
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,199
or that like just putting locks into

1374
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,079
your code that you don't know what kind

1375
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,439
of locks they even were right

1376
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,440
i mean that's kind of what i was saying

1377
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,679
like it's really bad if they put locks

1378
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,039
in there

1379
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:21,358
well it works in one sense but it

1380
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,440
doesn't work in another sense right like

1381
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:24,799
again describing something as working

1382
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,400
doesn't really

1383
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,680
it's not really true

1384
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,280
just because it produces the correct

1385
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:30,879
result if

1386
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,640
if part of the thing was how fast this

1387
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,920
thing was supposed to run or whether it

1388
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:39,440
would have any weird behaviors you know

1389
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:42,000
having locks suddenly in there is not

1390
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,200
you know what you would want

1391
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,400
that said it's not impossible for

1392
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,919
you know

1393
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,519
it's not impossible for it to do a

1394
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,440
reasonable thing because since you can

1395
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,838
just do a

1396
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,079
check that doesn't take a lock first and

1397
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:57,679
only take the lock if the check fails

1398
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,720
then it's unlikely to be particularly

1399
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,558
bad but still it's just

1400
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,480
in general you should never have

1401
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,559
anything that has anything to do with

1402
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,679
threads happen that you don't control

1403
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,440
it's just a bad bad idea and so i would

1404
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:13,118
still stand by my original statement of

1405
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,880
like you don't ever do that

1406
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,640
if you want those things you should

1407
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,760
write them yourself so that you know

1408
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:21,920
what was happening and when

1409
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,800
um

1410
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,838
so

1411
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,800
uh

1412
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:29,119
let me go ahead and

1413
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,119
um

1414
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:32,480
i always imagine local static variables

1415
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,160
as being the same as global static

1416
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,679
lifetime wise only difference is the

1417
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:37,759
variable's only available

1418
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,358
yeah that's not how it works

1419
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,160
um

1420
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:41,838
so

1421
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,000
it's basically like

1422
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:46,078
there it says that it won't actually get

1423
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,079
initialized until you enter the function

1424
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,318
i believe

1425
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,240
or at least that's how it was so it's

1426
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:54,719
not quite the same

1427
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,639
right it introduces code that wouldn't

1428
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,639
ordinarily be there it's not

1429
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,078
automatically hoisted

1430
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:05,199
right meaning it's not the same

1431
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,960
that is not the same as that even if x

1432
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,960
is only used inside this function

1433
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,719
uh because of the fact that you know

1434
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,159
i well i don't know why i don't that's

1435
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,000
how i would have defined it right

1436
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:25,799
i think it's because in c plus they want

1437
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,800
you to be able to do this

1438
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,279
right

1439
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,280
um

1440
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:44,000
i mean technically it'd be that right

1441
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:45,440
um

1442
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
they want to be able to do this and they

1443
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,838
want this to only be called when you get

1444
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,440
here so that this thing that does like

1445
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:53,358
17 000 things in the middle of its

1446
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,838
constructor

1447
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:59,119
it has to be

1448
00:53:54,838 --> 00:54:01,119
like only happen when you go in there

1449
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,400
it's all stupid you know

1450
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,160
it doesn't matter

1451
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,079
here's what i'll say don't use statics

1452
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,159
inside functions is the best rule of

1453
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,000
thumb you never need them for anything

1454
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,000
so i sometimes throw they're in there

1455
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,599
for debugging purposes like if i'm doing

1456
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,519
something quickly and that's totally

1457
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,440
fine other than that just stay away from

1458
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,199
them you never need them for anything

1459
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,358
there's no point to them just make a

1460
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:24,558
global variable if you need it

1461
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:26,960
that's it it doesn't do anything

1462
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,920
it just causes problems so i would just

1463
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:33,119
stay away from it um

1464
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,119
it's fine right

1465
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:35,679
so

1466
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,519
yeah and martin's that's what i would

1467
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,119
exp that's what should have probably

1468
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,119
been the definition of this thing like

1469
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,880
they probably should have only had that

1470
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,318
where it's just a scoped global variable

1471
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,720
that can't really call any function

1472
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,318
stuff and if it does call stuff it

1473
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,919
happens at startup that's how i would

1474
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:53,039
have done it i wouldn't have done what

1475
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,960
they did

1476
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,239
i know why they did it that way but as

1477
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,679
usual i think they don't really know

1478
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:00,159
what they're doing

1479
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:03,358
all right so let's go ahead and finish

1480
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:03,358
up what we're working on here

1481
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,078
so we need to pass in a sim region so

1482
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:10,639
that we can do queries uh that's

1483
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,000
probably true in general uh i would say

1484
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:15,199
so i don't know that i need to remove

1485
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,719
that maybe we should i don't know

1486
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,719
oh stomp on entities

1487
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:23,759
so we we actually preserved even the

1488
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,079
call to stomp on entity we just don't

1489
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,000
let you stomp on an entity yet

1490
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,680
i mean because you can't really stomp on

1491
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
an entity

1492
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,639
because you're not allowed to hop into a

1493
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
square that has an entity in it but i

1494
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:37,759
guess

1495
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,199
maybe that was a thing that's kind of

1496
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,310
cool

1497
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,309
[Music]

1498
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,400
i mean that's really kind of neat

1499
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,240
uh

1500
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,000
so hey maybe that's gonna be a thing

1501
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,000
like i don't know it doesn't matter at

1502
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,798
the moment but that's kind of neat um i

1503
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,838
do i do like that

1504
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:02,880
uh

1505
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:05,039
i don't think we really want this

1506
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,880
bit here but

1507
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,318
like we do probably want this to happen

1508
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,720
but i don't think we would want to

1509
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,719
actually like

1510
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:17,078
have to call phil unpacked entity at

1511
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:17,078
this particular time

1512
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,480
so i don't know about that uh that

1513
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:37,679
that's probably a bit of a bridge too

1514
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,760
far so i'm gonna go ahead and say that

1515
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:43,199
we don't probably pass assets there it

1516
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,799
seems like that's maybe a bit

1517
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,679
far-fetched

1518
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,079
uh but we'll see so anyway

1519
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:51,919
um the same is kind of true of particle

1520
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,960
cache like that part's a little bit

1521
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,200
strange

1522
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,199
um

1523
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,599
i don't know like spawning particles

1524
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:02,000
like i don't know to what extent we want

1525
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,240
this to happen here maybe we do

1526
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,239
um

1527
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:11,280
because this is animation and that's

1528
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,280
what particles are so you know uh yeah

1529
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,039
um

1530
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,960
so yeah what i was trying to say before

1531
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,199
is basically this like this idea of like

1532
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,599
t movement

1533
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,598
i think that wants to be outside

1534
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,838
because i think animations just want to

1535
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:28,720
be driven off of the t value and i don't

1536
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,318
think they should ever actually have

1537
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,480
uh

1538
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,159
you know even this yeah like this is not

1539
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,440
really in the right place you're gonna

1540
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:40,879
see it this is not you know it should

1541
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,440
just be basically about this uh edge

1542
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,358
transition that's happening here

1543
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,679
and

1544
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,440
we want that to kind of be handled

1545
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:51,838
outside in like the

1546
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,119
closing edge of what's happening in this

1547
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:54,798
particular

1548
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,960
uh entity

1549
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:59,280
um so that's yeah we're kind of gonna

1550
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,318
have to like think through

1551
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,720
um how we want that to happen

1552
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,159
and so yeah i mean we'll we'll get there

1553
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,399
it's gonna be a little bit of a

1554
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,679
reorganization as we kind of go through

1555
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,400
and figure out how we want all these

1556
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:14,798
things to sort of weave together uh but

1557
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,838
for the most part it's like you know

1558
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:20,559
we're just trying to make it so that

1559
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:23,039
these things make reasonable sense

1560
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,920
uh as they uh you know

1561
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,519
as as animation versus event

1562
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,920
uh we would rather separate the

1563
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,239
animations and events a little bit uh

1564
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,400
again to make it easier on ourselves to

1565
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,798
to write sort of the animations and use

1566
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,400
them more broadly across many different

1567
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,159
circumstances that might have different

1568
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,160
events happening

1569
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:43,920
and that sort of thing

1570
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,318
okay

1571
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,318
so

1572
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:55,559
oh i gotta stretch it out as far as i

1573
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:55,558
can stretch okay

1574
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,599
um

1575
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,240
kwmr like that's really bad if that's

1576
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,199
what they're doing if local static

1577
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:46,078
variables use thread local storage to

1578
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,798
execute that's like terrible right

1579
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,798
thread local storage is like very slow

1580
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:53,838
it's like a double indirect lookup first

1581
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:55,199
you have to look up the gs segment value

1582
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,358
for the table and then you have to look

1583
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,439
up the index off of that table so like

1584
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:02,400
you would never ever want to use thread

1585
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,760
local storage for anything

1586
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,880
that you don't absolutely have to right

1587
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,799
um

1588
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,880
so like if that's actually how they

1589
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:12,480
implemented it that sounds terrible

1590
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,720
um

1591
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,798
so that would be yet another reason not

1592
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,159
to use static variables if if that's

1593
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,480
really how it's being done because

1594
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:22,399
that's a terrible terrible idea in my

1595
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,280
opinion

1596
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,240
um

1597
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,240
just absolutely horrible

1598
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:39,599
all right uh so

1599
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:41,519
if we look up uh this update animation i

1600
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,200
guess what i'm trying to say is like all

1601
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:46,880
right so if the animation hopping stuff

1602
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,798
like you can see like we could just say

1603
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,559
oh well so there's the animation

1604
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,159
floating stuff and maybe we just do

1605
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,839
exactly the same thing

1606
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:55,440
so we just say like all right if there's

1607
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,000
a two and a from

1608
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,679
uh place that we're going here

1609
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,239
then all we really have to do is just

1610
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,519
uh do the movement two and the movement

1611
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:07,358
from

1612
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,119
it's just floating so it just it's just

1613
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:10,880
a linear interpolation or whatever right

1614
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,720
and maybe we want like

1615
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,798
you know some better stuff than that in

1616
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,039
the future but for now we don't really

1617
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:19,280
care till we look a little bit

1618
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,358
um

1619
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:25,200
more closely like what

1620
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:26,000
we want to do you know what i mean um

1621
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,449
so

1622
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,679
here we could just say

1623
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:32,679
[Music]

1624
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:32,679
clamp01

1625
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:37,039
uh and just use the t movement variable

1626
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,199
to

1627
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,440
move us you know float us between the

1628
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,879
places that we're going

1629
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,200
uh just

1630
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,200
you know

1631
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,358
not in a particularly

1632
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:50,838
interesting way or anything

1633
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:55,279
uh

1634
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:58,000
and now we just need these oops

1635
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,960
uh now we just need these guys as like

1636
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,199
like these guys could now move i think

1637
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,199
um

1638
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,480
well no that's not quite true so

1639
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,519
we need to regularize this a little bit

1640
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:14,798
more

1641
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:16,559
but what it's going to say is now these

1642
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,079
guys could move as long as we go to the

1643
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:19,760
brain controller and just say okay the

1644
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,880
brain now picks like

1645
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,880
somewhere for them to go

1646
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,199
right

1647
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:28,400
um

1648
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,720
so yeah so really

1649
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,559
oh boy

1650
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:34,719
there's so much stuff to do here i mean

1651
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,480
it's like yeah i mean we just really

1652
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:37,919
haven't spent any time on this code and

1653
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,119
just there's so many things we can do

1654
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,480
and we should probably just start doing

1655
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,400
them all because they're all kind of

1656
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,199
interesting and

1657
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,440
uh

1658
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,639
game like

1659
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,240
so

1660
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:49,118
you like the floating head things

1661
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,118
wouldn't

1662
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,358
step on buttons right and so if we

1663
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,798
basically have the button stepping code

1664
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:58,480
be in here yeah i mean

1665
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,318
right there's just so much stuff we can

1666
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,318
do now so let's start to try and work

1667
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,519
through this slowly uh we have a

1668
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:05,679
tremendous amount of stuff what time do

1669
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:07,358
i have to start

1670
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:11,199
my dinner stuff i gotta i got at least

1671
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,199
an hour of programming i can do here

1672
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,720
um

1673
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,279
so anyway uh looking at at what's going

1674
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:18,959
on here uh

1675
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,559
let's ignore the glove for now because

1676
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,798
that's kind of a new thing let's just

1677
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,319
look at the um

1678
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:25,358
whatever those floating head things are

1679
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,920
called

1680
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,838
i i don't actually know um what they're

1681
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,880
called

1682
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:35,199
uh i think they might be one of these

1683
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,200
uh

1684
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:42,160
i mean they're not the familiar anymore

1685
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,519
but i think that is

1686
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:45,038
what they're

1687
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,440
doing

1688
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,440
um

1689
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,838
yeah and so so these

1690
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:02,719
oh boy

1691
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,039
there's so much cleanup to do here right

1692
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:05,038
um

1693
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,798
you can still swap your head with ground

1694
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,599
towels uh yeah you can swap your head

1695
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:11,599
with

1696
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,519
what did we do there was something that

1697
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,640
we did that was just a joke that you

1698
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,639
could swap your head with

1699
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:22,399
what even was that uh i know what you're

1700
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,838
talking about there's like a whole we

1701
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,599
added a thing where you could hit a

1702
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:29,920
button and swap your head out with

1703
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,359
something

1704
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,280
do you guys even remember i don't

1705
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:35,358
remember anything about that other than

1706
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,359
like that we did it

1707
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:39,279
uh

1708
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:42,558
it was with the enemy but i don't what

1709
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,559
was do you just hit return

1710
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,200
i don't even remember like what you hit

1711
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,760
but yeah there was something like that

1712
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:49,759
there we go

1713
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,960
basically any

1714
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,839
uh nearby entity that's not

1715
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,119
a

1716
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,159
static tile you can just grab as the

1717
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:03,760
head

1718
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,440
can you get a tree probably not because

1719
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,440
that's not an nd

1720
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,440
um

1721
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,358
you may be can you get like an orphan

1722
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,039
so you can't get an orphan

1723
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,358
so i don't know what our check was our

1724
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,280
check must have been something like

1725
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:29,598
that prevented you from getting a like i

1726
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,960
can't get a cat head

1727
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,000
which seems ridiculous if you're going

1728
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,639
to have this feature you should be able

1729
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,798
to get a cat head right

1730
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,400
i mean do we want to target the furry

1731
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:41,038
demographic or don't we here dude you

1732
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,200
should be able to get a cat head on

1733
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,359
um

1734
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:46,879
so

1735
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,598
yeah i don't know what what we're

1736
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,599
actually checking for

1737
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,879
i don't even know i don't know what this

1738
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,679
code is doing i have no idea

1739
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,160
um

1740
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:08,798
so that code will just be removed though

1741
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,399
uh like that's not gonna stay right i

1742
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,400
don't even know what we put that in for

1743
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,358
it was just something for fun i guess i

1744
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,880
don't know

1745
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:16,838
i don't know what the what the heck we

1746
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,680
were doing

1747
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:21,279
um yeah so like basically i grabbed that

1748
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,960
thing

1749
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,200
i can grab the other thing too looks

1750
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,199
like

1751
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:29,759
like now i've got like

1752
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,838
a rib cage

1753
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,559
as my

1754
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:36,239
head

1755
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:38,160
which doesn't seem particularly good

1756
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,439
uh so anyway i don't know what the heck

1757
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:41,038
that code is for

1758
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:45,480
uh it's funny

1759
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:45,480
i guess there's that um

1760
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:50,558
but i don't know that it's particularly

1761
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:50,558
good

1762
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:01,240
thank you for opening the door for us

1763
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:01,239
that was very nice of it

1764
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,079
oh i'm also now lighting up the world

1765
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:09,358
because these guys have a light attached

1766
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,359
to them i forgot about that

1767
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,639
enough substitution no there's only 766

1768
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,439
subscribers i said i wouldn't do a react

1769
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:25,598
streamless or 2 000 subscribers there's

1770
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,798
no way that will ever have that many

1771
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,280
subscribers

1772
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:31,759
by design i picked a number we will

1773
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:35,440
never have so that there's no chance i

1774
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,960
have to do a react.js stream so

1775
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,960
don't even think about it it's

1776
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,960
impossible it was picked to be

1777
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,960
impossible

1778
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:47,118
yeah so i guess that code

1779
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:55,318
uh must just like pick

1780
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,318
it must just pick like the

1781
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,200
the closest thing

1782
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,400
gosh i don't even know like the closest

1783
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,730
thing that

1784
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,889
uh

1785
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:13,889
[Music]

1786
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:21,079
that is a head that is marked as a head

1787
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,079
but those ground tiles wouldn't be

1788
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,319
um

1789
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,479
so it looks like you can swap it with

1790
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:44,479
anything that has a brain

1791
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:53,838
right

1792
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:04,318
so it looks like as long as the thing

1793
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,798
has a brain you can swap with it i guess

1794
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,080
the reason you can't swap with the npcs

1795
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:10,798
is right now they just don't have a

1796
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:10,798
brain assigned

1797
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,519
so

1798
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:17,838
yeah i don't know i i would assume that

1799
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,759
probably we just want to turn this off

1800
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:21,119
it's not really something that should be

1801
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,640
happening right

1802
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:26,479
um

1803
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,480
so we'll we'll nerf that from now

1804
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:35,279
um but who knows if it will come back

1805
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:38,158
right so now you can't you can't grab

1806
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,159
arbitrary crap

1807
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,039
all right so what i was trying to say

1808
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,520
before is just that like

1809
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,719
you know we now have to start thinking

1810
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,640
how we're going to do the actual

1811
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:52,560
movement transactions and we want those

1812
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,560
movement transactions to have like

1813
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:59,439
more consistency and more logic to them

1814
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:01,119
and so let's start trying to make this

1815
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:03,599
happen so

1816
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:05,039
effectively any given entity is going to

1817
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,960
have a movement

1818
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,800
uh operation that they're currently

1819
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:12,239
doing and that movement operation is

1820
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,239
going to have some you know

1821
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:20,359
some rules to it right i

1822
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,359
and there's also like kind of

1823
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,520
there's some kind of interesting

1824
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,039
questions here too about like what do we

1825
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,040
actually want how do we want to

1826
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:47,600
represent things like a glove strike

1827
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,960
that happens across multiple squares

1828
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,640
do we want to just have that be a

1829
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,880
movement that like basically cues up

1830
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,320
like here are the squares that are going

1831
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,480
to be

1832
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:57,479
you know

1833
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,839
i need to think about this for a second

1834
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,119
because like if we want this thing to be

1835
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,280
about like patterns like that

1836
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:49,198
then i do wonder if you want to do

1837
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:50,960
things like when you hit the strike

1838
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:52,000
when you do something like execute a

1839
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,600
punch

1840
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,960
what it's really saying is we're going

1841
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,159
to cue

1842
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,319
this

1843
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:00,319
pattern right

1844
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:03,679
of

1845
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:03,679
cell to cell movements

1846
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,719
and the same would be true for like

1847
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:08,719
enemy attacks

1848
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,920
and like once you commit to one of them

1849
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,840
it like has to follow through

1850
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,640
right

1851
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,600
um and like maybe there are ways for you

1852
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,600
to interrupt that

1853
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:26,559
sometimes and maybe there are times when

1854
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,520
it cannot be interrupted right like

1855
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,000
like maybe sometimes

1856
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,840
maybe certain glove attacks

1857
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,439
if it turns out that the attack if if

1858
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,079
like the attack is fairly lengthy like

1859
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:39,359
it you know it spans nine cells that it

1860
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:42,319
does or something

1861
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:43,759
maybe like certain kinds of attacks you

1862
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:45,519
can't interrupt in the middle if they're

1863
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,600
going poorly and you don't and you want

1864
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,520
to recall the glove to do something

1865
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:53,039
maybe you can do that

1866
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,880
and maybe other times you can't and so

1867
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:57,279
it's like a big deal like

1868
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,039
if this glove is an interruptible glove

1869
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,319
that's like potentially like a big deal

1870
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:03,840
because it means that you can start an

1871
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:05,920
attack and then not finish it

1872
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,760
it turns out to be going poorly

1873
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,279
whereas other gloves maybe you know and

1874
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,280
there's like trade-offs like oh there's

1875
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:14,238
a more powerful glove but it cannot be

1876
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:16,158
interrupted so once you start an attack

1877
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:18,799
that attack will go through i kind of

1878
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,719
like the sound of that so i feel like

1879
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,679
maybe what we do is we say like there's

1880
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,880
like a move cue

1881
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:29,079
where

1882
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,079
you know there's like this

1883
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,639
like this move

1884
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:41,359
that you've queued up and it's getting

1885
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,360
executed and it sort of

1886
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:47,119
has properties that are gameplay related

1887
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:49,439
right

1888
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:49,439
um

1889
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:02,079
like to me that sounds good and so i'm

1890
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,679
just gonna maybe do that because i don't

1891
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:06,399
see a reason not to so like maybe what

1892
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:08,399
we do is basically say look you queue up

1893
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:10,719
you

1894
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:11,759
create a cue

1895
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:15,840
of

1896
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:18,159
tiles that will get occupied by this

1897
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,640
thing or attempt you it will attempt to

1898
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:22,799
occupy these squares

1899
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,760
and then the system just tries to do

1900
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,079
that and they are marked as whether or

1901
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,079
not you might may or may not be able to

1902
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:33,559
like

1903
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,559
interrupt them

1904
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:15,439
i guess my only question now is where

1905
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:18,238
does that live do we have a move cue

1906
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:18,238
that's basically

1907
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,880
separate from entities so like moves go

1908
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,399
into the move queue

1909
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,440
and they are

1910
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:27,439
generally dealt with

1911
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,679
um

1912
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:04,279
uh tin spin yes of course you can

1913
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,719
um

1914
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:31,359
i mean you can make a thing that runs on

1915
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:31,359
xp and windows 10 if you want to

1916
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:37,679
just make sure you don't link with

1917
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:39,359
anything from windows 10 that isn't in

1918
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,039
windows xp

1919
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,880
and anything that you want to use in

1920
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:45,359
windows 10 you do a get proc address

1921
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,119
load library get proc address and only

1922
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:50,639
use if you find it

1923
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:50,640
right that's how you would do it

1924
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:53,679
um

1925
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,520
so yeah my my feeling on this is like i

1926
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,760
think this all sounds good my only

1927
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,840
question is where does that move cue go

1928
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,159
and there's two ways you could do it one

1929
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,400
way is each entity keeps its own move

1930
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,920
queue i think that's kind of wasteful

1931
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:11,839
because most entities in the system

1932
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,760
don't move like they're like ground

1933
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,840
tiles that don't move

1934
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,360
so that seems stupid so what i would say

1935
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,840
is probably there's sort of this

1936
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:23,679
separate idea of move cues the move cue

1937
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:26,400
there's just you know some bunch of

1938
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:28,158
64 move cues or whatever like the brains

1939
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,399
the brains hold the move cues or

1940
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,719
whatever and so brains have the move

1941
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,559
cues in them and you only get assigned

1942
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:37,600
to move queue if you actually have an

1943
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,320
active thing at that time right

1944
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,880
so my guess is it's more like you know

1945
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:46,719
there's this brain thing

1946
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,719
and these brains

1947
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,639
if i remember correctly the brains kind

1948
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,719
of like

1949
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,840
do

1950
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:55,840
they get assembled

1951
01:17:56,079 --> 01:18:01,519
like over time right like they

1952
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,760
they

1953
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,760
they get assembled at you as you start a

1954
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,159
particular simulation

1955
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:11,119
you basically get like a brain

1956
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:13,198
slot assigned to anybody who's doing

1957
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,640
you know active stuff which is the only

1958
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,799
people who would need to move q anyway

1959
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,280
because if you don't have

1960
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,880
an ai attached to you how you wouldn't

1961
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:22,319
know to move

1962
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,920
anyway

1963
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:25,759
um so i'm assuming that that would be

1964
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,119
fairly safe and so if you look at the

1965
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,679
sim region

1966
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:32,719
i believe what happens is that inside

1967
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:35,279
the sim region itself uh why can i not

1968
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,920
jump to sim region

1969
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,759
i hate the way this works i wish that it

1970
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,520
someone would fix it i don't i can

1971
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,560
probably try to fix it myself but like

1972
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,560
why would you ever want to jump

1973
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,280
like this thing needs to say which one

1974
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,920
is which right like it needs to say

1975
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:52,960
whether this is the forward declaration

1976
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,279
of a type

1977
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,039
or the actual type and it should

1978
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:58,800
severely pessimize the forward

1979
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:02,399
declaration because you basically never

1980
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:06,199
want to go there right

1981
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:06,198
it don't make no sense

1982
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,440
yeah it's just really inefficient

1983
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:17,359
anyway so the sim region here

1984
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:19,839
what we have is this um entity hash

1985
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,920
and brain ash that get built up and i

1986
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,000
believe that the only place that brains

1987
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,679
ever actually exist

1988
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,760
is like in here

1989
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,359
you know what i'm saying

1990
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,920
they

1991
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:33,920
therefore like we the problem that we

1992
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,158
would have is

1993
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,158
you can't store these move cues anywhere

1994
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:39,759
because they don't really exist there's

1995
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,319
nothing that persists from frame to

1996
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,400
frame right

1997
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:48,198
which is kind of

1998
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:48,198
not super useful

1999
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,440
so like the question is like where do

2000
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,198
you want that stuff to live and of

2001
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,799
course like it can live in the entity

2002
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:02,479
like we said

2003
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,640
um but it just seems wasteful to put in

2004
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:05,839
the entity

2005
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,039
i mean i guess we could put it in the

2006
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,800
entity and say well the entities are

2007
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:10,238
going to get compressed anyway

2008
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,679
and that stuff gets thrown out when the

2009
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,718
entity is packed

2010
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,880
so

2011
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,560
as long as it stays unpacked it's in the

2012
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,840
active set and would need the move queue

2013
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,360
if it gets packed then it's not going to

2014
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,199
move anyway

2015
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,679
so it doesn't need to move anymore i

2016
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:23,678
mean that's

2017
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,960
a thing you could say

2018
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:06,560
but what i would really prefer is just a

2019
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:10,600
coherent notion of a move cue that just

2020
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,600
exists over time

2021
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,079
it's pretty hard to know though

2022
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,199
like the handmade hero code does this

2023
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,960
nice thing where like you can basically

2024
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:28,719
have worlds be as large as you want

2025
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:30,560
which almost nothing

2026
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:33,039
ever supports

2027
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,719
and so

2028
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:35,840
one of the downsides of doing something

2029
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,679
like that

2030
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,960
is you would have to decide what happens

2031
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:43,840
to a move cue when you are not really

2032
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,840
simulating that part of the world

2033
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,840
presumably you just throw it out right

2034
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:56,440
and so that kind of suggests one of two

2035
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,439
things either the move cues

2036
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:04,639
are just in the entities

2037
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,519
and then when they get

2038
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:12,319
packed they just get tossed i mean you

2039
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,320
ca right so

2040
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:16,479
um

2041
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:20,799
so when you look at handmade entity

2042
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,960
right you can you can see like there's

2043
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:26,320
this thing at the bottom which is just

2044
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:29,119
like crap that doesn't get stored

2045
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:30,880
and so really like maybe that's just the

2046
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:32,719
answer to how most of this stuff works

2047
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:36,159
and you just don't bother overthinking

2048
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,158
it right you just say look

2049
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:41,759
there's a move cue the move queue is

2050
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:44,000
like

2051
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,320
um

2052
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,800
where you're gonna go these these entity

2053
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:51,039
traversal points which at this point now

2054
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,360
we could actually get rid of these

2055
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:54,560
so these are totally not necessary

2056
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:57,279
anymore

2057
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,159
because we basically are just on a grid

2058
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:00,800
now

2059
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:00,799
you know what i mean

2060
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,639
and so while we're on a grid we don't

2061
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,560
need the flexibility of traversable

2062
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:07,679
points we could just use the grid index

2063
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,199
index

2064
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,039
right

2065
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:13,119
uh so the traversable points are not

2066
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:14,800
really interesting and we can simplify

2067
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:15,920
this code tremendously and probably

2068
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,360
should

2069
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,039
but for now

2070
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,799
let's just say that we're not going to

2071
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:24,800
do that and so

2072
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,800
what we would say i guess

2073
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:32,000
is

2074
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:34,000
the traversible point id so the this

2075
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,319
right

2076
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,319
um

2077
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:42,799
there's just some like big old list of

2078
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,199
these

2079
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,199
32 is probably not

2080
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:51,279
something we would want um

2081
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:53,359
but so let maybe like 16 or whatever but

2082
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:56,158
um there's just a list of those and

2083
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:57,279
anytime you're going to do a movement

2084
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,799
um

2085
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:03,198
you push it onto the queue and that is

2086
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,520
what that is right

2087
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:05,519
and

2088
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:12,079
you know if we were going to be

2089
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:13,678
the kind of people who do things

2090
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,600
that are things that you do when you're

2091
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,359
this kind of person

2092
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,600
you might also say that there's like a

2093
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:23,198
move cue entry

2094
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:25,920
uh struct and that has the traversable

2095
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:25,919
entry in it

2096
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,960
um

2097
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:35,519
that's like the destination

2098
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,639
and then also like some crap in here

2099
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:40,638
like

2100
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,199
is it interruptible

2101
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:47,359
you know what i mean

2102
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,119
so you'd have like these move q entries

2103
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:50,880
you said like okay are we allowed to

2104
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:53,119
interrupt this particular

2105
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,639
move or not

2106
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:57,599
and

2107
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,760
then when you have like control input

2108
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,000
that comes in

2109
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,400
you can look to see whether or not

2110
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,158
you're actually able to interrupt the

2111
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,920
thing

2112
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,158
that you're currently doing and if you

2113
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:14,560
can then you do you clear the move queue

2114
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:16,879
and at and change the movement request

2115
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,880
um

2116
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:20,238
but

2117
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:31,238
but like otherwise you

2118
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,239
you just have to keep doing it right

2119
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,719
yeah so i don't know i'm just gonna go

2120
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:55,840
ahead and say like that's fine and maybe

2121
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,840
that's just what happens

2122
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:14,559
um

2123
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:22,359
is john still streaming counter-strike

2124
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,359
by the way

2125
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,320
does anybody know

2126
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,079
no

2127
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,479
it's over

2128
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,198
who won

2129
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:46,319
or is there only one match today how

2130
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:46,319
does counter-strike work

2131
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:53,839
how did the finals work do they are

2132
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,840
like is it multiple days of stuff or

2133
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,840
whatever

2134
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,280
multiple days of playoffs final best of

2135
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:24,799
three today

2136
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:28,158
so like are they going to play another

2137
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,159
match later on today

2138
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,920
or

2139
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:50,719
okay so so it's already over and like

2140
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,719
phase one

2141
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:54,479
won the the thing

2142
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:03,919
i see

2143
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,920
all right

2144
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:14,000
yeah well simulator i i that that that

2145
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:17,600
thought had crossed my mind as well

2146
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,600
so uh back to our program so if we add

2147
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,760
this move cue thing in here also what

2148
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:25,120
the heck does move spec

2149
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,119
do now nothing right

2150
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,480
um so we should be able to get rid of

2151
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:30,639
that

2152
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:32,198
and just like

2153
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:36,079
you know sort of

2154
01:28:32,198 --> 01:28:36,079
squanch that away

2155
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:43,359
and then

2156
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:46,399
we don't use introspection anymore so i

2157
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:46,399
don't know why that's there

2158
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,719
let's get rid of all that

2159
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:59,479
oh

2160
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,119
all right

2161
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,079
um

2162
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:26,639
okay back to our show

2163
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:28,960
so what we want here is we want a way to

2164
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,960
yeah like you know okay

2165
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,800
so you know you're doing this stuff and

2166
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,119
you're hopping around

2167
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,360
and all that good stuff

2168
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,920
and i assume

2169
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:44,238
although i don't really know that pretty

2170
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:47,119
much what you would do here is

2171
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:47,119
when you don't

2172
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:49,759
uh

2173
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:56,479
like the glove needs to sort of not

2174
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,880
really occupy the squares that the glove

2175
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:02,079
moves through because it's not supposed

2176
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,079
to block motion

2177
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:07,599
in those squares

2178
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:10,239
probably like the glove is sort of like

2179
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,239
ethereal

2180
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,799
right

2181
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:16,799
so like

2182
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:21,198
again this is just this is really game

2183
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,840
design unfortunately but you know it is

2184
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:26,079
what it is so like if we imagine what's

2185
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,239
got to happen here like this glove kind

2186
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,880
of has to be like just kind of floating

2187
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:32,718
next to the hero sort of tucked in there

2188
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,639
more or less

2189
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,520
probably like that's

2190
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,119
it's too high up right now as well and

2191
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,480
probably needs to be like right there

2192
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:42,479
basically

2193
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:43,839
just sort of in there

2194
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,839
and

2195
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,639
when you hop from one square to the

2196
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,000
other

2197
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:53,359
the glove has to just be like wherever

2198
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,639
you are and it can't really

2199
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:56,099
uh

2200
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,400
occupy

2201
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,840
[Music]

2202
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:02,839
these

2203
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,840
squares

2204
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,880
which is probably fine

2205
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,600
so again

2206
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,880
i apologize i'm really just trying to

2207
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,159
think this through for the first time so

2208
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,000
i don't really know what's supposed to

2209
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:29,479
happen here like i'm just kind of making

2210
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,479
this up right

2211
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:34,800
but for

2212
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:36,238
you know

2213
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,920
for the most part here what we're

2214
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:39,039
talking about

2215
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,840
is

2216
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:43,439
when you do stuff

2217
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:48,159
in here

2218
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:51,158
and you hop from one place to another

2219
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:51,158
um

2220
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:05,199
this pdc nonsense has to be replaced

2221
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:06,719
with something that actually has an idea

2222
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:07,599
of where the heck this thing is going to

2223
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:09,439
go

2224
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,880
furthermore entity

2225
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:14,719
ddp like wouldn't be a thing

2226
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,119
because all of the animation would have

2227
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:19,119
to be procedural now like maybe we would

2228
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:20,000
have a ddp

2229
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:22,079
um

2230
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,639
in there somewhere

2231
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:24,639
for like

2232
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:31,599
matching visual consistency stuff it's

2233
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:32,799
not like we would totally not have that

2234
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,120
right

2235
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,119
um

2236
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,320
but in general

2237
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,119
in general like we would just be saying

2238
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,719
you move from one square to the other or

2239
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:49,599
whatever

2240
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,198
so

2241
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,440
my guess is that what should happen here

2242
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:58,000
is that whenever you hop from one place

2243
01:32:55,439 --> 01:33:00,638
to another your gloves should hop to

2244
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,479
where toward wherever you are

2245
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:05,359
at right

2246
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:06,399
so if we look at the glove

2247
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:11,519
um

2248
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:11,519
and we say okay if the glove

2249
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:16,879
um

2250
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,359
move q count

2251
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,119
equals zero

2252
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:24,000
that means there's nothing that it's

2253
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:28,079
like trying to do right now

2254
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,079
and so it can have

2255
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:35,600
the place where the hero currently is

2256
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:38,238
we can just push that on as the place

2257
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,159
it's going to snap back to

2258
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:42,638
and like in the future we probably want

2259
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:44,879
that snapback to be to have to actually

2260
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:47,520
traverse but for now maybe i'll just

2261
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:50,520
have it go direct

2262
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,520
um

2263
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:57,760
for whatever reason

2264
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,760
like

2265
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:03,159
i don't know

2266
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:03,158
um

2267
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:11,759
i also don't know why this glove thing

2268
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:13,439
is inside the part where you have to

2269
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,800
have a head and a body because it seems

2270
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,960
to me

2271
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,800
uh like that's not necessary so i'm

2272
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,319
assuming that you could really just do

2273
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,920
like as long as there's a body and a

2274
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:23,840
glove

2275
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,960
um

2276
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,199
then

2277
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,198
you

2278
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:31,879
do something

2279
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:37,679
or something

2280
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:40,559
so here you would say

2281
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:43,560
the glove

2282
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:43,560
like

2283
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:52,079
the glove

2284
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,800
place that it's

2285
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:57,118
trying to go

2286
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,119
um

2287
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:02,559
yeah all of this stuff would go away god

2288
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,000
we just there's so much cleanup we have

2289
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,320
to do now

2290
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,319
um

2291
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,638
the glove place that's trying to go

2292
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,679
needs to be set here basically so if the

2293
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:22,238
move queue count is zero

2294
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:22,239
um then it would push one onto there

2295
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:25,479
um

2296
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:31,599
this is all nonsense

2297
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:41,679
okay

2298
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,039
so i think we need to sort of

2299
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:44,639
fundamentally change a little bit of the

2300
01:35:43,039 --> 01:35:46,319
stuff to put us in a position to be able

2301
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:49,359
to write this kind of code quickly and

2302
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:51,599
like the way that we want to do it right

2303
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:51,599
um

2304
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:58,238
this code should look something like

2305
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:01,199
if the move q if the move

2306
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:03,279
q count is zero

2307
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:05,599
then

2308
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:05,599
if

2309
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,920
yeah and i don't know like maybe this is

2310
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:14,559
kind of like well no i don't know

2311
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:18,239
um this stuff probably needs to be like

2312
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:20,480
more about how we execute the move cue

2313
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:20,479
um

2314
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:24,399
and and honestly that move cue might

2315
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,199
need

2316
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:28,399
more

2317
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:31,039
like the actual move cue en tree

2318
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:32,000
might be the thing that you

2319
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:36,760
uh

2320
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,760
put the animation type in right

2321
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,800
um

2322
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,639
i

2323
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,118
so we kind of have two separate issues

2324
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:06,560
here and i don't really know one of

2325
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,000
them's pretty straightforward so what

2326
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,039
we'd want to do here is basically say

2327
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,920
look we put a move on the m move cue

2328
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:15,198
that's if you know if you are not if the

2329
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,359
glove is not

2330
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:20,079
where the player is then it moves to

2331
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:22,960
where the player is right

2332
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:24,719
the harder part is saying what does that

2333
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,840
actually mean

2334
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,640
because

2335
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,719
the glove

2336
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,719
[Music]

2337
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:36,559
in addition to moving

2338
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:39,279
needs to know that it should be like

2339
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:42,320
relative to the player's position

2340
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:44,559
so we also want to set like a relative

2341
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:48,679
like relative to the square

2342
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,679
gosh i don't know about that

2343
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:21,678
the part about the

2344
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:26,399
glove like where it should appear on the

2345
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:26,399
tile is a little more complicated to me

2346
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:34,079
but i guess

2347
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:36,158
maybe what you say there is

2348
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:38,559
that it is sort of that is like a

2349
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:42,519
separate thing that happens with the

2350
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,520
facing direction or something

2351
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:47,159
do we have sound effects at the moment

2352
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,359
um

2353
01:38:47,159 --> 01:38:50,358
[Music]

2354
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:55,519
yes

2355
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:58,960
but i think they may be turned off

2356
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:00,800
at the immediate moment like if that's

2357
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,039
what you mean

2358
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,039
let me see

2359
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,079
so

2360
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:41,920
i'm pretty sure that there should be a

2361
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:43,198
sound uh in this play sound thing here

2362
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,960
so uh

2363
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:46,879
let me see if

2364
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,039
that's actually turned off at the moment

2365
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,079
because it might be

2366
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:53,600
uh

2367
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:56,639
we probably do want that to be on

2368
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,639
at the moment

2369
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,000
just

2370
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:03,198
because

2371
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:10,880
uh we're gonna want to start like having

2372
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:14,000
that be in there right so

2373
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:17,440
this thing output playing sounds

2374
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,520
i don't know like we may have

2375
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:22,079
we may have basically like nerfed this

2376
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:23,840
somehow i just don't remember like

2377
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:25,359
because you know when we were doing

2378
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,039
development before we may have wanted to

2379
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:29,279
turn it off

2380
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:29,279
uh

2381
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:34,718
you know i i again i really just don't

2382
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:36,559
remember like what we did there but it

2383
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:40,719
looks like it's still hooked up so get

2384
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,719
sounds game get sound samples

2385
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:47,520
uh is still being called

2386
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:49,599
right

2387
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:52,080
um and so i think

2388
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:54,159
i think all of this stuff should still

2389
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:55,679
be working now the thing that i don't

2390
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:57,519
actually know is

2391
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,639
whether we actually

2392
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,320
have this

2393
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:03,600
baked in this blue

2394
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:06,238
sound right i don't actually know

2395
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,239
if that's

2396
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,920
um

2397
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:20,158
if that's actually being built it looks

2398
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:24,639
like it is right there's a bloop

2399
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:26,399
uh wave file that you know maybe is in

2400
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:28,319
here i assume it is

2401
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,559
so we could look and see

2402
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:32,399
like there's this play sound right

2403
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,800
um so we could look and see if that's

2404
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:36,479
actually happening but it looks like it

2405
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:40,320
should sort of

2406
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:42,879
be happening at least a little bit right

2407
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:46,158
um so let me take a look

2408
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:49,440
and i can see if if this is working or

2409
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:49,439
not because i don't really know

2410
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:02,960
so i'm gonna set a breakpoint at play

2411
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,960
sound

2412
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:10,479
so yeah we call this function uh it puts

2413
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,480
a sound

2414
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,600
uh onto the

2415
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:18,579
it does it does like place a sound

2416
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,439
onto the

2417
01:42:18,579 --> 01:42:24,639
[Music]

2418
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:24,638
list here although that

2419
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:30,879
that is not finding a sound so

2420
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:32,719
i take it back like

2421
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,960
basically this

2422
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:39,198
get best match

2423
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:40,239
uh asset that is actually not

2424
01:42:39,198 --> 01:42:44,559
working

2425
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:44,559
so that's wrong um

2426
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:52,400
it may be that asset audio isn't a thing

2427
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:56,760
anymore

2428
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:56,759
to be honest it's like the

2429
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:04,239
i guess that part i don't really

2430
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,239
remember

2431
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,920
so it looks like sounds currently aren't

2432
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:15,279
playing because we no longer look them

2433
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,600
up

2434
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:21,679
that's what it appears to be anyway

2435
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,679
so in here like this

2436
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
um

2437
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:29,519
that

2438
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:32,559
with tag bloop doesn't appear to

2439
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:35,119
actually find anything

2440
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,000
for whatever it's worth i

2441
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:40,158
we

2442
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,158
could look at the asset processor nope

2443
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:43,679
um

2444
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:54,638
so you can see here there's like this

2445
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:57,759
hha asset sound that's coming in here

2446
01:43:54,639 --> 01:44:00,079
and you know

2447
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,880
when it processes this audio import you

2448
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,840
get

2449
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:07,840
well i mean you get whatever you get and

2450
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,840
presumably the tags

2451
01:44:11,198 --> 01:44:15,039
presumably the tags on it are set okay

2452
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,520
but it doesn't look like it finds it so

2453
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:22,638
so i'm not sure

2454
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:25,119
why we don't get a sound there

2455
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:26,719
but that's why so basically this right

2456
01:44:25,118 --> 01:44:28,479
here that tries to

2457
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:31,039
find the sound effect

2458
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:34,039
never finds it

2459
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:34,039
um

2460
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:37,439
and that's why there's no sound at the

2461
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:40,239
moment

2462
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:43,519
so if we go into this

2463
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:46,519
uh this is the tag hash here right

2464
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,520
um

2465
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:55,679
so here's like assets by tag

2466
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:57,920
uh and it's like trying to look this up

2467
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,920
and

2468
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:02,479
here's the

2469
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:05,360
asset values that it's looking through

2470
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:05,359
i and

2471
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:19,439
this type value here

2472
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,820
uh if i add a watch to it i can cast it

2473
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:22,898
to

2474
01:45:19,819 --> 01:45:22,898
[Music]

2475
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:27,198
what it thinks it is so that's a bitmap

2476
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,639
so that's obviously

2477
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:31,638
not gonna work

2478
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:31,639
right

2479
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:38,409
so basically like it's just not there

2480
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:39,840
um

2481
01:45:38,409 --> 01:45:43,039
[Music]

2482
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,480
it's just not the tag hash doesn't match

2483
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:46,399
so

2484
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:47,678
the reason that this is not playing is

2485
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,079
because

2486
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:50,079
that

2487
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:56,118
was never

2488
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,118
added to the import apparently

2489
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:02,639
so

2490
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,639
if we look for

2491
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:14,239
in

2492
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,560
the

2493
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:17,919
envy system here

2494
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,159
if we look for

2495
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:22,319
the

2496
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:24,559
way that we're getting these from other

2497
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:28,158
stuff right so i guess the better place

2498
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:30,639
to look probably would be an entity gen

2499
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:33,039
um when you do the

2500
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:35,440
hashes you can see like

2501
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:36,399
what sort of hashes look like they're

2502
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:39,599
just like

2503
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:41,839
a thing and then the the tag right

2504
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,840
um

2505
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,880
you would think that that would be

2506
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:50,879
correct so like asset body base asset or

2507
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,480
whatever is how those normally are so

2508
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,480
presumably

2509
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:55,479
um

2510
01:46:58,319 --> 01:47:02,799
presumably that would work now as i look

2511
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,639
at this

2512
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,159
those are legacy categories supposedly

2513
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:07,440
but yeah

2514
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:10,960
um

2515
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:13,519
as i look at this like the audio

2516
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,960
tag right i mean that is what that

2517
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,520
should do

2518
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:20,480
and then you know bloop is up here

2519
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,480
so it it looks to me like that should

2520
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:23,839
have worked

2521
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:26,238
you know

2522
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:29,840
um and so that's why i said like i'm not

2523
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:32,559
really sure the asset processor when it

2524
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:37,760
presses an audio import and it goes to

2525
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:40,719
do like what are the tags on this thing

2526
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:42,159
you can see it sort of doing that

2527
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:46,158
bit here

2528
01:47:42,158 --> 01:47:48,638
it sets the type to hha asset sound

2529
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:49,759
but i guess i don't know if it inserts a

2530
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,079
tag

2531
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,320
for that right

2532
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:54,319
um

2533
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:07,719
so that's part

2534
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:07,719
might be more interesting so let's look

2535
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:26,039
like this is going to pass in the tags

2536
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:26,039
here right

2537
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,159
uh that it parsed out

2538
01:48:36,319 --> 01:48:40,000
so yeah like i do wonder

2539
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:49,198
i just maybe no one's ever actually

2540
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:49,199
passing that in

2541
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:53,479
like it could be that

2542
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:10,639
like there's that asset audio right

2543
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:10,638
that's in end tags

2544
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:14,279
um

2545
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:33,520
and that tag is going to be in the

2546
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:33,519
opposite order right so

2547
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:42,399
it looks like it would happen the same

2548
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,840
way though so i'm not sure why this

2549
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:45,920
works

2550
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:48,159
either i guess maybe because tags go in

2551
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:52,158
the opposite order but if you look and

2552
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:52,158
it's like okay it's gonna add

2553
01:49:54,158 --> 01:50:00,158
this basic category tag with whatever

2554
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:00,158
the category is

2555
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:05,679
you would think that would work so i

2556
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,119
don't know it looks you know that code

2557
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:12,079
is terrible like most of the asset

2558
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:14,238
system is absolutely horrible right um

2559
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:15,920
but it honestly doesn't look like as bad

2560
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:19,279
as it is it doesn't look like it's

2561
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,639
really doing anything all that

2562
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:22,960
strange

2563
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:22,960
um

2564
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:26,079
so that's a bit

2565
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:30,000
so that's a bit confusing as to why that

2566
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:32,480
didn't work

2567
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,639
right um

2568
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:36,238
so so let's take a look here and see if

2569
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:38,800
maybe there's

2570
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:41,598
uh a little bit of a better

2571
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,360
explanation for that because it doesn't

2572
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,960
really look like it's doing anything too

2573
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:47,920
stupid

2574
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:50,920
but maybe it actually is

2575
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,920
um

2576
01:51:08,238 --> 01:51:12,718
so you can see here like yeah

2577
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:15,039
it would appear to be doing the thing

2578
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,639
for the basic category right like it

2579
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:19,279
doesn't seem

2580
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:21,840
like it's doing anything weird there

2581
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:21,840
um

2582
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:28,079
so you would think

2583
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,520
that that would probably work correctly

2584
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:30,319
you know what i mean

2585
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,840
um

2586
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:35,519
it doesn't seem particularly

2587
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:37,920
strange right doesn't seem particularly

2588
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,920
strange

2589
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:44,159
and by the way nomad pixel yet i really

2590
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:45,869
like the the razer keyboards razer the

2591
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,279
orange

2592
01:51:45,869 --> 01:51:48,960
[Music]

2593
01:51:47,279 --> 01:51:51,759
mechanical switches

2594
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:54,639
they're like my favorite switches by far

2595
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:57,039
but the build quality on razer

2596
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:59,440
keyboards and the software is freaking

2597
01:51:57,039 --> 01:52:01,279
terrible i don't install their their

2598
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:04,559
driver

2599
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:06,319
and i have to buy new keyboards fairly

2600
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:08,080
frequently because their build quality

2601
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:10,158
is so terrible

2602
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:12,399
so like if razer would just

2603
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:14,399
stop being a terrible company and

2604
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:16,158
actually just like produce high quality

2605
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:18,000
versions of their orange switches that

2606
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:18,638
work in a keyboard that doesn't require

2607
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,639
a

2608
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:22,000
freaking terrible piece of software to

2609
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:23,760
use

2610
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,520
they would be by far the recommended

2611
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,960
keyboard that i would recommend but as

2612
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:30,719
it is i can't really recommend their

2613
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:31,520
keyboards because everything else about

2614
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:34,560
their

2615
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,560
company sucks

2616
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:39,279
so i would actually say don't buy razer

2617
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:43,118
even though i buy razer because their

2618
01:52:39,279 --> 01:52:45,840
company is literally that bad

2619
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:47,679
um all right so

2620
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:50,079
uh

2621
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:51,760
yeah and please someday if anyone can

2622
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:53,359
produce a keyboard that's like a high

2623
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,920
build quality

2624
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:58,079
non-driver based keyboard

2625
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:59,920
that has something similar to a razer

2626
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:02,399
orange switch in it

2627
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,399
please

2628
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:05,759
tell me

2629
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,280
i will switch to your keyboards and i

2630
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,599
will tell everyone else to switch to

2631
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:12,719
your keyboards

2632
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:15,679
mx brown is not even remotely similar to

2633
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:19,760
a razer orange switch

2634
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:19,760
it's not similar in any way

2635
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,800
i have mx brown switch keyboards here

2636
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:28,719
they are literally nothing like razer

2637
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:32,079
orange switches even a little bit

2638
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:34,319
uh i wouldn't even consider them

2639
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:34,319
as

2640
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:40,960
as related they're completely different

2641
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:43,279
uh

2642
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:45,359
mx brown and razer orange they are

2643
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:48,359
nothing alike to type on

2644
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:48,359
whatsoever

2645
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:59,198
what's the difference is that they feel

2646
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:02,239
literally nothing alike uh i don't know

2647
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:04,319
what an actuation profile would actually

2648
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:05,678
tell you because you know i can only say

2649
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:07,439
what happens when you try to type on the

2650
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:09,920
actual keyboard but

2651
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:13,359
razer orange switches and cherry mx

2652
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:15,279
browns do not feel anything alike

2653
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:18,000
at all

2654
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:19,759
um like you would never mistake one for

2655
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,479
the other ever

2656
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:24,320
unless you just don't

2657
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:25,759
like have any perception of what's

2658
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:26,639
happening with a keyboard for example

2659
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,159
right

2660
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,440
um

2661
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:31,598
so

2662
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:35,118
but basically like yeah razer orange

2663
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:37,520
switches uh are the best switches by far

2664
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:38,479
for like feel in my opinion

2665
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,719
um

2666
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:44,079
but they just don't like

2667
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:44,079
the keyboard just kind of sucks

2668
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:48,839
so what are you gonna do

2669
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:58,559
zelio purple switches huh

2670
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:58,559
um i would try that

2671
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,119
like there's a lot of switches out there

2672
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:05,280
right so for all i know there's like

2673
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:06,719
like maybe those feel the same as razor

2674
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,039
orange right

2675
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:09,760
and if they do maybe i could find you

2676
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:12,479
know

2677
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:14,800
so so uh i haven't tried enough switches

2678
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:16,479
i've tried some i one time try bought

2679
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,320
one of those like

2680
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:19,839
switch testing packs and none of the

2681
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:22,158
switches felt like a razer orange in

2682
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:23,440
that pack but it was still only like 10

2683
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:26,479
different types of switches and there's

2684
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:29,479
a lot more switches than 10.

2685
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:29,479
so

2686
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:39,118
yeah if somebody tries

2687
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,719
uh if somebody who really likes razer

2688
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:41,920
orange switches

2689
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:43,920
tries

2690
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,599
some other switches and ever finds one

2691
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:47,520
that's close please tell me because i

2692
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:49,599
would want to try it as well that's what

2693
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:52,000
i would say so if someone does try the

2694
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:54,480
zelio purples and finds that they are

2695
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
feel the same or some quite similar to a

2696
01:55:54,479 --> 01:55:57,359
razer orange switch

2697
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,760
that would be really nice to know

2698
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:02,960
because i would love to be able to buy

2699
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:06,639
a better keyboard than this keyboard

2700
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:06,639
but have the same kind of

2701
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,960
feel

2702
01:56:23,118 --> 01:56:26,479
so yeah please keep me posted if anyone

2703
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:28,158
really does find one that feels like

2704
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:29,678
razor orange don't just tell me to buy

2705
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:31,759
some random switch because i don't

2706
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:33,279
believe you like i want to know that you

2707
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,560
actually tested them and feel like you

2708
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:36,079
can't really tell the difference between

2709
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:37,760
a razor orange and whatever this new

2710
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:39,599
switch is

2711
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,280
and then i would try it but only if

2712
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:42,719
you've actually done that and can't tell

2713
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:45,840
the difference like you blind taste

2714
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:45,840
tested right

2715
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:52,238
all right so

2716
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:54,079
uh

2717
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,118
yeah let's find out why our sounds

2718
01:56:54,079 --> 01:56:56,079
aren't launching because that's a good

2719
01:56:55,118 --> 01:56:57,759
thing to do at the end of the stream

2720
01:56:56,079 --> 01:56:59,679
today and the next week we can pick up

2721
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:01,520
on animation or whatever

2722
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:04,158
so here's the thing that like feeds

2723
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:05,920
these into the asset tag hash uh this

2724
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:07,279
whole system is just garbage now because

2725
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,399
it's been through so many iterations and

2726
01:57:07,279 --> 01:57:10,800
we can't change the way we're doing

2727
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:12,238
things but just because it's garbage

2728
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,920
doesn't mean it doesn't work or

2729
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:15,839
shouldn't work so it'd be nice to know

2730
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,480
why like whatever is happening there

2731
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:22,239
that's not actually working

2732
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:24,638
um and so let's see if we can get some

2733
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:27,759
kind of an explanation here

2734
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:28,960
uh as to what's actually going on

2735
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:33,159
so

2736
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:33,158
we've got a

2737
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:42,079
yeah i mean we've got a pretty

2738
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:45,760
straightforward thing it's gonna stick

2739
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:48,559
the type id in here which should be

2740
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,639
you know asset audio

2741
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:54,480
and maybe we should go in and just

2742
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:54,480
verify that so like you know we can do

2743
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:06,559
a thing where we base say when you see

2744
01:58:04,079 --> 01:58:08,000
an asset audio yo let's go ahead and

2745
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:10,560
stop

2746
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,599
right there we could even go one further

2747
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:16,000
and say

2748
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:18,239
you know if tag zero equals tag bloop

2749
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,238
um

2750
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:22,480
stop here as well and that way we can

2751
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,840
just set breakpoints to see do we

2752
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:25,919
actually ever

2753
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:28,639
register these sounds that we're looking

2754
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:32,158
for do they ever actually get loaded um

2755
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:34,319
because if they don't then well you know

2756
01:58:32,158 --> 01:58:37,279
that would give us a clue right there to

2757
01:58:34,319 --> 01:58:37,279
what's gone wrong

2758
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:49,840
so

2759
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:49,840
inside here we've got some stuff

2760
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,279
um

2761
01:58:53,520 --> 01:59:01,239
and i'll go ahead and set a break point

2762
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:01,238
at these little little darlings

2763
01:59:07,279 --> 01:59:09,920
i don't think that's the right thing

2764
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:13,840
it's not

2765
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:13,840
that's not what i meant um

2766
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:19,359
so what i actually want is

2767
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:22,359
like

2768
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:22,359
this

2769
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:35,118
so here we can see that you know we've

2770
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:38,800
got our asset audio

2771
01:59:35,118 --> 01:59:41,598
um and then we've got tag 0

2772
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:44,400
and it looks like channel index

2773
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:46,639
so maybe that's most of what's going on

2774
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:48,719
here is that we just forgot that channel

2775
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,079
index comes through first

2776
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:54,000
right

2777
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:59,399
and the sound comes in next

2778
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,399
uh so we don't care about channel index

2779
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:05,118
so that pretty much tells us everything

2780
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:07,279
we needed to know

2781
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:07,279
i

2782
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:12,760
i don't know how exactly we want to

2783
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:12,759
handle that

2784
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:18,560
like what we want to do with channel

2785
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:20,400
indexes

2786
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,440
one thing we could do is strip them for

2787
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:23,359
now

2788
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:25,198
uh

2789
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:27,839
the other thing we could do is sort them

2790
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:27,839
to the end

2791
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,639
i don't know

2792
02:00:32,319 --> 02:00:34,639
um

2793
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:40,079
i feel like it should kind of go into

2794
02:00:38,158 --> 02:00:42,399
the match vector is what it really

2795
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:42,399
should do

2796
02:00:48,238 --> 02:00:54,039
so that's kind of a tougher question but

2797
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:54,039
like

2798
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:01,119
so in here where we've got this you know

2799
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:04,560
facing direction and variant

2800
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:08,079
um you know i don't know if maybe like

2801
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:09,199
this needs to have one more thing in it

2802
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:10,639
that's

2803
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:12,559
you know that's going to be the channel

2804
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:14,719
or maybe the channel is sort of like

2805
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:18,080
duplicative of that

2806
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:20,719
uh like you know facing direction

2807
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:20,719
and channel

2808
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:25,359
are overlaid

2809
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:28,000
i don't really know

2810
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:31,000
um but you know you would basically say

2811
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
that

2812
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:44,799
for now anyway

2813
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:46,479
we just do this

2814
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:49,760
and that way you don't put the channel

2815
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:52,158
index in anywhere you just kind of have

2816
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:52,159
you know

2817
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:54,559
um

2818
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:02,480
what is it complaining about

2819
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:03,599
there's an access violation reading the

2820
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:05,839
tag

2821
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:05,840
what

2822
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:13,960
what are you talking about

2823
02:02:10,479 --> 02:02:13,959
show me that again

2824
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:22,800
that makes no sense to me what is the

2825
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:26,399
problem here

2826
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:28,480
how did this end up being out of bounds

2827
02:02:26,399 --> 02:02:32,279
this should not have altered

2828
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:32,279
the size of anything

2829
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,158
right

2830
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,440
like this should not have changed

2831
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:45,480
this

2832
02:02:41,439 --> 02:02:45,479
uh any of this stuff

2833
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:55,638
so i don't quite see why we would have

2834
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:08,719
like i don't see why that would have

2835
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:11,118
caused a problem just taking

2836
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:13,679
channel index out of

2837
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:14,479
i mean literally all we did was this

2838
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:16,639
right

2839
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:19,439
as far as i know because that's a

2840
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:22,480
non-thing

2841
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:24,799
i mean i'll verify that it's a non-thing

2842
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:26,718
just in case

2843
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:29,599
but because i want to make sure maybe

2844
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:32,239
i'm missing something

2845
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:35,199
so if i rebuild and

2846
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:37,919
uh oops that was still running

2847
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:40,559
so if i rebuild

2848
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:42,960
and we don't have that extra define

2849
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:44,639
presumably we still get get the error

2850
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:48,520
and so what you're telling me is

2851
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:48,520
literally it's just this

2852
02:03:57,118 --> 02:04:01,598
i am so confused now so what did we

2853
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:02,960
touch i must have accidentally done

2854
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:05,039
something

2855
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:07,118
but how did we break that because

2856
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,719
there's nothing here we didn't change

2857
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:11,118
anything did we

2858
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:12,800
did i accidentally typo something when i

2859
02:04:11,118 --> 02:04:16,479
was

2860
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:16,480
not paying attention like this

2861
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:24,078
can be restored to its

2862
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:26,560
previous state right

2863
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:28,319
and this

2864
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:30,239
can be restored to us previously and now

2865
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:31,359
there's no changes

2866
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:34,319
so

2867
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:36,238
explain to me what's going on

2868
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:38,559
how is that possible

2869
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:40,638
we didn't touch anything

2870
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,880
this is the problem with programming on

2871
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:44,480
stream like none of this stuff should be

2872
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,800
happening but programming on stream is

2873
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:49,759
just so incredibly difficult

2874
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:53,360
and the code comes out so much worse

2875
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:54,480
it's really kind of hard to

2876
02:04:53,359 --> 02:04:56,960
convey

2877
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:58,959
just how much harder it is

2878
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:01,279
than when you get to program

2879
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:02,399
on your actual own

2880
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:03,759
um

2881
02:05:02,399 --> 02:05:05,039
so all right

2882
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:06,800
fine

2883
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:08,319
whatever you say

2884
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,719
so basically what we're saying is here

2885
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:16,078
inside the hha when we actually iterate

2886
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:17,520
over these we've got uh an you know a uh

2887
02:05:16,078 --> 02:05:18,880
a bogus

2888
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,800
like

2889
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:23,599
uh hha

2890
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:25,199
tag overlay right like like the series

2891
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:27,199
of tags

2892
02:05:25,198 --> 02:05:31,118
that we get is somehow

2893
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:32,559
you know grotesquely incorrect right

2894
02:05:31,118 --> 02:05:37,439
um and so

2895
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:37,440
you know when we uh step in here

2896
02:05:38,238 --> 02:05:43,919
i guess what we would expect to see

2897
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:43,920
is that the assets

2898
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:51,199
hha eventually gets these two values are

2899
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:54,480
garbage right

2900
02:05:51,198 --> 02:05:57,359
so what happens is this

2901
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:59,279
in here right we're gonna see this

2902
02:05:57,359 --> 02:06:00,799
become somehow

2903
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:02,479
totally wrong

2904
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:04,560
so this is what we expect to see just

2905
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:06,638
like uniform

2906
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:08,560
yeah so eventually we just get to one

2907
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:09,920
that's just complete garbage like the

2908
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:12,159
asset

2909
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:14,158
that we're asked to process is just

2910
02:06:12,158 --> 02:06:15,759
complete nonsense

2911
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:18,799
um

2912
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:22,639
so like asset 173 is the garbage in this

2913
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:22,639
case if we look at the assets

2914
02:06:24,158 --> 02:06:29,279
um we can see that that's not a

2915
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:31,440
particularly high valued

2916
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:33,599
thing right it's not like that's

2917
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:35,118
somehow totally ridiculous

2918
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:36,078
you know what i mean

2919
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:38,319
um

2920
02:06:36,078 --> 02:06:41,279
so it's it's weird

2921
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:44,719
that uh we would be having that problem

2922
02:06:41,279 --> 02:06:47,359
that early on in when we loaded you know

2923
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:49,359
when we loaded the asset out

2924
02:06:47,359 --> 02:06:51,679
so it does seem a bit strange

2925
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:53,679
and it when we're actually doing this

2926
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:56,480
merge here when we load through these

2927
02:06:53,679 --> 02:06:59,440
files like something has gone horribly

2928
02:06:56,479 --> 02:07:00,479
wrong and somehow we did that by like

2929
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:01,678
touching

2930
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:04,638
this thing

2931
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:05,840
just lightly right like we didn't do

2932
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:08,078
anything

2933
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:09,679
um

2934
02:07:08,078 --> 02:07:12,319
which is absurd but that's what happened

2935
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:13,440
so you just have to deal with it right

2936
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:16,439
um

2937
02:07:13,439 --> 02:07:16,439
so

2938
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:31,598
what is going on here

2939
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:44,519
what is happening in the chat do i need

2940
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:44,519
to step in here

2941
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:17,319
yeah it looks like you guys can handle

2942
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:17,320
this on your own

2943
02:08:22,078 --> 02:08:26,479
anyway what i will say is that the

2944
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:27,760
reason that open source software is bad

2945
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:29,439
has nothing to do with the quality of

2946
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:31,119
the software the reason open source

2947
02:08:29,439 --> 02:08:32,319
software is bad is because it exploits

2948
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:34,960
workers

2949
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:36,719
it's ridiculous that people who claim to

2950
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:38,158
be like you know

2951
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:40,880
uh pro

2952
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:42,559
like pro worker or pro whatever would

2953
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:44,159
ever support open source software

2954
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:46,159
because all it does

2955
02:08:44,158 --> 02:08:48,479
is basically allow other people to

2956
02:08:46,158 --> 02:08:49,839
profit off of work they didn't pay for

2957
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:51,439
that's literally the only thing that

2958
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:53,920
open source has done as far as i can

2959
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:55,439
tell like entire corporations that now

2960
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:57,440
effectively control

2961
02:08:55,439 --> 02:09:00,078
most of the digital world

2962
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:02,238
google facebook twitter whatever

2963
02:09:00,078 --> 02:09:04,078
they were all built off of work they did

2964
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:06,078
not pay for

2965
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:08,880
like 90 of the software at those

2966
02:09:06,078 --> 02:09:11,039
companies was done by workers who were

2967
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:12,319
completely exploited in like the

2968
02:09:11,039 --> 02:09:14,719
traditional

2969
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:16,960
like way that

2970
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:18,399
karl marx would have been very upset

2971
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:20,078
about right

2972
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:22,000
they did a bunch of work

2973
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:24,238
other people came and

2974
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:26,158
basically took control of large swaths

2975
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:29,759
of the economy using their work and paid

2976
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:31,679
them either nothing or almost nothing

2977
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:33,679
versus how much money they extracted out

2978
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:35,840
of those pieces of software

2979
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:37,840
that's what happened right and there's

2980
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:39,039
no alternate read to open source than

2981
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:40,000
that

2982
02:09:39,039 --> 02:09:42,158
period

2983
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,118
that is just literally what occurred

2984
02:09:42,158 --> 02:09:44,559
so

2985
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:46,078
that's really the only thing people

2986
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:47,599
should be talking about with open source

2987
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:50,319
right now as far as i'm concerned is how

2988
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:52,560
to figure out how to stop workers from

2989
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:54,799
being exploited because that is the only

2990
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,880
thing happening in open source right now

2991
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,960
that

2992
02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:01,679
that i can see at all

2993
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:05,599
is people doing work

2994
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:07,599
and getting completely exploited by

2995
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:10,159
effectively like a managerial class that

2996
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:12,639
takes their work for free and builds

2997
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:14,559
adds very small amount of value to it

2998
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:15,920
and takes all the money

2999
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:17,039
right

3000
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,560
so

3001
02:10:17,039 --> 02:10:20,158
that's what that's what open source

3002
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:22,480
looks like to me that's what the story

3003
02:10:20,158 --> 02:10:23,359
of the world is right

3004
02:10:22,479 --> 02:10:25,198
um

3005
02:10:23,359 --> 02:10:27,279
so

3006
02:10:25,198 --> 02:10:28,479
so like solve that

3007
02:10:27,279 --> 02:10:30,238
that's the thing you should be talking

3008
02:10:28,479 --> 02:10:32,158
about not the software quality yet

3009
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:33,439
because if as far as open source is

3010
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:35,198
closed because i don't think open source

3011
02:10:33,439 --> 02:10:37,279
versus closed source is really

3012
02:10:35,198 --> 02:10:40,078
necessarily i don't think the the big

3013
02:10:37,279 --> 02:10:41,920
issue there has anything to do with code

3014
02:10:40,078 --> 02:10:43,599
quality that's that's a separate issue

3015
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:45,920
that we could talk about and whether

3016
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:48,239
open or closed source is better or worse

3017
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:51,118
for that is kind of more of a thing

3018
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:53,198
uh more of a subtle discussion

3019
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:55,920
the fact that open source is massively

3020
02:10:53,198 --> 02:10:58,000
exploitative of of the working class is

3021
02:10:55,920 --> 02:11:01,039
undisputable in my opinion

3022
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,719
like like there's no way you could

3023
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:05,439
possibly make an argument that that's

3024
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:07,359
not what happened because it's like so

3025
02:11:05,439 --> 02:11:10,078
overwhelmingly obvious

3026
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:12,078
that people who did not do the majority

3027
02:11:10,078 --> 02:11:14,078
of the work now has the majority of the

3028
02:11:12,078 --> 02:11:15,920
money and power

3029
02:11:14,078 --> 02:11:19,039
and it was all thanks to open source

3030
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:19,039
software right

3031
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:22,719
so so you're going to have to figure

3032
02:11:21,118 --> 02:11:24,559
that out before we can have any other

3033
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:26,880
discussion about open source in my

3034
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:28,159
opinion because it's a huge problem and

3035
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,480
completely

3036
02:11:28,158 --> 02:11:32,799
exploitative and unfair as it currently

3037
02:11:30,479 --> 02:11:32,799
stands

3038
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:37,400
all right so

3039
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:47,479
uh

3040
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:02,719
so how the heck did this happen

3041
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:05,279
what we need like a good

3042
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:07,039
forensics that's like how did that how

3043
02:12:05,279 --> 02:12:09,840
did what i did

3044
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:12,000
knock this like fairly precarious stuff

3045
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,159
into a bad state right

3046
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,599
like how did that happen that's a

3047
02:12:14,158 --> 02:12:18,839
strange it's a strange beast

3048
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:22,800
right

3049
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:25,199
um it's a strange beast there

3050
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,320
whatever just occurred it doesn't really

3051
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:29,118
make

3052
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:30,479
um a whole lot of sense

3053
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:31,439
right

3054
02:12:30,479 --> 02:12:34,439
so

3055
02:12:31,439 --> 02:12:34,439
i

3056
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:44,960
so i guess i would say like

3057
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:46,960
are we

3058
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:49,920
is this something where we've where i

3059
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:52,719
accidentally typed in some kind of a

3060
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:54,399
weird like override bug or something

3061
02:12:52,719 --> 02:12:57,118
or did this

3062
02:12:54,399 --> 02:12:58,960
actually write some garbage to it i

3063
02:12:57,118 --> 02:13:01,519
don't actually know

3064
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:03,840
again because this is a bit

3065
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,840
um

3066
02:13:04,238 --> 02:13:07,919
yeah it's a bit weird here

3067
02:13:08,078 --> 02:13:11,078
right

3068
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:22,000
so as the files

3069
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:24,880
go

3070
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:27,599
they've already been loaded so

3071
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:27,599
you know the

3072
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:33,719
this part here

3073
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:07,759
so

3074
02:14:05,359 --> 02:14:11,399
i suppose that makes sense let's look at

3075
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:11,400
what this is doing

3076
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:20,519
so here we're just reading data from

3077
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:20,520
file

3078
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:29,399
here's the header

3079
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:45,119
not sure i understand what that means

3080
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:48,158
are those like

3081
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:52,839
like

3082
02:14:49,439 --> 02:14:56,238
encoded in some ways that's kind of

3083
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:56,239
weird right

3084
02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:05,599
uh keep it deeper is always the next uh

3085
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:08,238
once early uh i just wanted to before we

3086
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:09,520
get to that point i wanted to try and

3087
02:15:08,238 --> 02:15:11,678
find out

3088
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:13,040
whether it was an actual change or

3089
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:14,319
whether this is actually what's in the

3090
02:15:13,039 --> 02:15:15,840
file right because i don't actually know

3091
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:17,599
what kind of bug i'm looking for at the

3092
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:19,440
moment

3093
02:15:17,599 --> 02:15:23,840
um

3094
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:23,839
so what does the file info say

3095
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:36,319
all right so i guess that all is

3096
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:38,319
actually what it actually

3097
02:15:36,319 --> 02:15:41,439
that all is just what it is right that's

3098
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:44,000
all actually accurate

3099
02:15:41,439 --> 02:15:44,000
in theory

3100
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:49,800
it's the intro cut scene

3101
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:58,880
yeah like this stuff is just like way

3102
02:15:57,198 --> 02:16:00,719
too complicated right and that's what

3103
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:02,159
happens this is why i say like stream

3104
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:03,679
programming is terrible because like

3105
02:16:02,158 --> 02:16:05,439
this stuff should just be simplified

3106
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:07,359
massively and if you were working on

3107
02:16:05,439 --> 02:16:09,439
this sort of thing full time you just

3108
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:10,880
these kind of things get

3109
02:16:09,439 --> 02:16:13,039
resolved

3110
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:14,560
they do not get resolved when you have

3111
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:17,198
to program on stream and it's very

3112
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:20,239
unsatisfying

3113
02:16:17,198 --> 02:16:22,960
uh so if we look at what all these files

3114
02:16:20,238 --> 02:16:27,479
actually are

3115
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:27,480
once they've been loaded right

3116
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:44,718
so now we're gonna

3117
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:46,879
we're gonna like

3118
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:48,879
make the merge thing we have the

3119
02:16:46,879 --> 02:16:50,959
internal one that pushes the size out

3120
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:52,718
for that's just for adding stuff at run

3121
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:53,839
time but we don't like that's not

3122
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:55,119
actually

3123
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:58,558
that wouldn't be happening if the game

3124
02:16:55,120 --> 02:17:01,359
was actually running as it normally does

3125
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:03,518
right

3126
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:04,800
so now we loop through these and we're

3127
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:07,359
going to like

3128
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:11,279
read the tags out of the files into

3129
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:12,880
their final like destinations

3130
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:15,840
right

3131
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:15,839
um

3132
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,239
and then we're going to read the assets

3133
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:22,638
out

3134
02:17:20,239 --> 02:17:25,599
and adjust

3135
02:17:22,638 --> 02:17:25,598
the tags

3136
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:33,519
uh which maybe is broken

3137
02:17:30,569 --> 02:17:36,519
[Music]

3138
02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:36,519
right

3139
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:19,839
so it's after the it's this first file

3140
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:22,638
does not have any errors in it right

3141
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:25,760
because the asset count

3142
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:27,119
we get through up to like asset 173 or

3143
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:28,960
whatever

3144
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:31,679
is just fine

3145
02:18:28,959 --> 02:18:34,239
so the file asset count for the first

3146
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:36,478
you know for the first one here

3147
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:36,478
um

3148
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:43,120
this just is just fine there's no

3149
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:43,119
right

3150
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:50,079
like this will just work and it's only

3151
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,760
once we get to the next file that's the

3152
02:18:50,079 --> 02:18:56,159
one that that would that is busted right

3153
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:58,398
so in other words this part of the code

3154
02:18:56,159 --> 02:19:00,239
here we actually

3155
02:18:58,398 --> 02:19:03,039
like we can get down to this temp memory

3156
02:19:00,239 --> 02:19:05,439
block in theory right and it's just fine

3157
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:08,719
and we have 170 assets all of which are

3158
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:11,120
fine so it's only when we get to this

3159
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:12,638
next part of the

3160
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:14,800
shenanigans

3161
02:19:12,638 --> 02:19:17,279
right

3162
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:20,239
that things go pear-shaped

3163
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:23,200
and

3164
02:19:20,239 --> 02:19:25,439
we're loading like a bunch of assets

3165
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:26,120
and a bunch of tags in here and we're

3166
02:19:25,439 --> 02:19:27,679
loading them

3167
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:31,359
[Music]

3168
02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:31,359
out of this like tag base

3169
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:37,200
uh which we guess i don't care

3170
02:19:34,478 --> 02:19:38,718
about that because really it's the asset

3171
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:40,719
that's garbage

3172
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:42,478
so we don't really care about the tag

3173
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:45,199
loading now that i think about it it's

3174
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:47,279
really just this at the moment

3175
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:50,240
um so we look at file asset count and

3176
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:50,239
we're like we're going to load

3177
02:19:50,359 --> 02:19:55,040
3113 or whatever out of this thing

3178
02:19:56,079 --> 02:20:00,559
uh so we

3179
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,559
load it in

3180
02:20:00,799 --> 02:20:05,759
like so

3181
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:08,719
um we load in the annotations

3182
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:11,120
and then we loop through the assets like

3183
02:20:08,719 --> 02:20:14,840
one at a time

3184
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:14,840
uh and

3185
02:20:16,239 --> 02:20:21,199
right there's a bunch of them

3186
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:23,600
and we can see which global one we're

3187
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:24,640
going to be on here

3188
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,159
uh

3189
02:20:24,639 --> 02:20:30,879
at each time and we can look

3190
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:32,318
at the source asset and the destination

3191
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:34,639
asset right

3192
02:20:32,318 --> 02:20:34,639
um

3193
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:42,559
it'd be this is what we were copying

3194
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:45,600
so the hha asset is

3195
02:20:42,559 --> 02:20:48,079
what we've loaded out of the file and

3196
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,960
it's this

3197
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:52,079
uh

3198
02:20:48,959 --> 02:20:54,559
which is garbage

3199
02:20:52,079 --> 02:20:54,559
for sure

3200
02:20:56,959 --> 02:21:04,239
right so this this is just garbage

3201
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:08,159
so for some reason this file it's just

3202
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:11,159
it just has pure garbage in it i believe

3203
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:11,159
um

3204
02:21:26,398 --> 02:21:30,478
so for whatever reason this particular

3205
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:32,318
file is just is just messed up is there

3206
02:21:30,478 --> 02:21:35,039
any like which file is this this is the

3207
02:21:32,318 --> 02:21:36,719
base game file so somehow the base game

3208
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:40,520
file got

3209
02:21:36,719 --> 02:21:40,519
totally borked

3210
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:44,000
i mean

3211
02:21:42,159 --> 02:21:45,840
right

3212
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,840
how is that possible we didn't do

3213
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:48,840
anything

3214
02:21:54,398 --> 02:21:58,799
like we must have done something that

3215
02:21:56,318 --> 02:22:00,559
caused our file to get screwed up

3216
02:21:58,799 --> 02:22:03,119
somehow

3217
02:22:00,559 --> 02:22:07,398
but i don't know what we did that could

3218
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:07,399
possibly have done that

3219
02:22:26,639 --> 02:22:33,959
so yeah i don't know that's that's a a

3220
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:33,960
real strange one

3221
02:22:36,239 --> 02:22:42,799
although like apparently that one was

3222
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:42,799
okay like am i misreading this

3223
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:47,959
somehow

3224
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:59,359
what is going on here folks

3225
02:23:02,079 --> 02:23:05,840
like how is that not

3226
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:11,359
i guess the way this is working is that

3227
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:13,600
you don't see the crash yet

3228
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:16,960
or you don't get a crash yet because

3229
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:18,399
since these two tags are the same you

3230
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:20,239
don't process anything

3231
02:23:18,398 --> 02:23:22,318
because you'd loop between them

3232
02:23:20,239 --> 02:23:24,398
if you ever went to load the data it

3233
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:26,478
would completely fail

3234
02:23:24,398 --> 02:23:29,519
right

3235
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:30,398
so something has gone horribly horribly

3236
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:32,560
wrong

3237
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:34,159
with like our our

3238
02:23:32,559 --> 02:23:36,000
loading of

3239
02:23:34,159 --> 02:23:38,318
the hha file

3240
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,318
the

3241
02:23:42,079 --> 02:23:46,478
the base game hha is somehow completely

3242
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:48,640
destroyed

3243
02:23:46,478 --> 02:23:50,239
but we don't really have any idea why

3244
02:23:48,639 --> 02:23:51,199
that would be

3245
02:23:50,239 --> 02:23:53,840
right

3246
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:56,159
meanwhile our cutscene hha file is like

3247
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:56,159
fine

3248
02:23:56,719 --> 02:23:59,719
right

3249
02:24:08,799 --> 02:24:13,239
so did we actually like

3250
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:22,239
so i don't know how we did that and i

3251
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:23,120
don't

3252
02:24:22,239 --> 02:24:24,959
yeah

3253
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:29,399
i don't know how we did that and i also

3254
02:24:24,959 --> 02:24:29,398
don't know like i mean

3255
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:35,439
it doesn't make a lot of sense so i

3256
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:38,079
guess my next question would be

3257
02:24:35,439 --> 02:24:40,079
so if we rebuilt it

3258
02:24:38,079 --> 02:24:42,239
does this problem go away meaning is

3259
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:45,039
this did we just corrupt the file

3260
02:24:42,239 --> 02:24:47,039
somehow or is this nothing to do with

3261
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:49,040
that right

3262
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:51,760
so we run it and oops

3263
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:53,520
we run it and we crash here and the data

3264
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:54,840
looks like garbage that we're loading

3265
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,319
out of the file

3266
02:24:54,840 --> 02:25:02,079
right um if we delete the base game hha

3267
02:24:58,318 --> 02:25:02,079
file so it's gone oops

3268
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:11,840
uh and then we rerun the program

3269
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:14,959
what happens

3270
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:17,680
like because now it's just going to like

3271
02:25:14,959 --> 02:25:20,318
rebuild that h file

3272
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:22,398
from scratch by loading all of the like

3273
02:25:20,318 --> 02:25:24,799
source assets and like smooshing them

3274
02:25:22,398 --> 02:25:27,279
together into a file

3275
02:25:24,799 --> 02:25:29,358
did we just break that at some point and

3276
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:32,239
since we never bothered to like rebuild

3277
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:34,079
these data files we just didn't see

3278
02:25:32,239 --> 02:25:36,840
that it was messed up because that's

3279
02:25:34,079 --> 02:25:39,359
very plausible right

3280
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:41,920
um or is that not what happened so

3281
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:43,280
there's it re it rebuilt the game asset

3282
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:44,398
data right

3283
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:46,960
um

3284
02:25:44,398 --> 02:25:48,398
and now if i go

3285
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:49,839
i don't quite remember how any of this

3286
02:25:48,398 --> 02:25:51,680
stuff worked but basically i think you

3287
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:54,159
just say

3288
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:54,159
um

3289
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:05,159
do i have to hit save or does it just

3290
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:05,159
automatically save

3291
02:26:06,639 --> 02:26:10,478
i think it's just automatically saves

3292
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:13,358
that

3293
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:13,358
i'm not quite sure

3294
02:26:15,439 --> 02:26:21,239
looks like it automatically saves the

3295
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:21,239
base game aj

3296
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:26,319
so

3297
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:28,319
um

3298
02:26:26,318 --> 02:26:31,199
so now we run it and it's right again so

3299
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:33,279
like somebody corrupted that

3300
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:35,760
so probably just bugs the incremental

3301
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:37,680
update i guess we probably need to clean

3302
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,040
that system up right i mean we've been

3303
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:40,479
cleaning up all the other systems at

3304
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:42,640
some point that one's going to be on the

3305
02:26:40,478 --> 02:26:45,438
table certainly

3306
02:26:42,639 --> 02:26:47,599
but it looks like that was the problem

3307
02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:50,079
so now the question is well if that was

3308
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,040
the problem does that mean now that this

3309
02:26:50,079 --> 02:26:55,039
can be

3310
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:55,040
restored so like if i do this again

3311
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:59,520
and put back in the part that i

3312
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:02,720
previously had to remove because

3313
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:05,359
everything seemed to be totally borked

3314
02:27:02,719 --> 02:27:05,358
can we now

3315
02:27:06,398 --> 02:27:10,879
just include this

3316
02:27:08,318 --> 02:27:10,879
thing again

3317
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:14,959
where'd it go

3318
02:27:15,359 --> 02:27:19,040
this

3319
02:27:16,398 --> 02:27:20,959
so this exact code that i wrote before

3320
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:23,120
right

3321
02:27:20,959 --> 02:27:25,599
like so which should not have had any

3322
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:29,399
deleterious effects

3323
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:29,399
um it is

3324
02:27:30,079 --> 02:27:32,398
that

3325
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:35,439
um

3326
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:36,959
can we just run it and

3327
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:38,960
expect to now

3328
02:27:36,959 --> 02:27:42,438
be back where we started with without

3329
02:27:38,959 --> 02:27:42,438
the weird bug

3330
02:27:44,239 --> 02:27:47,359
the answer appears to be yes

3331
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:52,478
oh god

3332
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:56,318
so there seems to be some audio tearing

3333
02:27:54,879 --> 02:27:58,959
and stuff in there there's also the fact

3334
02:27:56,318 --> 02:28:01,199
that apparently there's no actual stop

3335
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:03,039
gap on that attack code

3336
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:04,079
so that's a bit bad

3337
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:06,319
um

3338
02:28:04,079 --> 02:28:06,318
but

3339
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:10,318
now we're back to square one so that's

3340
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,159
all fine

3341
02:28:10,318 --> 02:28:14,799
that was like launching like hundreds of

3342
02:28:12,159 --> 02:28:16,239
sounds which is not a good thing

3343
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:18,079
to say the least

3344
02:28:16,239 --> 02:28:22,398
uh but

3345
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:24,079
uh so yeah like if we want to

3346
02:28:22,398 --> 02:28:27,079
where is attacked

3347
02:28:24,079 --> 02:28:27,079
um

3348
02:28:32,719 --> 02:28:35,920
yeah you can kind of see like this is

3349
02:28:34,799 --> 02:28:38,318
just not

3350
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:40,079
what you would want at all um to say the

3351
02:28:38,318 --> 02:28:42,000
least so you would want to do a thing

3352
02:28:40,079 --> 02:28:44,559
where you look to see if you were

3353
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:48,000
weren't attacking previously so

3354
02:28:44,559 --> 02:28:49,279
this you can't really leave

3355
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,439
like that

3356
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:53,520
but otherwise it's fine

3357
02:28:51,439 --> 02:28:55,600
so we do have sound effects in there

3358
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:57,120
currently we would need a way of uh

3359
02:28:55,600 --> 02:29:00,559
being a little bit more selective about

3360
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:02,960
triggering them um but otherwise

3361
02:29:00,559 --> 02:29:05,840
you know no big deal

3362
02:29:02,959 --> 02:29:08,398
uh so i'll i'll take this out

3363
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:10,318
temporarily because until we would have

3364
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:12,000
a way to just do a single trigger we

3365
02:29:10,318 --> 02:29:14,159
probably wouldn't want

3366
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,959
something like that to happen

3367
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:16,478
uh

3368
02:29:14,959 --> 02:29:19,438
but

3369
02:29:16,478 --> 02:29:23,079
that's fine and then if we

3370
02:29:19,439 --> 02:29:23,079
go to like

3371
02:29:23,359 --> 02:29:26,239
i want to say

3372
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:37,200
i want to say that the music

3373
02:29:34,879 --> 02:29:37,599
is a thing

3374
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:39,520
um

3375
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:42,479
[Music]

3376
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:45,920
and we could restore that as well uh now

3377
02:29:42,478 --> 02:29:45,920
if we wanted to uh

3378
02:29:46,079 --> 02:29:50,398
again just to double check that this

3379
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:53,280
stuff works at all which you know

3380
02:29:50,398 --> 02:29:56,879
some of it's kind of rotted

3381
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:57,840
so we don't really need the

3382
02:29:56,879 --> 02:30:01,519
uh

3383
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:04,079
match vector stuff quite exactly the way

3384
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:05,920
it was here this is again not actually

3385
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:07,439
necessary

3386
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:10,960
uh but

3387
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:13,359
if we've have it all so if we just go

3388
02:30:10,959 --> 02:30:15,519
like this

3389
02:30:13,359 --> 02:30:16,569
and say the

3390
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:19,439
channel

3391
02:30:16,569 --> 02:30:20,398
[Music]

3392
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:22,800
so

3393
02:30:20,398 --> 02:30:25,760
the channel zero id

3394
02:30:22,799 --> 02:30:28,478
and the channel one id are really just

3395
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:30,159
gonna be tag uh

3396
02:30:28,478 --> 02:30:32,879
yeah i don't

3397
02:30:30,159 --> 02:30:34,000
know what we called this music or did we

3398
02:30:32,879 --> 02:30:35,759
even

3399
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,159
include this music

3400
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:38,239
um

3401
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:39,280
[Music]

3402
02:30:38,239 --> 02:30:42,719
that

3403
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:45,600
maybe we don't even have the music do we

3404
02:30:42,719 --> 02:30:47,840
is that even still in here

3405
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:47,840
um

3406
02:30:50,239 --> 02:30:54,239
we may have to add

3407
02:30:52,079 --> 02:30:56,799
like a sound

3408
02:30:54,239 --> 02:30:59,199
we may have to add a thing for the music

3409
02:30:56,799 --> 02:31:00,879
because i don't actually know if it's

3410
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:03,600
here at all

3411
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:07,438
uh it kind of looks like it's not

3412
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:07,439
so we might have to

3413
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:15,359
look into

3414
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:19,439
the

3415
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:23,200
sources directory and just see if we've

3416
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:23,200
got any music we don't

3417
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:28,359
um

3418
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:36,880
okay so we do have a music test web

3419
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:39,120
there

3420
02:31:36,879 --> 02:31:42,959
and the music test web is an intro

3421
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:45,200
cutscene so maybe we did put it in to

3422
02:31:42,959 --> 02:31:46,559
one of these hht's as just into yeah we

3423
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:49,600
did

3424
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:52,318
so it's tagged title screen

3425
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:56,800
i don't know why but it is

3426
02:31:52,318 --> 02:31:59,119
um so we can do this

3427
02:31:56,799 --> 02:32:00,000
where we ask for

3428
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:02,560
the

3429
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:07,280
best match sound

3430
02:32:02,559 --> 02:32:07,279
and the asset match vector

3431
02:32:08,398 --> 02:32:13,279
we can pull out individual

3432
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:14,800
channels

3433
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:18,520
pretty trivially

3434
02:32:14,799 --> 02:32:18,519
we would just do

3435
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:29,600
match element channel

3436
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:32,479
equals zero

3437
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:34,640
uh and then one and that would be how we

3438
02:32:32,478 --> 02:32:36,719
would pull out a stereo sound

3439
02:32:34,639 --> 02:32:40,559
right and all this stuff goes away

3440
02:32:36,719 --> 02:32:43,039
entirely uh and like it's much cleaner

3441
02:32:40,559 --> 02:32:46,000
now like we did clean up that part quite

3442
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:49,439
a bit compared to what it was

3443
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:50,639
uh so in theory that's the music

3444
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:52,159
uh

3445
02:32:50,639 --> 02:32:53,680
why we're pulling out both channels i

3446
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:56,799
don't know because we only play one of

3447
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:58,880
them but i guess we were just

3448
02:32:56,799 --> 02:33:00,879
i mean i don't know

3449
02:32:58,879 --> 02:33:02,559
we're just playing around i guess

3450
02:33:00,879 --> 02:33:06,519
so you can see we're getting

3451
02:33:02,559 --> 02:33:06,519
a lot of tearing there

3452
02:33:06,719 --> 02:33:10,239
right

3453
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:12,000
and i'm guessing that's because in fact

3454
02:33:10,239 --> 02:33:13,760
you know what i know it's because we

3455
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,879
don't have sound on a separate thread

3456
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,760
currently

3457
02:33:14,879 --> 02:33:17,279
right

3458
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:18,159
so when the

3459
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:20,399
uh

3460
02:33:18,159 --> 02:33:23,600
speed when the

3461
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:24,959
when this speed is off then you're just

3462
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:27,200
going to get tearing

3463
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:30,559
so we probably will have to move sound

3464
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:32,240
to its own thread soon if we want

3465
02:33:30,559 --> 02:33:35,840
to start playing with sound which we

3466
02:33:32,239 --> 02:33:35,840
probably do right

3467
02:33:36,079 --> 02:33:40,719
so for example if you take a look in

3468
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,719
win32

3469
02:33:45,520 --> 02:33:49,359
so in here write this get sound samples

3470
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:51,760
fill sound buffer you can see that it's

3471
02:33:49,359 --> 02:33:52,800
synchronous with the frame update

3472
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:56,000
right

3473
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:58,398
and so because we now don't hit 60 hertz

3474
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,439
locked and probably won't

3475
02:33:58,398 --> 02:34:03,199
uh

3476
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:04,079
during development at least

3477
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,720
um

3478
02:34:04,079 --> 02:34:09,760
we would want to move this out

3479
02:34:06,719 --> 02:34:12,559
and that's a nice thing to do anyway

3480
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:14,840
we are kind of already prepared to do it

3481
02:34:12,559 --> 02:34:16,799
because you can kind of see

3482
02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:20,000
like

3483
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:22,239
while not entirely ready

3484
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,520
well while we're not like really quite

3485
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:26,879
there yet

3486
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:29,680
um you can see in the audio stuff

3487
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:32,318
when we're doing the sound that we do

3488
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:34,079
have a separate call right so we've sort

3489
02:34:32,318 --> 02:34:37,119
of prepared

3490
02:34:34,079 --> 02:34:38,398
roughly for this eventuality you know

3491
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:41,399
what i mean

3492
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:41,398
um

3493
02:34:48,879 --> 02:34:54,719
but we're just not quite doing that yet

3494
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:57,359
right so it doesn't like we can ask the

3495
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:59,199
game for sound samples on a separate

3496
02:34:57,359 --> 02:35:00,318
function but

3497
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:02,800
we don't

3498
02:35:00,318 --> 02:35:06,159
do that threaded and we have to do a

3499
02:35:02,799 --> 02:35:06,159
little bit of work here because

3500
02:35:06,239 --> 02:35:09,039
at the moment

3501
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:14,559
this code would not be thread safe

3502
02:35:12,719 --> 02:35:17,358
uh because

3503
02:35:14,559 --> 02:35:17,359
of this loop

3504
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:20,719
right

3505
02:35:18,959 --> 02:35:22,879
so like if you look at how this this

3506
02:35:20,719 --> 02:35:26,318
loop is working here you've got these

3507
02:35:22,879 --> 02:35:27,438
playing sounds right this is not you

3508
02:35:26,318 --> 02:35:29,119
know

3509
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:31,040
gonna cut it

3510
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:32,399
because if someone comes along and tries

3511
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:35,200
to play a sound while you're in the

3512
02:35:32,398 --> 02:35:36,159
middle of iterating this would break

3513
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:37,439
um

3514
02:35:36,159 --> 02:35:38,959
just one of the reasons why you don't

3515
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:40,639
write things this way

3516
02:35:38,959 --> 02:35:42,559
but keep in mind you know this was old

3517
02:35:40,639 --> 02:35:44,079
code it was written

3518
02:35:42,559 --> 02:35:45,760
you know when i didn't really do very

3519
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:47,920
much multi-threaded programming so it's

3520
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:49,359
not what i would write today but you

3521
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:51,920
know

3522
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:53,439
that's just to be expected

3523
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,439
multi-threaded programming is much

3524
02:35:53,439 --> 02:35:56,880
bigger now so i write most of my code

3525
02:35:55,439 --> 02:35:59,200
multi-threaded when i started handmade

3526
02:35:56,879 --> 02:36:00,159
hero that was not true right

3527
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:02,319
um

3528
02:36:00,159 --> 02:36:02,318
so

3529
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:07,359
so uh

3530
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:08,399
we'll probably have to take

3531
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:10,239
that

3532
02:36:08,398 --> 02:36:12,559
up soon

3533
02:36:10,239 --> 02:36:15,359
maybe let's leave this on

3534
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:16,239
so that we'll maybe do that first thing

3535
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:18,000
um

3536
02:36:16,239 --> 02:36:19,920
and that way we can have some sound

3537
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,040
effects because we'd like to sort of get

3538
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:22,559
that

3539
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,920
part of the loop working and while we're

3540
02:36:22,559 --> 02:36:26,239
kind of doing the stuff of like okay

3541
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:28,239
let's put in movement cues and

3542
02:36:26,239 --> 02:36:30,239
some sound effects and you know some

3543
02:36:28,239 --> 02:36:31,680
reactions that just sort of stuff we

3544
02:36:30,239 --> 02:36:33,199
probably just want all that stuff to mix

3545
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:36,800
together so we'll just kind of do like

3546
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:37,470
basic threading of the audio layer um

3547
02:36:36,799 --> 02:36:39,920
and uh

3548
02:36:37,469 --> 02:36:41,920
[Music]

3549
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:44,318
and basic sort of like movement

3550
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:47,439
resolution stuff and we'll call that

3551
02:36:44,318 --> 02:36:50,719
like our next kind of goal right like

3552
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:52,318
sort of making it feel more gamey doing

3553
02:36:50,719 --> 02:36:54,398
game like things

3554
02:36:52,318 --> 02:36:55,519
and cleaning up the code

3555
02:36:54,398 --> 02:36:57,119
uh

3556
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:59,200
in the places that we need to to make

3557
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:00,960
that reasonable

3558
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:02,840
um i'm gonna call it

3559
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:05,519
there

3560
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:06,960
and i mean yeah i'm gonna call it there

3561
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:11,000
so i don't have anything else to say

3562
02:37:06,959 --> 02:37:11,000
besides that's the end of it

3563
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:34,318
if one wanted to spawn a second window

3564
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:35,359
how would one go about tackling it

3565
02:37:34,318 --> 02:37:36,879
um

3566
02:37:35,359 --> 02:37:39,200
i i mean i don't really know what you

3567
02:37:36,879 --> 02:37:40,318
mean obviously you can just

3568
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:43,760
create

3569
02:37:40,318 --> 02:37:46,760
call create window twice

3570
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,760
uh

3571
02:37:48,478 --> 02:37:53,119
i don't really understand the question

3572
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:54,800
there's some nasty stuff that opengl

3573
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:57,120
just kind of sucks for stuff like that

3574
02:37:54,799 --> 02:37:58,559
so opengl is really annoying

3575
02:37:57,120 --> 02:38:00,640
because it's hard to do things like

3576
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:01,600
render to multiple windows

3577
02:38:00,639 --> 02:38:03,760
um

3578
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:05,600
unnecessarily

3579
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:07,200
i so you ha

3580
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:09,200
you can do opengl with two windows it's

3581
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:11,680
just it's just ugly you have to unbind

3582
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:15,760
and bind to the different htc but it

3583
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:18,000
works i do it all the time um

3584
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:20,398
directx is easier because you can just

3585
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:21,920
target a specific window right it's not

3586
02:38:20,398 --> 02:38:24,079
difficult

3587
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:26,398
um but either way there's not a lot to

3588
02:38:24,079 --> 02:38:28,000
it you just open a new window and then

3589
02:38:26,398 --> 02:38:29,680
whatever you're going to do to render

3590
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,600
you do it to one window and then you do

3591
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:32,960
it to the other window that's it

3592
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:35,120
it's really there really isn't much to

3593
02:38:32,959 --> 02:38:35,119
it

3594
02:38:38,478 --> 02:38:41,438
i mean if it helps you can even think of

3595
02:38:40,079 --> 02:38:43,120
it as not really being two separate

3596
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:44,639
windows you can think of it as rendering

3597
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:45,920
one big thing and then just putting part

3598
02:38:44,639 --> 02:38:47,920
of it to one window and part of it to

3599
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:50,920
another right

3600
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:50,920
so

3601
02:38:58,478 --> 02:39:00,799
um

3602
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:03,680
so anyway

3603
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:08,159
let's

3604
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:10,479
yeah let's call that a day

3605
02:39:08,159 --> 02:39:12,000
i'll be back here next weekend to look

3606
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:15,119
at that

3607
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,879
uh but i think we're good to go right

3608
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:19,600
um i think we are

3609
02:39:16,879 --> 02:39:19,599
good to go

3610
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:24,640
oh

3611
02:39:23,439 --> 02:39:26,479
what's the problem with exploitation of

3612
02:39:24,639 --> 02:39:28,478
the working class really an open source

3613
02:39:26,478 --> 02:39:30,000
problem you still can have a commercial

3614
02:39:28,478 --> 02:39:33,519
licensing on an open source code right

3615
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:37,040
uh well no let me be clear

3616
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:39,680
i'm just telling you what happened

3617
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:41,600
right you can hypothesize if there might

3618
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:43,280
be solutions to the problem but who

3619
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,720
cares i mean

3620
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,319
so if you can solve the problem then

3621
02:39:44,719 --> 02:39:48,000
great go solve the problem but the

3622
02:39:46,318 --> 02:39:49,199
problem currently is that's what

3623
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,239
happened

3624
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:52,720
so

3625
02:39:50,239 --> 02:39:54,159
it's really no good saying well you

3626
02:39:52,719 --> 02:39:56,079
could have done open source differently

3627
02:39:54,159 --> 02:39:58,799
and this wouldn't be a problem well okay

3628
02:39:56,079 --> 02:40:00,879
great but you didn't right

3629
02:39:58,799 --> 02:40:04,239
so anything that someone says about open

3630
02:40:00,879 --> 02:40:06,398
source being able to work properly so

3631
02:40:04,239 --> 02:40:08,959
that people don't get exploited

3632
02:40:06,398 --> 02:40:10,239
is purely speculative

3633
02:40:08,959 --> 02:40:12,799
right

3634
02:40:10,239 --> 02:40:14,159
so if you can go demonstrate it great go

3635
02:40:12,799 --> 02:40:16,559
go ahead and do that

3636
02:40:14,159 --> 02:40:19,359
uh and then we're great

3637
02:40:16,559 --> 02:40:21,278
but so far nobody

3638
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:22,559
period has

3639
02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:24,239
done this

3640
02:40:22,559 --> 02:40:25,760
the only thing that's happening in open

3641
02:40:24,239 --> 02:40:28,079
source right now is like massive

3642
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:29,920
exploitation of working programmers

3643
02:40:28,079 --> 02:40:32,079
to this day that is all that's happening

3644
02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:34,318
in open source anywhere as far as i can

3645
02:40:32,079 --> 02:40:35,600
see even the people who are getting paid

3646
02:40:34,318 --> 02:40:36,959
to work on open source are getting

3647
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:39,920
massively

3648
02:40:36,959 --> 02:40:41,759
underpaid to do it compared to how much

3649
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:43,920
the people who are using their code are

3650
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:45,600
making right

3651
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:47,359
so you can say that there are solutions

3652
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:49,680
and great i hope there are

3653
02:40:47,359 --> 02:40:51,439
but until someone actually demonstrates

3654
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:53,120
that those solutions work it's kind of

3655
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:56,000
the it's the standard like real

3656
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:57,680
communism has never been tried argument

3657
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,439
well i don't really care about something

3658
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:00,960
that you say hypothetically works but

3659
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:04,398
that you haven't demonstrated actually

3660
02:41:00,959 --> 02:41:07,278
does so someone has to actually prove to

3661
02:41:04,398 --> 02:41:09,358
me that open source can work and thrive

3662
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:11,600
while still properly allocating the

3663
02:41:09,359 --> 02:41:13,439
correct amount of payment to the people

3664
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:15,200
doing the work in my opinion before i'm

3665
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:16,880
willing to say that it's any good

3666
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:19,359
because so far

3667
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:21,199
all it seems to do to me is a massive

3668
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:23,600
transfer from labor

3669
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:25,279
to management

3670
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:26,159
that's all i see

3671
02:41:25,279 --> 02:41:28,720
right

3672
02:41:26,159 --> 02:41:30,559
um and i have seen nothing else happen

3673
02:41:28,719 --> 02:41:32,719
economically with open source other than

3674
02:41:30,559 --> 02:41:37,680
basically like a massive transfer of

3675
02:41:32,719 --> 02:41:37,679
wealth from programmers to managers

3676
02:41:38,398 --> 02:41:42,398
so

3677
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:45,279
that's that's what happened

3678
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:47,840
can it be fixed i mean i don't know

3679
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:48,800
probably i mean anything can be fixed if

3680
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:51,359
you

3681
02:41:48,799 --> 02:41:52,318
work hard at it but will it be fixed i

3682
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:54,479
doubt it

3683
02:41:52,318 --> 02:41:57,359
certainly there's no indications that it

3684
02:41:54,478 --> 02:42:00,079
will change at all in the near future

3685
02:41:57,359 --> 02:42:01,200
it's going exactly as it was going

3686
02:42:00,079 --> 02:42:03,600
right

3687
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:06,640
so i am not optimistic about the

3688
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:09,439
prospects of open source as a

3689
02:42:06,639 --> 02:42:10,559
fair economic model because the only

3690
02:42:09,439 --> 02:42:11,920
thing it's currently doing is

3691
02:42:10,559 --> 02:42:14,000
transferring wealth from programmers to

3692
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:16,318
managers and i see

3693
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:18,639
the only thing i see is that trend

3694
02:42:16,318 --> 02:42:20,639
accelerating if anything

3695
02:42:18,639 --> 02:42:22,719
um because as a generation of

3696
02:42:20,639 --> 02:42:24,239
programmers has basically been duped

3697
02:42:22,719 --> 02:42:26,799
into thinking that their hard work

3698
02:42:24,239 --> 02:42:29,279
should just be given away for free

3699
02:42:26,799 --> 02:42:30,559
it becomes increasingly difficult

3700
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:31,760
for people

3701
02:42:30,559 --> 02:42:33,840
to

3702
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:36,800
argue that you shouldn't release your

3703
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:39,439
code open source right

3704
02:42:36,799 --> 02:42:41,599
so until somebody actually is able to

3705
02:42:39,439 --> 02:42:45,359
turn this around i would say i think

3706
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:47,520
open source is very very bad

3707
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:49,359
it is currently like the very worst

3708
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:52,560
thing currently going

3709
02:42:49,359 --> 02:42:55,840
because it is so incredibly exploitative

3710
02:42:52,559 --> 02:42:58,318
it's far more exploitative than any

3711
02:42:55,840 --> 02:43:00,719
actual company is right now of the

3712
02:42:58,318 --> 02:43:01,760
workers who work at the company

3713
02:43:00,719 --> 02:43:04,239
um

3714
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:06,318
open source is way more exploitative

3715
02:43:04,239 --> 02:43:08,559
than that right now

3716
02:43:06,318 --> 02:43:10,719
uh and that it should be considered a

3717
02:43:08,559 --> 02:43:12,719
great cause for concern

3718
02:43:10,719 --> 02:43:14,398
for basically all

3719
02:43:12,719 --> 02:43:16,959
um

3720
02:43:14,398 --> 02:43:19,039
you know of

3721
02:43:16,959 --> 02:43:21,599
for anyone who wants to see people

3722
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:22,720
fairly compensated for their labor and

3723
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:25,359
not

3724
02:43:22,719 --> 02:43:28,799
have their labor exploited to produce

3725
02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:30,720
power centers that they then are subject

3726
02:43:28,799 --> 02:43:32,318
to themselves right

3727
02:43:30,719 --> 02:43:34,000
because that's what's currently going on

3728
02:43:32,318 --> 02:43:36,159
like working programmers are creating

3729
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:38,879
code they're releasing it for free use

3730
02:43:36,159 --> 02:43:41,200
on the internet and then people use that

3731
02:43:38,879 --> 02:43:42,879
code without really compensating them

3732
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:44,640
almost at all sometimes they compensate

3733
02:43:42,879 --> 02:43:45,438
them a little bit usually it's not very

3734
02:43:44,639 --> 02:43:47,199
much

3735
02:43:45,439 --> 02:43:49,200
certainly it's nothing compared to the

3736
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:51,840
power that then is accreted by the

3737
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:54,079
people who have co-opted that work

3738
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:57,920
thanks to the open source model

3739
02:43:54,079 --> 02:43:59,279
and then basically then what you get is

3740
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:02,000
you know

3741
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:04,960
you just get mark zuckerberg gets to

3742
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:07,040
define how the internet works despite

3743
02:44:04,959 --> 02:44:08,719
having paid for almost none of the

3744
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:12,720
software that his company actually

3745
02:44:08,719 --> 02:44:13,679
needed to make that work right

3746
02:44:12,719 --> 02:44:17,199
um

3747
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:18,880
so that's just that's the situation

3748
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:19,760
and

3749
02:44:18,879 --> 02:44:22,000
i

3750
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:24,398
until i see someone proving that there's

3751
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:27,200
a solution in practice

3752
02:44:24,398 --> 02:44:28,318
i i just don't endorse open source

3753
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:29,279
anymore

3754
02:44:28,318 --> 02:44:30,000
right

3755
02:44:29,279 --> 02:44:32,239
i

3756
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:35,200
i

3757
02:44:32,239 --> 02:44:38,159
would like there to be ways like like

3758
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:41,359
for example models more like

3759
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:44,000
uh you people who pay for the software

3760
02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:45,760
get to get a license to the source code

3761
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,359
but all they are not allowed to do

3762
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:49,040
anything with it

3763
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:50,640
outside of

3764
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:53,200
other people who have paid for it or

3765
02:44:50,639 --> 02:44:54,799
something things like that i could see

3766
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:58,000
being useful

3767
02:44:54,799 --> 02:45:01,840
but like i really just don't see

3768
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:06,000
we post stuff on github bed under a gpl

3769
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:08,079
ii or lgpl or apache or mit license

3770
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,120
that's just all that is is now it's just

3771
02:45:08,079 --> 02:45:12,159
exploitation that's all it is to me

3772
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:14,399
um

3773
02:45:12,159 --> 02:45:16,239
because it's so obvious

3774
02:45:14,398 --> 02:45:18,239
like how

3775
02:45:16,239 --> 02:45:20,079
many very bad things have happened on

3776
02:45:18,239 --> 02:45:21,840
the back of these

3777
02:45:20,079 --> 02:45:23,840
workers who

3778
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:25,920
basically produced the code necessary

3779
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:28,000
for all of these companies to exist at

3780
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:29,439
all they would none of them been able to

3781
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,600
get started

3782
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:33,840
facebook doesn't exist without php

3783
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:35,600
apache linux

3784
02:45:33,840 --> 02:45:38,000
facebook would never even have gotten

3785
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:40,399
day one without those people and now

3786
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:43,359
those people who built all those things

3787
02:45:40,398 --> 02:45:45,278
i mean whether you think php sucks or

3788
02:45:43,359 --> 02:45:47,840
not facebook doesn't exist without it

3789
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:49,680
the people who made php have no say in

3790
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:51,920
what happens on facebook

3791
02:45:49,680 --> 02:45:54,079
they have no power at all they get no

3792
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:56,719
decision-making authority they do not

3793
02:45:54,079 --> 02:45:59,439
share in the profits they basically just

3794
02:45:56,719 --> 02:46:01,119
get handouts that facebook decides to

3795
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:02,880
give them if they choose to give them to

3796
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:04,800
them at all and that to me is completely

3797
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:07,839
unacceptable

3798
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:10,239
it's just completely unacceptable

3799
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:11,279
the people who do the work should have

3800
02:46:10,239 --> 02:46:13,520
the

3801
02:46:11,279 --> 02:46:16,079
just compensation for what they did and

3802
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:19,439
they should have a fair voice in what

3803
02:46:16,079 --> 02:46:22,879
happens with their labor and

3804
02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:25,600
i don't necessarily go as far as

3805
02:46:22,879 --> 02:46:26,959
like a full marxist view of something

3806
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:28,239
like that where

3807
02:46:26,959 --> 02:46:30,398
i think that

3808
02:46:28,239 --> 02:46:32,239
you can't have like a capital class and

3809
02:46:30,398 --> 02:46:34,398
investment and stuff like that

3810
02:46:32,239 --> 02:46:36,799
but my point here is this was done

3811
02:46:34,398 --> 02:46:40,159
without even the capitalism model

3812
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:42,478
meaning nobody paid up front for those

3813
02:46:40,159 --> 02:46:45,279
people to make php

3814
02:46:42,478 --> 02:46:47,199
facebook did not pay them right so it's

3815
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:49,120
not even like

3816
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:52,800
it's it's

3817
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:55,680
it's much more like feudalism or

3818
02:46:52,799 --> 02:46:58,239
serfdom than anything else open source

3819
02:46:55,680 --> 02:47:00,239
is these people just did the work and

3820
02:46:58,239 --> 02:47:02,159
got nothing for it they weren't even

3821
02:47:00,239 --> 02:47:04,959
paid upfront by the people who ended up

3822
02:47:02,159 --> 02:47:07,200
using it which is one of the rationales

3823
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:08,879
for like the capitalist approach is that

3824
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:11,040
well these people are providing you a

3825
02:47:08,879 --> 02:47:13,599
salary before you did the work so to me

3826
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:15,600
that's a lot more fair here that didn't

3827
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:17,680
even happen they are not getting a

3828
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:21,359
salary they got nothing they did the

3829
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:23,040
work for free originally and then were

3830
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:24,720
completely exploited at the end of it

3831
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:26,960
it's kind of like

3832
02:47:24,719 --> 02:47:28,879
if you took the worst of socialism and

3833
02:47:26,959 --> 02:47:32,159
the worst of capitalism and combined

3834
02:47:28,879 --> 02:47:32,159
them that's open source

3835
02:47:32,959 --> 02:47:35,839
right

3836
02:47:36,719 --> 02:47:40,799
it it like that's the only real way i

3837
02:47:38,799 --> 02:47:43,119
can think to define it it's like if you

3838
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:45,119
took the worst aspects of capitalism for

3839
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:46,960
workers and the worst aspects of

3840
02:47:45,120 --> 02:47:50,240
socialism for workers

3841
02:47:46,959 --> 02:47:50,239
and you put them together

3842
02:47:50,478 --> 02:47:55,119
you that's what you you get open source

3843
02:47:55,680 --> 02:48:01,040
it's it's the you get no power and you

3844
02:47:58,079 --> 02:48:04,639
get no money that's what it is right so

3845
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:04,640
it's like the worst of both things

3846
02:48:06,559 --> 02:48:10,959
i i just don't know any way to say it

3847
02:48:08,478 --> 02:48:12,959
it's very very upsetting to me

3848
02:48:10,959 --> 02:48:15,959
it's very very upsetting to me

3849
02:48:12,959 --> 02:48:15,959
right

3850
02:48:17,359 --> 02:48:22,079
greg inc i disagree uh just because

3851
02:48:20,159 --> 02:48:23,760
someone chooses to let you exploit them

3852
02:48:22,079 --> 02:48:25,680
does not mean you didn't exploit them

3853
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:27,279
exploitation is true

3854
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:29,439
objectively

3855
02:48:27,279 --> 02:48:32,319
it is not have anything to do with

3856
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:33,840
whether someone was okay with it right

3857
02:48:32,318 --> 02:48:36,719
um

3858
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:39,359
so it's exploitative period it doesn't

3859
02:48:36,719 --> 02:48:41,119
matter whether the people chose to be

3860
02:48:39,359 --> 02:48:42,840
exploited right

3861
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:45,200
because you can't you can choose to be

3862
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:46,559
exploited you can choose to be

3863
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,760
submissive you can choose all those

3864
02:48:46,559 --> 02:48:50,159
things

3865
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:52,318
nobody said it was coercive

3866
02:48:50,159 --> 02:48:54,559
but it's very exploitative

3867
02:48:52,318 --> 02:48:54,559
right

3868
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:58,399
and for the record that's how most

3869
02:48:57,120 --> 02:49:00,800
exploitation works

3870
02:48:58,398 --> 02:49:03,439
most exploitation is about convincing

3871
02:49:00,799 --> 02:49:04,959
people that they're doing something that

3872
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:07,359
they should you know convincing them to

3873
02:49:04,959 --> 02:49:08,959
do something that turns out to be very

3874
02:49:07,359 --> 02:49:10,399
bad for them and very good for you and

3875
02:49:08,959 --> 02:49:13,599
that's exactly what the open source

3876
02:49:10,398 --> 02:49:15,840
movement has turned out to be

3877
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:15,840
right

3878
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:26,040
so

3879
02:49:28,318 --> 02:49:33,519
so fix it

3880
02:49:30,639 --> 02:49:33,519
stop doing that

3881
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:38,318
i i think there's some people who've

3882
02:49:36,959 --> 02:49:41,039
been trying different licenses like

3883
02:49:38,318 --> 02:49:42,079
there's a gpl license now right

3884
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:42,960
um

3885
02:49:42,079 --> 02:49:45,840
that

3886
02:49:42,959 --> 02:49:46,799
you know you uh

3887
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:49,600
that

3888
02:49:46,799 --> 02:49:51,199
requires basically it to maintain open

3889
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:53,279
source even if it's used on like a

3890
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:55,840
server or something like that

3891
02:49:53,279 --> 02:49:55,840
you know what i'm saying

3892
02:50:00,079 --> 02:50:04,478
cage betas uh yeah i mean i think there

3893
02:50:02,639 --> 02:50:06,318
is like there was a new gpl license

3894
02:50:04,478 --> 02:50:09,199
that's designed to fix the problem of

3895
02:50:06,318 --> 02:50:11,439
facebook right uh there's a new gpl

3896
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:14,800
license that's like look if you use this

3897
02:50:11,439 --> 02:50:16,800
source code even if you run it privately

3898
02:50:14,799 --> 02:50:17,759
you have to release all your source code

3899
02:50:16,799 --> 02:50:19,920
as well

3900
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:23,600
right that goes with it

3901
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:26,719
agpl yeah um

3902
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:28,479
and and that's really like

3903
02:50:26,719 --> 02:50:29,920
it's gonna you're gonna have to do

3904
02:50:28,478 --> 02:50:31,840
something like that if you want open

3905
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:33,760
source to survive or you do the opposite

3906
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:36,960
thing which is you have to pay a

3907
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:38,880
reasonable payment for your open source

3908
02:50:36,959 --> 02:50:41,599
um or something

3909
02:50:38,879 --> 02:50:43,039
but but yeah the agpl is really the only

3910
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:46,239
thing that i've seen so far that's an

3911
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:48,960
attempt to fix these fundamentally

3912
02:50:46,239 --> 02:50:52,239
unfair compensation practices

3913
02:50:48,959 --> 02:50:52,239
because um

3914
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:56,318
you know

3915
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:59,439
it really just requires

3916
02:50:56,318 --> 02:51:01,199
a certain amount of legal enforcement if

3917
02:50:59,439 --> 02:51:03,200
you want the source code to be open

3918
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:05,840
there has to be licenses

3919
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:05,840
right

3920
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,159
so

3921
02:51:10,239 --> 02:51:15,119
anyway i see it as a very bad situation

3922
02:51:12,719 --> 02:51:16,959
and people need to

3923
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:19,760
really rethink how this is structured

3924
02:51:16,959 --> 02:51:22,559
it's not acceptable currently

3925
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:25,600
it should be fixed

3926
02:51:22,559 --> 02:51:25,600
it should be fixed

3927
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:35,439
and the people who

3928
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:37,279
who create these foundational pieces of

3929
02:51:35,439 --> 02:51:39,200
software that other

3930
02:51:37,279 --> 02:51:40,560
companies choose to use to build their

3931
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:41,920
businesses on

3932
02:51:40,559 --> 02:51:43,199
they should be getting percentage

3933
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:45,920
ownerships of these companies or

3934
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:47,439
percentages of their earnings just like

3935
02:51:45,920 --> 02:51:48,639
a shareholder

3936
02:51:47,439 --> 02:51:49,439
right

3937
02:51:48,639 --> 02:51:50,559
um

3938
02:51:49,439 --> 02:51:51,920
because

3939
02:51:50,559 --> 02:51:53,359
the company simply could not have

3940
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:55,840
existed without this open source

3941
02:51:53,359 --> 02:51:55,840
software

3942
02:51:56,398 --> 02:52:02,559
uh greg yes so so in uh well two things

3943
02:52:00,799 --> 02:52:04,159
first of all handmade hero is closed

3944
02:52:02,559 --> 02:52:08,000
source

3945
02:52:04,159 --> 02:52:09,520
um for starters right

3946
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:11,680
so you have to pay to get the source

3947
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:12,960
code and you cannot use it uh in your

3948
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:14,720
own stuff

3949
02:52:12,959 --> 02:52:15,519
right

3950
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:16,318
but

3951
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:18,479
uh

3952
02:52:16,318 --> 02:52:21,359
the handmade hero

3953
02:52:18,478 --> 02:52:23,920
eventual thing was at some point after

3954
02:52:21,359 --> 02:52:26,800
the game is out i will eventually allow

3955
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:28,559
the source code to be reused

3956
02:52:26,799 --> 02:52:30,478
i would not have made that decision

3957
02:52:28,559 --> 02:52:32,318
today right

3958
02:52:30,478 --> 02:52:34,478
uh and we certainly will never do that

3959
02:52:32,318 --> 02:52:36,398
with another one of our products but no

3960
02:52:34,478 --> 02:52:39,119
even handmade hero was not is not open

3961
02:52:36,398 --> 02:52:39,119
source currently

3962
02:52:39,279 --> 02:52:42,800
and again that's to try and strike that

3963
02:52:40,799 --> 02:52:44,000
balance is to say look this is like

3964
02:52:42,799 --> 02:52:45,438
actual

3965
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:48,398
if you think this is useful you should

3966
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:51,840
have to pay for it right because that's

3967
02:52:48,398 --> 02:52:51,840
the only real fair way to go

3968
02:52:52,799 --> 02:52:56,159
that said handmade hero is not really a

3969
02:52:54,318 --> 02:52:58,559
foundational technology so it's not

3970
02:52:56,159 --> 02:53:00,079
really similar the level of exploitation

3971
02:52:58,559 --> 02:53:01,600
that can happen based off of handmade

3972
02:53:00,079 --> 02:53:03,200
hero is not very

3973
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:04,559
large

3974
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:06,880
right

3975
02:53:04,559 --> 02:53:09,439
um it's not a fundamental technology

3976
02:53:06,879 --> 02:53:11,759
like something like a web server

3977
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:13,680
so

3978
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:15,120
um

3979
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:17,439
the

3980
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:19,200
the chances that i will get fairly

3981
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:20,318
compensated for handmade hero are much

3982
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:22,720
higher

3983
02:53:20,318 --> 02:53:24,478
right uh than the chances that you'll

3984
02:53:22,719 --> 02:53:28,079
get fairly

3985
02:53:24,478 --> 02:53:30,000
compensated for something like linux

3986
02:53:28,079 --> 02:53:31,200
if that makes sense

3987
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,439
so

3988
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:35,439
you know

3989
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:37,680
even though handmade hero does have an

3990
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:39,200
eventual source code release component

3991
02:53:37,680 --> 02:53:42,159
to it

3992
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:43,840
it's also even though i wasn't

3993
02:53:42,159 --> 02:53:45,920
as concerned about source open source

3994
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:47,120
then i still did think that it being

3995
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:50,760
open source was not appropriate so

3996
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:50,760
that's why i didn't do that

3997
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:57,520
but yeah but like i said the the the

3998
02:53:56,079 --> 02:53:58,959
degree to which someone else can profit

3999
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:01,200
off of handmade heroes source code is

4000
02:53:58,959 --> 02:54:04,639
very low anyway so it's not really it's

4001
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:07,520
not a problem compared to something like

4002
02:54:04,639 --> 02:54:10,239
you know uh

4003
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:12,079
open ssl or something right like

4004
02:54:10,239 --> 02:54:13,439
whatever things are that are like you

4005
02:54:12,079 --> 02:54:17,478
know if you're working in that kind of

4006
02:54:13,439 --> 02:54:17,479
space you know what i mean

4007
02:54:21,279 --> 02:54:27,600
uh arkandos there's generally uh the

4008
02:54:24,879 --> 02:54:30,000
the general rule for

4009
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:31,680
stuff like that is it depends on the

4010
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:33,520
license sometimes but in general

4011
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:34,639
restraint of trade laws basically says

4012
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:37,040
that like

4013
02:54:34,639 --> 02:54:38,000
people can't control your learning per

4014
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:40,080
se

4015
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:41,680
so like if you're not literally copying

4016
02:54:40,079 --> 02:54:43,359
code from one place to another you're

4017
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:44,479
usually okay

4018
02:54:43,359 --> 02:54:45,840
right

4019
02:54:44,478 --> 02:54:47,519
um

4020
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:49,520
restraint of trade laws basically say

4021
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:51,279
that you know stuff that you learn while

4022
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:53,920
you're working on something

4023
02:54:51,279 --> 02:54:55,359
you know absent very specific language

4024
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:58,239
barring you from

4025
02:54:55,359 --> 02:54:59,600
employing that education elsewhere

4026
02:54:58,239 --> 02:55:01,680
um

4027
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:02,800
you're really not liable

4028
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:04,800
for

4029
02:55:02,799 --> 02:55:06,719
you know copyright infringement or

4030
02:55:04,799 --> 02:55:09,039
whatever it might be

4031
02:55:06,719 --> 02:55:10,959
uh so long as what you were doing was

4032
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:12,479
you learned something and then you you

4033
02:55:10,959 --> 02:55:14,879
know repeated that learning somewhere

4034
02:55:12,478 --> 02:55:18,799
else legitimately right you weren't just

4035
02:55:14,879 --> 02:55:18,799
making an excuse you know what i mean

4036
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:22,000
are you using any open source code in

4037
02:55:20,239 --> 02:55:25,439
your private card no we use literally

4038
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,719
zero open source code currently

4039
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:28,479
um

4040
02:55:26,719 --> 02:55:31,840
i was thinking of using bear ssl and

4041
02:55:28,478 --> 02:55:33,840
maybe at some point i might use bear ssl

4042
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:36,239
in something but it turned out we ended

4043
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:36,239
up not

4044
02:55:36,318 --> 02:55:40,680
no we do not use shawn's libraries

4045
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:55,840
uh currently no we don't use opengl

4046
02:55:54,478 --> 02:55:58,959
um

4047
02:55:55,840 --> 02:56:00,799
but opengl also isn't open source

4048
02:55:58,959 --> 02:56:01,679
right

4049
02:56:00,799 --> 02:56:04,959
so

4050
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:09,398
like the degree if you use opengl on

4051
02:56:04,959 --> 02:56:09,398
windows you're using closed source

4052
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:19,478
no we don't use stb for fonts

4053
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:19,479
i have my own font stuff

4054
02:56:32,079 --> 02:56:37,039
opengl also isn't an open spec

4055
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:38,160
it is neither open source nor an open

4056
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:40,880
spec

4057
02:56:38,159 --> 02:56:44,000
opengl has a lot of

4058
02:56:40,879 --> 02:56:45,199
very like contractual restriction things

4059
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:47,680
there's

4060
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:48,800
opengl is its own whole thing

4061
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:52,920
it doesn't matter anyway because you

4062
02:56:48,799 --> 02:56:52,920
don't really need to use it anymore but

4063
02:56:59,439 --> 02:57:02,159
so basically it's fine if i learn from

4064
02:57:00,959 --> 02:57:03,438
your stream then close the stream and

4065
02:57:02,159 --> 02:57:04,959
implement something like you for example

4066
02:57:03,439 --> 02:57:06,559
downloading architecture but if i say

4067
02:57:04,959 --> 02:57:09,039
yeah i mean that's generally the idea

4068
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:10,478
right is that like education you can't

4069
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:11,600
really like

4070
02:57:10,478 --> 02:57:14,000
stop

4071
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:15,600
and you know there's obvious good

4072
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:18,398
reasons for that right like you know

4073
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:19,600
otherwise there it would just be too

4074
02:57:18,398 --> 02:57:22,079
difficult

4075
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:23,920
to police if people could claim that you

4076
02:57:22,079 --> 02:57:25,760
like learned to do something from them

4077
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:28,079
and you weren't like allowed to do that

4078
02:57:25,760 --> 02:57:30,239
or whatever right it's pretty tough

4079
02:57:28,079 --> 02:57:31,600
so generally speaking the law tends to

4080
02:57:30,239 --> 02:57:33,039
expect that like

4081
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:34,239
look if you don't want someone to learn

4082
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:36,399
how to do something then you have to

4083
02:57:34,239 --> 02:57:38,398
keep it secret or you have to sign an

4084
02:57:36,398 --> 02:57:40,398
agreement with them that they won't go

4085
02:57:38,398 --> 02:57:41,599
do something like if if it was like some

4086
02:57:40,398 --> 02:57:43,760
kind of thing where like you know you

4087
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:45,600
were working with me specifically and we

4088
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:47,520
basically had a non-compete agreement

4089
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:49,359
that like for five years afterwards you

4090
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:52,000
couldn't go work on games or something

4091
02:57:49,359 --> 02:57:53,359
right so so that's tends to be more how

4092
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:55,600
those things are

4093
02:57:53,359 --> 02:57:58,159
in general you don't have you know

4094
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:59,520
protection for things

4095
02:57:58,159 --> 02:58:01,279
um

4096
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:03,040
like learning if someone learns to do

4097
02:58:01,279 --> 02:58:04,720
something and they weren't copying you

4098
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:06,560
they were just they learned to do stuff

4099
02:58:04,719 --> 02:58:08,559
and then they went and wrote their own

4100
02:58:06,559 --> 02:58:10,478
that's you know that's not considered

4101
02:58:08,559 --> 02:58:12,719
copyright infringement

4102
02:58:10,478 --> 02:58:14,799
um

4103
02:58:12,719 --> 02:58:16,318
right it can be patent infringement

4104
02:58:14,799 --> 02:58:17,599
certainly because if things are patented

4105
02:58:16,318 --> 02:58:18,559
then they're patented and there is no

4106
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:20,239
defense

4107
02:58:18,559 --> 02:58:21,359
you just if you did the same thing then

4108
02:58:20,239 --> 02:58:22,478
you're liable

4109
02:58:21,359 --> 02:58:23,760
it's one of the reasons i don't like

4110
02:58:22,478 --> 02:58:27,438
patents because

4111
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:27,439
that just seems too much but

4112
02:58:31,680 --> 02:58:34,720
um there are a lot of practical

4113
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:36,960
drawbacks to opengl it's not as well

4114
02:58:34,719 --> 02:58:39,679
supported on windows it doesn't have as

4115
02:58:36,959 --> 02:58:41,358
good of like um

4116
02:58:39,680 --> 02:58:42,880
just general operating system support

4117
02:58:41,359 --> 02:58:45,120
for it uh like things like

4118
02:58:42,879 --> 02:58:46,959
multi-threading are harder etc etc so

4119
02:58:45,120 --> 02:58:49,200
you know for a very simple game like av

4120
02:58:46,959 --> 02:58:51,119
racer isn't asking a whole lot

4121
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:53,600
um of the graphics subsystem so it's

4122
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:55,600
totally fine but as you want to do more

4123
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:59,000
complex stuff you probably really don't

4124
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:59,000
want to use opengl

4125
02:59:06,799 --> 02:59:09,438
how to calculate how much to go to open

4126
02:59:08,159 --> 02:59:11,279
source project if i make profits in

4127
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:12,960
percent let's say i mean we can't right

4128
02:59:11,279 --> 02:59:14,399
now that's kind of the point is there

4129
02:59:12,959 --> 02:59:15,759
like currently the answer is zero

4130
02:59:14,398 --> 02:59:16,719
percent you don't have to give anything

4131
02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:18,398
to them

4132
02:59:16,719 --> 02:59:20,799
um and i think that's just a very bad

4133
02:59:18,398 --> 02:59:22,478
economic model and so

4134
02:59:20,799 --> 02:59:24,079
you know it's not really up to you to

4135
02:59:22,478 --> 02:59:25,760
figure that out it was up to the

4136
02:59:24,079 --> 02:59:28,879
industry to like come up with a less

4137
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:31,439
stupid model for how power and

4138
02:59:28,879 --> 02:59:33,039
uh money which are very intimately

4139
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:34,720
related right like money kind of is

4140
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:35,840
power in modern society to a large

4141
02:59:34,719 --> 02:59:36,139
extent

4142
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:37,439
um

4143
02:59:36,139 --> 02:59:39,599
[Music]

4144
02:59:37,439 --> 02:59:42,720
because money fundamentally is a thing

4145
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:46,399
that allows you to allocate resources

4146
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:47,599
and that's sort of what power is right

4147
02:59:46,398 --> 02:59:49,439
so it's really kind of up to the

4148
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:51,279
industry to fix it it's not up to you

4149
02:59:49,439 --> 02:59:52,880
it's not up to you to be charitable it's

4150
02:59:51,279 --> 02:59:54,479
up to the industry to

4151
02:59:52,879 --> 02:59:55,759
wake up and stop using this as a

4152
02:59:54,478 --> 02:59:58,559
fundamental model because it's

4153
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:58,559
completely broken

4154
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:03,439
so

4155
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:05,760
um

4156
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:12,800
and that's uh that's that

4157
03:00:18,079 --> 03:00:22,959
let's see what's going on

4158
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:22,960
in raid land
