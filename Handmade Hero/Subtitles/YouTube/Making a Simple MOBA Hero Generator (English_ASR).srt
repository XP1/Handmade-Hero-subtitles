00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,588
hello everyone welcome to handmade hero

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,339
sure--we code a complete game live on

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:11,449
stream we here at handmade hero have

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:15,929
been informed by none other than

5
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:19,169
Jonathan Blow himself that Valve has

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,269
announced new heroes for dota and as you

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,640
know you can never have too many heroes

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:29,480
for dota apparently dota just got two

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:33,689
new heroes a void spirit I'm told and

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,689
something called Spitfire spin fire spin

11
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:40,259
fire snap fire and something called snap

12
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:42,628
fire I don't know what how many heroes

13
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:44,128
that brings it to but what I can tell

14
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,609
you is I'm sure it's not enough so I

15
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:49,259
feel like today on handmade hero what we

16
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,289
should really be doing what we should

17
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:55,349
really be focusing on instead of

18
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:58,739
programming our game is generating new

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,890
heroes for dota and so what I'd like to

20
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:03,919
do is just go through here and just make

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,540
a simple command-line utility we can run

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:14,490
anytime we need a new dota hero and that

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,920
way you know anytime valve needs to add

24
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:20,099
Heroes to their game they'll be able to

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,118
do it so let's just start with the

26
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:26,640
basics here I'll do the simplest

27
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:28,170
possible thing so I'm gonna go into the

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,719
handmade directory and I'm gonna make

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,140
like a dota directory here and we just

30
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,239
need a simple really simple program that

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,719
can get us started right something that

32
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,989
just prints stuff out and so if we go to

33
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,789
the like for example in our code

34
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,938
directory you know we have utilities

35
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,500
like this like we have a little HHA edit

36
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:51,688
and we have like a build that does that

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,700
so I should be able to just do something

38
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:56,728
effectively similar to that so I'm gonna

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,879
do a copy from our code directory of the

40
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:03,000
build that back into this dota directory

41
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:05,489
here just to make a little oops sorry

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,688
we're gonna I have that alias time I

43
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,549
work machine so I'm used to being able

44
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,008
to hide CP whether I'm on Linux or

45
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,620
Windows and so we just need to take this

46
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,958
build up at and

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,780
and make it so that it just builds this

48
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,789
one utility that we're going to want all

49
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,590
right so we'll start there and we'll

50
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,419
move out from there so I'm gonna load up

51
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,158
for a coder and what I'm gonna do here

52
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,628
is I'm just gonna load this build that

53
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:29,759
bad there's way too much stuff in here

54
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,348
we don't need most of this so all I'm

55
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:35,039
gonna do is just take I'm just gonna

56
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:36,750
grab a single build line oops I don't

57
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,310
really I want to get rid of those I'm

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,870
just gonna grab a single build line for

59
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,459
building one of these command line

60
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,409
utilities and we're just gonna use that

61
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,930
and in fact we really don't need most of

62
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,519
these compiler commands either but you

63
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,780
know for now I guess well we'll leave it

64
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,700
at that okay so let's see we've got the

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,150
HHA edit is probably the closest thing

66
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,878
or the HH fonts maybe maybe the HH edit

67
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,250
right so we really just want this is all

68
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,408
we really want you know what I mean

69
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,719
so so this should pretty much do it and

70
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:11,608
we also don't really need to we can just

71
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,299
build it in this directory that seems

72
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,409
fine too

73
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,840
I mean we don't really need to build it

74
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:17,340
into the build directory you know what

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,900
actually we won't think about this why

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,889
don't I just build it in the handmade

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,450
here a directory begin with I don't know

78
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,099
let's leave it standalone just seems

79
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,449
better so a lot of this stuff we

80
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,259
probably don't need this stuff either

81
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:29,518
but you know we'll we'll trim this down

82
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:32,098
later to something a little bit more

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,480
standard so let's delete all of this so

84
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,969
really all we're gonna do here is just

85
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,619
have a single compiled line and what I

86
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:41,939
want to do is just make it so that it's

87
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:46,469
going to compile just this dodok erosion

88
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:49,530
dot cpp or something or maybe just DOTA

89
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:51,840
hero dot cpp and so that will get us

90
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,340
what we actually need i suppose again i

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,259
can just cut and paste the ones of these

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,930
and then i need so really I think we're

93
00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:00,149
really talking about something this

94
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,340
simple at the end of the day we'll just

95
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,659
do just a really basic compile and just

96
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,329
let it take care of everything for us

97
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,889
right that seems good so why even bother

98
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,919
to copy that I don't know that's because

99
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:13,250
like that's why it'll be fine so let's

100
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,379
go ahead and load that up doe to hero

101
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,019
dot cpp and this will just be a standard

102
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,978
like basic standard io like the

103
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,199
old-school way program here well we'll

104
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:27,389
just include who-knows-what from the C

105
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,990
runtime library god only knows what its

106
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,120
gonna do but you know what that's fine

107
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:37,278
and we'll just do it you know we'll do

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,360
it old school I'm still gonna want my

109
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,620
internal cure because I like to put

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,169
everything is internal but other than

111
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,329
that we'll keep keep things pretty

112
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:47,968
straightforward all right so when we

113
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:49,168
have our main function care I'm just

114
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:51,149
gonna return zero because it's always

115
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,859
gonna succeed when you ask for a random

116
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:55,620
dota hero you know I don't want it to

117
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,658
ever fail to make a new dota hero so

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,310
then that printf here I just want to say

119
00:04:57,658 --> 00:05:06,329
you know this is our like dota hero

120
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:11,728
generator and you know I don't know what

121
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:16,528
the version is version one point some

122
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:18,120
stuff a beta let's say and then what I

123
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:20,069
want to do is just I want to build this

124
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,899
thing right I'm gonna make a little

125
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,528
project file for it so that for coder

126
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:28,588
just knows that it's something we can

127
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:32,129
load and build so out here I believe

128
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:33,329
I've got the project file so we've got

129
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:35,009
the things on this machine I'm just

130
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:36,028
gonna add one for this so this is I

131
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,939
don't know what we're calling this but

132
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:41,278
we're just gonna call this dota hero

133
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:43,379
from for the moment I guess and we'll

134
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:48,838
get it asleep at that so that's handmade

135
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:52,229
dota and this will be like dude a 0 prj

136
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:54,300
and then that's it I think we just need

137
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:56,028
a project file and then it will manage

138
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,750
it for us and it'll it'll all be good

139
00:05:56,028 --> 00:06:00,509
again you don't really need to do that

140
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,639
part if you're not using for coder I'm

141
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,229
just doing that so I have it I can load

142
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,449
it quickly and switch to it quickly and

143
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:07,769
it'll automatically build it for me so I

144
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,259
don't have to like run it from the

145
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:13,258
command line and stuff like that ok so

146
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,718
if I do a dota he rode up here J that

147
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:19,110
just needs to tell it where that stuff

148
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:22,050
is and again that's just the same as

149
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,479
this handmade prj file like this thing

150
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,278
here and so again we don't really need

151
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,538
to give it any directories just say we

152
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,800
build out of this directory and load the

153
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:30,180
files from that directory and it'll

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,129
automatically load it all for us so now

155
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,860
we should be able to now anytime we want

156
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,330
to work on our dota generator in case we

157
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,370
don't make it as awesome as it could

158
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,740
possibly be today we should be able to

159
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,519
switch now build and it should in theory

160
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,000
build for

161
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:47,969
and off we go uh I don't know why it

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,769
says it there's a fatal Inc error there

163
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:55,349
what happened did I mess up the build

164
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:56,939
somehow oh is that that weird thing that

165
00:06:55,348 --> 00:07:02,550
happens with four coders sometimes where

166
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:04,589
you can't wear it if you have something

167
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,538
inside the build like if your product is

168
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:07,258
inside the bill directly did Alan ever

169
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:09,149
fix that

170
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,879
I don't know cuz I don't really do that

171
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:14,038
anymore but if that's the case I will

172
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,199
borrow something from the old build back

173
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:18,000
because I don't want to have that bug

174
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,560
that that's a really bad bug and as far

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,038
as I know it's never been fixed

176
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,819
it's Windows for some reason like Alan

177
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:29,038
was using the the windows directory

178
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,050
watch so he just opens the directory and

179
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,370
says watch this directory and he gets

180
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,560
notifications that's wave knows the

181
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,110
files changed apparently in Windows if

182
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,509
you do that sometimes it fate like

183
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,120
people can't open the file handle it was

184
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,139
really weird and I looked at the code

185
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,129
myself it didn't look like there's

186
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,560
anything wrong with it it just looks

187
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,849
like Windows does that and I I don't

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,000
know I've never had a chance to ask

189
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:54,209
someone on the windows team what's going

190
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,339
on there I have I have no idea what's

191
00:07:54,209 --> 00:08:01,918
going on there but it's pretty weird all

192
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:04,258
right so anyway that's fine we'll just

193
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,389
do it that way so now it should just

194
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:11,370
work and I think it does in here I'll

195
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:13,889
get rid of these and so now when we

196
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,930
build it builds into that handmade

197
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,218
directory I'm sorry the handmade build

198
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,528
directory and so we should be able to

199
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:21,329
run dota hero from there and it we

200
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:23,158
should get it now since we pretty much

201
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:25,680
just want to see what it generates for

202
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:27,839
us I'm gonna also in the batch file just

203
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,389
run it so in here I'm just gonna run

204
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,189
dota hero that eggsy right and that way

205
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:34,019
like when we run it it'll do it'll just

206
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,060
actually run it in there so we can just

207
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,208
build and see how our hero names are

208
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,769
going all right so that's good enough

209
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,869
for boilerplate we don't need anything

210
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,939
too fancy so what I want to do in here

211
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,519
is I'm just gonna run a little loop and

212
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,399
we're gonna generate some dota names

213
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,198
right so we're just gonna say look

214
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,778
there's a hero index I'm going to run

215
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:58,049
that to a hero account

216
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:01,259
for now we'll just hard code it to give

217
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:05,549
you let's say to hero names because

218
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,810
that's how many valve announces but

219
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,818
later on maybe we'll have it take an

220
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,229
argument where you can just say how many

221
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,789
key rows you want and that's how many

222
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,430
heroes you'll get because you know we're

223
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:16,188
a full-service institution here so what

224
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:19,679
we want to do here is we want to say

225
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:22,498
alright give us back a hero name please

226
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:26,698
and and and we'll go from there

227
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:28,110
so let's do that let's just do and I'm

228
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:29,969
not sure exactly how I want to do this

229
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,959
but I think the way I want to do it is

230
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,720
with a simple string with a simple

231
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:39,179
string concatenation stack so we'll

232
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:47,189
probably do something roughly along

233
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:52,979
these lines we'll just do care star get

234
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:55,078
0 name and for right now you literally

235
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,129
just call that so we'll say hero name

236
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,778
equals get here our name and then we

237
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:06,000
want to print it out so we'll say like

238
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:07,980
you know here's the first hero name like

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,470
so and normally I don't really like this

240
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,300
kind of string I'm a counted string kind

241
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,009
of person but because we're doing this

242
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,708
as a standalone utility that uses the C

243
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:18,509
runtime library I'm just gonna go with

244
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,239
the fact that we'll we'll use the

245
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:23,519
null-terminated strings because it's

246
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,480
unfortunately just they built that

247
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,480
assumption into everything

248
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:35,969
sadly all right so if we assume here

249
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,389
that we just say well the hero name at

250
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,620
the at the start we're not gonna do

251
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,028
actually generate a name we're just

252
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,100
gonna say that the hero name is like

253
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:46,528
void spirit or whatever it is right so

254
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,889
now what should happen tubes that's not

255
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:52,068
what we wanted it all there what just

256
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:54,839
happened there

257
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:57,448
can I type something stupid in we got

258
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,509
back our void spirit name we returned it

259
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:02,088
oops yes we did hero in this gotta love

260
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,649
those see print oh there we go

261
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,029
so that'll print out void spirit for its

262
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:07,799
spirit which is you know not

263
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:08,159
particularly useful so now we need to do

264
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,750
is we

265
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,009
to find a way to generate these and

266
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,360
we're just gonna do some simple stuff to

267
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,139
generate them and the first thing I want

268
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,490
to do is we want mmm now if we just want

269
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,318
to generate something random that'd be

270
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,980
one thing but we want to do is we want

271
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:26,729
to generate heroes that sound right that

272
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,129
sound like these these dota heroes right

273
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:33,449
so what I want to do first is I want to

274
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:36,680
like grab all of these words in here and

275
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:39,269
I want to start breaking them apart so

276
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,099
ideally I would like a list I can cut

277
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,990
and paste and the problem here is I

278
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,909
don't know if that's actually doing it

279
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,688
so I was kind of hoping I could find

280
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:50,399
some sort of a list that would be like

281
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:52,679
just cut and paste a bolt you know and

282
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,539
I'm saying um and I'm not sure it looks

283
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,769
like this might do the trick

284
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:01,828
like if we just kind of grab that like

285
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,509
this I'm thinking maybe that would help

286
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:05,489
and let me just see what that ends up

287
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:08,310
being if I paste it yeah yeah yeah so

288
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:11,370
that seems pretty good so if I just go

289
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:15,119
ahead and paste that in here right what

290
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:18,589
I want to do is take all of these pieces

291
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,899
right and I want to break them up into

292
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:25,740
into chunks that I can recombine and

293
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:28,078
make more of right so let's just quickly

294
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,129
take a look at the well quickly I mean

295
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,528
there's a lot of them here so and I'm

296
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:35,578
gonna be that quick but all I want to do

297
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:37,289
is start to look at these and feel okay

298
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,909
yeah Warriner I'm just just trying to

299
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:42,000
get a feel for what's going on here

300
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:43,889
looks like chaos and I doom dragon is

301
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,269
that what or is it doom and Dragon

302
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,938
what's the okay I don't even know that

303
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:53,750
spaces didn't get doom and dragonknight

304
00:12:47,938 --> 00:13:02,099
okay there we go or a spirit or shaker

305
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:03,269
elder titan husker io Cooney cuca is it

306
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,980
just me or does that sound like some

307
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:06,959
kind of like a weird racial slur that

308
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,170
would be you know cancelled by now but I

309
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:14,068
don't know whatever a kunkka is I let's

310
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:17,338
see what else we got Magnus Mars those

311
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:19,740
are probably just single words right I'm

312
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,250
gonna go ahead and guess yeah and then

313
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,720
Night Stalker

314
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:30,610

317
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:44,948
spend tidehunter timbersaw tiny treant

318
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:47,588
protector or just Trent Trent protect or

319
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:50,409
what's a Trent I don't know but I guess

320
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:57,939
it needs protecting tusk underlord

321
00:13:50,409 --> 00:14:00,429
undying wraith king okay so those are

322
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:09,328
the first sets of heroes there then

323
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:09,328
we've got let's see and time age oops

324
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:14,828

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,949
shadow and fiend as two separate heroes

338
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,490

361
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:13,740
outward devourer puck pugna queen of

00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:23,308

silencer gaia wrath mage storm spirit

Windrunner winter wyvern witch doctor

366
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:44,769
and zeus holy cow okay so now what I

367
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:47,379
want to do is we want to take a look and

368
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:48,009
see if we can broadly categorize these

369
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,480
name

370
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:51,759
I'm just gonna open up the same file but

371
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,710
in a different window here I want to try

372
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:59,440
and broadly categorize these names into

373
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:04,559
types like basically like patterns that

374
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:07,420
occur frequently in the like in the dota

375
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,450
naming convention so that we can obey

376
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,070
those names right and I'm gonna be

377
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,039
breaking apart these lists so what I

378
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:17,529
want to do first is I want to just make

379
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm gonna make a separate file here for

380
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:21,819
these and just put them all in there as

381
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,680
strings probably and the reason I want

382
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:26,379
to do that is because when we're

383
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,840
generating names we may generate a dota

384
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,450
name that already exists like we may

385
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,709
generate Beastmaster and if we do we

386
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,730
don't want to print that out because the

387
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,710
point is this is supposed to generate

388
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,470
new dota heroes not ones that already

389
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,210
exists so what I want to do is I want to

390
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,450
make a file

391
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:46,329
I suppose in here and maybe we'll even

392
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,309
make this be a file that we load and so

393
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:51,149
in our dota directory I want to make a

394
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:54,190
like some kind of a text file like

395
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:57,070
existing heroes dot txt or something

396
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,740
like this and that existing Curos file

397
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:02,769
will have all of the current heroes in

398
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,920
it and we'll leave them there right and

399
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:08,319
that way we can load this file in and we

400
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,830
can load all of these heroes and then if

401
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:15,069
we accidentally will we'll use that list

402
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:16,569
to compare against to make sure that

403
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:20,589
we're not going to print out a hero name

404
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:24,490
that already exists right so let's just

405
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:26,019
do that as the first thing and then I'll

406
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,180
show you what we're gonna do for for

407
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:29,799
categorizing these so the way I'm going

408
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,570
to test this and we want to be able to

409
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,859
load these lists in and I want ways to

410
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:34,059
load these lists and easily because

411
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:36,639
we're probably going to use these lists

412
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:38,649
for lots of things right but what I want

413
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,720
to do here is let's just do this where

414
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:48,550
we say okay when you call get hero name

415
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:52,799
there's a little switch right and we

416
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,799
just say if switch equals zero

417
00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:02,799
or actually let's do it equals one I'm

418
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,690
just gonna do a real simple thing here

419
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,720
where we say like okay when we get back

420
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:10,710
to this avoid this result here we're

421
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,509
gonna return on the second time through

422
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,850
dazzle mansur which is our one of our

423
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,740
new heroes or whatever and so what I

424
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:20,559
want to do now is make it so that when

425
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,930
we actually print this out you can see

426
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,099
like one of our things is void spirit

427
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,390
which is a new here actually we got an

428
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,549
ad that it I don't think that was added

429
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,780
in here was it so we need void spirit

430
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:32,470
and what was the other one

431
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:35,769
snap fire right okay so now that we have

432
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,390
a list of all those dota heroes what I

433
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:40,059
want to do now is make it so that we

434
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,950
won't print out void spirit so the first

435
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:43,539
time we call this we get void spirit the

436
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,460
next time we call get dazzle mansur and

437
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,409
we'll keep getting taoism answer so just

438
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,990
to test to make sure that we will have a

439
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:53,410
hard gate against ever printing out a

440
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,049
dota hero that actually exists I'm gonna

441
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,480
do that test okay so what we need here

442
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,970
is a way to load file lists in base like

443
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,140
lists of things so I'm gonna make like a

444
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:08,819
string list thing and all this is gonna

445
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:11,170
be is just a giant set of strings right

446
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:14,589
it's just gonna be a thing that has like

447
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:20,170
tons of strings in it and that's all it

448
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:22,059
is right so again C really doesn't have

449
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,500
great ways of doing this stuff but

450
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:26,200
that's okay this is a quick and dirty

451
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,599
utility I don't mind doing it crap away

452
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,240
right so anyway I'm just gonna have in

453
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,339
here a string count and then I'm gonna

454
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,440
have a pointer to a pointer which is the

455
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:36,819
strings and that way we can just say

456
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,950
that we have some way of loading one of

457
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:41,079
these things and we load it and then we

458
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:45,279
know that we can pick random things out

459
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:47,529
of it and those random things will you

460
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,799
know then be accessible to us so we can

461
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:52,180
we can check so if I want to make sure

462
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:56,379
that one of the hero names that comes

463
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,090
back is not going to be one of the ones

464
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,370
that's in the existing dota list I would

465
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:03,909
need some way of doing that so I would

466
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:06,309
need like you know existing heroes

467
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,350
equals load string list and I would need

468
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,730
to say

469
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:13,859
in whatever that that list is there and

470
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,558
in the build-up bat you can notice this

471
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:18,449
really needs to be run in our actual

472
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:23,579
data directory so we kind of want this

473
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,169
to do this sort of thing right we want

474
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:27,659
it to to come back to the main directory

475
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:30,330
and then run it so it'll have access to

476
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,519
its data files so the existing Kiros

477
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:35,788
text file we want to load that in and

478
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:37,859
then what we want to do is every time we

479
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:40,279
get one of these heroes back we want to

480
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:42,629
say if we want to do an if here right

481
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,418
technically I think I guess we want to

482
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,770
do this as a while but either way we'll

483
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:56,150
we'll figure that out it's like in fact

484
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:59,099
I can do it this way I guess like that

485
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,500
so basically we will just try to

486
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:02,730
generate these heroes and when we get

487
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,250
ones that already matched we'll skip

488
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,829
those we just won't print them out right

489
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:10,829
so I just want to say if string exists

490
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:13,230
in so I can just say take this existing

491
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:14,819
heroes list I don't really need the

492
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:16,500
address so if I can just do it like that

493
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:19,319
actually I could pass it it's by value

494
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,450
because it only has two things in it see

495
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:23,849
if this string that we get back exists

496
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,490
then I don't want to print it out right

497
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:28,500
like that would be bad so we want to

498
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,000
basically do that say if it doesn't

499
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,308
exist then we print it if it does exist

500
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,740
we skip it and this needs to be

501
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:36,750
something Curia that just returns you

502
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,788
know to or true or false I guess I'll

503
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,140
use the regular pool here just because

504
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:42,240
this is the seal of runtime library

505
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,788
program so I should probably stick with

506
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,960
their convention and not go outside of

507
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:48,750
it since we're not in the hand made hero

508
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:53,519
code base at the moment um so there's

509
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:55,048
our string list here's our string and so

510
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,548
all we need to do here is just loop over

511
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:57,869
these now again if we were worried about

512
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:59,400
performance we would want to do

513
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,889
something clever here like a hash table

514
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,990
ER thing we're not we've got so much

515
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,759
compute power to spare this is not going

516
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,880
to be an issue so we're totally fine to

517
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,980
skip that for now all right so we look

518
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,659
at the string index we just loop over we

519
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,819
know exactly how many we have because

520
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:18,480
the count is right it was right there

521
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:19,500
I may just call that just straight up

522
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,028
count because you're not gonna be

523
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,519
anything else in here

524
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:25,199
so it should just be back so we're just

525
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,719
gonna loop over each of these and we'll

526
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:30,239
basically say the results equals false

527
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:32,429
and we'll assume that we don't find it

528
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:38,459
then if we do we'll say result equals

529
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:41,788
true and break so we'll say if strings

530
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:43,709
are equal and I guess I could use stir

531
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:45,179
comp here I tend to not to like to do it

532
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:47,399
because it's kind of a weird function

533
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,379
but I'll use it for now and we'll see I

534
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:51,418
might decide not to later and pull that

535
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:53,428
out so in here we've got lists of

536
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:56,219
strings we've got our index so that's

537
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:58,079
our string comp right there and that

538
00:24:56,219 --> 00:25:00,689
that'll prevent us you know the equals

539
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:01,918
zero is when it actually matches which

540
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:03,359
is kind of confusing but that's how

541
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,159
string comp arcs it was made for doing

542
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:06,749
ternary compares so you do less than or

543
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,539
greater than depending on the order

544
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:11,219
that's so you can use it for sorting so

545
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,229
anyway now what we need is a way to load

546
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:20,159
these things up the trouble with loading

547
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:21,359
them for us is the size limitation we

548
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,589
don't know how many there are going to

549
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:28,499
be until we actually until we actually

550
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:30,958
spin through the entire file so we can

551
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:33,838
make a dynamically growing set here or

552
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:35,818
who knows what we can do it depends but

553
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:38,698
I'll figure something out on the fly so

554
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:40,318
here's our load string list function and

555
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:42,149
here is the file name so that's where

556
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:44,459
you want to do it what I want to do here

557
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:46,378
is I just want to get the file open and

558
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:49,318
in this case we're gonna read it as non

559
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:51,208
binary so we want to read the file as a

560
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:53,188
text file because we're that is what it

561
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:56,339
actually is so we're gonna say all right

562
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:58,439
let's get this file in here let's loop

563
00:25:56,338 --> 00:26:00,298
through all the lines if we can't get it

564
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:03,058
I'll just print a simple diagnostic

565
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,378
message I'll f print F to standard error

566
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:06,828
just in case those are getting routed

567
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:10,128
separately but I'll just say cannot open

568
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:10,128
this file

569
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:16,720
so that's just a thing that you know

570
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,069
we're printing out as a courtesy in case

571
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,480
one of the files is missing in the

572
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:21,759
future and we're just why isn't it

573
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,920
working right and that's why so the

574
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,390
string list will still work the program

575
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,970
will run but there won't be anything in

576
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,530
it and that won't obviously be good but

577
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,600
so what I probably would want to do here

578
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:34,119
also I suppose is fill it out with one

579
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:37,839
thing so maybe I'll do the count here

580
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:40,089
equals one and the strings list here is

581
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,639
like the error string set or something

582
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,859
like that and so I'm just gonna make a

583
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:52,360
little thing here which is like error

584
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:55,179
string set like this maybe so that way

585
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,589
if anyone if we didn't have a required

586
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,539
file it would just print out error

587
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:59,949
everywhere just so you could see and the

588
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:01,599
rest of them wouldn't like divide by

589
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,580
zero and craft because we might divide

590
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,139
by this number at some point and so I

591
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:09,609
don't want to ever actually have there

592
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:15,670
be a zero there in fact I might even go

593
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:17,439
so far as to say do this so that's

594
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,990
always you know they're always valid

595
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,390
right so there always has to be one

596
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,430
there if that makes sense and we could

597
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,570
also Pat it we could do that so it just

598
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,039
wouldn't put anything out I don't know

599
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:29,259
how we might do it but well we'll figure

600
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,819
it out so anyway that's all good and

601
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:33,369
what we need now is some way of actually

602
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:35,200
F reading these lines so I'm gonna just

603
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:38,709
do total cheese here again cuz I don't

604
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,720
care so we're just gonna do an F gets an

605
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,009
F gets again for those of you unfamiliar

606
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,660
with because we don't use the runtime

607
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,029
library on handmade here oh but if you

608
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,340
don't know what it is you can look it up

609
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:50,529
here it's pretty straightforward all

610
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:54,189
it's going to do is it's going to give

611
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:56,680
us a line of the file that's that's all

612
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,180
it's going to do right and so we just

613
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,890
want to read these a line at a time so

614
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,930
when we do this F gets here you have a

615
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,930
string a number in a stream write the

616
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,960
number is just how big the the buffer is

617
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:10,450
so it's literally just like this right

618
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,460
and then the stream is just where it's

619
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,170
coming from and then we put it in there

620
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,380
right so each time we read one of these

621
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:20,440
things out we're good we're gonna sort

622
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,800
of get the the next string in the file

623
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,910
and then for each one of these it should

624
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:29,509
tell us I think

625
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,509
[Music]

626
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:35,390
so there's an e off f e off will be set

627
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:37,129
what it gets to the end so in here we

628
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,610
can just do a while loop right we can

629
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,500
just do like while what does this return

630
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:43,729
an ons are going to turn the case of the

631
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,779
end of file indicator set the string of

632
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:50,630
set so we want wall it's not f ef we're

633
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:52,579
just gonna read we're just gonna read

634
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,050
lines from the file and then when we're

635
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:56,000
done we close the file and call it a day

636
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,649
right and that's it

637
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,960
so I think that's all we really need

638
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,850
there and then we have to figure out a

639
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,860
way to actually store these and that's

640
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:07,490
how we'll get data into our program so

641
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:10,909
where's our errors here syntax error

642
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,799
oh hold on one second there is one thing

643
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,580
I would like to do there's a thing that

644
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,440
prints like full path names in here

645
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:22,250
isn't there I don't remember exactly

646
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,580
what it is and call them Diagnostics I

647
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,319
want those

648
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:29,509
let's get those let's get those in here

649
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:32,659
and debug and stuff like that so I would

650
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:39,019
like to have this stuff probably there

651
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:41,630
we go so anyway what is the complaint

652
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:43,490
here we've got a care star arrow string

653
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,620
shouldn't that what's wrong with the oh

654
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,089
that's that's all just a semicolon look

655
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:50,000
that looks fine but the semicolon

656
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:52,189
doesn't alright so now what we need to

657
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,410
do is actually put something in here

658
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,269
besides this and so as we read these

659
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,769
things in what we need to do is we need

660
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,240
to figure out how many there are so

661
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:01,400
here's one thing we could do we could

662
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,870
just count and read a second time it's

663
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,179
the other thing we could do if we wanted

664
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:08,419
to in fact let's just do that like why

665
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:10,280
not right that seems pretty

666
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,390
straightforward actually so what we

667
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:18,160
could do is just say alright like hey

668
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,160
we'll just do this

669
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:34,490
that's how many we have I guess

670
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:36,500
seems reasonable go back to the

671
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:38,120
beginning I'm playing it pretty fast and

672
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,640
loose here folks and I apologize that's

673
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:43,699
just the way it is I guess uh I don't

674
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,220
know if if that's clear that that Effie

675
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,259
off there so we'll take a look at that a

676
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,850
second but maybe we just do it this way

677
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:51,710
count the strings allocate the memory

678
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:53,179
fill them in I could use it dining

679
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,400
everything growing array but I don't

680
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,410
know why bother I don't think I care so

681
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,870
this seems fine so what I could do here

682
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,430
is just say all right we then know how

683
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:04,519
many there are so the count equals the

684
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,049
expected count now or actually I guess

685
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,000
they're I still want the count equals

686
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:11,569
zero and every time we read it maybe

687
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,460
I'll do a result count plus plus there

688
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:18,980
so we'll do strings result count plus

689
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,630
plus equals malloc however big the

690
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:35,480
string is and then we'll copy it in

691
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:36,770
write something like that so this would

692
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,630
basically just say look I'm going to get

693
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,279
the address of the pointer that we're

694
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:47,450
putting this one into we're going to

695
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:55,279
malloc some memory for the string and

696
00:31:47,450 --> 00:32:00,519
then we're just going to copy I think we

697
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,519
can actually do this right I think

698
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:11,519
this is actually a size key not up so

699
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:12,629
this would read one in it would tell us

700
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,230
how big it is

701
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:18,599
we would then allocate space for it and

702
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,278
copy it in I assume that would be fine I

703
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,509
don't really know but again I don't

704
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:22,859
really care and I don't care if there's

705
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:24,149
bugs in this program it's just made to

706
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,528
generate dota heroes it's not

707
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:27,418
mission-critical I would never use any

708
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:29,489
of these functions if it was so that

709
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:37,679
should be fine so let's just copy it in

710
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:40,710
there like so and that should give us

711
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,259
our strings hopefully right but again I

712
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,700
don't actually know we also need to do

713
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,980
that but I also don't actually know

714
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,239
about that effie off so we've got some

715
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,618
stuff we have to do there oh and one

716
00:32:48,239 --> 00:33:00,808
other thing obviously I need to actually

717
00:32:49,618 --> 00:33:03,888
allocate our string array so I need to

718
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:07,378
allocate space to store those strings

719
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:09,329
that's about it yeah okay

720
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:11,939
so let's actually go to bug this and get

721
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:14,128
this working and then we should be often

722
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,389
and running with every with all the

723
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:16,918
basic stuff we need we need a

724
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:22,168
concatenate er but that's about it

725
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:23,460
uh so let's see dota he rode eggsy let's

726
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,350
load it up in remedy I should have

727
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,940
updated my remedy oh wait I did update

728
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:30,418
my room buddy and what a what a good boy

729
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:34,470
am i let's make sure that we run it

730
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:37,859
however in the W hand-made dota

731
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:40,679
directory let's step in there let's try

732
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:45,079
to load the string list let's see how

733
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:51,480
many it thinks are there spected counts

734
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:54,329
121 okay if the memory see what we get

735
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,159
in our buffer that's exactly what we

736
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:57,689
want

737
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:00,450
biggest the buffer it's eight long

738
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,830
that's exactly what one two three four

739
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:09,030
thousand eight yep that's as F what we

740
00:34:01,829 --> 00:34:11,219
want - that looks good everything looks

741
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,929
good here let's see what happens when

742
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,418
we're done I just want to take a look

743
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,800
now at the result and see if this looks

744
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,099
right it should be 121 and

745
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,380
these should be like some strings I

746
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:26,339
don't know why we're seeing that period

747
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,610
there one two three four five six seven

748
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,590
eight

749
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:34,769
oh the I know why it's gonna include

750
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:41,010
that backslash n so I think we probably

751
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:43,199
want to trim that so like I think we

752
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,630
probably want to do something like like

753
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,879
do the null termination ourselves so

754
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,220
when we after we do this mem copy I'm

755
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,679
just gonna trim that back so I'm gonna

756
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:56,579
get rid of those backslash ends there if

757
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,829
that makes sense so yeah I don't know

758
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:02,190
exactly I want to do that but maybe what

759
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:05,599
I'll do is just something like this this

760
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,599
is kind of wasteful but

761
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:30,140
I may even do this right here and so all

762
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:32,869
I'm doing here is just getting rid of

763
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:35,420
anything that I think is gonna come in

764
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:37,309
as part of that F read that I don't

765
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,740
really want right I don't want those in

766
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:43,639
there so I'm just gonna like clean that

767
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:45,500
buffer out first and you can see that

768
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:47,029
now it's actually working so now we're

769
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,829
preventing void spirit from coming

770
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:53,090
through and we're loading our string

771
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:55,279
lists properly right okay so step two

772
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:58,760
now we have to actually do the real work

773
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,480
here that was just basic stuff no no big

774
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,760
deal there but what we need to do here

775
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,780
now is we have to actually go through

776
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,210
and take like the the pieces of these

777
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,390
that look like they mean something like

778
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:18,920
that the ways that these happen to work

779
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:24,710
out we need to try and break them into

780
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:27,440
sort of component parts right and so the

781
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:32,510
first thing I want to do is let's focus

782
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:36,470
first on things that are two English

783
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:41,570
words welded together right so basically

784
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:44,239
like you're taking like a noun and a

785
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:48,950
verb and you're putting those two things

786
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:50,599
together right so because I see a lot of

787
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:54,500
that like I see a lot of that

788
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:59,869
Beastmaster brewmaster Nightstalker

789
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:03,110
you know bristleback war runner clock

790
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:05,750
well clockwork not really Earthshaker so

791
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:11,590
let's start by removing those hero names

792
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:16,179
and making those be in the generator as

793
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:19,309
ideas right so I'm going to call that

794
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:23,529
for for lack of a better term at the

795
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:27,829
outset I'm gonna call that like a

796
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,910
primary noun so we're gonna have a list

797
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,969
of these primary

798
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:38,299
nouns and the primary nouns are going to

799
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:41,449
come from specifically these sets so

800
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:45,050
like beasts and brew and I'm going to

801
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:47,269
separate the master part of that out so

802
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:49,039
meaning this will go into our secondary

803
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:50,480
list and we'll see how that goes I'm

804
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,559
going to make all of these the lower

805
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,940
case because well assuming the

806
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,719
capitalization will happen at the end

807
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,809
right

808
00:37:53,719 --> 00:38:05,059
so here's war and we'll separate runner

809
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:06,529
out to the bottom right I don't know if

810
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:09,340
a bristle is technically a now because I

811
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:12,080
but it is I guess the thing on a yeah

812
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:16,610
Clockwerk is a little bit more tricky

813
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,289
there because I'm not sure what I guess

814
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,210
that is sort of the same so I'm gonna

815
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:22,039
I'm gonna treat it this way for now if

816
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,720
we have to pull it and do something a

817
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:25,789
little bit more fancy there and later

818
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:31,209
maybe we will but we'll just leave it

819
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:34,400
that way for now right um so again just

820
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:37,960
just break these out really straight for

821
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,269
just scanning the list Omni Knight is

822
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,260
kind of a different kind of name so I'm

823
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:47,210
gonna skip that one

824
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:50,440
for now and and we'll look at look at it

825
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:50,440
a little bit more

826
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:02,769
let's see and I'm being kind of fast and

827
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,289
loose with these so it's not a

828
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:09,159
hard-and-fast English rule really it's

829
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:13,299
it's more of a kind of more of a general

830
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:15,129
sort of trend they're you know I'm just

831
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:30,998
trying to I'm it's sort of a loose

832
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:42,068
criteria that roughly works right all

833
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:44,318
right um what else we got gyrocopter I'm

834
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:45,969
gonna I'm gonna give that up I'm gonna

835
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:49,389
give that a pass because it sort of

836
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:59,789
seems like it could get in there into

837
00:39:49,389 --> 00:40:06,998
that set I'm gonna say those are as well

838
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:19,079
honestly just kind of clean that out

839
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:19,078
there Lancer as well not really

840
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:27,838
Mansur is already in there isn't it no

841
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,838
it's not

842
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,108
it's so crazy how many of these there

843
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,730
are that are this pattern though right I

844
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:37,259
mean you're seeing so many of them in

845
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,719
there

846
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,160
[Music]

847
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:44,919
not really

848
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:50,139
death profit probably if we're honest

849
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:54,730
about it it's pretty close it's pretty

850
00:40:50,139 --> 00:41:02,379
close right don't know about grim stroke

851
00:40:54,730 --> 00:41:13,679
that might be a bridge too far yeah I'm

852
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:13,680
gonna go with YES on that one and I

853
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:28,050
think we're almost done

854
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:32,350
I think we've got almost all of them

855
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:36,190
alright so our first way we can generate

856
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:38,170
a hero name is going to be by using

857
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:41,550
these two lists and that'll get us

858
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:45,400
started I'm gonna go ahead and open up

859
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:48,940
we have that primary noun file right so

860
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:54,360
there's there's primary noun up text and

861
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,360
I'm going to call this like secondary

862
00:41:54,449 --> 00:42:01,899
action maybe verb something like that

863
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:04,500
and we're gonna put those in here

864
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,500
right

865
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:12,329
I should double-check that we can have

866
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:15,789
that we don't add things to the list

867
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:30,429
that aren't actually don't have any

868
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:33,489
length so maybe something like this yeah

869
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:36,279
I'm saying let's just get that going all

870
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:39,819
right so now what I want to do is get

871
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:42,970
these lists up and loaded um I don't

872
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:44,530
think I care about global variables here

873
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:46,269
at all so I think I'm just going to make

874
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:49,630
all of these things accessible to

875
00:42:46,269 --> 00:43:10,469
everybody so I will probably just do

876
00:42:49,630 --> 00:43:14,789
this and everyone can have these alright

877
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:14,789
so we're just going to load these up

878
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:22,089
right at the beginning of the program

879
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:24,900
here and that way we'll have all the

880
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:28,829
stuff in there so we can have our

881
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:34,769
primary noun text oops

882
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:37,179
and our secondary verb text file right

883
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:40,869
those should get loaded

884
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:43,750
oops I didn't actually include that

885
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:46,269
string list structure before I started

886
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,829
actually using it let's fix that

887
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:50,469
and now we should be able to actually

888
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:52,630
generate some hero names so what we can

889
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:54,399
do first is we just need some way of

890
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,780
picking a random number and then we can

891
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,380
just pick a random one out of each of

892
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,910
those lists and put them together right

893
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,700
so what I want to do is I want to say

894
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:13,569
okay the result is going to simply be

895
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:18,759
equal to concatenation of two things

896
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:20,588
first I want to capitalize the first

897
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:28,239
letter

898
00:44:20,588 --> 00:44:32,048
right of a get primary noun and I guess

899
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:34,509
this is like just random from primary

900
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:36,400
noun something like that

901
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:41,739
so I want to capitalize the first letter

902
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:45,489
of it and then I want to confirm the

903
00:44:41,739 --> 00:44:47,889
secondary verb okay and that's the most

904
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:51,039
basic rule that I can have to generate

905
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:52,958
something new and so those are the

906
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,930
functions I need and hopefully they are

907
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:57,429
not particularly hard to implement and

908
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:58,929
again we don't care about memory or

909
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:00,998
anything here we're just in party mode

910
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:04,179
so everything is on the table and it's

911
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:06,548
fine so we've got concat and i want to

912
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:08,198
do like a care a care b thing where we

913
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:09,998
can cat and not concatenate two strings

914
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:13,989
together and the slowest stupidest

915
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:28,298
possible way again like really really

916
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:30,039
dumb here okay

917
00:45:28,298 --> 00:45:32,259
and so we're just gonna use Rand and

918
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:33,640
we're gonna mod with random acts I'm

919
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:35,259
gonna since I'm going to be calling Rand

920
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:37,298
a lot though I think what I do want to

921
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:38,739
do is have an actual function for it so

922
00:45:37,298 --> 00:45:40,298
that we can replace the seer and a bunch

923
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,338
of the C random number generators

924
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:43,538
absolute garbage so we may want to

925
00:45:42,338 --> 00:45:45,938
replace it with a real because this is

926
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:47,499
all about random generation right so we

927
00:45:45,938 --> 00:45:52,928
probably want to actually have a thing

928
00:45:47,498 --> 00:45:55,118
here that's like get random count or

929
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:56,979
something like that where you pass in

930
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,329
the counts and it gives you back a Rand

931
00:45:56,978 --> 00:46:00,328
mob bat right

932
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:11,440
just this and so when we do random from

933
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:14,288
list I just want to do like a get random

934
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,170
count on the list counts and that's the

935
00:46:14,289 --> 00:46:19,750
care star I'm going to return so the

936
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:22,180
result here is just list strings plus

937
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,480
that value and I return that result it

938
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:30,669
was sorry I can't see my head's in the

939
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:33,608
way there we go right to capitalize the

940
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,769
first thing I just need to do like if

941
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:38,500
star a so like if there is something in

942
00:46:35,768 --> 00:46:39,879
there I and we don't really need to do

943
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,900
this probably but I just need to do like

944
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:48,000
to upper so that that thing gets

945
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,000
capitalized right and that's it

946
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,900
maybe something like that we probably

947
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:54,429
could just do that because if it was 0

948
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,809
to upper wouldn't do anything so we

949
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:59,199
probably don't really need to check star

950
00:46:55,809 --> 00:47:01,089
a but you know I did anyway right so

951
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,469
here we do this result what I want to do

952
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:04,358
is I want to make it safe for you to

953
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:10,598
pass anything that you want in so I'm

954
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:16,808
going to do like if a and B we can cat

955
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:20,470
else if a we return a else if not we

956
00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:27,819
return b right and I think I guess

957
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:30,489
that's just this right and so all I want

958
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:33,219
to do here is just you know take these

959
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:36,068
two strings and I want to smoosh them

960
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:38,018
together right I don't know if stir cat

961
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:39,548
will do that for me but I only care cuz

962
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:42,250
it takes 10 seconds to write so it's

963
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:43,650
fine all I want to do here is just say

964
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:47,528
all right

965
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:56,108
Ln equals sterling a beeline equals

966
00:47:47,528 --> 00:48:00,568
sterling be result equals malloc Ailin

967
00:47:56,108 --> 00:48:06,460
plus Pilon plus a null terminator right

968
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:08,259
result Aylan plus feelin zero that puts

969
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,440
the null terminator in and then I'm just

970
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:15,250
going to mem copy these two right so we

971
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:19,079
basically got into our results in the

972
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:19,079
first part we're going to put a

973
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,019
and into the second part we're gonna put

974
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:28,509
B right

975
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:33,940
so to upper I think is like a some kind

976
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:35,550
of a like cared dot H or something I

977
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:41,440
don't really remember what it's called

978
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:46,769
where is that remember what it's like C

979
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,769
type or C C type that's what it is

980
00:48:51,570 --> 00:49:03,309
what's problem here oh that produces an

981
00:48:55,539 --> 00:49:04,840
int not anymore it doesn't so I'm just

982
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:06,489
gonna pass this through here because

983
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:10,720
it's just gonna do it in place and it's

984
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:14,139
fine alright so as you can see we're

985
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:17,589
already sort of generating names that

986
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:19,809
are 100% dota2 since we're trying to

987
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:24,400
test it here I want to kick us up from

988
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:27,909
to right but basically like we're

989
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,150
already kind of done I mean those

990
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:34,000
there's no way you can tell me that like

991
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:38,410
those are not phantom doctor and life

992
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,750
assassin and gyro hunter are totally are

993
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:44,319
totally things that are going to be in

994
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:47,170
DotA right like there's no way there's

995
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,620
no way that war assassin isn't a valid

996
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:52,329
dota hero okay and we haven't even done

997
00:49:50,619 --> 00:50:07,529
anything yet so we're off to a good

998
00:49:52,329 --> 00:50:09,880
start right like like off we go mmm

999
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:14,470
humans aren't so creative after all are

1000
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,880
they all right so I was going to push

1001
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:18,639
this a little bit further now there's a

1002
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,400
lot more we could do with those because

1003
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,809
remember that we could also have a few

1004
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,670
different rules for how these come

1005
00:50:22,809 --> 00:50:27,519
together even using the ones we have

1006
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:31,329
already and so for example what I might

1007
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:34,630
want to do is do a split on those two

1008
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:37,119
words and and generate two different

1009
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:39,579
types of results from it right so what I

1010
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:43,240
could do is something like this I could

1011
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:45,509
say like give us a switch on a random

1012
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,509
count

1013
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:55,180
what was it get random count and I'm

1014
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,310
just gonna say give me like two

1015
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:59,710
different possibilities here right so

1016
00:50:57,309 --> 00:51:04,509
there's one there's possibility one and

1017
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:06,789
there's possibility too right

1018
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,980
and so what I want to do here is inside

1019
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:11,590
these I'm gonna have just two different

1020
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:13,990
ways of concatenated the same crap

1021
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:15,460
because dota does that for their heroes

1022
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:18,909
they have two different ways of cata

1023
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:21,099
naming the same crap right one way is to

1024
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:23,019
capitalize the first name and then stick

1025
00:51:21,099 --> 00:51:25,900
the other one on the end of it another

1026
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:32,099
way is to insert a space and capitalize

1027
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:34,360
both of them right so it looks like that

1028
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:36,279
now what I want to do here is I don't

1029
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,050
want to have to sit around type in this

1030
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,119
crap all the time so what I'm going to

1031
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:42,490
do is just say well alright if you give

1032
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,800
me multiples of this stuff I'm just

1033
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:48,159
gonna stick them all together so a

1034
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:51,550
concat of three things is just a concat

1035
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,980
of the two back ones concatenated with

1036
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:56,260
the final one that way i can just string

1037
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,690
these together like a freaking party all

1038
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:06,970
the time right and I can just keep on

1039
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:10,079
keeping on right and all I have to do is

1040
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:10,079
just do the last one

1041
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:21,240
I don't know how many of these were

1042
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:23,909
gonna have but that's probably enough

1043
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:25,859
right there are languages I think it's

1044
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:28,349
called currying there's a language

1045
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,820
feature named for this and of course C++

1046
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:31,529
didn't have it because you know why

1047
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,809
would it have a language feature they

1048
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,600
don't put language features in C++ so

1049
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:38,759
here we go so now we can do things like

1050
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,159
getting a space of the names now one of

1051
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,260
the things that you'll notice is when

1052
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:45,269
you look there's times when we'll come

1053
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,220
up like timbersaw is the name of an

1054
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:48,840
existing hero but we didn't match it

1055
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:50,939
against our list because it's got a

1056
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,070
space in there now right so what we

1057
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:56,220
might want to do is when we do our

1058
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:58,950
string exists in what we might want to

1059
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:03,659
do is collapse those two strings down

1060
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:08,969
first into something that will get

1061
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:11,759
matched just based on the like just

1062
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:15,929
based on the version that doesn't have

1063
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:28,040
spaces June I'm talking about so I may

1064
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:28,039
say like sort of existent like like that

1065
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:33,539
and if we run here you can see we're not

1066
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:35,669
randomized so we're getting at that

1067
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:37,320
number five timbersaw every time what I

1068
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,000
want to do now is I want to make sure we

1069
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,320
don't get that so what I'm going to do

1070
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,300
is I'm gonna compare these two strings

1071
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,970
to my own string compare but that string

1072
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:48,180
compare is gonna be based on the the

1073
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:49,259
versions that don't have spaces right so

1074
00:53:48,179 --> 00:53:59,309
what I'm going to do is going to start

1075
00:53:49,260 --> 00:54:02,850
with two pointers a and B and what I'm

1076
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:04,108
gonna do here is say that we're gonna

1077
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:08,339
loop through them

1078
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:11,639
so while star a and star B right

1079
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:21,480
what I want to do is skip any spaces so

1080
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:25,199
while star a oops and star a or a zero

1081
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,949
is not equal to space I'm sorry is equal

1082
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:29,088
to space

1083
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:30,858
actually I suppose that does itself

1084
00:54:29,088 --> 00:54:37,730
right that's all we need

1085
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:39,588
so while a is a space skip it while B is

1086
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:45,139
a space skip it so we're just skipping

1087
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:49,849
over right we're just gonna skip over

1088
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:53,480
the spaces wherever they should occur if

1089
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:54,619
a is not equal to B then we so I'm gonna

1090
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,909
assume true

1091
00:54:54,619 --> 00:55:04,240
let me start I'm gonna say assume they

1092
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:04,239
match right oh sorry

1093
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:15,588
so assume they match the outset loop

1094
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:18,920
through here if they're ever not equal I

1095
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:22,250
assumed that they've failed right and we

1096
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:25,039
break out of this loop if the result is

1097
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:27,019
ever true then we break out of the loop

1098
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,279
and return right it's a little bit

1099
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:31,730
squeaky but I think that's basically

1100
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:34,430
what we want now I want this here to do

1101
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:36,170
a to lower on these guys so that also if

1102
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:37,519
we capitalize something and they didn't

1103
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:43,180
or whatever we're not going to consider

1104
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:45,679
that similar and these are on the we go

1105
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:47,269
there we go

1106
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:48,319
I may have accidentally created an

1107
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:49,820
infinite loop there though I just

1108
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:54,460
realized I didn't put the plus plus in

1109
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,460
there that's my bad sorry infinite loop

1110
00:55:54,670 --> 00:56:02,720
yeah I know where that is

1111
00:55:57,289 --> 00:56:05,690
there it is okay all right so each time

1112
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:10,009
through here we have to increment our a

1113
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:13,039
and B which I forgot to do right all

1114
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,960
right so thankfully now we got rid of

1115
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,849
our timbersaw which is all I really

1116
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,349
wanted to do there but as you can see

1117
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:19,760
we're still also always generating the

1118
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:22,039
exact same hero's what you don't really

1119
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:27,349
want to do so I would like to do an SRAM

1120
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:29,179
time or something here like you know so

1121
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:31,280
that we're gonna get different ones I

1122
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:32,899
don't remember is it clock there's an

1123
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,420
easier way to do this I don't remember

1124
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:40,259
exactly what it is but I would like to

1125
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:43,230
go ahead and close this

1126
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:47,099
I would like to go ahead and have a good

1127
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:49,108
way to s R and just to seed the random

1128
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:51,289
number or something time no that's what

1129
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:51,288
they do

1130
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:59,940
so that's time dot H and that means you

1131
00:56:58,108 --> 00:57:08,818
know as we run it it'll just change over

1132
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:16,528
time unsigned int is that really a

1133
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:18,028
problem so what's a time T these days so

1134
00:57:16,528 --> 00:57:29,568
I think I probably just have to cast it

1135
00:57:18,028 --> 00:57:34,710
and I'll be fine okay WindSeeker is

1136
00:57:29,568 --> 00:57:37,288
excellent be stranger war stealer timber

1137
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:39,269
master it's very good alright so

1138
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:43,109
something weird happened here

1139
00:57:39,268 --> 00:57:49,399
why is war stealer inter caps did ice I

1140
00:57:43,108 --> 00:57:49,400
screwed something up didn't I

1141
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:58,619
somehow whoops so what happened there

1142
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:02,640
why why did I how did how did that

1143
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:06,180
happen like that shouldn't be possible

1144
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,129
right it should only capitalize when

1145
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:12,798
when we insert a space it should never

1146
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:12,798
capitalized when we don't

1147
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:26,289
and all of these are lowercase right so

1148
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:26,800
how are we how did it do that um hold on

1149
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:30,750
a second

1150
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:34,750
if I don't s ran do I get one of those

1151
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:36,340
gyro answer number eight does that so I

1152
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:39,369
want to take a look at what happens on

1153
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:41,620
number eight there because I I obviously

1154
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:43,779
screwed something up and I just want to

1155
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,339
fix that real quick before we put in

1156
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:49,420
some more rules and some more words

1157
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:51,490
right um so okay in here what I'm going

1158
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,860
to do is I just want to skip to number

1159
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:56,500
eight which is actually number seven in

1160
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:01,180
our case so I want to go till the hero

1161
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:04,449
index is there which is right like that

1162
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:07,359
and we'll skip in here so let's see

1163
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:09,279
where we go we return a random value and

1164
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:13,079
we end up in this case where we do a

1165
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:16,150
concat on these two so I'm gonna just

1166
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:18,519
let this thing get its results back I

1167
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:23,860
don't know what those results are so it

1168
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:29,559
got you'd actually got back Oh duh I'm

1169
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:31,300
not copying those stupid me so I need to

1170
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:33,130
actually copy those when we do

1171
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,380
capitalize first I should actually copy

1172
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,610
them because I'm modifying it I actually

1173
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:41,349
just returned it directly that was

1174
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:46,950
pretty stupid actually so my bad we

1175
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:46,949
should just have a clone here right

1176
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:09,349
so in this case all I'm gonna do is just

1177
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:10,549
say okay Len equals sterling a I'm also

1178
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:12,259
do the whole nine here and I don't

1179
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,039
really need to be defensive here but I'm

1180
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:21,470
going to anyway

1181
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:22,070
just cuz and this is basically the stir

1182
01:00:21,469 --> 01:00:23,839
copy

1183
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:25,010
routine or something it's a C runtime

1184
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,570
live every team that does but I don't

1185
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:28,100
like using this new runtime I worry when

1186
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:30,080
I can just write it myself most of time

1187
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:31,849
because I who knows what they're doing

1188
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,090
in there right so we say it's always a a

1189
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:41,170
gigantic mess so I'm just going to

1190
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:41,170
allocate this guy and do the mem copy in

1191
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:55,490
and try not to make order my parameters

1192
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:57,320
wrong okay so I think we're good now

1193
01:00:55,489 --> 01:01:02,079
I'm gonna turn my s R and on again just

1194
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:06,620
for for fun and looks good right

1195
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:09,079
bop clock hunter blood hunter so

1196
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:11,599
what I would like to do here is there

1197
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:16,989
are a few things like verk that maybe

1198
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:20,319
shouldn't appear as separate last

1199
01:01:16,989 --> 01:01:22,759
sections so in that secondary verb list

1200
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,490
we've got some things that maybe

1201
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,260
shouldn't be there like mansur and

1202
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:29,509
lancer and stuff so i'm gonna separate

1203
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:32,720
those out into a slightly different one

1204
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:34,820
so i'm gonna do secondary suffix or

1205
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,529
something like that and all I'm doing

1206
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:40,730
here is just picking out ones that I

1207
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:52,210
don't want placed as a separate second

1208
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:52,210
word right copter probably back

1209
01:01:53,280 --> 01:02:06,250
writer Lancer and man sir so I think

1210
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:10,059
that's good right okay so I think that's

1211
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:16,000
fine and then inside the dota hero thing

1212
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:18,730
I'm gonna add that tubes I'm gonna add

1213
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,429
that to our list so in here we're gonna

1214
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:28,710
have string list secondary suffix I

1215
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:43,779
might label what these are I'm so like

1216
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:45,670
all right um and so this here the

1217
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:47,470
secondary verb should maybe just be

1218
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:49,780
verbs and we should separate secondary

1219
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:51,879
nouns as well so that might be it to do

1220
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:54,250
on the list a little bit later but for

1221
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,500
the moment I'm just I'm not being - like

1222
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:58,690
I said it's it's pretty loose because

1223
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,889
the dota names are kind of ridiculous so

1224
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,539
you know if we call them something

1225
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:05,079
ridiculous if anything it's like it's

1226
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:06,610
good that we did that not bad right

1227
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:09,099
um so I'm gonna go ahead and put that on

1228
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:11,590
there right and so now we won't see

1229
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:13,539
those but I want those to be on there so

1230
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:16,750
what I want to do now is in my list here

1231
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:19,719
where we do random from secondary verb

1232
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:21,460
so in here where we were doing the

1233
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:23,379
concat with a space I don't want that

1234
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:30,460
but what in here I want to say you can

1235
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:32,140
grab from secondary verb or from you can

1236
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:36,460
grab from secondary verb or you can grab

1237
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:38,650
from secondary NAT suffix right so I

1238
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:41,320
want something like this so you can

1239
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:42,820
merge those two together right um

1240
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:46,000
and so what I'm gonna do here is I'm

1241
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:48,640
going to say let's suppose that we can

1242
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,349
look across many of these lists if we

1243
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:56,319
need to and and merge them together and

1244
01:03:52,349 --> 01:03:57,549
so that way we can kind of create random

1245
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,430
numbers that are that are going to be

1246
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:04,600
spanning more than one set I don't

1247
01:04:00,429 --> 01:04:06,159
really know whether I will want the

1248
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:06,759
random to pick which one of those is

1249
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:07,869
going to do and

1250
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,480
then pick or whether I want to pick

1251
01:04:07,869 --> 01:04:12,480
across the set that's a hard decision

1252
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,289
right I don't really know because you

1253
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:20,829
could see here what if we did something

1254
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:28,869
more like this like get secondary verb

1255
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:30,869
or suffix right something like that or

1256
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:34,509
maybe we just call this like a secondary

1257
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:42,639
ending right and what that does is it

1258
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:51,400
did it said look give me a give me a

1259
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:57,989
random case here and what I want you to

1260
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:57,990
do is decide either use secondary verb

1261
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:09,460
or use secondary suffix and so then what

1262
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:11,709
we can do is then if we know we can do

1263
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:16,630
any it's like any secondary ending is a

1264
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:18,809
thing that we that we want right and off

1265
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,809
we go

1266
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:28,838
okay so now we should see those like

1267
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:31,359
anytime we're using something that that

1268
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:33,730
has a concatenation like here we get

1269
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:36,098
tide copter right but we should never

1270
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,929
see copter on its own on the outside and

1271
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:42,280
that's all that was designed to prevent

1272
01:05:37,929 --> 01:05:48,549
right okay so now let's add another type

1273
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:51,070
of dota pattern in right so here what

1274
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:53,950
I'd like to do is say when we have a sec

1275
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:57,010
when we have a separate secondary word

1276
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:58,509
there I'm gonna say that there's a set

1277
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:02,859
of things that can happen on that

1278
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:06,040
outside right so so we've got secondary

1279
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:10,809
verb let's make secondary noun as a

1280
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:13,358
thing right so secondary noun patterns

1281
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:16,088
are ones like king or something like

1282
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:17,608
that right and writer would actually

1283
01:06:16,088 --> 01:06:21,009
should have been one of those

1284
01:06:17,608 --> 01:06:23,230
potentially but I don't know things that

1285
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,849
could get stuck on the end I don't know

1286
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:28,179
how we want to treat this exactly but

1287
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:30,160
we'll see so secondary noun will add

1288
01:06:28,179 --> 01:06:31,960
these things in there that we're

1289
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,029
supposed to be and we'll put chaos and

1290
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,740
dragon in those so we'll take those

1291
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:38,550
names and we'll split those out into our

1292
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:41,858
primary noun list and off we go right

1293
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:43,839
okay so I'm gonna go get that primary

1294
01:06:41,858 --> 01:06:47,319
noun list back and what I want to do

1295
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:49,119
here is just grab all of these it come

1296
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,740
out how did Earthshaker not make it into

1297
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,990
that list I don't know

1298
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:57,009
right but I'm gonna grab all of these

1299
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:59,429
and all of those folks are coming in

1300
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,430
there right

1301
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:18,989
- shoes we're gonna have to look at a

1302
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:23,989
little bit separately there's a lot of

1303
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:23,989
these we're gonna up our dota abilities

1304
01:07:28,969 --> 01:07:32,339
considerably here I think a vengeful

1305
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,920
spirit

1306
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:40,620
sorry that's technically not one because

1307
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:42,090
vengeful spirit is that's not a noun at

1308
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:46,500
the beginning eventual as a descriptor

1309
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:48,870
right so I suppose like lone druid and

1310
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,760
vengeful spirit really shouldn't

1311
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:51,630
shouldn't be in there because those are

1312
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,190
not nouns

1313
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:55,110
those are descriptors and we want to

1314
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:59,570
handle those a little bit separately

1315
01:07:55,110 --> 01:08:05,660
right so I just want to be careful there

1316
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:07,620
let's see Outworld devourer really is

1317
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:09,269
one of those ones that should have a

1318
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:13,049
secondary thing we'll look at that one

1319
01:08:09,269 --> 01:08:14,639
in a second as well I think Shadow Demon

1320
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:18,029
and Shadow shame info on that category

1321
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:20,818
sort of storm skywrath mage i guess cuz

1322
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:24,900
i skywrath i think i want to handle

1323
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:29,730
skywrath separately so we'll we'll make

1324
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:30,479
that be a separate thing yeah so I think

1325
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:33,329
that's good

1326
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:36,179
alright so I want to create a new one

1327
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:38,100
here which is the secondary mound right

1328
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,500
and secondary nouns are things that

1329
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:43,079
should only go in that second position

1330
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:45,060
right and we don't know that like we may

1331
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:46,829
find that we actually just allow all

1332
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,420
nouns to go into any slot and that's

1333
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:51,180
better but for now I'm going to keep it

1334
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:54,930
the way dota kept it right just to keep

1335
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:57,210
with their naming convention for now

1336
01:08:54,930 --> 01:09:03,329
right

1337
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:05,220
so I actually also want to put shaker in

1338
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:08,309
here I don't know how we missed it but

1339
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:10,319
we just we did so in secondary noun

1340
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:17,270
we've got night already

1341
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:17,270
we need Titan commander oops

1342
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:38,319
stalker breaker protector king warden

1343
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:50,710
void spirit sorry there fiend assassin

1344
01:09:50,890 --> 01:10:01,869
warlord maiden demon

1345
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:13,279
Shaymin and wyvern all right

1346
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:16,640
now all of these are things that can

1347
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:31,969
just loop right into our primary noun

1348
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:34,160
list right I and what I'd like to do now

1349
01:10:31,969 --> 01:10:35,448
is just incorporate now if we run it

1350
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:43,579
we'll get some bonus because we've got

1351
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:49,219
some new fake flip doctor okay

1352
01:10:43,579 --> 01:10:51,319
did I like I should put spaces on that

1353
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:53,329
denied ah yeah so I've got some spaces

1354
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:56,000
in there which I should probably trim

1355
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:59,390
those because those will end up putting

1356
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,000
in some extra yeah so that I was like

1357
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:07,989
that shouldn't have had a space and in

1358
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,988
that one if it didn't yeah

1359
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:17,340
oops okay let's try one more time okay

1360
01:11:15,329 --> 01:11:18,510
so here we got a bounty back we got the

1361
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,880
Kaos assassin

1362
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:24,449
we've got winged capture some of these

1363
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,279
probably should be we should require

1364
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:27,689
spaces between them I don't know how

1365
01:11:26,279 --> 01:11:29,009
we're gonna do that because I'm not sure

1366
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:32,488
what the rule really should be but left

1367
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:35,850
to look at that but anyway crystal

1368
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:40,439
mother bat mother very good heroes

1369
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:42,780
obviously venom hunter spirit man sword

1370
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:46,019
Rowell answer very good these are all

1371
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:48,448
timber shakers clearly an excellent hero

1372
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:50,790
a life back I don't know about that one

1373
01:11:48,448 --> 01:11:53,039
but wind copter certainly I mean

1374
01:11:50,789 --> 01:11:55,319
obviously but anyway we need to put

1375
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:57,869
these in here now so those are secondary

1376
01:11:55,319 --> 01:12:00,029
nouns are now need to be incorporated

1377
01:11:57,869 --> 01:12:02,069
into the generator as an idea because we

1378
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:03,719
don't have we're loading the secondary

1379
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:05,189
nouns I think or are we we're not even

1380
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:06,448
loading the secondary now so we need to

1381
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:08,669
load them in and then we need to use

1382
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:11,039
them for something right so we need

1383
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:11,340
secondary nouns oh there it is I put

1384
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,590
them there

1385
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,420
so did I actually load that list yeah we

1386
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:17,819
did so we have a second as loaded they

1387
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,949
just never get used for anything and so

1388
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:22,979
what I want to do here is where we do

1389
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:25,829
this secondary verb I want to also have

1390
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:28,979
secondary noun right so much like we had

1391
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:33,600
get secondary ending I want to have get

1392
01:12:28,979 --> 01:12:37,889
secondary word as a thing or I should

1393
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:40,800
say get final word so it's a word that

1394
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:43,920
ends the thing so it can be one of these

1395
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:47,100
secondary suffixes or it could be one of

1396
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,869
these secondary nouns right and so

1397
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:55,770
that's going to be our get final word

1398
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:57,149
call and we'll do that here okay so now

1399
01:12:55,770 --> 01:12:58,710
we should get some of those yeah like a

1400
01:12:57,149 --> 01:13:00,389
venom Shaymin we couldn't have had

1401
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:01,948
before now we can have a venom Shaymin

1402
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:03,810
we can also have a crystal Titan

1403
01:13:01,948 --> 01:13:05,119
couldn't have that before we can have it

1404
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:08,520
now right

1405
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,939
alright so we've got some good stuff in

1406
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,120
there

1407
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:14,639
and we're definitely improving our dota

1408
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:16,609
heroes but what you'll notice is we

1409
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:20,100
still there's still some obvious

1410
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:20,719
restrictions here because dota has two

1411
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,539
things

1412
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:27,439
at least that we don't have at all right

1413
01:13:23,539 --> 01:13:36,948
now like you wouldn't a monkey king how

1414
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:38,689
do we miss monkey king don't know how

1415
01:13:36,948 --> 01:13:41,750
that happened

1416
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:44,059
anyway so dota has some things that are

1417
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:47,569
that are that we don't really do yet

1418
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:49,489
right and first of all they're ones that

1419
01:13:47,569 --> 01:13:51,679
are like there's some of these things

1420
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:54,948
like queen of pain keeper of the light

1421
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:57,650
those are rarer or nature's like

1422
01:13:54,948 --> 01:14:00,829
apostrophe s right we don't really have

1423
01:13:57,649 --> 01:14:02,689
that concept in there but those are

1424
01:14:00,829 --> 01:14:05,390
pretty few and far between so if we

1425
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:06,979
never generated one of those no we would

1426
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:09,530
probably bat an eyelash because there's

1427
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:11,659
very few of them right but what you will

1428
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:14,689
notice is there's a lot of like single

1429
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:16,340
word sorts of things in here and we

1430
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:18,859
don't have any chance of generating

1431
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:23,119
those and there's a lot of those so

1432
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:27,198
someone might look askance at our at our

1433
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:29,599
system for not having some of those and

1434
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:32,029
so what I'd like to do is try to come up

1435
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:36,949
with a strategy for generating some dota

1436
01:14:32,029 --> 01:14:38,469
sounding short words like that and

1437
01:14:36,948 --> 01:14:41,359
that's gonna be the hardest part I think

1438
01:14:38,469 --> 01:14:43,640
of our program because this part so far

1439
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,960
was a cakewalk right it's not very hard

1440
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,690
to generate things that sound like dota

1441
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,119
names so I think we'll pass that test

1442
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:51,500
with flying colors so what I'm going to

1443
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:54,349
do is I'm just gonna separate these out

1444
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,939
here and what we're gonna start to do is

1445
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:57,230
we're gonna look at these these are

1446
01:14:55,939 --> 01:14:58,309
words we're gonna attack a little bit

1447
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:59,269
separately because they're closer to

1448
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:01,039
what we've already been doing and we

1449
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:02,810
just need a little bit of upgrades to

1450
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:06,380
handle names like that but what I want

1451
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:11,630
to look at now is words like these where

1452
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:14,869
they're kind of a little bit more small

1453
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:17,270
simple syllable words right so I want to

1454
01:15:14,869 --> 01:15:21,079
try in and get some of these together

1455
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:25,760
let's look at these so let's try to make

1456
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:27,409
ones that are sort of nonsense words you

1457
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:32,360
know that feel a little bit like

1458
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:34,380
nonsense words anyway and maybe we can

1459
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:37,609
try to get some of the

1460
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:37,609
somehow right

1461
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:46,200
terrorblade is actually one that we can

1462
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:54,270
handle this way but let's keep looking

1463
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:58,829
here so just trying to grab some here

1464
01:15:54,270 --> 01:16:13,200
that that feel like the kinds of things

1465
01:15:58,829 --> 01:16:17,689
we could do probably just looking at how

1466
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:17,689
they tend to make these names you know

1467
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:39,840
so like so I guess what I would say is

1468
01:16:36,869 --> 01:16:49,399
like there doesn't seem to be a lot I

1469
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:49,400
can really I can really get from those

1470
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:20,379
so the problem that I see with this

1471
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:24,360
right is just that I I need a way of

1472
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:29,139
generating nonsense words like slardar

1473
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:31,808
that sound like they're from dota but

1474
01:17:29,139 --> 01:17:34,118
I'm not sure what the actual thing is

1475
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:36,570
that make something sound like it's from

1476
01:17:34,118 --> 01:17:36,569
dota

1477
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:58,010
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and see

1478
01:17:53,779 --> 01:18:02,679
if I can literally just not do anything

1479
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:02,680
and have it work

1480
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:22,689
so I'm gonna do the following and this

1481
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:24,520
is I am just pulling this out pulling it

1482
01:18:22,689 --> 01:18:27,069
straight out of the posterior here my

1483
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:39,030
friends so I'm gonna break these into

1484
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:39,029
pieces that I would call sort of like

1485
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:48,900
consonant-vowel if you will

1486
01:18:42,939 --> 01:18:53,979
oops that was not what I wanted

1487
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:57,059
consonant vowel dot text and all I'm

1488
01:18:53,979 --> 01:19:01,539
going to do here is try to pull out of

1489
01:18:57,060 --> 01:19:03,940
this list the consonant vowel chunks

1490
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:36,899
that I think are interesting so for

1491
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:36,899
example na JA ki ro ha go slow

1492
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,350

1495
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:16,468
Klee Lee and right you can see what I'm

1496
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:35,550
doing here right

1497
01:20:16,469 --> 01:20:35,550
we already got no no we don't nee J me

1498
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:46,599
and we've got key so we just need

1499
01:20:42,698 --> 01:20:59,079
reading their flaws already in there

1500
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:59,650
oh it's not me Ron nah me nah nas in

1501
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:08,109
there

1502
01:20:59,649 --> 01:21:10,359
I don't think rah is it's not um we'll

1503
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:16,829
stuck stick a ba in there for good

1504
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:16,829
measure a lay in there for good measure

1505
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:30,090
Pro a foe oops

1506
01:21:31,529 --> 01:21:41,488
Allie's there

1507
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:41,488
nos there too

1508
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:52,360
ra's there stay there

1509
01:21:52,390 --> 01:22:04,840
no and cause they're right that's not

1510
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:13,789
all right so what I've done is I've

1511
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:19,609
broken the sill up there like the

1512
01:22:13,789 --> 01:22:22,220
syllabary right of these names in DotA

1513
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:23,989
and I've kind of like just kind of

1514
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:26,180
gotten their nonsense names split up a

1515
01:22:23,989 --> 01:22:27,979
little bit so those are consonant vowel

1516
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:32,450
sounds and then these are just going to

1517
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:35,899
be like raw vowel sounds right and

1518
01:22:32,449 --> 01:22:40,550
there's and I guess dawn would be one

1519
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:42,829
maybe and we'll leave with that and so

1520
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:49,600
these are just gonna be raw bowel sounds

1521
01:22:42,829 --> 01:22:49,600
so are maybe RR n KN kz

1522
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:04,420
there's sort of ones that are foul like

1523
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:05,859
ER and I don't really know what I want

1524
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:07,179
to do about those so we'll take a look

1525
01:23:05,859 --> 01:23:10,179
at those later but we'll just leave

1526
01:23:07,179 --> 01:23:13,500
these in there as sort of more raw

1527
01:23:10,179 --> 01:23:22,539
sounds so I'm gonna make another file

1528
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:24,310
called consonant only and this now we're

1529
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:27,368
gonna have to start to try and work out

1530
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:29,050
how this will happen and and this is

1531
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:30,158
again I'm gonna be tough these are this

1532
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:32,230
will be the toughest part of this

1533
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:33,670
program for sure if we can manage to get

1534
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:37,448
something I don't have a lot of time

1535
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:40,060
left but we'll see how we do so alright

1536
01:23:37,448 --> 01:23:41,859
so this is for our nonsense names so

1537
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:45,360
we've got consonant vowel and just

1538
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:49,500
consonant and if we go into dota hero

1539
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,500
I'm just gonna put those in here

1540
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:09,810
maybe spelling that wrong and I

1541
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:12,810
apologize but we need those two lists

1542
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:12,810
here

1543
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:31,599
oops alright so now we have oops

1544
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:35,699
consonant text apparently is not there

1545
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,700
oh I think as I called it consonant only

1546
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:48,969
my bad okay so for right now what I'm

1547
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:51,340
going to do is when we call get hero

1548
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:53,140
name I'm gonna really quickly if zero

1549
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,670
this out and I just want to focus on

1550
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,680
just those names for now and then we'll

1551
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:58,510
add them as a third case so what we're

1552
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:03,130
really gonna do is this right we're

1553
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:07,180
really gonna do get nonsense name for

1554
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:09,100
now and so I will eventually turn that

1555
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:12,010
on but at the moment I just want to

1556
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,800
practice these only so what we're gonna

1557
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:17,650
do is we're only gonna have the nonsense

1558
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,020
names for now and that way we can just

1559
01:25:17,649 --> 01:25:22,000
try to get those working so let get

1560
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:24,610
nonsense name is gonna have to do

1561
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,380
something and this is going to be the

1562
01:25:24,609 --> 01:25:28,569
hard part of the program so here we go

1563
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:30,400
in result and I'll say alright let's

1564
01:25:28,569 --> 01:25:31,420
just start by saying it's you know I

1565
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,739
don't know what we're gonna do here but

1566
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:37,659
just let's make sure this is working at

1567
01:25:32,739 --> 01:25:43,329
all we're gonna say give me a random

1568
01:25:37,659 --> 01:25:50,159
from consonantal only I'm sorry from

1569
01:25:43,329 --> 01:25:50,159
consonant-vowel a random from consonant

1570
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:58,119
and a random from constant vowel again I

1571
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:08,760
don't know I have no idea that's going

1572
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:19,359
to do only sorry and it's not awful

1573
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:20,409
right it's not a honestly it's it's not

1574
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:21,729
that past

1575
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:28,949
[Music]

1576
01:26:21,729 --> 01:26:28,949
[Laughter]

1577
01:26:31,609 --> 01:26:36,079
[Laughter]

1578
01:26:41,420 --> 01:27:15,720
honestly if you told me there is a girl

1579
01:26:44,100 --> 01:27:17,010
called magna or slots key oh okay so I

1580
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:23,750
thought that's gonna be the hard part of

1581
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:26,070
the program it's not oh man okay whew

1582
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:30,289
I'm gonna add a couple more in here like

1583
01:27:26,069 --> 01:27:30,289
n D D D

1584
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:40,890
maybe kale and LK I don't know see how

1585
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:43,680
those do at all

1586
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:47,310
pretty darn good and so I'm gonna say

1587
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:49,610
that there should also be a vowel only

1588
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:52,230
[Music]

1589
01:27:49,609 --> 01:27:54,420
that's just I suppose vowel only is

1590
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:57,269
really just like if you want start with

1591
01:27:54,420 --> 01:28:00,930
over a or something but I'm gonna say

1592
01:27:57,270 --> 01:28:06,290
there's a vowel only as well and that's

1593
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:08,990
just like a IOU for now but we may like

1594
01:28:06,289 --> 01:28:17,519
want that to be a little bit more

1595
01:28:08,989 --> 01:28:19,170
ridiculous uh so basically like that was

1596
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,390
ridiculous I mean I guess it's way

1597
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:22,890
easier than I think it is I was thinking

1598
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:25,410
we have to do that we have to do

1599
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:26,640
anything just like make up a ridiculous

1600
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:32,250
collection of syllables and it sounds

1601
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:32,700
like a total name I guess I shouldn't be

1602
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:36,170
surprised

1603
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:43,800
all right so off we go here's vowel only

1604
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:46,409
and good news so I'm gonna go ahead and

1605
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:49,140
say that the nonsense name now will

1606
01:28:46,409 --> 01:28:52,109
just have a switch for what it wants to

1607
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:55,860
do here where we'll just have a couple

1608
01:28:52,109 --> 01:28:59,309
patterns oops we'll just have a couple

1609
01:28:55,859 --> 01:29:01,679
patterns that we use and we'll see which

1610
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:03,000
if any of them if they all tend to work

1611
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:06,180
out I don't know let's let's make like

1612
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,890
five patterns I'm just again apparently

1613
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:09,720
pulling stuff out of your butt is just

1614
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:11,490
fine for doing two names like right

1615
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,810
because they pull them out of their butt

1616
01:29:11,489 --> 01:29:14,550
so I guess I can pull them out of mine

1617
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:15,900
or my computer could pull it out of

1618
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:18,480
there but just fine too

1619
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:22,460
all right so we're gonna take and we're

1620
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,459
gonna say let's make our nonsense name

1621
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:30,510
is gonna have some stuff in it here and

1622
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:32,610
that's fine and then I'm gonna make a

1623
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:34,949
bunch of these so we already know that

1624
01:29:32,609 --> 01:29:37,409
this one works right that works just

1625
01:29:34,949 --> 01:29:40,409
fine but what about some other ones

1626
01:29:37,409 --> 01:29:47,250
right what about some other patterns

1627
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:52,789
here that we could use right let's just

1628
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:58,859
make up five of them right um and

1629
01:29:52,789 --> 01:29:59,880
honestly to be honest though really we

1630
01:29:58,859 --> 01:30:05,609
could break this down into two

1631
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:07,650
categories so we could instead of doing

1632
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:09,829
five here well I mean maybe we do yeah

1633
01:30:07,649 --> 01:30:15,569
like maybe we do like consonant only

1634
01:30:09,829 --> 01:30:22,850
like vowel only consonant vowel or

1635
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:22,849
something I don't know which

1636
01:30:36,489 --> 01:30:50,960
III don't even know I I'm sorry I have

1637
01:30:39,859 --> 01:30:58,460
no idea what I'm doing what I was gonna

1638
01:30:50,960 --> 01:31:01,760
say though is so what I think we should

1639
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:07,930
do in addition is after we generate this

1640
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:23,180
we should roll like if you roll a random

1641
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:27,079
let's say there's a 1 out of 10 chance 1

1642
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:31,730
out of 8 chance something 1 I attend

1643
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:36,010
chance that whatever complete crap we

1644
01:31:31,729 --> 01:31:44,199
don't we generated there will cat on

1645
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:52,430
itself so like with one of these

1646
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:53,869
ridiculousness is right so once in a

1647
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:55,820
while and it looks like we didn't

1648
01:31:53,869 --> 01:32:00,760
generate any there sadly new that's -

1649
01:31:55,819 --> 01:32:00,759
yeah we'll get one of these you know

1650
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:07,819
kind of things it looks like maybe it's

1651
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:10,880
only really appropriate for ones that

1652
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:13,159
start with consonant-vowel so not ones

1653
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,810
that start with consonant only I'm not

1654
01:32:13,159 --> 01:32:16,460
sure we actually want to start with

1655
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:22,010
consonant only so I might get rid of

1656
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:23,779
that entirely right alright so I think

1657
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:25,610
that's probably good I don't know if

1658
01:32:23,779 --> 01:32:26,929
that should be capitalized inter wide so

1659
01:32:25,609 --> 01:32:29,420
I don't that any shouldn't be

1660
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:31,539
capitalized in that or not but I think

1661
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:33,670
we're good ok so now if we let this go

1662
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:37,180
[Music]

1663
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:37,180
right we can

1664
01:32:37,479 --> 01:32:44,488
we can get a really respectable look

1665
01:32:40,029 --> 01:32:47,590
looking set of done' names now right I

1666
01:32:44,488 --> 01:32:49,209
mean I defy someone to know the

1667
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:52,750
difference between this list and an

1668
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:54,939
actual list of dota heroes right so

1669
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:57,640
that's pretty good I'm pretty happy with

1670
01:32:54,939 --> 01:33:00,279
that right but what I would also like to

1671
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:02,980
do is get some more like possibilities

1672
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:04,869
in here once in a while so these was

1673
01:33:02,979 --> 01:33:07,209
what I would call maybe Core dota names

1674
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:09,250
once in a while I'd like to go nuts with

1675
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:12,010
it and just say look what if we had like

1676
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:15,880
nonsense name and then a final word as

1677
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:20,560
well right so every so often you know if

1678
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:22,929
you did a get random count here like

1679
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,060
this sort of thing every so often I'd

1680
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:28,329
like to see maybe it's a little more

1681
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:32,199
frequent than that I'd like to see a con

1682
01:33:28,329 --> 01:33:35,649
cat with a capitalized first get final

1683
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:39,369
word on these guys right so a nonsense

1684
01:33:35,649 --> 01:33:43,119
word but then a real noun right I mean a

1685
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:44,439
real ending that we concatenate on to

1686
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:47,679
whatever the nonsense word is

1687
01:33:44,439 --> 01:33:49,269
regenerated right and so that way you

1688
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:51,069
know you can get stuff like dock bar

1689
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:53,440
protector which we wouldn't have gotten

1690
01:33:51,069 --> 01:33:55,238
before which i think is a good addition

1691
01:33:53,439 --> 01:34:03,988
to like the set of things that we can

1692
01:33:55,238 --> 01:34:03,988
have right you know what I mean I

1693
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:16,119
thought we took Virk out of the set of

1694
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:18,429
things that were final word didn't we

1695
01:34:16,119 --> 01:34:20,789
say that we weren't supposed to have

1696
01:34:18,429 --> 01:34:20,789
that

1697
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:38,170
oh this is wrong this is get final word

1698
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:42,400
is supposed to be verb isn't it I think

1699
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:48,029
we screwed that up yeah because like

1700
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:48,029
virk and stuff like the secondary verbs

1701
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:53,559
we're supposed to be they're not the

1702
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:55,360
suffixes yeah yeah yeah yeah I messed

1703
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:57,700
that up sorry that was my bad

1704
01:34:55,359 --> 01:35:04,569
all right so this is a pretty

1705
01:34:57,699 --> 01:35:12,189
respectable list profit I feel like as a

1706
01:35:04,569 --> 01:35:19,659
secondary noun I feel like that should

1707
01:35:12,189 --> 01:35:22,299
be in there so that's looking pretty

1708
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:25,769
good so now all I want to do just to

1709
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:28,750
make it so that it's a little bit more

1710
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:32,590
powerful we can do a ton more stuff with

1711
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:41,229
this obviously but I want to just add

1712
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:49,600
our own words in now right so we're just

1713
01:35:41,229 --> 01:35:52,449
gonna add our own set so let's see in

1714
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,190
this list for example we've just got you

1715
01:35:52,449 --> 01:35:55,809
know it's obvious what's here like so

1716
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:59,759
you know let's just make up some words

1717
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:59,760
that sound like they go with this list

1718
01:37:13,939 --> 01:37:18,119
right and we should put a lot more in

1719
01:37:17,069 --> 01:37:28,619
there but I just want to go through this

1720
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:31,189
list and put them in there that should

1721
01:37:28,619 --> 01:37:31,189
really be here

1722
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:09,479
all right

1723
01:39:17,238 --> 01:39:21,250
so really this should have been here

1724
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:40,798
[Music]

1725
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:28,520
we should be adding like way more words

1726
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:31,850
than this but I'm just trying to do like

1727
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:41,920
a quick and dear dirty you know job here

1728
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:41,920
I don't know if that would really work

1729
01:41:12,289 --> 01:41:27,319
also alright so I don't know if we made

1730
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:27,320
it better or worse we made it better

1731
01:41:31,229 --> 01:41:36,229
sellers should really be stealer I think

1732
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:55,130
thief should be in here

1733
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:55,130
sure controllers not that good

1734
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:19,390
I think our job here is done

1735
01:42:12,579 --> 01:42:20,170
I feel like Forge it's gotta be in here

1736
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:27,039
somewhere

1737
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:27,520
am I wrong about that feel like we need

1738
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:35,489
a forge

1739
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:35,490
I think I think we're good

1740
01:42:36,029 --> 01:42:45,789
here's $100 Hiro's valve if you need

1741
01:42:40,449 --> 01:42:50,069
them I think there's maybe our mix is

1742
01:42:45,789 --> 01:42:50,069
not perfect like we probably should

1743
01:42:50,609 --> 01:42:55,589
silencer also looks like more of an

1744
01:42:52,779 --> 01:42:58,688
final noun like

1745
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:58,689
[Music]

1746
01:43:47,488 --> 01:43:51,219
Forge might want to be Adam all right I

1747
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:55,289
don't really know

1748
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:55,289
there you go that's what we've got

1749
01:44:24,939 --> 01:44:31,809
I don't suppose John's probably still

1750
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:34,780
here but hopefully we can send him some

1751
01:44:31,809 --> 01:44:37,779
of these quality names now so that he as

1752
01:44:34,779 --> 01:44:42,458
a game designer who I know would like to

1753
01:44:37,779 --> 01:44:44,649
be able to design games like dota won't

1754
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:51,158
have to come up with all of these

1755
01:44:44,649 --> 01:44:54,299
awesome hero names himself right so I

1756
01:44:51,158 --> 01:44:54,299
think that's pretty good

1757
01:45:35,899 --> 01:45:40,369
just making the fake get look like yeah

1758
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:44,170
that's that's all I did for the fake it

1759
01:45:40,369 --> 01:45:46,579
I just looked at the stuff that that

1760
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:54,770
they were generating and generated stuff

1761
01:45:46,579 --> 01:45:58,479
with the same pattern right sent or were

1762
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:58,480
litter was that generated at some point

1763
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:16,029
are you capitalizing the original source

1764
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:17,260
strings no not at the moment

1765
01:46:16,029 --> 01:46:19,349
oh wait you probably were telling me

1766
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:22,119
that back when I was yeah okay nevermind

1767
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:24,160
did making the fake it look similar to

1768
01:46:22,119 --> 01:46:29,349
this yes you also need the one word type

1769
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:30,519
names like doom or silencer the problem

1770
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:31,960
is I don't know that we can really do

1771
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:36,130
that because that we just have to add

1772
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:39,698
those words right so I don't know how we

1773
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:41,350
would do that because it has to find a

1774
01:46:39,698 --> 01:46:43,479
word in the English language that could

1775
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:46,239
probably be a dota hero and use it and I

1776
01:46:43,479 --> 01:46:50,349
don't know that's while something we

1777
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:51,189
could try what was the point there is no

1778
01:46:50,350 --> 01:46:55,739
point to this

1779
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:55,738
other than we needed more dota names

1780
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:12,790
Linda's memory macros sure yes we can do

1781
01:47:09,079 --> 01:47:20,869
those so the Linux memory macro problem

1782
01:47:12,789 --> 01:47:22,760
I all I know about it is this pusher and

1783
01:47:20,869 --> 01:47:26,869
push size need to have the pound pound

1784
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:32,150
on them I and push it and I'll terminate

1785
01:47:26,869 --> 01:47:34,279
can't that's all I know so I will make

1786
01:47:32,149 --> 01:47:35,448
that change but I don't know anything

1787
01:47:34,279 --> 01:47:40,630
else about it since obviously I don't

1788
01:47:35,448 --> 01:47:43,460
compile on Linux if that makes sense so

1789
01:47:40,630 --> 01:47:55,219
looking at the push struct push array

1790
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:57,319
push side loops so looking at these so

1791
01:47:55,219 --> 01:48:03,109
basically you're just saying push struck

1792
01:47:57,319 --> 01:48:06,529
needs that push array needs it and push

1793
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:10,130
size needs it that correct that says

1794
01:48:06,529 --> 01:48:16,609
here push truck pusher a push size push

1795
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:20,800
on mill terminate should not have it at

1796
01:48:16,609 --> 01:48:20,799
all I guess

1797
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:34,460
are you sure it shouldn't have a comma

1798
01:48:26,779 --> 01:48:39,259
with that after it does it does it you

1799
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:40,699
sure doesn't have to have this I think

1800
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:43,150
we need it to have that don't or maybe

1801
01:48:40,699 --> 01:48:43,149
not all right

1802
01:48:55,880 --> 01:49:03,380
so pushing a null terminate is trying to

1803
01:48:58,789 --> 01:49:04,158
pass its entire set down here with the

1804
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:15,319
comma

1805
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:18,309
oh it just needs that probably right is

1806
01:49:15,319 --> 01:49:18,309
that sufficient

1807
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:29,659
and and we don't want the comma I

1808
01:49:27,369 --> 01:49:33,769
thought you did need the comma you can't

1809
01:49:29,659 --> 01:49:35,659
just do that Kenya yeah you can't you

1810
01:49:33,770 --> 01:49:37,810
can't do that you have to do that that's

1811
01:49:35,659 --> 01:49:40,809
the only legal one that I know about

1812
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:40,810
right

1813
01:49:58,038 --> 01:50:03,050
is that is that good up encoder well I

1814
01:50:01,729 --> 01:50:07,509
guess I can check this in and then we

1815
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:07,510
can fix it if that's not good enough

1816
01:50:09,908 --> 01:50:28,629
right so we'll just say like off we go

1817
01:50:31,430 --> 01:50:39,440
um someone wanted to see the main

1818
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:43,510
function again of our duty hero

1819
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:46,689
generator so let me just jump down there

1820
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:46,690
here it is

1821
01:50:59,369 --> 01:51:03,449
and here's the get here on you

1822
01:51:20,810 --> 01:51:25,080
do you think it's a worthwhile exercise

1823
01:51:23,189 --> 01:51:27,059
learning to program for Gameboy or some

1824
01:51:25,079 --> 01:51:29,809
other constraint platform or is it too

1825
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:34,320
esoteric specialized to be transferable

1826
01:51:29,810 --> 01:51:36,630
well I guess what I would say is it's

1827
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:38,309
definitely a useful thing to do and I

1828
01:51:36,630 --> 01:51:40,380
think you would learn a lot from doing

1829
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:43,380
it the question is not really if it's

1830
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:46,500
transferable this the sort of the stuff

1831
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:48,090
you learn a lot of it is stuff you can

1832
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:50,039
apply and it helps you understand a

1833
01:51:48,090 --> 01:51:52,050
platform and stuff right the question is

1834
01:51:50,039 --> 01:51:54,090
just is it the most efficient way to

1835
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:55,889
learn because there are plenty of things

1836
01:51:54,090 --> 01:51:57,510
that are just plain specific to Gameboy

1837
01:51:55,889 --> 01:52:04,260
that you'll be learning that really have

1838
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:09,360
no bearing on anything else and so I

1839
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:13,020
don't know I I would say it depends a

1840
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:16,559
lot on how much time you have to spend

1841
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:17,909
and how much you care about maybe

1842
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:21,530
learning some things about a platform

1843
01:52:17,908 --> 01:52:25,859
that you don't really need to know ever

1844
01:52:21,529 --> 01:52:28,109
so it's kind of a toss-up have you ever

1845
01:52:25,859 --> 01:52:32,639
programmed an emulator no I have not

1846
01:52:28,109 --> 01:52:35,698
I programmed a few like cycle simulator

1847
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:37,980
things in the past that try to like take

1848
01:52:35,698 --> 01:52:39,809
some like assembly language code for a

1849
01:52:37,979 --> 01:52:42,509
particular platform and determine like

1850
01:52:39,810 --> 01:52:44,190
what the CPU will do with it but those

1851
01:52:42,510 --> 01:52:46,020
were just to like do performance

1852
01:52:44,189 --> 01:52:49,049
analysis they were never designed to

1853
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:51,030
actually simulate the behavior like that

1854
01:52:49,050 --> 01:52:53,389
and actually produce output from it you

1855
01:52:51,029 --> 01:52:53,389
know what I mean

1856
01:53:42,029 --> 01:53:51,479
will I be streaming beta j ai I don't

1857
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:52,950
have a beta ji I would be happy to play

1858
01:53:51,479 --> 01:53:54,959
around the downstream though sometime

1859
01:53:52,949 --> 01:53:57,090
for sure I had me I don't know how to

1860
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:59,579
program in ji so you know would be kind

1861
01:53:57,090 --> 01:54:05,390
of a learning experience right so I

1862
01:53:59,579 --> 01:54:05,390
certainly couldn't do much right but

1863
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:17,099
would you put today's achievement on

1864
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:19,800
your CV this is my CV alright if you

1865
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:21,780
don't think that a hundred perfect dota

1866
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:28,590
names is a reason to hire me I just

1867
01:54:21,779 --> 01:54:30,539
don't know what to say I do think it

1868
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:32,610
would be nice to hook this up to a like

1869
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:36,170
a little Twitter posting bot so that it

1870
01:54:32,609 --> 01:54:36,170
just generates a dough to name a day

1871
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:15,720
I mean I assume I may not really know

1872
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:36,390
like if I went to twitter.com and I just

1873
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:36,390
you know signed up and I said it was

1874
01:55:47,869 --> 01:55:51,829
you know whatever the heck it is

1875
01:56:12,329 --> 01:56:16,529
let's just let's just see

1876
01:56:20,229 --> 01:56:32,959
so what I need here is I need to make an

1877
01:56:27,559 --> 01:56:38,860
account I guess that could tweet out a

1878
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:38,859
hero every day right

1879
01:56:46,488 --> 01:56:48,879
and

1880
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:33,130
okay

1881
01:57:38,279 --> 01:57:41,000
hello

1882
01:58:35,519 --> 01:58:43,880
so it never asked me what my handle

1883
01:58:38,399 --> 01:58:47,479
would be why not

1884
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:47,480
what's my handle

1885
01:58:59,729 --> 01:59:06,049
weird so it just doesn't you don't get

1886
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:06,050
to pick your handle anymore

1887
01:59:11,609 --> 01:59:14,899
that really sucks

1888
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:27,989
man Twitter just gets worse and worse

1889
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:31,670
like it never asked me what the handle

1890
01:59:27,989 --> 01:59:36,059
was it just it said what what name and

1891
01:59:31,670 --> 01:59:39,180
it just like randomly concatenated my

1892
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:41,450
name I guess you can change the user

1893
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:41,450
name

1894
01:59:51,939 --> 01:59:58,029
all right so I've created an account

1895
01:59:55,189 --> 02:00:00,408
called daily MOBA hero

1896
01:59:58,029 --> 02:00:03,559
so I guess Twitter allows you to change

1897
02:00:00,408 --> 02:00:07,129
it so that's fine so we now have daily

1898
02:00:03,559 --> 02:00:14,020
MOBA hero and let's just tweak one of

1899
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:19,819
our names from today I think let's see

1900
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:22,809
what we should have Forge maiden I think

1901
02:00:19,819 --> 02:00:22,808
is going to be it

1902
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:44,820
and so we'll just go ahead and and make

1903
02:00:41,010 --> 02:00:46,590
that happen there I will hook it up to a

1904
02:00:44,819 --> 02:00:48,329
Twitter bot later today so that it just

1905
02:00:46,590 --> 02:00:54,239
tweets out one of the things that this

1906
02:00:48,329 --> 02:00:56,960
thing generates every day right and and

1907
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:56,960
that'll be that

1908
02:01:54,079 --> 02:02:04,550
all right folks it's happening we're

1909
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:10,020
good to go so I'll get that worked out

1910
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:12,500
as soon as I can and and and we'll go

1911
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:12,500
from there

1912
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:23,819
let me wrap it up for today because I

1913
02:02:22,350 --> 02:02:28,320
mean I really think it would be a crime

1914
02:02:23,819 --> 02:02:35,539
for the world to not have our daily

1915
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:35,539
mobile hero available

1916
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:51,000
maybe tomorrow you should show us how to

1917
02:02:49,109 --> 02:02:53,219
hook her name's Reptar I'm not gonna I'm

1918
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,469
just gonna use the command line to like

1919
02:02:53,219 --> 02:02:57,179
probably just a cron job right that just

1920
02:02:55,469 --> 02:03:07,829
sits there and posts it that's all I'm

1921
02:02:57,179 --> 02:03:09,359
gonna do yeah two weeks to generate

1922
02:03:07,829 --> 02:03:11,039
plausible looking portraits to go with

1923
02:03:09,359 --> 02:03:13,319
dota hero names which approach would you

1924
02:03:11,039 --> 02:03:14,760
take I don't know that's probably not a

1925
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:16,948
two week thing unless you just wanted to

1926
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:20,219
hack together some like AI image

1927
02:03:16,948 --> 02:03:21,719
libraries or something in an API how

1928
02:03:20,219 --> 02:03:23,279
might you distinguish between functions

1929
02:03:21,719 --> 02:03:25,139
that do things in place two already

1930
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:26,609
allocated memory versus ones that do the

1931
02:03:25,139 --> 02:03:28,679
same thing on freshly allocated memory

1932
02:03:26,609 --> 02:03:30,000
for example an image processing function

1933
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:31,670
that modifies that memory in place

1934
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,289
versus one that returns a modified image

1935
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:42,929
so I just in api's I pretty much never

1936
02:03:36,289 --> 02:03:44,609
do that I never have the API allocate

1937
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:47,399
the memory I always have the memory get

1938
02:03:44,609 --> 02:03:48,539
passed in and then if you want it to

1939
02:03:47,399 --> 02:03:50,579
allocate the memory you just do a

1940
02:03:48,539 --> 02:03:52,139
secondary call or something that makes

1941
02:03:50,579 --> 02:04:01,109
it allocate and then you pass that

1942
02:03:52,139 --> 02:04:02,368
that's pretty much what I always do can

1943
02:04:01,109 --> 02:04:04,469
you show us how to hook it up is it hard

1944
02:04:02,368 --> 02:04:06,598
I know you there's just command-line

1945
02:04:04,469 --> 02:04:09,118
utilities to tweet pretty sure you don't

1946
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:10,679
really have to do anything if you want

1947
02:04:09,118 --> 02:04:12,000
to write your own it's a huge pain in

1948
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:14,579
the butt because you got it right ooofff

1949
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,198
which is a nightmare so I would highly

1950
02:04:14,579 --> 02:04:18,149
recommend not writing a twitter bot from

1951
02:04:16,198 --> 02:04:21,089
scratch because then you're in like the

1952
02:04:18,149 --> 02:04:22,679
OpenSSL territory which is terrible but

1953
02:04:21,090 --> 02:04:26,329
if you don't mind using curl or

1954
02:04:22,679 --> 02:04:26,329
something then it's pretty easy

1955
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:38,360
