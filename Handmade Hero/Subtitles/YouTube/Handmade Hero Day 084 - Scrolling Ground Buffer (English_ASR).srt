1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:08,969
start recording so hello everyone and

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,099
welcome to a limping edition of handmade

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,410
hero which I know it's a little bit odd

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,870
to say but of you know especially since

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,600
our hero has no legs it's hard to limp

6
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,989
but unfortunately I guess twitch

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,730
suffered some sort of a cyber attack and

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,858
I'm sure was a sophisticated cyberattack

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,060
because no one ever says just cyber

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,859
attack because that would make it sound

11
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,178
like they didn't have sophisticated

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,109
security so I'm sure with a

13
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,890
sophisticated cyber attack that

14
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,530
consisted of someone running some

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,679
scripts somewhere and so there had to be

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,780
a bunch of oo oo 3 set key reset stream

17
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,579
reset stuff happening and so we're we're

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,879
sort of up and running but we don't

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,620
really have the QA system back up and

20
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,808
running yet because I haven't gone

21
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,759
through and figured out all the tokens I

22
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,789
need to reset to get it to connect again

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,710
so hopefully we'll be able to do that by

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,010
tomorrow but today we may have to do

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,290
basically like limited QA or or you know

26
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,438
not not really the kind of QA that we're

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,799
used to doing but we can stream the show

28
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,809
and so that's something and so if we

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,868
can't stream the show we should stream

30
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,909
the show and so in order to do that I

31
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:20,368
guess what we should probably do is it's

32
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:26,549
get started take a look at where we are

33
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:27,680
at and and yeah today is day 84 so if

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,290
you're trying to follow along at home

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,400
unzip day 83 source code if you're one

36
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,640
of people who pre-ordered on handmade

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,670
hero org 83 is the day that you want to

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,969
start with so let's take a look let's

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,460
let's do a little bit of our own damage

40
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,109
assessment here now that we no twitches

41
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,699
in the middle of their damage assessment

42
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:52,349
and let's take a look so we are at the

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,750
point we took a little bit of a

44
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,188
diversion last week and we made a thing

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,170
that does little background bitmap

46
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:59,639
composites it was kind of cool like I

47
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,659
like that little ground composite back

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,879
there that we just kind of hacked

49
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,799
together it was a pretty neat thing and

50
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,670
you know kind of validated the idea of

51
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,920
how we were going to build our

52
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,288
backgrounds but it was kind of a

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,628
diversion and also don't ask me why we

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,839
have all these heads floating here you

55
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:14,159
know

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,950
sometimes you just have a lot of heads

57
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,780
floating around everywhere and you know

58
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:19,889
we probably should should maybe you know

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,090
let me let me just take a minute and

60
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,669
turn those off because that's just too

61
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,560
many heads that's way too many heads and

62
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:27,000
we're just getting confused if that many

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,080
heads are floating around so let's let's

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,969
turn that back down let's get back to a

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,620
single floating head which is which is

66
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:39,359
easier for us to deal with

67
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,180
alright so hmm where we are at at the

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,120
moment is we we are trying to figure out

69
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,959
how to finish off our world construction

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,789
so that basically ground and stuff is is

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,848
more of a known quantity so that we can

72
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:56,729
move on and and call a call our Z

73
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:58,169
handling finished and right now

74
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,119
everything works kind of well as long as

75
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:01,259
you're on one level and we sort of

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,939
started working on stuff where you can

77
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,109
go multiple levels like that allows me

78
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,400
to kind of walk up for our mythical

79
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,569
staircase which you don't have graphics

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,680
for yet but we kind of drew some

81
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:09,839
rectangles in there so we could see

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,500
where it was and kind of see it's like

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,299
sort of 3d aspect to there to it right

84
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,609
but we now need to kind of take it just

85
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,069
to the to the final step that we haven't

86
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:22,829
done yet which is actually putting some

87
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:24,869
ground in so that we can see sort of

88
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:26,879
like when we have two levels one that

89
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,840
eclipses the other that we can see where

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,340
that is and also so that we can we

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,650
haven't really gone through and and

92
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,590
modified our collision loop to really

93
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,419
handle the the necessary like we haven't

94
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,348
really done the work that we need to do

95
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:48,870
in order to ensure that our people

96
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:51,179
actually walk on the ground right so

97
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,129
right now all we actually do is we just

98
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,230
assume that the ground is at zero and we

99
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,689
did the work to put in actual markers to

100
00:03:55,229 --> 00:04:00,629
say what you know where the ground was

101
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,180
but we didn't actually do the work to

102
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:05,939
use them yet so that's sort of something

103
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,109
that we need to do and so I don't know

104
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,329
which order will tackle this and maybe

105
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,620
we'll just kind of start trying to move

106
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,200
towards a place where we are both

107
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,840
drawing some ground and where we know

108
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,459
where that ground actually is that seems

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,930
like probably the best thing for us to

110
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:25,639
be doing alright so

111
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,079
let's think about this a little right

112
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,900
now we have a thing that composites

113
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,219
ground in the background so we did that

114
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:32,598
but we haven't actually done any work to

115
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,860
actually put that into the world

116
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:35,209
anywhere it's just something that guys

117
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,129
called in the main loop so you can see

118
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,198
it just stays there in the upper right

119
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,729
hand corner and so one thing we might

120
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,620
want to think about now and this is kind

121
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:44,418
of where I'm leaning it's just how do we

122
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,300
get that into the world so that we can

123
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:49,219
have those sort of textures as our

124
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,009
actual ground texture and it will move

125
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,180
around as we move around right in order

126
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:56,000
to do that it seems like we probably

127
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,889
want to put an entity in there that is

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,439
you know that has that ground texture

129
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,030
and then when that entity comes in it's

130
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:05,029
going to get drawn with that ground

131
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:06,978
texture right and I don't know exactly

132
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:08,689
how we want to do that that's kind of a

133
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:10,430
you know kind of been up in the air

134
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,439
thing but you know let's just take a

135
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,329
look at where we're at with how we were

136
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,228
specifying the ground things and see if

137
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,029
there's something we can figure out

138
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:18,529
that'll be a reasonable way to sort of

139
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:20,448
start getting that worked into the

140
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:22,489
system so that it's not this sort of

141
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,218
floating weird separate thing

142
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,918
so we currently know that we've got this

143
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:30,800
sort of space option here this is the

144
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,408
entity it's sort of this concept that we

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,750
can it can can talk about empty space in

146
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:37,939
the world and basically these empty

147
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,399
space entities we can put around the

148
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:43,699
world and they tell us where the person

149
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,109
can walk right anywhere there's empty

150
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,879
space that's somewhere you can walk in

151
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,740
anywhere where there's a bottom to the

152
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,288
empty space like so that where there's

153
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,699
no more empty space beneath it that was

154
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:54,439
going to be our definition for where the

155
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:56,930
ground is and that seems like a pretty

156
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:00,860
good idea now the question is what do we

157
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,348
actually want to do in terms of drawing

158
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,689
those ground areas do we want that to be

159
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:08,658
something that's defined with the space

160
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:11,899
do we want that to be something that

161
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:15,610
sort of splat it out separately and I'm

162
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:18,109
not really sure it's a little bit tricky

163
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,449
well you know maybe let me flip to the

164
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,310
blackboard for a second and I'll try to

165
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,759
kind of go over with you what I was

166
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,699
thinking

167
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,050
let's see funny that we say we flip over

168
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:31,580
to the whiteboard and it says nowadays

169
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:34,649
nothing works reliably anymore that's

170
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:39,899
kind of a moral story today right

171
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:43,619
alright alright so let's see here we are

172
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:46,769
on on day 84 so let me go ahead and make

173
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:48,659
a little space here for day 84 and then

174
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:51,778
we will go ahead and and and talk about

175
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:53,968
this a little so right now where we're

176
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,528
at is we've got a pretty flexible system

177
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:57,838
right for defining where the ground is

178
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:59,038
and and so what we did is we said all

179
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:02,368
right we're gonna have sort of these

180
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,498
these spatial entities that define sort

181
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:06,059
of rooms almost right and those rooms

182
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:07,588
don't actually have to be literal rooms

183
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,899
right they can be outdoors or whatever

184
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:13,050
but there's basically bounding volumes

185
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:15,478
that say this is a walkable area the

186
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,550
user can walk around on here and the

187
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,109
bottom of it is considered to be solid

188
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,300
for all intents and purposes you know

189
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,830
unless there was another bounding volume

190
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,169
that kind of overlapped it right that

191
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:26,550
you could good work with but assuming

192
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:28,859
that you just had one like this then

193
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,509
this was actually ground and so it might

194
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,229
make some sense to say all right

195
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:36,360
maybe the ground is just defined the the

196
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:38,158
image of the ground is defined as being

197
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,218
something that's drawn sort of on this

198
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:43,949
bottom plate right and so that's one

199
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:49,379
thing we could say I it's a little

200
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:53,598
problematic though right because it has

201
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:56,158
this this issue and that issue is that

202
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,889
if we wanted to start making more

203
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:00,688
complex shapes right if we wanted to

204
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,879
start like carving out like let's say we

205
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:06,330
also carved out a little pit here by

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,129
adding another one of these right then

207
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:11,068
we wouldn't want the ground to be drawn

208
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:13,229
in there we'd want the ground ground the

209
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,718
ground to be drawn over here right and

210
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:17,490
we sort of have this nasty problem at

211
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:20,399
that point where how are we defining

212
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,538
like how would we know how this would

213
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,449
work how would we know how it was

214
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:27,808
clipped and so on in sand and

215
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:30,330
furthermore like when and how is this

216
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:32,729
bitmap being produced like I don't if we

217
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:34,978
have a giant world I don't want to store

218
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,449
that bitmap I don't want to store that

219
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,439
huge bitmap for the whole thing right I

220
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:43,019
want to store something a lot more

221
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:45,370
minimal so that I don't have to worry

222
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,570
about storing some gigantic data set

223
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,190
just to pre-produce the ground

224
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,960
especially when the ground is made up of

225
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:54,279
like you know if you take a look at this

226
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,600
from the top for looking at this you

227
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,570
know I don't want to store this giant

228
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,490
bitmap for the ground when really it was

229
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,670
just a bunch of like overlapping splats

230
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:07,149
anyway at worst I would just want to

231
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:09,519
store those splats right like all I'd

232
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:13,209
really want to do is store the splats

233
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,088
that went in here and and that seems to

234
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,470
me like a much more sane way to store it

235
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,029
because I could regenerate it pretty

236
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,110
easily from those splats and that gets

237
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:24,299
me out of the business of storing these

238
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,830
giant bitmaps and so how would I do that

239
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,629
storage along with the thing I don't

240
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,930
know it would need like the list of

241
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:34,929
splats like guess I'm not sure but point

242
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:38,349
being it's a little bit wonky but you

243
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:40,449
know we could do it so the next question

244
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,129
is let's say there's an ax button one

245
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,170
like you know there's another one over

246
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:45,519
here so it's like there's two rooms next

247
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:47,889
to each other maybe there's a doorway in

248
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,850
between them and we would like or maybe

249
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,649
there's nothing in between them maybe

250
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,350
just completely open right and it goes

251
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,939
this direction now what I'd like to do

252
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,980
especially if this is like so there's a

253
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,720
pit here you know it's like that and so

254
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,580
if we were to look at how this thing was

255
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,639
set up right there's another it

256
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:07,150
continues over here right this piece is

257
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:09,100
this piece here and when I'm building

258
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,079
these things together I want especially

259
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,310
if we are in an region where we want to

260
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,139
support smooth scrolling or something

261
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:18,069
like that we don't want there to be a

262
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:19,088
hard seam going across that sort of that

263
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,420
edge there right

264
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,339
I want this splat to contribute to here

265
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:25,899
so that we have a seamless texture that

266
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:28,000
goes all across and then there's be more

267
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,949
splats up here right and that's fine but

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,299
we want the ones that that work across

269
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:38,470
the boundary to work properly

270
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:41,289
right so you know there's definitely a

271
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,000
lot of there's a lot of tweaking us here

272
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:46,778
there's a lot of things to think about

273
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,789
so what I really need to do is I need

274
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:50,679
some way I think what I'm gonna need to

275
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:52,059
do if I want to do this the splat stuff

276
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,919
and and I don't think the splats

277
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,449
probably want to be entities really I

278
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,948
mean there's no need for destroy them

279
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,269
all those entities we could do that

280
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,559
the simplest way to do this obviously

281
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,879
would be to store all the slots as

282
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,409
entities but I mean then we're really

283
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,028
starting to talk about really

284
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,948
multiplying that entity account for no

285
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:08,809
reason because these things are just

286
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:11,498
things that produce a ground texture and

287
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,278
I don't know that we ever really want to

288
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:15,709
start talking about them as entities

289
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,120
they can't really get modified much even

290
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,768
if they could get modified we probably

291
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,318
wouldn't necessarily modify them in the

292
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:23,179
way that they would be entities right we

293
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:24,649
just kind of like overlay bitmaps on top

294
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:26,328
of them to show like scorch marks or

295
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,970
something right but we probably wouldn't

296
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:31,399
actually be modifying these things like

297
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,689
we wouldn't slide around the splats or

298
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,058
anything like that that doesn't seem

299
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:38,328
like a very logical thing for us to want

300
00:11:35,058 --> 00:11:39,289
to do and certainly not as a full entity

301
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:40,729
that's gonna have all these properties

302
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:42,230
and stuff it just doesn't seem like that

303
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,360
would be necessary now maybe I'll be

304
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,889
wrong about that and we'll see again all

305
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,329
of these things whenever you're going

306
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:49,818
through architecture stuff like this

307
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:52,188
you're just trying to do your best guess

308
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:55,308
first and you can never really be sure

309
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:57,019
when a game goes down you know through

310
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:58,730
the rest in production there's always

311
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,568
gonna be things where you find out you

312
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,009
were wrong and that's ok but you do want

313
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,878
at least try to make that initial guess

314
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,919
when you're doing your engine

315
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,050
architecture you want to have some

316
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,549
guiding principles there some reason to

317
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,169
suspect you might be right you don't

318
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:13,789
just want to do nothing or do the

319
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:16,278
easiest thing because then you're really

320
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:19,278
not doing your job setting the engine up

321
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:21,259
for success right so anyway

322
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,610
and that's just again part of the that's

323
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,188
sort of the same mentality with right

324
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,259
the usage case first right it's like you

325
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:29,088
want to try and do something that you

326
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:31,068
really think is what the game will

327
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,189
actually do when you're designing the

328
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:35,750
engine you want that to sort of drive

329
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,889
how the engine works you don't want to

330
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,929
just do whatever is easiest in the

331
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,909
engine or something like that or ignore

332
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,349
a problem till later on you want to try

333
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:44,028
and envision okay how do I actually make

334
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,420
this work let's try to make that work in

335
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:49,129
a first pass that we have a reasonable

336
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:55,669
set up there that we believe might

337
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:57,678
actually be effective okay so there's

338
00:12:55,669 --> 00:13:00,259
some pretty easy ways I could store the

339
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:02,480
splat list right and so I'm thinking

340
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,068
that basically that one of the easiest

341
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,230
things to do would probably just store

342
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:09,289
the splat list as something that

343
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,870
actually you know exactly as we were to

344
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,459
to use it before

345
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,200
so if you look at this draw test ground

346
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,629
you can see the parameters coming in

347
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,250
here are essentially nothing right it's

348
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,929
basically just a width and height of a

349
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,809
buffer that needs to get composited and

350
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:25,509
then a random seed that just is like you

351
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:27,039
know some some value that we're saying

352
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:29,169
to seed the random number with and then

353
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,089
it's just picking random values now I

354
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,889
don't think that'll be the entirety of

355
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,420
it I think we're gonna add more

356
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:37,029
complicated stuff like when we want to

357
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:38,529
have like dirt roads going like paths

358
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,360
going through things or stuff like that

359
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:41,199
we're gonna have more information here

360
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,230
so it's gonna be a little more

361
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:49,870
complicated than that but on the whole

362
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:52,930
if we were to generate one of these

363
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,259
splat sets really all we would need is

364
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:58,000
some notion of how big we want to seem

365
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:00,639
to be like the radius how big we want

366
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,559
the splat region to be how many splats

367
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,929
we want it to do or some other metrics

368
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,589
like that right that's really all we

369
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:10,449
need to do in order to put this thing

370
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:12,820
together without actually having to

371
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,800
store where the things went so we don't

372
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,540
need to store all hundred grasses we

373
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,639
don't need to store all hundred stones

374
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:20,079
or whatever it's flats that we did we

375
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,879
can just store something that's net that

376
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,790
we use to generate those and that will

377
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,889
be sufficient so I'm thinking that you

378
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:28,659
know storing the splat list is going to

379
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,689
be something pretty simple it's gonna be

380
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:33,879
something like you know sort of some

381
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:37,240
definition of the region to splat some

382
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,710
definition of what - splat right but

383
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,639
that's really all we're gonna need to do

384
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,620
for that I think

385
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,949
and then we'll regenerate it so the more

386
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,769
complex thing I think in general is

387
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:50,440
going to be about figuring out the shape

388
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:53,079
of the ground right because where the

389
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,230
ground is really has to do with what

390
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,290
those spatial entities are that have

391
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,580
been set up those empty space entities

392
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:03,849
and that's a little bit more complicated

393
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,530
to do right we kind of have to have some

394
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,149
sort of an opinion about where that

395
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:11,079
ground is and it's it's a little bit

396
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:13,539
tricky now what I think I could do is

397
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:17,080
basically when I am pulling in when I'm

398
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:19,599
doing the rendering right I'm gonna know

399
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,520
for any given screen right I'm gonna

400
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
know all the spatial entities that over

401
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,208
that are

402
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,069
involved right and so I'm gonna have a

403
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:29,198
notion of like here's all the spatial

404
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:30,639
entities that have been defined you know

405
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,909
on the screen or something like that

406
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:38,139
that overlap the screen you know on

407
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:39,429
every in every at every Z level right so

408
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:42,459
there might be some down here as well

409
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:45,250
and so on and so forth right so what I

410
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:47,349
could do is imagine the essentially

411
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,809
taking slices through the world right

412
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,209
saying okay there's going to be some

413
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:53,909
fixed number of Z levels so there's some

414
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:57,789
going to be some fixed number of Z

415
00:15:53,909 --> 00:16:00,338
levels in the game right that are

416
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:01,929
visible at any given time we have one z

417
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:03,370
level which is like whatever the players

418
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:05,438
standing on to some degree or whatever

419
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,720
is you know fairly close to that and

420
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:10,659
maybe you know that is is sort of this

421
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,300
region here right these are the empty

422
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:15,458
spaces that that are sort of all lined

423
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,778
up with where the player is standing and

424
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,338
then maybe there's some that are

425
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:20,139
actually like below where the players

426
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:23,110
standing as well so maybe this one is

427
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:25,269
like a lower Z level so maybe this is

428
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,159
you know a Z equals you know negative

429
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:28,299
one and this is Z equals zero or

430
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,588
whatever you know we're not really

431
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:32,139
assigning any values here but just

432
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,839
thinking how that goes and so what I

433
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:38,159
could do certainly is I could build up a

434
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,579
region and say okay this is you know

435
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:45,909
roughly what has to be regenerated right

436
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:48,669
for the ground I could sort of build up

437
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:51,730
that region and say let's go ahead and

438
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:53,469
build up the splats that are in these

439
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,480
regions we'll build them up and we'll

440
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,399
clip them to whatever this region looks

441
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,129
like right so as you move around

442
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:02,620
we'll just regenerate whatever we need

443
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:06,640
to you know what I'm saying because

444
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,439
really the each Z level could have its

445
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,839
own buffer that's as big as we want in

446
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,610
terms for caching so we could be working

447
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:14,558
on a buffer that's that's fairly large

448
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:16,750
right that we just used for caching and

449
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,338
then when it Scrolls if there's a region

450
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,828
of it that hasn't been filled yet we'll

451
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:22,538
fill it but it's not quite as simple as

452
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:24,970
that because that region has to have

453
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:26,619
holes in it right in other words like I

454
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,568
was saying if this is the edge let's say

455
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,129
this you know a better example maybe

456
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:32,500
would be to say let's say we're looking

457
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,200
at a place where the hero is standing on

458
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,079
some stuff here right and the hero is up

459
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,028
here

460
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,710
and they're stuffed down below so

461
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:41,868
there's a Ledge that they're kind of

462
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,139
looking over right and there's another

463
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:47,480
region here and so if this region here

464
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:50,178
is at a different Z level than this

465
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,038
region here then we need sort of two

466
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,980
right there's two buffers at play here

467
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:58,609
there's the one that's that's up higher

468
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,690
right that the player is standing on and

469
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:01,548
then there's that one that's lower

470
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,999
and we can't composite them both into

471
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:07,460
the same region in terms of if we're

472
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:08,839
doing some sort of lazy sort of building

473
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,788
of what the what these things look like

474
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,648
we can't do them both into the same

475
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:14,808
buffer and the reason for that is that

476
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:17,058
this layer will move at a different rate

477
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:18,648
than this layer you know potentially if

478
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:21,200
we want there to be that like parallax

479
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:24,589
happening then when the hero like moves

480
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,569
this way right this line is going to

481
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:28,759
move this way faster than this thing

482
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:31,579
moves this way right that's just how

483
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:34,358
that's going to work and so I I don't

484
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:38,689
really know exactly how we want to

485
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:40,249
handle this the easiest way is if we

486
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,869
could just know ahead of time that

487
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:44,929
there's a certain number of Z slices

488
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:47,298
right and and so you know what I would

489
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:50,298
like to be able to do is say all right

490
00:18:47,298 --> 00:18:52,878
add a maximum we've got some depth some

491
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:56,480
number of Z slices right so there's like

492
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:59,778
our Z zero slice you know our our z1 our

493
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,239
z2 r z3 and these don't correspond to

494
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:03,888
actual Z's in some sense they're really

495
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:06,200
layers in fact I could say that this is

496
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:09,199
really more it's not Z it's just depth

497
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,859
right so this is like depth 0 this is

498
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,679
depth 1 depth 2 type 3 right and like

499
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:18,319
depth 0 might be above the player so

500
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,499
this is above the player this is like at

501
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:24,108
the player you know this is below the

502
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:27,079
player and this is like a second layer

503
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:28,668
of below right and so normally you don't

504
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:30,168
see this one unless you're transitioning

505
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,109
so if the player is kind of going up

506
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,639
into this layer then they will actually

507
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:36,618
experience it right they will see it

508
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:38,418
come in and it will kind of blend in but

509
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:41,658
then it will become the at layer again

510
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:43,278
right and similarly these below layers

511
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:44,990
will work the same way like if you were

512
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:47,148
walking down the stairs then this layer

513
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,230
comes up at you this one comes up at you

514
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,559
and then a new one comes in from the

515
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,370
bottom right and the

516
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,230
at layer becomes that above layer so if

517
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:57,029
you think about it we sort of you know

518
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,370
what I'd like to do is have this sort of

519
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,869
notion that the game has to work within

520
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:03,959
some constraints you can't have

521
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:06,299
arbitrary stuff going on here because

522
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,690
we're not a 3d renderer and that would

523
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,700
caused a bunch of problems right so

524
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,680
that's probably the way that I'd most

525
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,430
like to look at it because that would be

526
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,140
really kind of easy to conceptualize

527
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:24,269
again the problem with it is it wouldn't

528
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:27,390
let us do sort of arbitrary stuff it

529
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:29,309
wouldn't let us have arbitrary levels of

530
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,410
ground right so if we wanted another

531
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,359
piece of ground thing in here we you

532
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,519
know we couldn't have ground be doing

533
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,929
all these weird sorts of things right so

534
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,789
if we wanted to have like another ledge

535
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,310
in there and another legend here and so

536
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:43,589
on that becomes much more difficult if

537
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,659
we were to do it this way

538
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:48,509
and so there's kind of like a tension

539
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,990
there in terms of how we want to do that

540
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:55,470
compositing now we could also again say

541
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,230
that we're just gonna do it will allow

542
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,970
as many depth layers as as show up right

543
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,579
that's something that could totally be

544
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:07,230
plausible but I just don't know how

545
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:08,879
realistic that actually is so I don't

546
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,559
know I might sort of look at it this way

547
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,060
for now and then if when we get in there

548
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,559
if it turns out that there's an easy way

549
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,480
to make it more general maybe we will

550
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,769
but I'm thinking that just based on also

551
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,779
the way the game is sort of

552
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:22,200
conceptualized where there just isn't a

553
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:24,779
lot of complex Z level stuff happening

554
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,940
in in terms of like walking up little

555
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,500
mounds or little things and going down

556
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,450
I don't know this will be necessary

557
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,809
because remember this is only for the

558
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,090
ground so objects that are on here can

559
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:38,190
be all kinds of Heights in here so we

560
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:40,049
can certainly we can AB objects that

561
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,940
give us sort of more height interest in

562
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,740
here they just won't be part of like the

563
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,360
ground compositing stuff with the

564
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:51,450
seamless texturing and that sort of

565
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:52,559
thing right so yeah that is that is what

566
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,630
I'm thinking in terms of Ground

567
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,950
generation is we have some fixed number

568
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,520
of layers and then those layers called

569
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:03,179
upon now again what we need to do is we

570
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,028
need to figure out a good way of you

571
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,070
having the ground actually knowing where

572
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:11,159
where that ground actually is and isn't

573
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:16,979
right and so again what we're looking at

574
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:19,139
there is if we if we think about how

575
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:20,848
we've defined this if we have some kind

576
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:23,218
of definition for the space where the

577
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:25,499
space you know we sort of said there's

578
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:27,419
empty space here and there's empty space

579
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:30,269
here you know and there's empty space

580
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:32,669
here or even like this so it turns out

581
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:34,858
to be just like a hole right here that

582
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:38,009
you can see down into or something like

583
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:41,189
this if we have something like that or

584
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:42,778
or or even if we have something that's a

585
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,330
little bit different where we carved out

586
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:48,148
empty space for the whole thing and then

587
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:50,699
did a region you know in the middle that

588
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:53,368
was supposed to fill it back in right so

589
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,989
you know this was empty space all here

590
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:56,819
but then there was like a solid piece

591
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:59,489
here and or something like that I'm not

592
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:02,038
sure exactly what but a way of defining

593
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:04,769
it so that we used a large empty area

594
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:05,460
but then we sort of filled it in or who

595
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,378
knows what

596
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,538
I guess the trivial example here

597
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:11,939
actually I can draw it in 3d pretty

598
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:15,419
easily right is let's say we made the

599
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,820
empty space like we did here and we go

600
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:22,589
back to that pit oops that pit example

601
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:25,138
right so I I draw a pit entity I'm not

602
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:26,908
entity empty space it is still an entity

603
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:29,098
but you know what I'm saying so there's

604
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,989
a pit in here right and so that means

605
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:33,749
that if we wanted to generate the ground

606
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:37,679
for this region right that thing looks

607
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:39,028
like this right this is the actual

608
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,450
region that wants to get filled with

609
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:44,819
ground and we don't want this region to

610
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,580
be filled we want that to remain this

611
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:51,178
should be like alpha zero in here right

612
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:53,278
so that we don't have any you know so

613
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,099
that we can see into that pit which was

614
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:58,079
you know the intention of whatever the

615
00:23:55,098 --> 00:24:02,759
level was at the time where generated

616
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,378
that kind of a setup and so when we

617
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,210
think about that it's relatively easy

618
00:24:04,378 --> 00:24:08,128
for us to sort of flatten these

619
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,509
rectangles and say okay this rectangle

620
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:13,439
here but it's harder for us to think

621
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:15,419
about how we would do this part and I

622
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,650
guess what would what we would probably

623
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:19,590
do

624
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:22,860
he's just splat the actual you know

625
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:25,168
maybe we just splat the actual region in

626
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:28,558
its entirety meaning including this part

627
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:33,480
and then have these fill-in alpha0

628
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:37,349
regions where they occur right that you

629
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,778
know seems like perhaps the more logical

630
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,579
thing to do here not sure but that just

631
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:45,390
seems like what would what would make

632
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:47,308
the most sense you know so I don't know

633
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:50,429
that seems like that seems like possibly

634
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:52,558
the way we might want to do it and if we

635
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,509
were to do it that way it wouldn't be

636
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,308
too difficult really for us to figure

637
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:58,710
out what to do with the ground really

638
00:24:56,308 --> 00:25:01,048
all we'd have to do to figure out what

639
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,710
to do with the ground is fill the whole

640
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:07,048
area with ground right and then look for

641
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,019
any empty space regions that are carving

642
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:12,690
out places so it really be mostly just

643
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,220
about carving out the ground and never

644
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,649
really about filling it in because we

645
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,419
could always just feel more of it in

646
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:20,418
that doesn't sound like a bad idea to me

647
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:32,099
that seems pretty reasonable yeah that

648
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,719
seems pretty reasonable so maybe that's

649
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:35,219
the way I'll look at it for now we'll

650
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,759
say that empty space things are gonna

651
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,860
carve out regions like that we'll start

652
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,750
with that and then the other thing that

653
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:44,519
we'll do is again we'll sort of try to

654
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,919
we'll try to work out how we're gonna do

655
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,509
this depth peeling thing so I guess the

656
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:53,038
way that will maybe do that is we'll

657
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:56,759
have this notion and we'll just sort

658
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:59,339
things into there by ground entities you

659
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:02,759
know empty space entities that happen to

660
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:05,359
have their min fall near one of these

661
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:09,329
wherever these depth layers happen to be

662
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:12,000
will get sorted into there as as being

663
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:14,398
ground or rather we'll just use I guess

664
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,079
the depth of needs to cut out based on

665
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:20,278
whether they overlap these depth layers

666
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:23,189
that were peeling out right does that

667
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:25,259
seem like a good idea I don't know I'm a

668
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,330
little bit nervous about the fact that

669
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:29,129
we're doing this a little bit ad hoc in

670
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:32,250
terms of knowing where the ground

671
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,830
to draw it like like that but I don't

672
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,170
know really how else we would do it in

673
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:39,839
this circumstance because again we we

674
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,400
really don't want to go full pull and

675
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,109
start to try and like have each of these

676
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,090
entities have its own sort of

677
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:47,129
constructive solid geometry happen the

678
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,929
FEM produces like a textured area that

679
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,150
we then like it seems like you'd be

680
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,250
spending a ton of work to not really do

681
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,140
much since you know that the action is

682
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,599
fundamentally taking place on a few

683
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,220
separate planes and so my question is

684
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,779
just like it you know is there any

685
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,390
reason not to just say that there's a

686
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:05,160
fixed plane like there's a fixed set of

687
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:09,330
those planes and we'll just kind of have

688
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:13,019
those we'll just acknowledge those and

689
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:14,759
build them that way does seem alright I

690
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,500
mean that seems pretty reasonable to me

691
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,710
I don't know that seems like something

692
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,690
that we could we could work with and so

693
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,269
really the only question we have then is

694
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,920
if we need to produce a region right if

695
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,779
we need to produce one of these regions

696
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,910
the question is what are the splats for

697
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,589
the region and what we could do for now

698
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,130
is say well we're just gonna produce

699
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:36,809
those splats purely based on some you

700
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,840
know we won't even store what the splats

701
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:42,480
are basically we'll produce those splats

702
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,839
entirely from some kind of a random

703
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,360
number

704
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,069
oops some kind of a random number that's

705
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,949
seated off where we are in the world

706
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:51,659
right so you know if you think about it

707
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,740
like let's say that we're going to

708
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,690
produce this region we've got like some

709
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,750
buffer and we're trying to fill this

710
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,640
area right if we imagine whatever

711
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,220
there's sort of like some underlying

712
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,430
resolution at which we want to consider

713
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,140
splatting right we could just say all

714
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,970
right for each of these areas you know

715
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,950
and this is maybe the five meter radius

716
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,870
like we were doing before for each of

717
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,850
these regions wherever may be wherever

718
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:20,639
the center point is we just use that as

719
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:24,049
the random seed we do the splats for

720
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,820
this region right and so for every

721
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:29,519
region that we want to composite we just

722
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:31,079
see all of the tiles that that would

723
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,420
overlap very much like our tile chunk

724
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:35,939
system works for example we just see all

725
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,500
of the overlaps in that area and we do

726
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,660
all the splats that we would need to do

727
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,650
that could touch that area right but we

728
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,060
don't actually store anything to the

729
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,630
splats they're just generated based on

730
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,589
the spatial

731
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:49,370
patient right that seems pretty safe to

732
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:49,369
me

733
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,860
can't think of any reason not to really

734
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,930
so let's let's see let's let's try it

735
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,990
that way and and we'll see what happens

736
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:04,529
so let's first modify let's first get it

737
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,690
working just with a single ground plane

738
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:08,730
so like the first step the step will try

739
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,580
to start today with a single ground

740
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,410
plane let's just try to make the ground

741
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:17,309
plane scroll infinitely in all

742
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:18,870
directions so when we walk around when

743
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:20,429
when our hero walks around there will

744
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:21,929
always be ground and it will generate

745
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,960
and it's always fresh ground it's new

746
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:26,370
right so and it's never you know it

747
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,470
doesn't repeat it's not repeating text

748
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:31,019
or it's being generated on the fly right

749
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,120
let's see if we can do that we've

750
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,349
already sort of got a little bit of bit

751
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,379
of that happening with a draw test

752
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:40,409
ground let's see if we can do it so that

753
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,450
that that will work right so the way

754
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,340
that I'm gonna do that is I'm gonna use

755
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,990
exactly all the same stuff we already

756
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:48,240
did so we've got this loaded pit map

757
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,740
ground buffer here right but I'm gonna

758
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,779
take that ground buffer and I'm gonna

759
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,210
make that ground buffer relatively large

760
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:56,099
right so what I want to do is I want to

761
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,059
say that the ground buffer is going to

762
00:29:56,099 --> 00:30:02,879
be big enough so that if it were you

763
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:04,589
know if it had to scale up one right if

764
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,510
it had to I'm sorry I've said the scale

765
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:08,730
down one so for example if the ground

766
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:10,890
buffer if I started walking up a

767
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,660
stairwell and the ground had to recede

768
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,240
into the background there would still be

769
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,240
enough apron around it so that it would

770
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,970
it would be able to to cover that region

771
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,009
right and so I'm not sure exactly how we

772
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,049
want to we're still at unfortunate a

773
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:27,359
little bit of an unfortunate place in

774
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:29,279
terms of not having written the renderer

775
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,679
yet we don't know exactly all the ways

776
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,359
in which this should be driven but we do

777
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,779
have that input buffer and we know how

778
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,909
big that is right so we know that like

779
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:41,460
our you know our actual render buffer

780
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,660
there that got passed into us we know

781
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,210
how big that is

782
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,730
so we could start with that size right

783
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,950
so we could say you know the the screen

784
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,870
width or I should say the the display

785
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,430
width or something like that and I know

786
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:55,109
we thought we'll call it screamin so we

787
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,700
could say that the screen width right is

788
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:58,949
is known

789
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,840
because we got it from the platform

790
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,399
layer right when when the platform layer

791
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,839
passed the start game launched off

792
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,319
stream buffer it told us how big that

793
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:10,980
was in pixels right so we we actually do

794
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:15,358
know that right so we've got those two

795
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,999
things now we also know that we're gonna

796
00:31:15,358 --> 00:31:20,759
have to have some amount of Z scaling

797
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:22,528
that will make these things appear

798
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:25,679
smaller as they recede into the distance

799
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:27,089
right so if we wanted to think about it

800
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,038
this way we could say all right let's

801
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:31,738
suppose this were a real the screen

802
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:35,700
width right so then we could say well

803
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:38,278
our lowest depth layer has to be big

804
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,649
enough so that the pixels right that are

805
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:45,388
in it still you know cover the screen

806
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:46,678
you know trying to just give you it give

807
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:47,689
you an idea here of what I'm talking

808
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,929
about

809
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:53,759
if this is the screen then if we wanted

810
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:56,369
to have ground that filled this region

811
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,079
all we would have to use right is we

812
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:59,398
just use a buffer that was the width of

813
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,408
the screen times the height of the

814
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,658
screen right it's like that's width by

815
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:04,950
height that would that would store all

816
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:08,519
the pixels that we're gonna display on

817
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:11,069
screen right but now if we imagine that

818
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,450
this screen actually recedes into the

819
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:14,970
into the distance of the book because

820
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,038
the hero walks up the stairs right so if

821
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,749
the hero walks up stairs now we have a

822
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,368
case where this is actually the screen

823
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:22,618
and what used to be the screen is

824
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:24,868
actually like a lower depth level right

825
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:28,099
that we're looking into and so now it

826
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:31,319
has to actually be wider and taller

827
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:34,528
right in order to actually fill the

828
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:36,839
whole screen and so what we need to know

829
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:39,329
there is what our Z scaling factor

830
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,749
actually is between the very top level

831
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:44,128
and the very bottom level right and we

832
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:46,379
don't actually know what that what that

833
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:49,498
actually is yet but we can at least set

834
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:52,168
ourselves up for success by saying that

835
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:54,538
we have some maximum Z scale that's

836
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:57,440
going to happen you know and maybe

837
00:32:54,538 --> 00:33:01,408
that's half the size or something right

838
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:05,788
that would be all we would actually have

839
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:07,440
to do in order to that that would be the

840
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:09,480
minimum we'd actually have to do right

841
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,390
Birds I started the maximum size we have

842
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,970
to do

843
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,020
for one of these buffers now at first we

844
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,430
don't have to worry about that because

845
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:17,079
we're only allocating one of them but

846
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,450
we're gonna allocate more of them so so

847
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,819
the first one could actually be just

848
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:25,390
just that one size and so what I'm gonna

849
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:28,119
say here is just our overscan our ground

850
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:30,940
overscan I guess we'll say that that's

851
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:33,279
1.2 and all I'm doing there I'm pulling

852
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:37,150
that number totally randomly out of thin

853
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,799
air is we're gonna over scan a little

854
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,860
bit we're gonna compute a little bit

855
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,710
extra so that when we scroll we don't

856
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:46,269
have to update quite as often right it's

857
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,880
not it doesn't have to update every

858
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:51,400
frame necessarily so we might want to

859
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,020
just do some over-over scan to to make

860
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,120
it so that we we have more time there

861
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:56,559
and really where that comes in that'll

862
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,149
come into play later probably when we're

863
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,829
doing multi-threading when we have

864
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,210
threads in the background that are doing

865
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,549
stuff like ground compositing or

866
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:07,150
whatever else we don't want them to have

867
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:08,829
to hit every frame a complete update and

868
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,809
so like for example when the hero walks

869
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:12,190
sideways we want you know when this sort

870
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:14,529
of starts to scroll we want there to be

871
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,539
time where we know we have to fill in

872
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,210
something we want there to be some time

873
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:20,889
where we can do that right so I don't

874
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:25,210
know maybe it's maybe it's more than

875
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:27,369
that I'm not sure but let's go ahead and

876
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,679
say that we've got some ground over scan

877
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:32,529
of having an extra half there and so

878
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,980
what we end up with in terms of our base

879
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:38,350
ground level right so our ground buffer

880
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,329
width is going to be whatever the screen

881
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:46,480
is times that ground overscan right

882
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:49,989
that's going to be its width and we can

883
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,849
we can round that guy so round and same

884
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:55,509
with the height right the heights just

885
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:57,099
going to be that that same thing and so

886
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,690
now that we have those we could say all

887
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:00,069
right let's make an empty bitmap that's

888
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,550
the ground buffer width in the ground

889
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:05,769
buffer height like so and that'll just

890
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,490
give us that backing store that we

891
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:14,009
wanted that's sorry that's an indirect

892
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:16,349
reference there what's

893
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:20,460
not casting clear real are you happy

894
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:22,079
about that there we go so that that

895
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,550
gives me enough space now I don't know

896
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,199
we probably need to start using the

897
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,750
transient area but that's separator so

898
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,368
that gives us enough space now to

899
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,679
produce something that we could scroll

900
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:34,410
with and so now what we need to do is we

901
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:38,039
need to go in and actually partition

902
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:40,199
that into something that we can can use

903
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,840
in a more illogical way right we need to

904
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:46,019
be able to scroll that around now what

905
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,079
we can do first right is we can we can

906
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,639
introduce some notion of where the

907
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,690
ground is so that it moves with the

908
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,579
camera

909
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,440
that's like obviously something that we

910
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,670
would want to do as well so what we

911
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,590
could do first is let's get it moving

912
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,970
with the camera and we're going to want

913
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,850
to move the camera in such a way that

914
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:05,219
you know for those of you again who

915
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:06,868
aren't familiar with this when we move

916
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:10,049
with the camera when we move this with

917
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:14,400
the camera what's going to happen is

918
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:18,030
we've got the buffer here right and we

919
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,970
have the screen here that we're seeing

920
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:24,210
now as the hero moves in a particular

921
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:28,108
direction it will get to a part a point

922
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:30,679
where the buffer is is at like the end

923
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:34,250
of where it could logically be right

924
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:36,269
like we can't move any further over and

925
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,500
while the player is moving that way

926
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:39,269
they're going to keep moving that way

927
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,550
what we then need to do is recenter that

928
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:43,250
buffer so then what we do when we come

929
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,660
down here when we know when we've got

930
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:51,750
the situation here is we sort of

931
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:54,690
teleport back to - like here right so as

932
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:57,119
the as the player continues to move in

933
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,760
that direction we then teleport them

934
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,400
back into the space and the buffer by

935
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,030
basically taking all of the stuff that

936
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,789
was in the buffer here and copying it

937
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:11,070
backwards right so we just placed the

938
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:12,900
player's view into the buffer backwards

939
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,030
and we also move everything that was in

940
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,160
the buffer backwards right so that now

941
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,540
it's like that and now this region is

942
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,250
ready for filling and we can fill that

943
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:22,469
with new ground splats and the player

944
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,329
can keep walking that direction right so

945
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:27,719
we're just kind of like doing that kind

946
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:29,009
of standard sort of

947
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,679
allow them to scroll through it then

948
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:34,080
Phil then you know copy back Phil let's

949
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,819
go through a copy back Phil and like I

950
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,079
said this won't be multi-threaded at the

951
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,559
moment so we're gonna have a hiccup

952
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,340
every time that happens because we don't

953
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,108
we

954
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,210
composite very slowly right now so

955
00:37:43,108 --> 00:37:46,619
that'll happen but that's fine that's

956
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,210
not a problem that's something that will

957
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,400
solve over time and so we'll just you

958
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,769
know we'll be okay with that but we got

959
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,760
to get the rest of the stuff working

960
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,829
before we can think about stuff like

961
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,300
hiding that computation time like or

962
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:59,098
speeding it up first of all and then

963
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,440
also hiding it by putting it on a

964
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,269
separate thread or doing something else

965
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,750
so what I want to do now is I want to

966
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:09,269
say all right let's let's actually move

967
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:12,420
that thing so what I need to do there is

968
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:16,320
I need to have some notion of where the

969
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:18,750
ground buffer is relative to the camera

970
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,349
right so I need to kind of know you know

971
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:25,199
where where is this and probably the

972
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:27,510
easiest thing to do I guess is to use

973
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:31,259
our sort of location stuff like our

974
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:34,589
camera P right it's probably easiest to

975
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,270
use the ground buffer as one of those so

976
00:38:34,588 --> 00:38:38,519
we'll start it out coincident with the

977
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:40,559
camera then we'll let the camera move

978
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,429
away from it and then when it gets too

979
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:46,289
far we'll kind of snap it in right

980
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:48,299
that's what I'm thinking anyway so if I

981
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:52,159
wanted to do that the first thing that I

982
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,210
need to do is I need to say all right

983
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,559
we're drawing a bitmap that's the ground

984
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,329
buffer here we need to know where that

985
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,789
ground buffer is relative to the camera

986
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:02,130
we know that there's the screen Center X

987
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:05,429
screen Center Y right and so if I was to

988
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:08,789
draw it like this screen Center X screen

989
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:11,699
Center Y well it would also kind of have

990
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:15,269
to be offset by how large it was as well

991
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:16,949
so there is that I think we want to

992
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,780
basically draw off the center so that's

993
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:24,618
the competition I'm going to use so

994
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:27,960
we'll do ground X and ground Y like so

995
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:32,789
so if we put in the ground X ground Y

996
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:35,789
here then what we need to compute is

997
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:39,150
from the screen Center we need to move

998
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:40,710
back to the upper corner so that this

999
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,170
bitmap is still drawing out of the upper

1000
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:46,170
corner so we need to subtract however

1001
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,809
big that ground buffer actually is right

1002
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,750
we need to subtract half of that to move

1003
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:53,608
back to its appropriate location so I'm

1004
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,559
just gonna do that here again pretty

1005
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:57,960
straightforward nothing the same same

1006
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,509
math you've seen me do on here a billion

1007
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,699
times so that's gonna draw it at the

1008
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,960
center I believe of the screen and

1009
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,000
that's exactly what it did so that's

1010
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,369
good and so now what I want to do is I

1011
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,369
want to displace it by however much the

1012
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:12,900
camera has moved right so I'm gonna make

1013
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:14,910
this in I think I'm gonna make this into

1014
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,150
a V - why not just so it could be a

1015
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:21,659
little easier on me and there we go

1016
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:24,660
and so if I go ahead and make this

1017
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:26,699
ground now displaced by that difference

1018
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:30,480
you'll remember that we have a very easy

1019
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:32,719
way to find that out it's it's in here

1020
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,719
somewhere

1021
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,130
let's find it again

1022
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:42,250
subtract that's it so if I want to take

1023
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,640
two of these guys and subtract them I

1024
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:48,760
want to see basically how far is the

1025
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:50,920
ground buffer from the camera right so

1026
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,528
I've got that game state that camera P

1027
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,068
and I've got that ground buffer P I want

1028
00:40:53,528 --> 00:41:00,969
to see how far away those are and that

1029
00:40:57,068 --> 00:41:04,480
returns me back I believe a v3 right and

1030
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:06,818
so that's that Delta like so now I'm

1031
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,108
gonna ignore the the Z of it but later

1032
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:10,838
on I think we'll probably want to use

1033
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:12,518
that because we're gonna use that for

1034
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:14,108
doing like the ground scaling and other

1035
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:16,808
stuff like that so we'll probably

1036
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:18,548
actually use that later on just just not

1037
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:22,599
right now so I'm going to go ahead and

1038
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:25,268
add that Delta in and oops I got

1039
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,838
actually passed the game world there

1040
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:32,229
probably huh world position and these

1041
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:35,108
want to be addresses so I've got them so

1042
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:38,559
now if I run it we should see it move

1043
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:41,650
and it is moving and so oh well you know

1044
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,690
it's moving but it's moving in pixels

1045
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,130
not meters this is in meters and this is

1046
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,809
in pixels this is actually a render

1047
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:50,769
operation so we need to actually take

1048
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:52,890
and and do our meters to pixels here so

1049
00:41:50,768 --> 00:41:55,028
that we can do our rendering properly

1050
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:56,920
and I feel like that was already it

1051
00:41:55,028 --> 00:42:00,400
that's also going the wrong direction in

1052
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,778
Y which is because again are we kind of

1053
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,210
needs something that does our render

1054
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:06,130
transform for us that's what the render

1055
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,960
would normally be doing and we haven't

1056
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,720
written it yet and it's kind of annoying

1057
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:14,980
to constantly have to do this ourselves

1058
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:16,719
right but you know it's one of those

1059
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,548
things that do we take the time to go do

1060
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,739
that or we just keep fussing with this

1061
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:22,509
stuff and it feels to me like we want to

1062
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:25,568
just keep fussing with this stuff for

1063
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:26,980
the most part just because you know

1064
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:28,750
you've got to kind of pick and choose

1065
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,719
when you do each individual battles so

1066
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,699
like you know that Delta there we want

1067
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:35,528
it to be you know we want it to be in

1068
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:36,969
our pixel coordinate system and it's

1069
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:39,460
coming out in our world core system

1070
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:43,419
where Y goes up which is always going to

1071
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:45,519
be wrong so anyway yeah that's that's

1072
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:48,400
what we would have expected so now it's

1073
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:49,750
locked with the world correctly we

1074
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,300
probably

1075
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,789
want to start by saying that at the

1076
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,950
outset it's where the camera is right

1077
00:42:54,789 --> 00:43:00,159
that seems like a pretty sane thing to

1078
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:02,109
do so our game state ground buffer P you

1079
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:07,359
know should start out being wherever the

1080
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:09,730
games take camera P is like that and

1081
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,150
then when we walk it should you know be

1082
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:14,769
there right and so what we need to do

1083
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,450
now is we need to say whenever our

1084
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,789
ground buffer would be getting to the

1085
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:22,269
point where it would run out of pixel

1086
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:25,389
coverage right we want to snap it

1087
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:27,519
towards the cameras direction right so

1088
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:30,279
we need to do like that copy and we need

1089
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:33,759
to yeah we basically need to do the copy

1090
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:36,970
we need to change the location of it so

1091
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,980
what I'd like to do for that first of

1092
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:40,629
all what I'd really like to do is not be

1093
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,179
constrained anymore

1094
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:47,110
by these trees so I think what I might

1095
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:50,739
do is temporarily turn off this

1096
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:54,070
generation stuff entirely so so let's go

1097
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:57,759
ahead and do that let's go ahead and get

1098
00:43:54,070 --> 00:44:04,269
rid of those those let's get rid of that

1099
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:08,080
Chris do put the walls back in don't

1100
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:12,130
forget yeah but while we're doing this

1101
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,900
you know so there we have it right now I

1102
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,309
can just walk around randomly and like I

1103
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,809
said the problem is that when we get to

1104
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:19,179
the end of the ground

1105
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:21,250
we can't oh you know what we need more

1106
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:22,659
empty space though too don't we because

1107
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,039
we wouldn't have much empty space but

1108
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:26,440
this might be enough for me to do my

1109
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,269
testing on it anyway although I could

1110
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,320
make that empty space just really large

1111
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:38,980
as well let's take a look where is the

1112
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:43,690
empty space adder let's see the empty

1113
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:46,869
space adder add standard room is right

1114
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:50,880
there uh well you know what else I could

1115
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:54,900
do this is what I'll do I'll just say

1116
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:58,720
that we'll go back to the old way of

1117
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:02,470
fate you know forcing it not to create a

1118
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,519
Z door right so when it does this random

1119
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:05,679
choice thing

1120
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:09,550
I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and say no

1121
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:11,349
you know it's only allowed to generate

1122
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,330
flat stuff and that'll let me do my

1123
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,659
walking that I wanted to do so there we

1124
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:16,150
go

1125
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:19,149
now we're good everyone's happy

1126
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:21,430
everyone's everyone's smiling good to go

1127
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,940
and similarly I think we can turn off

1128
00:45:21,429 --> 00:45:27,039
the thing that like we had a thing that

1129
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,570
only generates like one room or

1130
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,269
something like that right we stopped

1131
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:34,450
doing our actual room generation in some

1132
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:36,909
way we can we can probably put that back

1133
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:40,539
in now right so that we have more rooms

1134
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:42,549
there's more stuff in them alright so

1135
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:44,590
now we've got you know those rooms back

1136
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,690
you can walk through them it's all good

1137
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,760
and so now let's just try to make it

1138
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:51,570
fill with ground you know what I'm

1139
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,980
saying so when we walk up here right and

1140
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:55,450
you know and we walk into this room we

1141
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,130
want it there to be grounded here as

1142
00:45:55,449 --> 00:46:01,210
well we want that to just be constantly

1143
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:03,820
generating itself right so how do we do

1144
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:06,519
that well first thing we probably want

1145
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,460
to do is when we actually generate stuff

1146
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:11,320
here we want to generate we want to

1147
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:13,840
generate the screen in some kind of an

1148
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:21,820
intelligent way so let's think about how

1149
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:23,740
we want to do this I guess it's kind of

1150
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:26,740
a rote issue we don't really need to

1151
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:30,129
tile it this is pretty straightforward I

1152
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:32,679
think so I think if we do our draw test

1153
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:34,390
ground thing here right really all we

1154
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:35,559
need to do is say when you do draw test

1155
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:38,559
ground make sure you fill the whole

1156
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,659
buffer right so in draw test ground when

1157
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,730
this is doing its thing what we want to

1158
00:46:40,659 --> 00:46:44,399
do is instead of doing this radius thing

1159
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:47,320
here what we want to do is generate

1160
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,869
randomness that goes out to the edges

1161
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,039
you know of the actual buffer right we

1162
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:56,170
want something that's going to be big

1163
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:59,259
enough that way although again if we're

1164
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:02,230
going to regenerate the seed properly we

1165
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:05,200
need to do that on tile boundary so

1166
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:07,090
here's I'll just draw that out will

1167
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,609
actually say what I was what I was

1168
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,110
thinking there so what I was trying to

1169
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,760
say is this is gets back to thing I was

1170
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:16,180
talking about before so what will happen

1171
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,440
is we're gonna have a buffer and the

1172
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:21,399
buffer is going to be filled with

1173
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,159
round right we are going to move like I

1174
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,750
showed before in here and when the

1175
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,699
player moves off let's say they move off

1176
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:33,550
this side of the screen we're going to

1177
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:35,409
have a problem where now we copy this

1178
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:37,510
part of the buffer we copy it into here

1179
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:40,269
and now we need to fill in this part of

1180
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:42,520
this buffer right now normally if we

1181
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:45,280
just had a repeating tile texture that

1182
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:47,650
repeated everywhere all we would have to

1183
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,450
do is just call and say refill this

1184
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,700
region and it would just do it it would

1185
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:54,068
be easy right but that's not what we

1186
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:55,149
have we're randomly generating what goes

1187
00:47:54,068 --> 00:47:56,469
in there and it may be fairly

1188
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,108
complicated like there may be stuff like

1189
00:47:56,469 --> 00:48:00,699
like things that run through here and we

1190
00:47:59,108 --> 00:48:02,650
want to generate stuff on them and stuff

1191
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:04,389
so really what we need to do is we need

1192
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,068
to consider this in places where we can

1193
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:08,679
guarantee that we generate the same

1194
00:48:06,068 --> 00:48:10,300
things every time for that region and in

1195
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:12,818
order to do that like I said with the

1196
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,099
splats if we wanted to make the splats

1197
00:48:12,818 --> 00:48:16,900
be procedural based on just where you

1198
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:19,480
were in the world we need that to be

1199
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,760
some fixed thing that doesn't that isn't

1200
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,800
randomly getting moved around by how

1201
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,599
this thing moves and so I think the only

1202
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,060
way to do that really honestly is to

1203
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,609
break it into chunks so we need to sort

1204
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:32,858
of do chunks where we can say okay if

1205
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:35,559
we're filling anything with this chunk

1206
00:48:32,858 --> 00:48:37,420
we kind of use you know we use some

1207
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,239
known value to produce the splats in

1208
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,309
that chunk right so I think draw test

1209
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:46,750
ground is gonna be like draw ground

1210
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:49,719
chunk or something like this right it's

1211
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:52,380
gonna take a loaded bitmap buffer right

1212
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:54,730
which is what it's going to draw into

1213
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,190
but then it's got to take a little bit

1214
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:58,929
more information so it knows what it's

1215
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:02,250
supposed to actually do and I guess when

1216
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:02,250
I say draw a ground chunk

1217
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:10,439
so when I say draw a ground chunk

1218
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:15,599
there's there's a little bit more to it

1219
00:49:10,438 --> 00:49:19,018
than that there's like we're drawing we

1220
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:22,349
have to be yeah let's put it this way we

1221
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:25,008
have to know what the the location is of

1222
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:27,809
this chunk I guess so we'll actually use

1223
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:32,608
whatever its world location actually is

1224
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:33,839
let's say to do that there's a lot of

1225
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:35,728
stuff that's complicated here I'm kind

1226
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:39,748
of explain them in a good order if that

1227
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:43,498
makes sense so this is the the chunk P

1228
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:44,818
right so when we draw a ground chunk

1229
00:49:43,498 --> 00:49:46,498
we're gonna want to know whatever that

1230
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:49,079
chunk P was and we're gonna use that for

1231
00:49:46,498 --> 00:49:50,759
something and that chunk P is arbitrary

1232
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,619
it doesn't really matter that it's where

1233
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:54,539
it is in the world it just matters that

1234
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,869
for any given location that we're trying

1235
00:49:54,539 --> 00:50:00,269
to redraw we always use the same initial

1236
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:02,039
position for it input position so that

1237
00:50:00,268 --> 00:50:04,708
the random stuff comes out the same

1238
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:06,630
right so we need to know that we have

1239
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:08,969
that that buffer that's what we're

1240
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:15,329
actually drawing into and then we also

1241
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:17,969
want to we want to be able to say okay

1242
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:20,969
when we're drawing into this thing we

1243
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:22,650
need some bounding region right because

1244
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:24,269
we don't want to draw we don't want to

1245
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,160
recompose it stuff that's in the bitmap

1246
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:28,858
that we already had so we need to have

1247
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,928
some kind of a like a clipping region as

1248
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:32,728
well that we use now there's a trick we

1249
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:34,229
can use for that so I'll guess I'll

1250
00:50:32,728 --> 00:50:35,818
ignore that temporarily for now and I'll

1251
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:37,048
show you a trick we can use for that so

1252
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:39,358
we don't have to do it but anyway when

1253
00:50:37,048 --> 00:50:42,838
we come in here our chunk P let's figure

1254
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:45,028
out some way to do we'll use this chunk

1255
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:46,978
P to generate our random seed and

1256
00:50:45,028 --> 00:50:54,059
that'll just be like you know like the

1257
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:56,308
chunk X the chunk Y and the chunk Z

1258
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,999
we'll just grab those out and just

1259
00:50:56,309 --> 00:51:00,839
full-on

1260
00:50:56,998 --> 00:51:02,818
do complete nonsense here I don't even

1261
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:07,170
pretend this is reasonable when I'm

1262
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:10,429
typing in but there you go yeah not so

1263
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:12,959
let's do something even more ridiculous

1264
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:14,608
so there you go I've typed in some

1265
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:15,958
absolutely ludicrous things and really

1266
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:18,659
I'm just trying to take these three

1267
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:20,078
numbers and produce a random seed out of

1268
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,868
them and now when we

1269
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,798
get to random number generation you know

1270
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:31,509
we might want to say look into Wang

1271
00:51:25,798 --> 00:51:36,338
hashing here or some other spatial seed

1272
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:37,809
generation thing we might want to try

1273
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:39,219
and do something better for generating

1274
00:51:37,809 --> 00:51:43,719
random numbers off of positions but for

1275
00:51:39,219 --> 00:51:46,568
right now that'll be fine so once we

1276
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:49,119
have that what we want to do is we want

1277
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:51,338
to generate chunks that we know will

1278
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,318
sort of fill in this region for us and

1279
00:51:51,338 --> 00:51:55,568
we'll do a better job of that later when

1280
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:57,369
we get to world generation for reals but

1281
00:51:55,568 --> 00:52:00,518
for right now what we want to do is put

1282
00:51:57,369 --> 00:52:03,190
those stamps down so that they kind of

1283
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:04,899
nicely cover that space so what we want

1284
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:07,389
to do is say instead of radius being

1285
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:09,818
system fixed value here which isn't

1286
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:11,440
particularly useful we probably want to

1287
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:14,278
get rid of this notion of meters to

1288
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:18,849
pixels here and say let's actually use

1289
00:52:14,278 --> 00:52:21,518
the size of the whole bitmap right let's

1290
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:23,798
actually use that as our offset so what

1291
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:25,629
we want to do for there is we'd want to

1292
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:27,489
say half the height we could actually

1293
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:29,588
use a random unilateral here and move it

1294
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:35,440
that way so let's just use a random

1295
00:52:29,588 --> 00:52:38,018
unilateral right from a series in both

1296
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:43,329
of these and we'll use whatever that

1297
00:52:38,018 --> 00:52:47,258
input width and height is right so in

1298
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:50,019
fact I'll pull these out something like

1299
00:52:47,259 --> 00:52:51,818
that so that we can have them at the

1300
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:59,558
ready maybe I'll even just call this

1301
00:52:51,818 --> 00:53:02,048
width and height okay so let's do this

1302
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:03,849
this is the width times random

1303
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:06,788
unilateral this is the height times the

1304
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:10,359
random unilateral and that produces what

1305
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:12,910
we wanted we can then actually we don't

1306
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:15,759
need Center at all Center doesn't have

1307
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:17,548
to happen radius doesn't have to happen

1308
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:20,559
at all

1309
00:53:17,548 --> 00:53:24,880
offset none of this stuff has to happen

1310
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:27,009
so really I think the only thing that's

1311
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,890
really yeah really nothing has to happen

1312
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:32,318
it's it's just it's just the offset

1313
00:53:29,889 --> 00:53:34,569
minus the bitmap Senate right yep we're

1314
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,969
almost at the QA

1315
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,809
we'll go ahead and wrap this up like I

1316
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:38,949
said I don't know if we're gonna be able

1317
00:53:37,809 --> 00:53:42,159
do Q&amp;A today because we haven't

1318
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:46,629
regenerated Oh off keys and Lord knows

1319
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:48,039
what else alright so if I do that we

1320
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:49,570
want to we're basically doing the same

1321
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:51,670
thing here we didn't really compress

1322
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:57,070
this code very much at all it's quite

1323
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:58,960
sort of still all kind of kind of count

1324
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:01,240
janky in here but that's okay again you

1325
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,530
know everything in its time so if I go

1326
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:05,649
ahead and get this going here

1327
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:07,350
let's see v2i width and height that's

1328
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:11,950
not necessary anymore so we can do that

1329
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:15,730
draw a test ground okay that's draw a

1330
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:18,159
ground chunk right there we go and we

1331
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:19,719
can pass in for now we'll pass in the

1332
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,119
ground buffer P but that's not actually

1333
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:23,679
what we want to pass in that'll be

1334
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:27,969
different later on but let's just see if

1335
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:30,399
this properly fills things out as it

1336
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:32,829
should yeah so there we go so now you

1337
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,780
can see that that buffer is is is

1338
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:36,099
getting you know the whole buffer is

1339
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,750
getting filled in unfortunately we

1340
00:54:36,099 --> 00:54:40,389
haven't done enough slotting to actually

1341
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:42,969
cover it at any reasonable amount of

1342
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:45,309
detail though so we probably would want

1343
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:47,980
to increase those hundreds to something

1344
00:54:45,309 --> 00:54:50,559
higher but you know that's that's a

1345
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:52,659
separate issue so again how to do

1346
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,829
coverage and stuff there is sort of a

1347
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:55,599
separate thing and that will think about

1348
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:57,309
later but so there's now we've at least

1349
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,500
got some ground that spans the first

1350
00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:02,860
region and mostly all we'll have to do

1351
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:06,670
is figure out how to do again that the

1352
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:08,920
update as we move and then we'll sort of

1353
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,450
have our progressive ground working all

1354
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,840
right so let's go ahead and do a little

1355
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:16,239
try to do a little Q&amp;A I think we might

1356
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:20,760
as well try but unfortunately I don't

1357
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:22,839
actually know yeah I don't actually know

1358
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,520
how well this will work but let's go to

1359
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,360
let's at least do a couple minutes Q&amp;A

1360
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:27,489
and see how it works

1361
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,930
please prefix your questions with Q :

1362
00:55:27,489 --> 00:55:30,939
although I don't know that'll actually

1363
00:55:28,929 --> 00:55:32,889
help but I can at least try to scan for

1364
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:35,019
those manually even though the twitch

1365
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:38,369
thing is broken in terms of showing us

1366
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:38,369
what's actually there

1367
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:45,199
let's see

1368
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:01,849
when we fill the entire game window

1369
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:06,170
instead of having all that black space

1370
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:07,459
actually that's intentional so I guess

1371
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:10,188
one thing that might be a problem is

1372
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:12,858
people who are new to the stream might

1373
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:14,838
not realize that we're in development

1374
00:56:12,858 --> 00:56:16,248
stuff like if you wanted to see it fill

1375
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,139
the whole screen you know you could

1376
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:20,568
already do that that's not really a big

1377
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:23,808
deal but in development what you want to

1378
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:29,469
do is you don't want to ever pretty much

1379
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:35,089
look at your your actual game output as

1380
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:37,489
a in full-screen the reason for that is

1381
00:56:35,088 --> 00:56:39,708
you may have drawing bugs that happen

1382
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:42,048
off off the edges of things and stuff

1383
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:45,438
like that and so usually what I do is I

1384
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:47,358
always have stuff that looks essentially

1385
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:50,298
like this when I'm working and will

1386
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:53,920
probably go even further than what we

1387
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:56,389
are doing right now and actually show

1388
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,278
you know the way that our debug will

1389
00:56:56,389 --> 00:57:00,889
work in the future will be something

1390
00:56:58,278 --> 00:57:02,989
where this is actually centered but not

1391
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:05,748
filling the whole screen so basically

1392
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:08,028
this this thing here will be centered in

1393
00:57:05,748 --> 00:57:10,759
the thing in the middle and we'll draw a

1394
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:13,909
little bit outside of it as well and

1395
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:15,409
we'll verify that everything is drawing

1396
00:57:13,909 --> 00:57:18,048
properly and we'll have like a safe

1397
00:57:15,409 --> 00:57:20,239
region marker that shows us so we can

1398
00:57:18,048 --> 00:57:22,938
see what's happening outside the game

1399
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:24,920
area because what you know showing just

1400
00:57:22,938 --> 00:57:26,928
the game area that's a view for players

1401
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,278
that's not a view for developers

1402
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:30,139
developers generally shouldn't be

1403
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,789
looking at a view that just shows what

1404
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:33,348
the player will see they should be

1405
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:35,509
seeing more than that and they should be

1406
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:37,939
looking for problems and so typically

1407
00:57:35,509 --> 00:57:40,489
what we'll end up with is more stuff out

1408
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:43,308
here and maybe this will be centered but

1409
00:57:40,489 --> 00:57:45,380
what we won't do is draw fullscreen in

1410
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:46,939
general that's only a thing that will

1411
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,650
test periodically to make sure that it

1412
00:57:46,938 --> 00:57:50,358
works properly because that's what the

1413
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:52,278
players will do and when we're in sort

1414
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:54,199
of final testing we'll we'll maybe do a

1415
00:57:52,278 --> 00:57:55,969
lot more playing with it in that mode

1416
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:57,229
but that's not the general mode we want

1417
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:59,239
to be in for developing because it

1418
00:57:57,228 --> 00:58:01,399
doesn't show us it won't be showing us

1419
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:03,818
as much as we need to see hopefully that

1420
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,818
makes some sense

1421
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:31,440
not seeing a lot of questions here are

1422
00:58:29,789 --> 00:58:32,940
some of these issues with dealing with

1423
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,650
display on multiple levels stemming from

1424
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:38,730
the lack of a Z coordinate for the

1425
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:40,170
camera to just do a lerp on no not

1426
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:43,409
really because we have a Z coordinate

1427
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:45,889
for the camera we actually know what

1428
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:48,480
that is most of the problem with the

1429
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:50,549
thinking through Z issues is largely

1430
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,980
just because we don't have actual 3d

1431
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:54,690
geometry right so if we were to build

1432
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,869
the whole game in 3d then this wouldn't

1433
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:59,579
be an issue but as it needs to be kind

1434
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:01,710
of there's some things a lot of things

1435
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,630
get easier when you do a 2-d game mostly

1436
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:05,400
the asset creation right like your

1437
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:08,309
artists will have a much easier time in

1438
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,990
2d and 3d you know a single artist can

1439
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:10,650
do a whole 2-d game by themselves and it

1440
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:12,809
can look great

1441
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:14,400
3d not so much like you're not gonna

1442
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:17,179
have one artist do call a duty right

1443
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,588
that's not on the table

1444
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:21,690
and so you get some benefits when you go

1445
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:23,940
to 2d because your art quality for the

1446
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,380
number of artists you have your art

1447
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,940
quality goes up dramatically and that's

1448
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,980
a good thing but some of your

1449
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,869
programming complexity well a lot of

1450
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,980
your current flexi also goes down

1451
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:33,660
because you don't to deal with all the

1452
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,550
asset pipeline stuff which is a huge

1453
00:59:33,659 --> 00:59:37,170
headache for 3d and pre-processing and

1454
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:38,519
all your shader stuff all that stuff

1455
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:39,450
that's a lot you know there's there's a

1456
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:40,889
whole bunch of programs nothing it's

1457
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:43,199
simpler but there are some probably

1458
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:45,569
things get more complicated if you want

1459
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,159
to do interesting things with it now we

1460
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:49,050
could have cut out all this and just

1461
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:50,519
said there's only one Z level right and

1462
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,869
then you wouldn't have to do any of the

1463
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:53,489
things that I've been talked about also

1464
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:55,858
you could have said you don't move

1465
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:59,909
smoothly up stairwells and that would be

1466
00:59:55,858 --> 01:00:03,088
fine as well so basically like I would

1467
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:05,039
say that if you wanted to not try to

1468
01:00:03,088 --> 01:00:08,369
tackle hard programming problems we

1469
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,900
could have done that too and that's not

1470
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:11,700
a bad thing it's just that this is a

1471
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,800
programming stream I try to do things

1472
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:15,868
that are more complicated than than the

1473
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,000
simplest right I try not to just do

1474
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:19,200
whatever be easiest for us to do because

1475
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,369
I'm not that really that interested in

1476
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,379
teaching how to people how to do stuff

1477
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:23,789
that's simple I feel like if you want to

1478
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,410
do something that's simple you could

1479
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:27,509
just go grab game maker or something

1480
01:00:25,409 --> 01:00:29,549
right and so I want to show you how to

1481
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:31,650
do is push a lot of boundaries and do a

1482
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:33,090
lot of interesting things with the code

1483
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:34,110
and

1484
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,610
so that's what we're doing like

1485
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:37,079
procedurally-generated ground is a good

1486
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:38,039
example of something that you may not be

1487
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,710
able to do if you just grab an

1488
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,119
off-the-shelf tool and so we want to do

1489
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,559
stuff like that because if all I ever

1490
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:45,210
show you how to do is just rebuild

1491
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:47,460
exactly what's in some off-the-shelf

1492
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:48,510
tools that's a good thing for some set

1493
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,619
of programmers but also doesn't

1494
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,180
encourage some of the things that I

1495
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:53,250
would like to encourage which is pushing

1496
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:55,169
beyond what you would just be able to do

1497
01:00:53,250 --> 01:01:04,800
with a simple basic tool that you could

1498
01:00:55,170 --> 01:01:06,269
just buy right if no one's asking

1499
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,070
related questions could you ballpark a

1500
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:09,539
time frame when adding a font and text

1501
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:12,980
rendering system will become useful or

1502
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:17,250
necessary I would say it's gonna be

1503
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:21,929
right here it's actually already on the

1504
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:23,969
schedule I think it's right there and

1505
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:27,119
the answer is is not that long actually

1506
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:29,879
right we've got some hard things to work

1507
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,119
through here none of which I think will

1508
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:34,380
really require font for display but then

1509
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,380
we're gonna get into stuff like asset

1510
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:39,570
streaming which you really want to have

1511
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,950
some debug vis stuff for and you really

1512
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,690
want fonts to be in there at the time

1513
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:44,099
for debug if there's a debug flaw so you

1514
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:46,760
don't have to do final fonts but just

1515
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,759
debug files

1516
01:01:56,139 --> 01:02:02,739
and for folks that are asking stuff like

1517
01:01:58,699 --> 01:02:02,739
any advice I'm publishing my first game

1518
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:06,500
and stuff like that that's really stuff

1519
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:08,180
we talk about more in the pre stream so

1520
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,670
this is more time for the programming

1521
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:12,379
questions if you want to come back about

1522
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:13,849
15 minutes before a scheduled start time

1523
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,400
and ask those questions we could totally

1524
01:02:13,849 --> 01:02:17,840
cover them although to be honest with

1525
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,220
you I don't know very much about game

1526
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,309
publishing I'm not a publisher I'm a

1527
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:26,980
programmer so you'd probably have to ask

1528
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:26,980
a different person

1529
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:54,130
all right it doesn't look like we really

1530
01:02:43,599 --> 01:03:03,489
have any questions look I don't see many

1531
01:02:54,130 --> 01:03:04,900
programming questions on here aster

1532
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:06,159
what's the most some people are asking

1533
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:10,090
this is a very standard question we get

1534
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:12,699
a lot which is what's the most efficient

1535
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:14,350
way to learn C++ or what's a good

1536
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:17,289
tutorial for learning OpenGL with Super

1537
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:19,059
Plus and so on with C and so on I don't

1538
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:20,289
really know I mean one of the reasons

1539
01:03:19,059 --> 01:03:22,389
I'm doing this series is because I don't

1540
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:23,500
know the best way to teach where people

1541
01:03:22,389 --> 01:03:26,579
should go to learn things there aren't a

1542
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,840
lot of good learning materials out there

1543
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:31,000
there's a lot of bad learning materials

1544
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:34,840
but finding good ones is pretty tough

1545
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:37,829
and so I don't really know what I would

1546
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:41,620
recommend there are some reasonable like

1547
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:43,630
the arc synthesis tutorials for the

1548
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:48,069
OpenGL question

1549
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:56,470
are bad I don't know where they are

1550
01:03:48,070 --> 01:04:00,580
though does anyone actually link to the

1551
01:03:56,469 --> 01:04:05,769
arc synthesis toriel's in here here we

1552
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:09,069
go here we know oh no don't tell me

1553
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:11,259
they're gone are they actually gone that

1554
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:15,539
would be awful if they were gone the arc

1555
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:15,540
synthesis tutorials if you can find them

1556
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:23,670
would actually be a good place to go but

1557
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:26,559
and I hope they're not gone

1558
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:31,090
that would be real bad maybe I'm

1559
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:34,630
spelling it wrong or something no I

1560
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:36,039
don't know all right well if Yorkton

1561
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:37,119
this tutorials are gone I don't even

1562
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:40,480
know what to point you to for good

1563
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:43,719
OpenGL tutorial we'll be doing some

1564
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,490
graphics AP on the stream maybe if we're

1565
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:48,179
lucky

1566
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:50,859
Vulcan will be ready and we can do that

1567
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:52,569
so we'll be doing one later on but right

1568
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,890
now the arc synthesis tutorials were

1569
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:56,430
pretty good if I remember correctly but

1570
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:58,779
you know

1571
01:04:56,429 --> 01:05:00,809
they look like they're disappeared or

1572
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,810
something

1573
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,049
you mentioned offloading ground drawing

1574
01:05:12,429 --> 01:05:15,699
to a separate thread to prevent hitches

1575
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:17,890
is it possible to offload the drawing

1576
01:05:15,699 --> 01:05:20,219
work over multiple frames and would

1577
01:05:17,889 --> 01:05:23,230
there be any benefits over either method

1578
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:24,519
yeah my intention would be to offload it

1579
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,740
to a separate fred's so that it would

1580
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:29,829
happen over multiple frames and the

1581
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:33,399
reason for that is because usually

1582
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:37,179
there's just a lot of CPU power sitting

1583
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:40,539
around that you know especially for a

1584
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:43,690
2-d game where if once we start taking

1585
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:45,579
advantage of the GPU for rendering we're

1586
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,740
gonna have probably cores sitting around

1587
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:49,210
not doing anything on the CPU and so

1588
01:05:47,739 --> 01:05:51,729
what I'd like to do is have those

1589
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:53,380
running completely asynchronously from

1590
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:56,050
the main thread generating stuff that we

1591
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:57,940
might want it to generate and so I think

1592
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:00,130
we'll probably have like a CPU that's

1593
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:02,320
doing a lot of background loading and

1594
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:04,420
decompression or who knows what and

1595
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,519
we'll probably also have a CPU thread

1596
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:08,889
that's doing a bunch of generation along

1597
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:12,460
the same lines and I don't think those

1598
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:14,289
will need to be coupled at all to the

1599
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:16,619
main thread they'll they'll just you

1600
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:19,389
know communicate by queues or something

1601
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:20,950
and I think that's probably the way that

1602
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:22,539
we'll want will end up doing it I can't

1603
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:24,989
promise that that will be true but I

1604
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:24,989
think so

1605
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:34,639
how much of a memory footprint is your

1606
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:37,039
game using already certainly it won't be

1607
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:40,549
large but I'm more meaning how many

1608
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:43,639
different containers are there how many

1609
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:45,260
different containers can you be more

1610
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:48,349
specific as to what you mean by

1611
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:54,350
container I guess and then I can try to

1612
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:55,819
answer that let's see procedural

1613
01:06:54,349 --> 01:06:59,420
generation of 2d graphics is there some

1614
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:02,000
mainstream math for that well it's not

1615
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:03,440
only math II per se something there are

1616
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,440
some math that elements to it such as

1617
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,090
good noise patterns and stuff like that

1618
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,070
but it's sort of more of a black art

1619
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:13,010
kind of thing like procedurally

1620
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:15,010
generating 2d graphics is you know one

1621
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:18,410
of those things that you just kind of

1622
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:20,210
got to learn to work with and like I

1623
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:21,379
said we'll be doing some of it on the

1624
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,789
stream like will be doing ground

1625
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,840
generation will be doing much better

1626
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:27,139
ground generation than we're doing right

1627
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:28,309
now for example and so that'll be one

1628
01:07:27,139 --> 01:07:30,609
place we'll be kind of exploring that a

1629
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:30,610
little bit

1630
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:42,579
what is my programming experience as

1631
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,820
before handmade hero

1632
01:07:42,579 --> 01:07:48,639
oh it's well I'm a game tech guy I've

1633
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:50,340
been doing game technology for I don't

1634
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:55,239
know 20 years now or something like that

1635
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:57,880
so I worked at rad game tools which is a

1636
01:07:55,239 --> 01:08:00,399
company that makes like game libraries

1637
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,769
that are used in lots of thousands of

1638
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:05,920
games really and I did a 3d animation

1639
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:09,369
system and a video codec while I was

1640
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:12,010
there and then I've done work on actual

1641
01:08:09,369 --> 01:08:13,839
games before like just this last this

1642
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:18,250
most recent game I worked on was the

1643
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:20,140
witness which isn't quite out yet it's a

1644
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:22,060
game you should definitely check out if

1645
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:25,900
you hadn't yet it's a it's John Blair's

1646
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:27,550
new game and I I did a bunch of work on

1647
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:31,479
the collision detection and the editor

1648
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:33,400
for that so that's mostly what I what

1649
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:34,809
I've worked on in the past I've worked

1650
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:43,539
on other things too but you know those

1651
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:44,800
are the notable things sorry for

1652
01:08:43,539 --> 01:08:46,359
confusing with terminology javis

1653
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,210
distribution of classes how many

1654
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:55,779
different classes are you having to use

1655
01:08:49,210 --> 01:09:01,449
already well I mean sort of I guess the

1656
01:08:55,779 --> 01:09:05,319
answer is we don't use any classes in

1657
01:09:01,449 --> 01:09:08,170
that sense we have some systems so for

1658
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:09,460
example we have a sim region which is

1659
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:12,609
sort of a collection of things that's

1660
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:17,500
used to do simulation of the of a game

1661
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:20,559
area we have a world rep representation

1662
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,510
right which is sort of divides the world

1663
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:28,030
into chunks and allows us to quickly

1664
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:30,460
access those trunks but we don't we

1665
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:34,269
don't use classes so classes are sort of

1666
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:35,770
a mental thing right really they're a

1667
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,390
way of breaking things down in an

1668
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,700
object-oriented we don't really do that

1669
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:41,650
we sort of work with things in in more

1670
01:09:39,699 --> 01:09:43,720
of a systemic sense where stuff is kind

1671
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:46,389
of grouped together and so we have

1672
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:48,190
structs that define data layouts but

1673
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:49,539
really our systems are a little more

1674
01:09:48,189 --> 01:09:51,609
broader and they're not really thought

1675
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:52,539
of in the same class way but you can

1676
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:54,489
still think of them kind of

1677
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:55,600
similarly like what you might think of

1678
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:57,039
breaking down as a class you would think

1679
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,970
of us breaking down as a system in our

1680
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,970
in our approach

1681
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:07,109
thank you is amaro 37 by the way for

1682
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:09,909
posting the opengl tutorial there

1683
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:11,409
hopefully that's that's a good one I

1684
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:14,609
don't know if it is or not is that the

1685
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:14,609
arc synthesis ones I'm not sure

1686
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:35,350
is there a simple way to explain

1687
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:37,210
pointers and references in C++ if so can

1688
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:39,789
you briefly explain when you would use

1689
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:43,239
either if that's to clump K just don't

1690
01:10:39,789 --> 01:10:46,000
worry about answering this that is is

1691
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:51,000
not complicated in fact it's not there

1692
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:58,529
is no difference there a syntactic thing

1693
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:01,300
so try to think of the easiest way to

1694
01:10:58,529 --> 01:11:03,909
show this here but basically if I have

1695
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:07,000
something like int X and then I have

1696
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:09,909
something like int star X right or y

1697
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,710
equals x I should say maybe I'll say

1698
01:11:09,909 --> 01:11:17,109
pointer X hmm

1699
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:19,899
then what this is doing is it saying

1700
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:23,139
alright I would like the compiler to

1701
01:11:19,899 --> 01:11:27,129
know that I am trying to refer to the

1702
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:31,119
memory the first like I want a number

1703
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:33,940
that's the first byte of memory occupied

1704
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,680
by X right because X is a 32-bit integer

1705
01:11:33,939 --> 01:11:37,839
it occupies 4 bytes in memory

1706
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:39,369
I want a pointer to it so I've taken the

1707
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,650
address of it and I can store that here

1708
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:44,739
now the compiler may never actually do

1709
01:11:41,649 --> 01:11:46,000
that operation because it only needs to

1710
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:47,409
do that operation if it's going to do

1711
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,329
something else with it later for example

1712
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:52,149
if the only thing I ever did with this

1713
01:11:49,329 --> 01:11:54,670
right is dereference the pointer and set

1714
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:56,170
it equal to 3 then the compiler probably

1715
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:58,510
will never actually take the address of

1716
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:59,739
X and never actually produce a register

1717
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:01,600
with the address in it it'll probably

1718
01:11:59,739 --> 01:12:07,569
just know where X is on the stack and

1719
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:09,100
directly write 3 into it right now on

1720
01:12:07,569 --> 01:12:10,689
the other hand if I actually go to do

1721
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,300
something where that actually needs to

1722
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:15,729
be done in terms of taking the address

1723
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:18,460
it actually will for example if I was to

1724
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:20,199
do something like have a mem copy

1725
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,939
routine or something like some kind of

1726
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:24,550
like copy memory routine that's going to

1727
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:26,710
take that pointer to X now it will

1728
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:28,480
actually do the work of to figuring out

1729
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:30,250
where it is putting that in a register

1730
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:32,879
and letting copy memory work on it or

1731
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:36,069
something that that might happen right

1732
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,489
now if I wanted to have a reference as

1733
01:12:36,069 --> 01:12:40,090
well

1734
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:42,219
right where I do something like this all

1735
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:44,199
that's doing is this a different

1736
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:46,449
Cley cheer for pointer it's basically a

1737
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:49,000
Naaman clay Chur for a pointer or what a

1738
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:51,069
pointer was representing that does not

1739
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,489
need to be dereferenced in order to use

1740
01:12:51,069 --> 01:12:55,869
it so it's just saying hey look I want

1741
01:12:54,489 --> 01:12:58,510
you to essentially treat this

1742
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:59,680
essentially like a pointer right but now

1743
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:01,510
I'm going to call it a reference and

1744
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:04,000
what's gonna happen is everywhere I use

1745
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:05,650
it pretend that I was just dereferencing

1746
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,439
the pointer that you had so it's sort of

1747
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:10,119
just another name for X right that's all

1748
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:11,859
it is it's another name for X at that

1749
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,539
point right

1750
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:14,889
but implementation wise they're still

1751
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,960
gonna have to do exactly the same things

1752
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,220
that the pointer was doing if it needs

1753
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,470
to figure out what the address is to

1754
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:23,909
point it to send it to something like if

1755
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:26,880
I'm gonna call something like let's say

1756
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:29,199
let's say this was giant for some reason

1757
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:35,529
I'm traveling but this is like struck

1758
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:37,569
giant right okay

1759
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:42,099
so there's no way that that's ever gonna

1760
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:43,509
be passed in registers right but if I

1761
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:46,120
wanted to do something where I was

1762
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:50,260
actually gonna modify that thing so I

1763
01:13:46,119 --> 01:13:53,500
have a giant one right and now I've got

1764
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:55,329
a pointer to it like so and I've got a

1765
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:58,420
reference to it or whatever right and

1766
01:13:55,329 --> 01:14:01,119
now I want to call some function where

1767
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:04,359
I'm actually gonna operate on on this

1768
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:07,769
thing right well if I was gonna do it by

1769
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:11,109
pointer so I have food giant star

1770
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:12,790
whatever like this if I was gonna

1771
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:14,549
operate on it by pointer then we all

1772
01:14:12,789 --> 01:14:19,420
know what would happen here when I call

1773
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:20,619
foo with my giant whatever it is with my

1774
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,630
pointer to giant it's just gonna pass

1775
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:25,539
the address and then this function is

1776
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:28,869
going to work off the address of that

1777
01:14:25,539 --> 01:14:31,899
object to actually modify it right so

1778
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:35,140
you know if I wanted to hear do

1779
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:38,309
something like this so as I shouldn't

1780
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:38,310
call this the same thing

1781
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:42,569
there we go if I wanted to operate off

1782
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:43,859
it like that

1783
01:14:42,569 --> 01:14:46,920
basically what it'd be doing is it would

1784
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:49,189
be taking that address it would be using

1785
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:52,800
this layout to know where it should go

1786
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:54,809
to operate on the 30th integer that's at

1787
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,369
that address right and it would do

1788
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:59,520
whatever the operation is I told it to

1789
01:14:56,369 --> 01:15:00,599
do now equivalently if I was to make

1790
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,520
another one of these

1791
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,570
that took a reference to that thing and

1792
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:08,280
modified it right now this may look a

1793
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:10,349
little different because I'm using the

1794
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:11,819
dot operator and this is actually the

1795
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:13,789
bar it's you know in some sense it's

1796
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:16,529
actually a giant not a pointer giant

1797
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:17,789
syntactically in terms of what the

1798
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:19,619
compiler is gonna generate if the

1799
01:15:17,789 --> 01:15:21,869
compiler has any sense at all it will

1800
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:24,890
generate exactly the same code for these

1801
01:15:21,869 --> 01:15:27,658
two foods right through one in foo two

1802
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:32,159
will generate exactly the same code and

1803
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:34,289
exactly the same way hopefully so really

1804
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:37,079
will still end up just being a pointer

1805
01:15:34,289 --> 01:15:38,719
when the compiler actually uses it so

1806
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:41,158
it's really just about how you

1807
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:45,149
syntactically wanted to treat that thing

1808
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:46,979
it doesn't do anything right it doesn't

1809
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:48,869
actually have any different effect than

1810
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:50,459
a pointer effectively would in most

1811
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:53,550
cases in terms of the compilers going to

1812
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:57,029
do right so hopefully that helps a

1813
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:58,560
little bit I mean in fact really you

1814
01:15:57,029 --> 01:16:00,630
could think of it as unless you're

1815
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,520
trying to use some c++ features that

1816
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:04,380
need you to not use the dereference

1817
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,150
thing like if you had some crazy c++

1818
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,859
features you were caring about you might

1819
01:16:06,149 --> 01:16:09,299
need to use references but otherwise you

1820
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:10,619
never need to use them references

1821
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:12,150
pointers just do the same thing you

1822
01:16:10,619 --> 01:16:14,340
would never actually use reference it's

1823
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:17,089
just a syntactic convenience for you if

1824
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,090
you prefer it

1825
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,070
all right

1826
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:34,960
all right I think that's about it for

1827
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,910
questions today because I can't actually

1828
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,810
read the questions very well since the

1829
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:39,729
twitch thing is down

1830
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:41,770
I'll get that working tonight so that

1831
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:42,489
tomorrow we'll be in good shape but I

1832
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:43,810
think I'm going to call it for today

1833
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:45,279
because it's really hard to read the

1834
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:49,990
twitch dream without my little filter

1835
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:53,259
that normally runs on it so yeah all

1836
01:16:49,989 --> 01:16:54,760
right so I think that's it for now

1837
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,380
tomorrow I think

1838
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,050
let's I'm liking where we're going with

1839
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,340
the ground thing so tomorrow we'll do

1840
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:01,900
some more work on that and we'll get it

1841
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:05,230
to the point where we're actually

1842
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:07,089
generating a continuous ground and then

1843
01:17:05,229 --> 01:17:08,469
we'll maybe the day after that we'll

1844
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:10,539
start working on hole cutting in that

1845
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:13,420
and then after that we can actually do

1846
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:14,800
multiple layers so maybe you know by the

1847
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,449
end of the week we'll actually have some

1848
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,550
relatively solid ground stuff drawing in

1849
01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:20,139
there and that would be pretty fun cuz

1850
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:22,630
that's another pretty major to do that

1851
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,470
would be off our list so thank you

1852
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:25,210
everyone for joining me for another

1853
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:27,430
episode of handmade Hira it's been a

1854
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:28,930
pleasure coding with you as always if

1855
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:30,700
you would like to follow along at home

1856
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:32,950
with a source code you can pre-order the

1857
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:34,210
game at handmade hero org using the

1858
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:35,710
little pre-order button and it comes

1859
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:36,760
with a source code you'll get a link in

1860
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:39,460
your email that you can use to download

1861
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:43,630
the source code anytime you want and i

1862
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:46,779
think if i refresh the page yes and i

1863
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:49,630
added a thing down here to resend if

1864
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:52,119
you've lost your order email you can use

1865
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:53,949
this little habit we sent button to have

1866
01:17:52,119 --> 01:17:55,630
it resent to you so that's pretty handy

1867
01:17:53,949 --> 01:17:58,119
I found out that I could I could do that

1868
01:17:55,630 --> 01:18:00,069
with send owl so I did that so that's

1869
01:17:58,119 --> 01:18:01,449
good thing to know if you want support
