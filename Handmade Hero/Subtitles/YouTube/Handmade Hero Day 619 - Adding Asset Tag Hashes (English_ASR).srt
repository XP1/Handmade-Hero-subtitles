00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,759
hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:07,119
welcome to handmade hero code ah show

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,400
where we could complete game live on

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,839
stream

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,839
sorry i'm a little slow this morning

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,199
we did a few streams that weren't

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,399
uploaded to youtube

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,439
uh that were just trying to get

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,159
my for coder configuration into a place

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,679
where everyone else could use it uh

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,039
because i want people to be able to code

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,320
the same way i could on stream that was

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,519
kind of always a goal and it kind of

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,039
drifted out of that

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,519
because i kind of had like a hybrid

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,200
version of four coder that was never

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,040
released and my custom layer was never

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
released and so on

19
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,320
and so we're trying to keep that under

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,960
control now

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,520
and i think we've basically got it more

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,079
or less

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,640
where it needs to be a mirror the editor

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,759
that i

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,799
use like the way that that works

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,280
effectively

27
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:58,640
for most things that matter and

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,320
we did it in ryan flurry's custom layer

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
which is maintained on github so i

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,040
should be able to just like

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,159
push those changes back uh eventually

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
well we already pushed a bunch of

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,479
changes back

34
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,478
but for coder still needs to

35
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,079
have a new point release because we

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,359
worked with alan to get a few new things

37
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,438
in in order to support some of the

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,159
things that i needed

39
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,798
and so that should be coming fairly soon

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
i don't

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,840
have a date for it because i don't know

42
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,239
what alan's doing so i don't actually

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,400
know

44
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,920
when it will be released hopefully it'll

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,280
be released soon

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,599
um i'll try bugging him about it but uh

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,879
basically we did that work so today what

48
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,959
we're gonna do is start

49
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,679
editing on the game again and i'm just

50
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,759
gonna try and keep track of anything

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
that i noticed that's like weird or

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,359
idiosyncratic

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,680
with the editing that i think we need to

54
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,200
fix and then i can fix it and i can just

55
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,560
fix it off stream it's it's

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,478
not important obviously because it has

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,280
nothing to do with the game

58
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,718
but i'll just like make a mental note or

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,680
i'll i'll keep note of it here i've

60
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,158
actually got

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
a handmade hero notebook so i can just

62
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,960
write it down

63
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,399
and i'll remember to take care of it

64
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,000
afterwards

65
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,000
so there was already one thing that was

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,919
broken and that was that the d key was

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
not doing the right thing so we had

68
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,958
bound the d key to delete range

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,878
but instead and i'll show you what i

70
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,759
mean

71
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,439
effectively what happens is if i

72
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,919
actually should go

73
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,039
to the handmade hero directory um so if

74
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,280
i'm trying to edit

75
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,679
uh like here in the handmade hero code

76
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
base uh and i go to uh

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,360
i go to some place the way i always have

78
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,800
my keys work

79
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,920
is that the d key deletes from

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
where i am to the end of the line and if

81
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,318
there's nothing left on the line then it

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,360
deletes

83
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,919
the line feed so basically like d if you

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
tap d

85
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,958
once it deletes to the end of the line

86
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,479
if you tap d

87
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,479
twice it deletes like it sucks whatever

88
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,399
was up on the previous line on the next

89
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,039
line up to the previous line

90
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,680
so the problem is right now if i hit d

91
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,079
it actually deletes the range

92
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,599
um i'm not sure why i bound to that but

93
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,719
you can see like that would delete like

94
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,000
all the way at the beginning of the file

95
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,479
in this case because that's where the

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,560
the marker was

97
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,399
so i really don't want that because i

98
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
hit the d key a lot and that'll just

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
completely throw me off

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
so i just need to replace that one

101
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
function

102
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:30,000
other than that i don't remember

103
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,840
us noticing anything weird so hopefully

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,959
um we'll be fine if we just fix that so

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,439
i cut and pasted the code that deletes

106
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,719
the current line from the four coder

107
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,199
source

108
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,959
uh and effectively what i'm going to do

109
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,518
is just see if we can modify it a little

110
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,280
bit

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,280
so you can see here it gets the view in

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,680
the buffer it then

113
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,080
looks to see how like what the actual

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,519
range of a particular line is

115
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
and then it adds one to the end of the

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,120
line to encompass the

117
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,239
carriage turn character uh it then just

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,759
goes ahead and

119
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,759
uh i guess does a clamp

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,759
and then replaces the range so i think

121
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,840
all i need to do here

122
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,919
is just muck a little bit with this

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,039
logic here so the range that it's

124
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,319
actually using

125
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:21,039
is i think all i would have to do um

126
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,399
i don't think there's anything else so

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,080
my assumption is

128
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,560
that like so this range size equals zero

129
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,199
thing

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,319
and then it looks to see if it should

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,120
delete the thing

132
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,599
it looks like it already does some kind

133
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,280
of a

134
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,840
new line eating here so we it

135
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,159
i don't really know but it may be as

136
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,439
simple

137
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,800
as just saying hey let's

138
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,639
delete let's just take the range

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,478
and make the beginning of the range be

140
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,160
the current cursor position

141
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,758
so i don't really know because i don't

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
know a lot of what four coders

143
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,639
conventions are for things so i couldn't

144
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,959
tell you

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,160
but i believe if i just say range start

146
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,239
equals pause right then what will happen

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,160
is the end will still be the end of the

148
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,680
line the position here

149
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,080
will now be where the cursor was and

150
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,560
that's the start i won't include the new

151
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,279
line

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,280
right it'll then just go do its thing

153
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,198
where it starts doing some clamping

154
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,439
and it'll look to see whether the size

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,759
is zero if we were on the end of the

156
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,120
line

157
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,720
already that's what would that's exactly

158
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
the case where i needed to suck up the

159
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,720
new line so in this case

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
i don't know

161
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,479
i don't know if this code does the right

162
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,000
thing

163
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,000
but rather than write my own

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
and assume that it doesn't i might just

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,519
try it because i don't know

166
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,360
and we'll see what happens so i'm just

167
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,279
going to go ahead and save this

168
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,479
i'm going to build this and i'm gonna

169
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,599
bind this new

170
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:59,599
casey delete to end of line um

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,680
i'm gonna bind that to my uh

172
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,160
so to the where what the d key was bound

173
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,199
to delete range before

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
i'm just gonna go ahead and bind that uh

175
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,879
to mine

176
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,000
so in the bindings file uh it's just

177
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,159
this delete range

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
so it's delete uh casey delete to end of

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,240
line now

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,120
and so let's just go ahead and build it

181
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,319
so that's an

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,600
for coder custom

183
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,759
for coder flurry i think yeah um so that

184
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,479
will rebuild our four coder there

185
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,400
and now if i open it uh we just have to

186
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,240
see like does it do

187
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,159
anything like what i expect and i don't

188
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,680
know

189
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
so the most likely thing of these to

190
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,400
work properly is if i hit

191
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
d here it should delete to the end of

192
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,679
the line

193
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,799
so uh i don't know if that quite worked

194
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,280
that may have also

195
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,879
deleted one extra character it did

196
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,758
so like if i go yeah so it looks like

197
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,319
it's pause

198
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,199
plus one that we actually needed let's

199
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,598
try the

200
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,240
new line thing as well i don't know so

201
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,478
let's um

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,319
let's just fix that one problem first

203
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,598
because that does seem

204
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,720
uh relevant here so if i just say pause

205
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,279
plus one

206
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,960
that should be where i actually i guess

207
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:22,399
want to delete

208
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:25,758
um so anyway all right so i think we've

209
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:29,038
got the first part working just fine

210
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,680
if i go in here now and i just say okay

211
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,360
delete that's good and then delete again

212
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,160
doesn't do anything okay so

213
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,919
we do need to rewrite that other part so

214
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,840
in here what i think we would want to do

215
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:44,959
is say all right if the range start uh

216
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,799
if it

217
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,598
i don't really know what will happen if

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,280
we do the pause plus one here

219
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,038
when we're at the end of the line

220
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,159
technically so

221
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,159
i'm not quite sure

222
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,038
i i i would would have thought actually

223
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
that this would have

224
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,878
done the right thing so my only question

225
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,000
is it might be this

226
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,479
so it may be that this is like if range

227
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
size equals one might be the one we

228
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,318
actually want

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,319
um

230
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
in fact it might be more like this so so

231
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
if we

232
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,840
assume

233
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,519
so if we assume actually i think this is

234
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:36,639
easier than i'm making it out to be so

235
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,879
if we assume that this

236
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,559
end range is actually always correct

237
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,120
then i think we can actually just do

238
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,119
this

239
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,440
we can just say if range uh start

240
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
um

241
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,360
or sorry if pause equals range end so if

242
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,800
we're on the end of the line

243
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,680
right then we do something special

244
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,639
otherwise we don't that might be all we

245
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,479
actually need

246
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,240
so in other words here if we're on the

247
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,200
end of the line already we just push the

248
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,200
end out one

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,480
this i guess always happens it's not

250
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,680
really an else

251
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:19,519
we want that always so we just say um

252
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,919
you know range end equals pause plus one

253
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,639
and it may be so if the end of the line

254
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,159
is actually

255
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,838
technically a new line character then i

256
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,799
guess we would want this now that i

257
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,399
think about it

258
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:34,000
right maybe

259
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,120
um again i'm just really not sure

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,240
because i don't know

261
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,799
what the um what the size is here

262
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
so i guess we would leave this part the

263
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,439
same

264
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
because we don't know what this does i

265
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,560
just have no idea

266
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,000
uh what this is supposed to do in four

267
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,079
coder um

268
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
so i'm not going to try and guess but

269
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,600
anyway um so i think

270
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,240
something like that would probably work

271
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,680
we'll find out

272
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,519
uh so here we are in asynctask again

273
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:06,559
let's just go over here that deletes

274
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,120
that deleted the whole line though

275
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,000
hold on a second did i miss something

276
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,679
here

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,559
oh yeah so we do need this to be

278
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,399
always equal to pause in that case right

279
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,159
so it's got to delete the new line so

280
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,559
it's trying to

281
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,319
uh it probably needs to keep it as pause

282
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,159
it wouldn't advance it by one because it

283
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,519
still needs to replace something

284
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,278
so all right so hopefully that's good um

285
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
we'll see i think that will duplicate

286
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,720
the behavior that i'm used to so it

287
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,240
won't catch me by surprise anymore

288
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,240
um so yeah

289
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:43,838
yeah all right so i think that's all

290
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,278
good um

291
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,640
and then the other thing we should

292
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,519
probably do while we're in here is

293
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,120
you'll notice like

294
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,240
when i hover over something the um

295
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,278
the color of the parentheses

296
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,480
is the same color as

297
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:03,200
like the line highlight for some reason

298
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,839
and i don't know if that's like that's

299
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
going to drive

300
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,880
me insane because i can't see that

301
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,160
they're there

302
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,159
so i don't know what exactly that

303
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,078
comes from if it comes from anything i

304
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,879
may need to update to the new

305
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,838
four coder flurry that he recently

306
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,000
pushed

307
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,040
and we can try that i'll be doing that

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,679
after the stream

309
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,278
either way but we may also just be able

310
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,719
to hack that because i don't really care

311
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:27,759
about updating to the new one at the

312
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,360
moment

313
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,600
but some of these things are just a

314
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,079
little bit nuts like i don't know

315
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,040
uh if i can actually get rid of that one

316
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,239
or not

317
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,000
but everything else seems to be good um

318
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
so we'll see i mean maybe i should just

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,958
bite the bullet

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,159
and do it um we've come this far let's

321
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,639
just take a

322
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,679
let's just take a a whack at it i

323
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,519
suppose

324
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,599
um if i just go ahead and grab the new

325
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,039
one

326
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:11,440
we'll see what we'll see what transpires

327
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:14,559
so um

328
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,560
let's see here

329
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,599
i'm desperately trying to download this

330
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,078
but of course like google can't really

331
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,959
download

332
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,319
things anymore i i don't really know

333
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,239
what the deal is like

334
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,160
gmail has basically melted down almost

335
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,879
completely and i and i have no idea why

336
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:39,120
um like gmail and google drive are

337
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,000
almost completely destroyed at this

338
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,919
point i don't

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,799
i don't know who maintains these things

340
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,199
probably because there's not enough

341
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,199
advertising in them or something

342
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
they just don't work anymore it's kind

343
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,959
of nuts

344
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,839
the number of things i use which are

345
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,799
just rapidly degrading i constantly have

346
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,800
and in this like

347
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,159
position of having to like

348
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,159
worry about what i'm going to use for

349
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,519
basic services because they degrade

350
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,278
so rapidly it's nuts i mean you know

351
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
it used to be that i could relatively

352
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,078
rely on that gmail would work and now it

353
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,839
doesn't anymore

354
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,838
google drive is just complete nightmare

355
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,279
it doesn't work hardly at all

356
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,240
um it's just nuts

357
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,799
anyway um so i'm gonna move this over

358
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,399
here

359
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,078
uh while i'm at it i might as well grab

360
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,519
the new remedy i mean while we're while

361
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,519
we're moving stuff onto this machine

362
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,359
because there's been a patch uh for the

363
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,799
latest

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
it's 3-1-1 now

365
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:49,839
all right okay

366
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:57,838
so uh here's our four coder flurry

367
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,679
and we'll clean up those uh color issues

368
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,920
and here's our four coder

369
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,319
here's our remedy bg we don't need this

370
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,319
anymore

371
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:13,439
so remedy bg

372
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,440
can just get romped

373
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,838
there you go

374
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,439
and four coder flurry is a little harder

375
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,679
because um

376
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
well we have to save our bindings and

377
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,159
stuff although actually

378
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:33,519
it looks like none of this is

379
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:35,439
that way i don't actually modify any of

380
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,919
these files as far as i know

381
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,480
so i believe that we can just take them

382
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,799
all

383
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,839
wholesale because the only thing that i

384
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,240
actually need to do

385
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,600
is go and include my four coder

386
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,720
casey file which

387
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,800
obviously isn't included in his

388
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,480
but other than that i think we should be

389
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,198
fine

390
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,560
so let's take a look um let me close all

391
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:05,439
this stuff out

392
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,439
uh okay i guess i didn't save that

393
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,639
um and i'll back it up as well just to

394
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,838
make sure

395
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,839
um we'll see

396
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:21,120
okay uh and then we'll give it a shot

397
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:29,838
so here's apps for coder here's the

398
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,919
four coder flurry layer that i currently

399
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,920
have

400
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:37,360
um my themes file is actually in here

401
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,879
and my bindings file

402
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,159
is is here so we're not actually

403
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,480
changing any of that

404
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,240
um but you know what i'll just i'll just

405
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,560
copy the whole thing anyway

406
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,440
um i need to push these out to the

407
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,198
github

408
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,880
to the flurry github at some point so

409
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,359
they're backed up better

410
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,519
i'm not sure exactly how bindings files

411
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,039
would get backed up but

412
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,039
i don't know i don't want to know

413
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,120
so all i should have to do here is just

414
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,360
overwrite my stuff

415
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,159
and i may have to do some extra work

416
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,199
because

417
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:14,319
the like the theme example

418
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,159
file here um that's probably something

419
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,360
that i'm going to have to look at now

420
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,519
because

421
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,199
even though i'm not using it it's all

422
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,240
the color definitions

423
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:26,240
so if we go and you know we look at

424
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,559
this theme example file

425
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,480
um i'm not sure

426
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,680
so i'm not sure these are all new right

427
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,479
and that's relevant but i thought there

428
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,679
was some stuff

429
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,839
like in terms of like dimming

430
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:55,679
the in terms of like dimming the

431
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,759
the pain that you were on i thought he

432
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:01,039
mentioned that that actually got

433
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,600
defined in here somewhere but it doesn't

434
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,198
actually

435
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,720
look like it so that may still be in

436
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,838
there but

437
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,439
you know i can i can certainly uh

438
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,438
try to figure that part out separately

439
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,360
some other time

440
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,839
all right so if we actually just rebuild

441
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,119
we should get an error um well we

442
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,879
wouldn't really get an error but on four

443
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,879
coder load we'll get an error so if i

444
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:28,160
if i open up four coder um oh my

445
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,160
that doesn't seem good does it

446
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:36,319
okay i don't know what that was about um

447
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,038
so if we if if i rebuild this

448
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,798
uh it's not gonna it's not gonna include

449
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,599
my custom files so when we actually

450
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,279
launch my

451
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,119
my special key bindings and stuff

452
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,279
wouldn't work so

453
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,279
i need to do one modification to it

454
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,200
which is i need to be able to have the

455
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,839
four coder

456
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,120
uh i need to make sure that for coder

457
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,000
flurry includes me

458
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,959
that's really it um so in here where

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,798
it's got all this stuff

460
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,600
i just need like four coder flurry

461
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,558
casey cpp i just need that to be

462
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,439
compiled

463
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,839
right um and that's all that should

464
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
matter

465
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,839
um

466
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,160
oh that's not true all right so yeah

467
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,079
that's right so i will have to do some

468
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,679
merges okay this is okay so this is

469
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,119
actually

470
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,200
once again we're not gonna probably

471
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,399
actually get to doing any real work

472
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,000
today

473
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,798
um because it looks like right i'll have

474
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,240
to merge

475
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:38,480
my cursor drawing code

476
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,319
um with the new cursor drawing code

477
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,919
because i actually put in some slightly

478
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,079
different code here

479
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,960
so i'll have to look at the difference

480
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,918
between these two

481
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,519
and try to merge them reasonably that's

482
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,919
the only thing

483
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,679
i'd forgotten that i had to fix because

484
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,440
the way the cursor was drawn

485
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
was sufficiently different that i was

486
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,080
like i should probably

487
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,720
do this myself so we have beyond compare

488
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,798
here

489
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,720
um and i do recommend this utility

490
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,558
i never remember to import my license

491
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,319
and i don't want to do it on stream

492
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,160
because then everyone can just use my

493
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,599
license i think

494
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,679
um so uh

495
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,119
i do actually like this utility i don't

496
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,080
love the new one

497
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,479
um it's a little bit webbed up a bit

498
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,678
much

499
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
but the at least i still use the older

500
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,519
one

501
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,640
i use beyond compare i think two

502
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,359
this is what four yeah i used two i

503
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
believe

504
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,119
um and i've always used it for stuff i

505
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:43,279
like it it's pretty good

506
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:45,359
um so i i would still recommend it

507
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,798
i don't know about the most modern one

508
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,639
what i should probably do

509
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,319
is copy the old one onto this machine

510
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,080
and import my license

511
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,599
um because i would rather use the old

512
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,960
one than the new one to be completely

513
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,678
honest

514
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,519
that's true of most software so okay

515
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,360
going on to

516
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,279
w apps backup i just have to look at the

517
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:09,199
cursor code now so

518
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:12,399
our cursor code um oops

519
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,679
in here so our cursor code is on the

520
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,960
left

521
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:21,519
and now we need to open the new one

522
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:25,200
on the right so

523
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:27,599
here uh and

524
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,558
i don't know to what extent we'll really

525
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,879
have to do much

526
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:36,079
it depends on how much this was changed

527
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,520
in ryan's stuff so you can see here like

528
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,079
these look like they're all

529
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,158
pretty easy to import for the most part

530
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:46,158
uh this is all stuff that i

531
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:50,240
you know basically did um i don't

532
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,480
actually want to replace

533
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,319
the f4 render cursor symbol thingy

534
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,839
necessarily

535
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,279
i would probably rather just insert it

536
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,000
but you know what i'll let ryan deal

537
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,359
with that

538
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,240
because i'm just that charitable so i'm

539
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,519
going to go ahead

540
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,558
and copy all of this and just

541
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,798
romp the my version over

542
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,558
the other version right and then i'm

543
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,639
just going to go look in here to see

544
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,558
if if any of this stuff was really

545
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
changed much it doesn't really look like

546
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,599
it was

547
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,639
so these have to get moved out to color

548
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,959
bindings uh

549
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,480
eventually but it looks like it looks

550
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,759
like really

551
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,599
ryan hadn't touched this much

552
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:36,720
um from what i can tell

553
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,719
like it seems seems fine

554
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,960
so these i don't want

555
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,440
um so again i just want to get rid of

556
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,558
those

557
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,240
because they were moved up to here

558
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,678
um

559
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:58,319
[Music]

560
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,759
yeah so i mean i i think for the most

561
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,319
part it looks like ours

562
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,839
is just straight up you can just use it

563
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,480
right like there doesn't seem to be

564
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,959
anything

565
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
and i should really merge with ryan's um

566
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,440
so we should

567
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,519
we'll get together and handle that

568
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,000
separately i just have been too busy

569
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,558
uh to do it but it looks like everything

570
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,558
else is fine

571
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,400
so really we just want ours so we could

572
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,519
have just copied it over i just wanted

573
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,798
to make sure i didn't know if there were

574
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,279
any other color

575
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,240
things that were happening up here right

576
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,839
so

577
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:33,279
that should basically be it

578
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,959
so if that is the only thing then we are

579
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,399
now building but what was the weird

580
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,079
purple thing

581
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,720
like what's going on there

582
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,399
um that must mean that there are color

583
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,640
values that are not

584
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,320
set up for this thing or something

585
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,200
i wonder if ryan's around because i i

586
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:55,519
have no idea why that would be the case

587
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
it looks like what he did at least my

588
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:01,839
assumption would be

589
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,840
um that jimmy

590
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,119
that anything that isn't defined in the

591
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,038
file

592
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,399
is now purple right um so my assumption

593
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:14,158
is that

594
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,798
i mean i could be wrong i often am but

595
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,720
if we look at the for if the theme

596
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,440
example four coder

597
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,000
if we look at our theme i wonder if

598
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
that's just

599
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,880
things we haven't set yet is the only

600
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,599
problem there so like if we go

601
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:35,440
uh to my theme file which is

602
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:37,918
theme casey and i try to open that in a

603
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,759
new window i don't know

604
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,759
um let's see here

605
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,879
oh no what how do i open a new window i

606
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,440
don't even know

607
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,080
there we go um so if i look at these

608
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
side by

609
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:56,079
side uh and just look at what's in there

610
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,640
it looks more or less like all of this

611
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,879
stuff

612
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
is just the standard stuff so none of

613
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,600
that would have to change

614
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,120
but all of this looks different now so

615
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,480
these

616
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:13,119
these are maybe in there maybe not

617
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:15,839
um like i don't actually see

618
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,678
oh there it is okay so what we could do

619
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,720
is just kind of grab these

620
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,519
rearrange them and then set any that we

621
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,319
want to set

622
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,519
differently right and maybe that just

623
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,079
works and then we're done

624
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,599
if not we talk to ryan and find out like

625
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,158
where the actual colors are that we're

626
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,959
not

627
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,159
defining so i'm just going to go ahead

628
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,759
and put this

629
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,278
uh sort of at the end there

630
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,359
um so that it's easier for me to read

631
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,480
just what the list is it's just a little

632
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,479
hard to find everything

633
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,599
and then i'm going to look at which ones

634
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,400
i already had and put

635
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,359
plop those in there and then hopefully

636
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,440
that'll be it

637
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,759
if we're lucky because then we'll just

638
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,880
be able to you know

639
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:07,038
say okay this is this is all good

640
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,320
no more issues because the editing seems

641
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,319
fine it's just the colors

642
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,759
there's a few color things that make it

643
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,918
really hard to use

644
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,359
and so if we can just change some of

645
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,880
those colors

646
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,240
um hopefully we'll be fine

647
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,080
and really what we should also do at

648
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,440
some point but i'll do it off stream is

649
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:29,119
add our cursor color stuff in there

650
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,640
so basically right now i just hard coded

651
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,399
those two cursor colors so

652
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,559
what we'll do is we'll put those you

653
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,559
know

654
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,839
we'd make a casey color cursor or

655
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,200
something

656
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:46,558
right

657
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,038
all right so looking at these

658
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:49,759
some of them we already had so type

659
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,119
function

660
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:55,440
macro and four coder command uh

661
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,918
those we can just replace with our own

662
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,919
versions

663
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,439
so i'm going to put those up at the top

664
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,839
because those are the ones we knew that

665
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,038
we had

666
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:15,359
then we've got this and i don't

667
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:20,400
see like cursor mode

668
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:23,359
that that doesn't seem to exist maybe

669
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,200
at least it doesn't seem like it so from

670
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,038
what i can tell like these are not a

671
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,759
thing

672
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,720
these are um and they have not been

673
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,359
touched they're the same

674
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,519
so that would be all of the colors that

675
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,639
we can define now

676
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:43,440
so that seems like it's working right

677
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,000
and so now if we're lucky and we may not

678
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,679
be

679
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,278
we should be able to do something about

680
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,840
this stuff so

681
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,798
let's see what we can do um with some of

682
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,000
these highlights

683
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,960
so the the token highlight is like way

684
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
too much

685
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,440
right um and if we look

686
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,359
at where that was here the it's it's

687
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,840
this thing

688
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,798
we would want that to be backed down

689
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,720
quite a bit

690
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,319
and we already have like a there's a

691
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,919
line highlight

692
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,599
uh in here i believe yes it's this one

693
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,679
highlight cursor line

694
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,678
and all we would really want for that is

695
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,600
to just be the token should just be like

696
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,000
a little bit brighter or something right

697
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,000
so

698
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
you know maybe just bump it up a little

699
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,119
bit i don't want it to be like

700
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,480
shocking um then there's those

701
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,158
the parens uh which already i don't like

702
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,679
the fact that they're

703
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,080
so dark i mean it's just kind of hard to

704
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,000
read

705
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,158
in my opinion so i don't know where

706
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,480
that's i don't know what that's coming

707
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,120
from

708
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,480
actually so that may be

709
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:53,519
like brace highlights

710
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,278
uh probably not because it would have to

711
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,558
be something

712
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:02,640
that's the same as the line background

713
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:06,639
right so what is the line background

714
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:11,278
the line background was was this ff1

715
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:14,480
right um and so somehow that's

716
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:17,359
being used or something

717
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,240
like i really just don't know i really

718
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:20,240
just don't know what

719
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,519
where that's coming from unless it's

720
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:28,879
it's like that but that seems

721
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,879
nuts if that's the case right

722
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,569
so it would be nice to know where that

723
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,599
was coming from um

724
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:37,278
[Music]

725
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:40,959
it might be this actually

726
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:43,759
um so let's let's try that so if i put

727
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:49,200
this nonsense back in

728
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,200
is it just this it might be

729
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,519
oh wait i don't need to build i just

730
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,120
need to run it

731
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,119
so let's just see if that's what it is

732
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:13,440
yeah so that's what it actually is

733
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:15,919
um also what is going on with that

734
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,840
i have no idea what's going on with that

735
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,440
um all right so we've solved one mystery

736
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,278
which is just that it's it's this back

737
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,200
cycle text cycle thing

738
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:28,240
so i don't really love that very much

739
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,840
um i i definitely don't want the back

740
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,200
cycle probably

741
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:36,398
it's hard to say but i don't think i do

742
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,798
so i think i probably want this to be

743
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,199
still the zeros so it just doesn't draw

744
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,200
anything in the background

745
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,480
the text cycle clearly we do need

746
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,278
something but

747
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,120
maybe it's just uh much more subtle

748
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,798
right like i don't want anything too

749
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,398
drastic there so in terms of just the

750
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,839
default text color

751
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,239
which is this i feel like maybe we can

752
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:00,000
just

753
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,640
if we want to do something subtle we

754
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,679
could but just nothing particularly

755
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,038
onerous like the current version so you

756
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,679
know maybe it's just

757
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,640
like i don't know maybe this just goes

758
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,120
up one

759
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:19,200
or two like like this

760
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:23,839
um and then this one goes down

761
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
uh one

762
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,359
yeah i don't know

763
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,359
i don't know what that'll do i don't

764
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,079
know if i need to use

765
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,079
four of them or not uh we'll find out

766
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,480
and that seems fine right it's just like

767
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,240
a subtle

768
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,759
highlight although again you can see the

769
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,038
braces are highlighting there that might

770
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,440
be a different thing though

771
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,038
so in terms of the paren highlights that

772
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,640
seems fine

773
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,079
it's not too onerous it's just a little

774
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,320
bit more bright

775
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,000
um and that's fine so the real thing is

776
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,480
i don't get this

777
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,159
i don't understand at all that erasure

778
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,558
that's happening there

779
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,480
um so that one i just have no i have no

780
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,678
idea

781
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,839
we'll have to find out what that's

782
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,240
coming from however we're

783
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,599
almost there i think i don't again i do

784
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,960
not understand why

785
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,879
the these are darker

786
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,720
than everything else i don't think

787
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,559
that's normally what i would do so i

788
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,240
must have said that somehow but i'm not

789
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,599
sure

790
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,038
where or how that got set so we still

791
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,319
kind of have some more work to do that

792
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,440
would be nice

793
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,678
this says braces semicolons and stuff

794
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,679
um

795
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,679
that must be

796
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,678
the that's the darker version and again

797
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,038
i i don't really know that i want that

798
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,080
so it's really hard for me to say um

799
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,640
what this should actually be but

800
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,000
probably i don't want it to be that i

801
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,720
could knock it down like

802
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,119
one again just keeping it really subtle

803
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,319
i don't like how bold that it was

804
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:14,319
um but yeah

805
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:17,519
i also don't know like why operators

806
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,960
would need a special thing but again

807
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,159
they could just use

808
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,278
the same thing inactive pain overlay

809
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,760
um never that's the one that i guess we

810
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,319
needed

811
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,839
so this is the one to stop the dimming i

812
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,439
definitely don't want it to dim

813
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,439
at all um

814
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:39,359
file progress bar is the thing above the

815
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,640
top that says for the cursor i don't

816
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,639
know that we care too much about the

817
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,080
color of that

818
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,960
brace highlights so scopes containing

819
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,079
the cursor

820
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,759
so that's that really onerous one and i

821
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,678
don't think we want that

822
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,759
um so maybe we would do the same thing

823
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,559
we did here which is just give

824
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:59,519
the brace highlight a slight increase

825
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,720
maybe

826
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,720
right um

827
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,640
these are probably subdued enough at the

828
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,759
moment

829
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,360
um we'll see cursor macro

830
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,960
cursor power mode we don't need to

831
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,678
change token highlight

832
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,679
we definitely do and the token

833
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:27,759
highlights

834
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,240
well we already fixed all right um okay

835
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,519
so

836
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,640
we're getting closer i would say uh

837
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,159
but still not there yet so

838
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,919
now you can see the braces just

839
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,120
highlight a little bit which is fine i

840
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,640
don't know if i want them to be even

841
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,719
more than that or not

842
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,000
um because i don't really see that as

843
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,839
being valuable like

844
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,679
i don't know when i wouldn't know what

845
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,959
scope i was in

846
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,278
and that's certainly not going to tell

847
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,079
me i do feel like the connector lines or

848
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,278
maybe a little bit

849
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,480
much so turning those down a little bit

850
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,558
would probably also help um and so

851
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,880
really my only concern now i think

852
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:07,519
most of it is just that it's that

853
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:11,599
weird um

854
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:15,039
i i don't know where that's coming from

855
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,200
um so that that is a bit odd and

856
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,559
i feel like that probably has to be

857
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,480
fixed uh

858
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,918
but other than that i think we're good i

859
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,159
don't really want the

860
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,838
the mark displayed here but we'll take

861
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,480
that so i'm gonna write these down so i

862
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,719
can take them

863
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,639
care of them off stream but don't think

864
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:34,799
we need anything else

865
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:38,960
um from what i'm seeing here

866
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:44,159
so no

867
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,159
mark annotation

868
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:51,439
uh why do tokens

869
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,719
disappear so something there's something

870
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,760
weird going on there but i'm not sure

871
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,118
what

872
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,839
uh and then like i guess i can take care

873
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,760
of the less

874
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:04,159
bright scopes right now

875
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,040
i would also prefer it if this thing

876
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,799
went away

877
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,610
so like the no

878
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,240
active pain

879
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:16,000
[Music]

880
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:19,279
border would be nice um i don't i don't

881
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,719
care for that either

882
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,040
uh so i think we're good and

883
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,559
you know even that i probably could live

884
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,440
with for a few

885
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,799
uh hours anyway so i don't know that we

886
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,920
we care too much about that so i'm going

887
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
to go ahead and do the

888
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,240
couple of remaining low hanging fruit

889
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,599
things which is just um

890
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:42,799
get rid of the

891
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:47,519
the scope lines being so bright

892
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,400
uh and then maybe we're good

893
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,119
i also might turn down the roundness on

894
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,160
that

895
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,440
on the cursor so there's uh quite a bit

896
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,559
of roundness

897
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,599
happening um this

898
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,400
and i don't really like rounded things

899
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,079
just in general so we'll have to figure

900
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,079
out how to make that happen i'll write

901
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:13,839
that down as well

902
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,839
roundness parameter

903
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:25,839
and uh we'll go from there

904
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:28,239
okay uh and i think that's all good so

905
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,119
reasonably oops i don't know what

906
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,000
happened there

907
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,320
uh reasonably happy with all of that and

908
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,719
again like i think

909
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,280
the only thing we really need here maybe

910
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:42,719
is like these annotations are just too

911
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,519
much so maybe if we just turn them down

912
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,439
to like

913
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,480
you know i don't know if we need to be a

914
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,679
quarter

915
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,838
of the brightness but like maybe

916
00:36:51,679 --> 00:37:00,719
more like that in terms of alpha

917
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:02,719
um see if that's

918
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,919
more tolerable yeah so that that

919
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,919
wouldn't really get in my way

920
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,239
yeah so i think that's all good

921
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,519
and i'm also going to make a note that

922
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,078
the cursor

923
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,039
interpolation stuff seems kind of broken

924
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,519
a little bit

925
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,960
um so i might look into that as well

926
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:22,320
like there's just too many cursor

927
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,960
interpolation artifact

928
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,960
artifacts

929
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:35,679
okay um and we'll take one last gander

930
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:39,519
i guess i'll rebuild this as well so we

931
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,519
can get the roundness removed

932
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:51,839
oh whoops

933
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,838
looks like i missed one

934
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,920
did i

935
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,079
yes i did all right okay

936
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,519
so now we're back to

937
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,680
non-rounded cursors which is much more

938
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,719
comfortable uh for me

939
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:21,199
i also think the thickness is maybe a

940
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,199
bit much

941
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,039
looks like i didn't do that though maybe

942
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,119
the thickness isn't getting piped

943
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,119
through

944
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,039
it looks like it's only looks like it's

945
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,000
only on those little guys and this

946
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,800
the main one is like bigger or something

947
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,480
i don't know where that's coming from

948
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
all right well we'll take a look

949
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,960
thickness of cursor question mark

950
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,598
so i'll have my stuff for afterwards so

951
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,000
i think that's it i don't think we can

952
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,838
fix

953
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
the text i mean maybe we can if we just

954
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,078
guessed right but

955
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,760
since i have no idea what of this would

956
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,680
be involved in making the

957
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,040
token disappear like that um

958
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,679
i really don't have any idea where i

959
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:20,880
would look

960
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,879
right like just looking

961
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,160
token highlight

962
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,880
i'm not sure there's really much else to

963
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,880
this um

964
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
i mean it could have something to do

965
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
with this i guess but that wouldn't

966
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,079
disappear

967
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:45,440
right that's still that would show up so

968
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,440
it i mean i just don't see

969
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,960
so i don't know where that's coming from

970
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,440
so i'm gonna go ahead and just uh i'll

971
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,519
talk

972
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,800
to ryan about that and we'll go from

973
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,838
there

974
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,920
uh so let's try doing just

975
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,000
to see what happens if we edit because

976
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,440
we may discover some things

977
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,639
um along the way i don't know uh so if

978
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,159
we go ahead and build

979
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,239
like right and just see if we can jump

980
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,118
to errors and stuff like that

981
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,159
um because i don't know if we can of

982
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,358
course we don't have any errors at the

983
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,358
moment but we'll go make some

984
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:27,119
uh and

985
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,119
it seems pretty good

986
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,119
i would say it for whatever reason it

987
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,760
seems a bit dim i'm wondering does this

988
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,280
monitor a bit cause i think they're the

989
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,400
same colors

990
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,400
um no that's as bright as it gets

991
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:52,318
maybe i'll turn the contrast up a little

992
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,598
i don't know maybe that was a bad idea

993
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:57,358
we'll see

994
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:00,960
um it seems a bit dim

995
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,239
to me um it may actually be also like

996
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,800
the font

997
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,239
is not the font i'm used to so we might

998
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,119
have to go like set the font to

999
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,559
something else

1000
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,440
that may be part of the reason why it

1001
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,440
feels a little bit off

1002
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:14,078
so

1003
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,039
yeah i don't know that'll be a weird one

1004
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,800
too

1005
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,719
it's weird we can kind of see these sort

1006
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:34,720
of things you're like oh that's a little

1007
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:37,039
bit seems a little bit wrong

1008
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:37,039
all right

1009
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,279
other than the dimness which seems a

1010
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,440
little bit

1011
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,680
annoying like the dimness definitely

1012
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,440
kind of bugs me i don't know why it so

1013
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,598
feels so dim but it definitely feels

1014
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,240
really dim i don't know if it feels dim

1015
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,640
to you

1016
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,159
out there at home but it definitely

1017
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,519
feels dim to me

1018
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,719
and i'm not sure where that's coming

1019
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,719
from um

1020
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,000
hard to say all right so yeah we can

1021
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,119
compile just fine

1022
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,679
um let's see what actually happens if we

1023
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,960
try to make some edits here so we go in

1024
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:14,159
and let's suppose uh

1025
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,679
that we're gonna go into the entity

1026
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,039
system and do some stuff so one of the

1027
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,239
next things that i might do

1028
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,358
for example is i had kind of thought to

1029
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,118
myself well

1030
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:28,318
i might want to uh

1031
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,318
i might want to go in

1032
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:34,960
and start removing the idea of end

1033
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,960
of entity pieces

1034
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,559
because one of the problems that i have

1035
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:45,598
right now

1036
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,679
is that there's just kind of too much

1037
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,680
cruft involved in how these entities

1038
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,838
work

1039
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,519
um so i don't really know if any pieces

1040
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,358
should exist or not

1041
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,880
but they're kind of a little bit broken

1042
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,880
at the moment

1043
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,160
and a lot of this depends on what we

1044
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,200
want to do

1045
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:06,000
with the tag matching long term as well

1046
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:09,039
uh because what i'd like to do now is

1047
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,239
i'd like to be able to get to the point

1048
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:14,800
um now where we're pretty it's pretty

1049
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,598
easy to like move stuff around

1050
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,680
in the game in terms of like what art

1051
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,720
goes with what things

1052
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,639
uh and right now that's definitely too

1053
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,239
weird right there's just too much

1054
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:29,598
involved in it

1055
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:32,078
and so what i'd like to do somehow is

1056
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,720
sort of rework that system a little bit

1057
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,318
and just

1058
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,639
just basically cut down on the

1059
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,480
complexity because at this point

1060
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,078
you know we know exactly what the art

1061
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,679
that comes in you know how it's

1062
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,800
working exactly so we should be able to

1063
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,399
do something here

1064
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,119
where we can uh

1065
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,559
where we can make it easier uh to set

1066
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,318
things up right

1067
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,000
and so that's the main thing that i kind

1068
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,400
of wanted to do next anyway

1069
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,760
um i think we'll just kind of leave

1070
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,480
lighting for a little bit and we'll come

1071
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,599
back to it

1072
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,800
uh later on but anyway so

1073
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,800
it's one of those things where

1074
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:12,399
we would definitely like to um

1075
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,880
we would definitely like to be able to

1076
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,520
to streamline and simplify this process

1077
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,799
you can see that it has this like tag

1078
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,800
system here for like

1079
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,880
going and finding what it's actually

1080
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,880
matching and if we look

1081
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:34,318
into the the sources directory

1082
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:38,280
um we've got like uh

1083
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,440
the tags files here so we've got like

1084
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,400
basegame.hd

1085
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,400
right and you can see

1086
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,400
that these things have you know

1087
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,040
this is a particular png file and it's a

1088
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,039
head

1089
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,039
right and it's got you know these tags

1090
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,199
on it or whatever

1091
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,679
and i guess the thing about it is just

1092
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,879
that like i feel like this was too much

1093
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,480
work for us

1094
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,480
right it just doesn't

1095
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,359
it just doesn't really help us very much

1096
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,400
it would be easier if we just

1097
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:13,440
said hey this is the

1098
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,920
identifier for this head and then we

1099
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,358
pick

1100
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,358
you know in in the game and so

1101
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,598
simplifying the tag system down to

1102
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,279
something where we literally just ask

1103
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,039
for one thing

1104
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,800
and then you just have a parameter that

1105
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,159
picks out of there because

1106
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,160
that's all you can really do with the

1107
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:34,799
art files anyway like

1108
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,799
you know when we load these things in

1109
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,240
uh if we go look at

1110
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,280
if we go look at like one of these right

1111
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,759
this is what the

1112
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,800
orphan head files look like right

1113
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,920
they're just laid out

1114
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,280
in a particular fashion so we know that

1115
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,519
they can only have

1116
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,359
just that one whatever it is that

1117
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,239
they've got

1118
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:02,400
um and so we don't really need any kind

1119
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:05,358
of elaborate tagging anymore we can just

1120
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,280
use some kind of a direct lookup

1121
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,199
which would be way more efficient and

1122
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,079
much easier to specify

1123
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:14,318
right and we would lose the ability for

1124
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,960
the art to be flexible with respect to

1125
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,480
the code

1126
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,880
certainly um so

1127
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,880
yeah i mean it's not that there aren't

1128
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,079
some drawbacks in sort of a

1129
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,880
broader scheme but just in terms of this

1130
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,920
stuff

1131
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,920
we could just make it a lot easier uh

1132
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,000
than than what we did right

1133
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,280
and so we still kind of need the

1134
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,679
complexity of this stuff

1135
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,560
sadly because there's no way like one of

1136
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,679
the real

1137
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,239
bummers about the way things work if you

1138
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,679
do

1139
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:50,318
kind of just pngs as your source assets

1140
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:53,440
right is there's no markup ability

1141
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:55,119
in them right there's no way to say like

1142
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,679
where the snap points are and that kind

1143
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,680
of stuff

1144
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:02,239
it's a very like you know um

1145
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,838
this is just an unavoidable consequence

1146
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,318
of the fact that 2d image creation

1147
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,239
software has not evolved since

1148
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,639
we started doing games and so you can't

1149
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,239
like do the kind of complex stuff you do

1150
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:13,679
with like 3d files where you say like

1151
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,679
this is an attach point and

1152
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,960
it snaps to here and all that stuff so

1153
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:17,598
we still need to be able to do that

1154
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,199
stuff but

1155
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,760
what i was saying is that you know in

1156
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,799
here we can certainly just try

1157
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,920
making these things more explicit so

1158
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,640
that we just

1159
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,159
we apply this stuff in code rather than

1160
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,799
exporting it out to the art side of

1161
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,920
things

1162
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,480
right meaning we don't try to

1163
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,039
have there be this elaborate binding

1164
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,199
stuff because it just takes time

1165
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,880
it just takes run time it doesn't really

1166
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,480
get us anything because we always are

1167
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,838
setting the tags to try and pick a

1168
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,199
specific thing anyway

1169
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:51,440
right so

1170
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,679
again i don't really know whether we

1171
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,599
want to keep the pieces part or not but

1172
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,318
i guess the first step here would just

1173
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,440
be to like

1174
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,880
stop doing the tags this way right and

1175
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,280
instead you would just say

1176
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,079
look for each of those pieces so for

1177
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,119
each of the

1178
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,240
entity piece this thing here this would

1179
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,960
actually be the thing

1180
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:13,598
that tells you what the piece is like

1181
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,720
which one you're getting

1182
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,720
and so you just need

1183
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,160
you just need an asset file and then

1184
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,440
like you would need to set up

1185
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,879
a lookup code for it and the problem is

1186
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,400
that the lookup codes

1187
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,599
are actually the things that would be

1188
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:36,160
specific uh to the file

1189
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:38,400
so like a head file is

1190
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,399
a head file is going to have a specific

1191
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,599
indexing scheme

1192
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,960
and so really i think

1193
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,359
that's the thing that this would need to

1194
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,000
say

1195
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,440
so it would need to say what kind of art

1196
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,440
piece it was

1197
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,559
and then it would need to say what

1198
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,679
indexing scheme it

1199
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,119
needs right and then it would just use

1200
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,759
that indexing scheme

1201
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,039
i think that is more or less the

1202
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,079
entirety of it

1203
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,519
right like i don't think

1204
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,760
i don't think we would need anything

1205
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,079
else

1206
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,040
so if we go into the asset system as it

1207
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,920
is now

1208
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,519
um and we just look at like the tag

1209
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,240
stuff

1210
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,880
uh i would think that we can just sort

1211
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,000
of

1212
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,480
not do that anymore uh

1213
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,838
and you could almost tell that that you

1214
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,960
kind of knew that was true

1215
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:35,279
already in a sense because uh

1216
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:38,720
we had the previously we

1217
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,280
when we made the import right

1218
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,399
we actually had these like tag matrices

1219
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,880
that we build

1220
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,079
right and then we apply those tag

1221
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,000
matrices to like

1222
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,359
like it's this it's this import grid

1223
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,639
stuff right

1224
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:55,759
we apply the tag matrices on top

1225
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,639
of the asset files but we know for a

1226
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,680
fact that they

1227
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,920
always have to be that

1228
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:03,679
set of tags because that's how we're

1229
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,480
applying them in the first place

1230
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:11,279
so if we just saved these sets of

1231
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,880
tag matrices if we just thought of those

1232
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,599
as hard-coded things that were in the

1233
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,318
game

1234
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,880
right and then all you were doing when

1235
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:18,639
you

1236
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,920
marked up one of these asset files it

1237
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,679
said well

1238
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,200
it's you know it uses this particular

1239
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:26,719
tag matrix

1240
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:28,799
then we don't really need the constant

1241
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,118
of tags anymore because you now know

1242
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,480
it is this particular 2d matrix is how

1243
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,280
the lookups work

1244
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,039
right and so that's really just like a

1245
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,319
massive simplification

1246
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:43,679
that we can do there

1247
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:45,519
um and again you know we can't

1248
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,879
we can't simplify it all the way down to

1249
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:48,639
the thing that we started with which is

1250
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,400
that the file name itself tells you

1251
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,960
everything you need to know

1252
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,599
um unfortunately that just is never

1253
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,280
going to happen

1254
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,440
and like i said that's because we need

1255
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,400
these alignment points in here

1256
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,599
we need the ability to save these out

1257
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,838
from the game

1258
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,640
like we do currently because we need to

1259
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,239
be able to adjust

1260
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,679
how these pieces snap together

1261
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:13,759
so they're really the only thing we can

1262
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,598
fix um

1263
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,599
is the part where you know you're

1264
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,280
picking these things out by using sort

1265
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,599
of a diffuse set of tags i think that

1266
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,519
was just a little bit too much

1267
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,280
it also and again just to tie it back to

1268
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:30,639
how things were working

1269
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,200
in the actual entity system uh

1270
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,838
is that if you look at these visible

1271
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:36,159
pieces

1272
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:39,440
you wanted each visible piece to

1273
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:41,039
actually have its own tag set

1274
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,039
in the old system and that was kind of

1275
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,358
not clear how that would work

1276
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,960
right and so what we really want to be

1277
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:50,400
able to do is just replace

1278
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,400
this so instead of just the flags it

1279
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,720
also would then have

1280
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,519
um a thing which said this is the piece

1281
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:59,199
that i am

1282
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:02,480
in some you know big set of identifiers

1283
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,318
for pieces right

1284
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,000
and then we can just use those you know

1285
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,239
we just have sort of a standard

1286
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,280
enum set that just says here's all of

1287
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,919
the the different stuff that we have

1288
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,040
and i think that's probably just better

1289
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,079
i mean

1290
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:20,000
because again like we still can leverage

1291
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,400
the fact that these files have multiple

1292
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,480
things

1293
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,639
in them to avoid having to have too many

1294
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,519
enums so like when we look at something

1295
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,279
like this

1296
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,039
we don't have to define enums for each

1297
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,960
of these we just need an enum

1298
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:32,480
basically like per file so you can say

1299
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,119
like what's this thing oh it's like

1300
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,119
fire particles and then there's just a a

1301
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,358
big thing of fire particles in here

1302
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,599
right and that's all we really needed to

1303
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:41,598
know

1304
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:44,719
so i think that's what i would like to

1305
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,079
do next and that way we can just start

1306
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,318
to decorate the game more

1307
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,760
which i think would be nice um and we

1308
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,159
can put each of the different

1309
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,079
uh orphans in there correctly because we

1310
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:57,199
have all the different orphan bodies and

1311
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,280
orphan heads and stuff like that um so i

1312
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,399
think that's probably the best idea

1313
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,559
um for now right and

1314
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,519
uh and so i think that's what i would

1315
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,880
like to do next

1316
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:13,599
and looking at some of this stuff

1317
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,599
so blocks are fine um

1318
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:21,279
oh it's krampus um and

1319
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,400
yeah so i i i think that'll just work

1320
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,400
that's my theory anyway

1321
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:31,200
all right so

1322
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,880
effectively what this would look like is

1323
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,919
that when we build

1324
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,680
one of these asset files uh what we

1325
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,960
or rather when we load i guess i should

1326
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:40,719
say these asset files

1327
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,159
what we would do when we merge the asset

1328
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:45,039
files together

1329
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,960
is we try to just figure out of all of

1330
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,639
the tags of all of the

1331
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,400
i guess not tags but um of all of the

1332
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:56,639
things we have and we could

1333
00:53:52,400 --> 00:54:00,079
call those tags i guess if we want to um

1334
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,078
we would just need to figure out

1335
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,000
each of those would map into a table

1336
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:09,599
where the table just said what the file

1337
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,838
you know an id that corresponds to that

1338
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,838
file

1339
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:18,879
and we would already know in the code

1340
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:19,598
which kind it was so if it was a head if

1341
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,800
it was a

1342
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:26,880
you know a particle etc etc

1343
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,240
so there'd just be something and i guess

1344
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,440
we don't have a tags

1345
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:33,118
uh section here or whatever but

1346
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,039
we have a thing that that has like the

1347
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,519
file format information in it so like

1348
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,599
these

1349
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,798
right they've got all of this stuff

1350
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,599
right

1351
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,318
and you can see just why i think this

1352
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,000
kind of

1353
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,920
system didn't really work out that well

1354
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,358
it's just because you end up defining so

1355
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,119
many things anyway

1356
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,719
that you should have just used specifics

1357
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,760
and let the code handle it it's one of

1358
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,879
those things where you

1359
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,640
are inserting too much slop

1360
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,798
and the idea is that somehow that slop

1361
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:03,199
will become useful but it never does

1362
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:07,039
right um you never actually

1363
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:08,798
end up having sort of um

1364
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,239
any of the the play in the joints that

1365
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:11,280
you thought was going to be really

1366
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,479
useful to you somehow

1367
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:18,079
never actually ends up becoming that

1368
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:23,119
right so

1369
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:23,119
um so if we look we know that uh

1370
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:26,480
we know that some of this stuff right

1371
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,079
like head

1372
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,719
body that sort of stuff um block

1373
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,519
these map these are basically the things

1374
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,798
that tell us

1375
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:40,079
how to index into the files so

1376
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,119
the basic category i think would more or

1377
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,440
less

1378
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,160
survive unchanged and we should probably

1379
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,798
go through

1380
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:51,838
and like cut out some of the old

1381
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:54,400
unused stuff now um

1382
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:57,358
and just you know condense it down but

1383
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,920
it's the tags really that is the thing

1384
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:03,679
that then we would change and we might

1385
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:08,400
you know maybe what we should do

1386
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,399
is actually keep the tags file

1387
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,639
just keep the tag id as the thing and

1388
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:18,159
then we just change

1389
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:19,598
tags to meaning specifically

1390
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,838
which one of these things you're talking

1391
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,039
about right

1392
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,000
so when we look uh at those files all

1393
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,119
we're really doing

1394
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:34,480
is mapping this stuff to the files

1395
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:39,358
right and maybe that's how we do it

1396
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:41,440
so if we look in the base game hht file

1397
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,279
what i'm basically talking about here is

1398
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,000
for each of these

1399
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,720
when we do tags right instead now we

1400
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,880
would just

1401
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:54,159
call this like forest 01 right

1402
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,240
um or just forest

1403
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:58,078
right because if you look at what's in

1404
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,199
block forest 01

1405
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,519
so let's take a look right it's just a

1406
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:05,039
block

1407
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,759
and so if we wanted to have variants of

1408
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:10,318
this block we could have them stack up

1409
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,920
but you know all we really want to say

1410
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:13,199
is look when we're doing forest stuff

1411
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,798
that the tag for this

1412
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:20,159
is like you know i don't know

1413
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:22,880
forest block right

1414
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:23,519
and there wouldn't be multiple tags

1415
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,240
really

1416
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,599
i i guess you know one could argue that

1417
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:29,279
you need multiple tags to like put

1418
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,280
things into more than one place if for

1419
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,920
some reason you've got a single asset

1420
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,640
file that you want duplicated into two

1421
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,960
places but i don't know why we would

1422
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:40,000
ever

1423
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,199
do that so it's probably just

1424
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,400
like tag right

1425
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:46,719
and so if we were to look at what this

1426
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,559
would be so we got block orphanage here

1427
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:54,000
so we would do orphanage block right

1428
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:56,640
and because we have sort of

1429
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,719
a different conception of what this

1430
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:01,358
would be

1431
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:01,759
if we may want multiple tiles of this

1432
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,039
right

1433
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:08,400
so this is like just orphanage wall

1434
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:12,400
probably right and this is like forest

1435
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,400
floor you know what i mean

1436
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,000
uh and and i

1437
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,480
we could also adopt some of those team

1438
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,838
like forest basic and orphanage basic

1439
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,838
or something like that

1440
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:27,280
i don't know what we want to call those

1441
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,480
right but it would be something like

1442
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,519
this

1443
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,559
um and we've got block orphanage o2

1444
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:38,159
apparently uh no3 why is this

1445
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:38,640
there we go okay so there is floor

1446
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,440
there's

1447
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,480
there's stone floor okay okay so now i

1448
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,720
was right the first time

1449
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,880
i thought maybe there wasn't there so

1450
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:51,279
yeah so this is orphanage

1451
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:54,160
basic wall this is forest floor

1452
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,160
let's do it this way

1453
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,960
um that's not high spell orphanage

1454
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:10,880
and this is orphanage

1455
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,880
floor wood and this is orphanage floor

1456
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:20,639
stone

1457
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:22,960
and these would just get parsed and

1458
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:23,358
they'd just get slotted directly in

1459
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,760
there

1460
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:26,400
right and then from then on we don't

1461
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,359
need to do

1462
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,318
any tag matching anymore you just use a

1463
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,679
specific enum

1464
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:36,318
that goes directly with this now

1465
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:37,358
normally the underscores here is not how

1466
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:47,838
we do enum so

1467
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:47,838
you know it might be more like this

1468
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:56,960
right uh and off we go

1469
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,838
so i think that's more or less what i

1470
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,838
would want

1471
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:01,838
and

1472
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:17,358
and i guess when you think about it when

1473
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,358
we do a game build

1474
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:22,000
yeah we would just hard code those into

1475
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,200
an enum list and they would parse out of

1476
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,760
here and that would just be the end of

1477
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:27,358
it

1478
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,160
right so then if you imagine those were

1479
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,838
in here

1480
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,920
right if you imagine that now what we

1481
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,519
had was actually just the list of the

1482
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,318
things so we just had like

1483
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,318
this stuff in here

1484
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:43,838
right

1485
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,519
so that's a pretty weird thing i'm gonna

1486
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:57,519
have to take a look at too

1487
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:59,759
for some reason moving one token

1488
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,679
goes past the semicolon but the

1489
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,640
semicolon is a separate token

1490
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:04,639
so we have to look at that

1491
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:12,880
token move skips over semicolons

1492
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:16,000
the good news is we haven't noticed much

1493
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:20,960
else so i think our editing situation is

1494
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,960
seeming pretty reasonable right um

1495
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:36,719
so if we imagine these just got lined up

1496
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,519
like this

1497
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:39,838
uh that seems yeah that seems pretty

1498
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,280
good

1499
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:47,119
i don't know i'm i'm down with that

1500
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:50,480
so these would just be

1501
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,318
named by the people i guess

1502
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,240
uh although i guess these are the body

1503
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:56,639
types so i'm not sure how we want to

1504
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,959
name the body types exactly

1505
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,960
uh

1506
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,279
it looks like the bodies are basically

1507
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,760
named you know

1508
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,798
by their properties so like these are

1509
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,920
just orphan

1510
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:15,119
body earth i guess

1511
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:19,440
we could also try this sort of thing so

1512
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,440
we could also do like wall

1513
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,519
orphanage just so it's a little clearer

1514
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:28,318
floor floor

1515
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:35,838
i don't know

1516
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,920
that might be a little better just for

1517
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:49,838
our own ease of use

1518
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:49,838
so we can see what's what more quickly

1519
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,358
might want to get rid of the cursor

1520
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:04,880
trails as well

1521
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:06,639
they're just too much uh so there's a

1522
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,920
battery saver mode actually we can we

1523
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:09,920
can already kind of do that

1524
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,400
that i think yeah gets rid of the them

1525
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:15,838
it's much nicer without them

1526
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,200
i would i think actually they're just

1527
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,199
too noisy for me

1528
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:38,160
all right so looking at the orphan

1529
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,159
bodies here

1530
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,599
these would just be

1531
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,599
pretty straightforward

1532
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,680
i'm not sure if we had really much plans

1533
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:59,838
for what these

1534
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:59,838
meant but

1535
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,000
yeah sorry it's a little slow for me

1536
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,000
today like

1537
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,079
some of those little idiosyncrasies like

1538
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,280
the fact that it skips over a semicolon

1539
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,119
for some reason

1540
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,880
make it hard for me to edit fast because

1541
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,760
it edits differently than what i'm used

1542
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,880
to

1543
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,160
so i'm not sure how to really fix that

1544
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,400
part

1545
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,399
um

1546
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:38,480
you know like uh i guess that's just the

1547
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:41,838
code for that what determines a token in

1548
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:45,199
that setting is somehow different

1549
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:45,199
and so it's just a little bit tough

1550
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:55,838
all right

1551
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,440
so this is again something where it's

1552
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,358
just kind of really annoying because

1553
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,119
this stuff is really not stuff you

1554
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:26,880
should ever have to do

1555
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,798
it's just because c plus plus is such a

1556
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,240
gigantic pile of crap

1557
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:32,079
that you ever have to do anything like

1558
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,519
this yeah this is what computers were

1559
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,640
supposed to be made for but they're too

1560
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:37,920
busy worrying about

1561
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:39,358
like ridiculous crap in the spec about

1562
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,400
things that literally have no bearing on

1563
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,480
programming at all

1564
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,039
but you know they can't be bothered to

1565
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:48,000
actually get something that

1566
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,000
makes it automatic

1567
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:54,319
for you to have things like enums that

1568
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,318
are also strings

1569
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,599
it's insane

1570
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:01,838
never let anyone tell you can't program

1571
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,159
kids

1572
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:05,440
just go look at the c plus committee if

1573
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:07,038
you ever think you're not good enough to

1574
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:11,119
be a programmer

1575
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,119
there is no bar too low

1576
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,480
oh that's a spelling error

1577
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:24,558
op ron

1578
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:36,079
so that's all of the orphan bodies

1579
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,838
and you know i don't know but

1580
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,200
maybe walls and floors get separated in

1581
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:46,480
here if you imagine

1582
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:50,719
right uh

1583
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:53,039
and i assume we want this to just be tag

1584
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,038
right

1585
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,079
and eventually these will all have

1586
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:05,038
alignment info

1587
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:06,720
stuck in there because you know there

1588
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,079
we have to go into the little editor in

1589
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:10,159
the game

1590
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,400
at some point for each of these and

1591
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:15,118
actually like place where those

1592
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,039
attachment points are so all of these

1593
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,200
will eventually look like this one

1594
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,760
you know because it will have had the

1595
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:25,038
alignment data

1596
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:27,119
generated by the game editor but at the

1597
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,680
moment since we don't have that

1598
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,358
um all of these are basically all they

1599
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:33,279
will all they have is just the tag in

1600
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:38,318
them

1601
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:41,440
all right uh so this is

1602
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,000
still a body i guess right this is cat

1603
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,400
body

1604
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,400
fred

1605
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,318
cat body hannah

1606
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:55,358
um and cat body

1607
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:56,239
oh wait that's not cat body where's

1608
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:59,358
molly

1609
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:01,038
oh there's molly somehow krampus got

1610
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:02,480
inserted

1611
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,920
um in between i guess because we're

1612
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,358
going in alphabetical order but let's

1613
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,358
keep the cats together right

1614
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,798
so we've got molly who you just saw on

1615
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,039
stream earlier

1616
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:15,038
right

1617
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,838
uh so we've got the cat bodies and then

1618
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:25,838
we've got just krampus

1619
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:25,838
um

1620
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,000
i guess these are actually

1621
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:40,879
all in one file though

1622
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:40,880
so don't they have heads and bodies

1623
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,640
so i guess for some reason these are all

1624
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,159
together

1625
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:53,838
but i don't actually know why

1626
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:53,838
like why are they not

1627
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:07,838
i don't know why these wouldn't be in

1628
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:07,839
the same file

1629
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,838
um so that to me seems like it should

1630
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:17,198
probably just get fixed

1631
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:21,838
uh because there's no real reason not to

1632
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,838
do that

1633
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,000
like i mean they are still just heads

1634
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:35,358
and bodies right so i mean

1635
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,479
why would we not

1636
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,679
just have them i don't get it like i

1637
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:42,639
don't know why we did that

1638
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:44,960
unless there was some confusion as to

1639
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,159
how they should be created

1640
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:51,520
um i feel like we should just fix that

1641
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,519
so i might just say like

1642
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:56,158
you know these these should probably

1643
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,158
just be

1644
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:03,839
more like this

1645
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,440
i mean yet another way to say it was

1646
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:12,238
since there's heads as well as bodies

1647
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:13,919
and the type

1648
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:17,039
tells you the difference between those

1649
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:20,319
two maybe you don't even need that like

1650
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:20,319
maybe it's just this

1651
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:45,840
right um

1652
01:10:51,520 --> 01:11:00,080
i'm starting to have a thought

1653
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:01,599
i just had a thought that maybe i can

1654
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:05,198
get exactly what i want

1655
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,199
without actually even changing this

1656
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,399
so riddle me this tag man

1657
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,439
if we just said look

1658
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:27,840
we're going to keep most of this stuff

1659
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:27,839
but just flatten a few of these tags

1660
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:34,800
what if we just had a basically you

1661
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:40,319
hash the tag

1662
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:43,119
into a

1663
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,158
match which you just look up in table so

1664
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:46,640
for example

1665
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:48,879
this is basically already what we want

1666
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,480
it's just orphan hero orphan earth like

1667
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,920
if you read it

1668
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:55,919
not as two tags that are used in fuzzy

1669
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,640
matching but is in specifics so i just

1670
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,158
have to match these tags directly

1671
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:04,159
i mean who cares if i put an underscore

1672
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:07,759
between them or not i can make the code

1673
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:09,439
already do what i need it to do right

1674
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,679
and so if you just clean up a few of

1675
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:15,198
these and you say like oh this

1676
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:17,279
is you know um

1677
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:19,359
cat fred and cat hannah and cat molly

1678
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,119
probably instead of

1679
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,639
you know what was here before or

1680
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:26,719
something

1681
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:30,480
um it's still basically the same thing

1682
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:32,239
so i feel like if we just collapse a few

1683
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:37,839
of these

1684
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:37,839
we might actually be fine

1685
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:41,359
so let's try that because that's

1686
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,440
actually pretty compelling

1687
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:46,799
right so we just left everything exactly

1688
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:48,479
the way it was

1689
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,079
and then we just changed the lookup

1690
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:53,119
system so instead

1691
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:55,600
of there being so

1692
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:58,479
you know when we load it right you can

1693
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,960
see what happens

1694
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:05,919
during the asset actual loading process

1695
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,039
when we actually go through here and

1696
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,520
load these things in

1697
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:13,279
we load in all the different like um

1698
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,120
we load in all the different tags and we

1699
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:16,880
load in all the different assets and all

1700
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:20,640
that stuff right

1701
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:23,039
and once we do that we just have tag

1702
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,039
lists

1703
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:30,000
and when we go to do the matching

1704
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:32,799
we have to literally go through like

1705
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,800
each of those things so if you look

1706
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,800
there's like one of these um

1707
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:44,960
where is it here um

1708
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:48,479
it's it's like first asset of type

1709
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,840
right so you go look uh at the category

1710
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:51,839
you're talking about if you say that

1711
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,600
this thing's supposed to be a head file

1712
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,039
it goes in here

1713
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,880
and it starts looking for all of the

1714
01:13:55,039 --> 01:14:00,000
head assets or crap like that

1715
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,480
right and i think what we actually

1716
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,198
want to do here is just say look instead

1717
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,399
of that

1718
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:08,399
just have all the tags that aren't

1719
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:10,158
directional tags that aren't like

1720
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,158
that aren't picking from the matrix

1721
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:14,158
thing

1722
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,079
have all those tags actually just be

1723
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,679
things that you hash into a hash and you

1724
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:20,559
don't care about

1725
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:22,319
uh the type anymore other than just as

1726
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:27,120
something that's part of that hash

1727
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:31,840
matching right so there's something

1728
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,840
like this uh like asset

1729
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:37,198
um match

1730
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:43,840
i don't know we want to call this asset

1731
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,840
um

1732
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,279
i don't really know what this would be

1733
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,799
called exactly we'll think about that in

1734
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:54,158
a second

1735
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:57,279
but effectively what we get here is a

1736
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:59,599
hash of of the tags that are involved

1737
01:14:57,279 --> 01:14:59,599
and

1738
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:05,920
when we check the hash we

1739
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,399
would just check against the hash value

1740
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:12,960
first so there's something in here

1741
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:12,960
uh like a you know like a hash

1742
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:18,319
tag hash um and

1743
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:19,839
then in here is whatever the asset

1744
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:23,599
number actually is

1745
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,719
so the asset index in as it is currently

1746
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,960
loaded

1747
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,960
um

1748
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:34,719
maybe that oh no

1749
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:41,519
is my completion not turned on ah

1750
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:44,719
so completion is not in hold on a second

1751
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:47,360
we're gonna have to fix that i i

1752
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,399
live and die by completion so the

1753
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,920
completion

1754
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:53,599
is not is is erroneously only in the

1755
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,960
command version

1756
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,960
so if you take a look at

1757
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,119
where completion actually is happening

1758
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,840
here word complete

1759
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:05,039
um you can see that it only happens in

1760
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,679
the command version

1761
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:10,000
that's not acceptable right that's got

1762
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,000
to be

1763
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:14,238
that's got to be up here

1764
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:21,839
all right let's just go ahead and reload

1765
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,840
that

1766
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:28,239
um what buffers have i modified i don't

1767
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,239
even know what buffers have modified

1768
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:37,198
asset hash entry next

1769
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:37,198
so we'll get back to you in a moment

1770
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:42,879
it all looks good there um we can also

1771
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:45,839
at the moment

1772
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,239
turn off extra compilation to save time

1773
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,119
so

1774
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:51,039
like light prof and sphere and such

1775
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:53,279
don't actually need to run

1776
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,519
right we can just jump right to the

1777
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:59,198
actual game and compile it

1778
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,040
um so i think that's

1779
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,479
what we probably can do here with this

1780
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:05,439
system so it's not really

1781
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:07,039
it's not actually as far off as i was

1782
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:09,119
imagining it was

1783
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,760
so we probably can just do something

1784
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:11,760
much simpler

1785
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,120
oops that was power mode i didn't mean

1786
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:22,079
to do that

1787
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:23,840
i want battery mode there we go okay

1788
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,479
um so in theory completion should be

1789
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,480
working now

1790
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:33,840
is it let's see yes

1791
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:37,039
so uh let's go ahead and

1792
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,480
look at the asset

1793
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:41,359
hash entry so if we just imagine that

1794
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:44,479
we've got

1795
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:48,639
our assets hashed and we have like the

1796
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,639
asset index in the table here

1797
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,239
on load we can put all of these things

1798
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:54,319
into one of these

1799
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:55,599
hash tables so we can basically have a

1800
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:58,319
like tag hash

1801
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,760
here where we just look up things by the

1802
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:01,279
tags directly

1803
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,280
and that way when you ask for one of

1804
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:04,079
these things you can just ask for it by

1805
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,719
the hash

1806
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,679
now there's a couple different ways that

1807
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:13,840
we can

1808
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:13,840
look at this and

1809
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,000
my assumption is that actually what we

1810
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:21,440
can do is not have to use an

1811
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,840
a a real hash anyway

1812
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,719
because presumably we would probably

1813
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,840
only have

1814
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:29,119
something like you know less than a

1815
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,279
thousand tags

1816
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:35,439
anyway even in the final game

1817
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:36,399
so what we could probably do is just

1818
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:40,079
pack the bits

1819
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:44,158
in so we'll say you know you've got

1820
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:45,359
64 bits of hash and since you've got 64

1821
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:47,839
bits of hash

1822
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:48,479
we know that if you want to have say 10

1823
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,600
bits

1824
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:55,839
of tag data you can fit

1825
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:58,640
six tags into a single 64-bit id

1826
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,520
so the hash rather than thinking of it

1827
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,679
as a hash

1828
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,520
it's it's actually more like the act

1829
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,039
it's just is the tags

1830
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:09,600
right um so you wouldn't have to

1831
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,880
secondarily match or worry about hash

1832
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,600
collisions because

1833
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,239
there it would literally it's really not

1834
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,120
a hash

1835
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,839
per se it's it's more like just actually

1836
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,840
the thing

1837
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,400
right it's actually the data in in a

1838
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,440
sense

1839
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,839
so in here we could have um our tag hash

1840
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,559
right

1841
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,239
and we can have something you know i

1842
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,199
don't know how many of these we want

1843
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,399
um to have it doesn't really matter for

1844
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,519
now because we can look at the

1845
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,039
performance of that at some other time

1846
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,719
but if you imagine we would just have

1847
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:41,760
these hash entries in here and then we

1848
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,920
would do is just stick

1849
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,920
in

1850
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,000
the various pieces all we would then

1851
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,640
need is something that allows us to do a

1852
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,119
tag hash on say like four tags

1853
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,000
let's say four tags total or something

1854
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,519
like that

1855
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,039
and in fact if we assumed that each tag

1856
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,400
like i said was like 10 bits or

1857
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:04,158
something and we assumed no more than

1858
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:06,079
three tags we could even use 32 bits

1859
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:09,439
there's no real reason we don't care so

1860
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,439
64 is probably fine

1861
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,519
uh so i'm going to go ahead and and just

1862
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,760
assume that that's what we would do

1863
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,440
be doing and we would have something

1864
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,440
like okay

1865
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:24,079
you know get tag hash

1866
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:25,279
or something like this and in here we

1867
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:28,639
would pass those

1868
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:31,039
tags that we were getting from the hht

1869
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,319
file format stuff so in here where we've

1870
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,238
got these

1871
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:36,639
file formats with the different tags and

1872
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:40,238
so on so these tags for

1873
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:40,239
whatever is happening here

1874
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:47,840
these tags would be

1875
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,840
like fused together

1876
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:58,719
so when we go to produce the actual

1877
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:02,079
um composite of these

1878
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:05,679
we would just say yeah each one of these

1879
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:11,039
gets converted to you know

1880
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:13,600
a u64 and they just get ored together

1881
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:14,479
and we just shift them up so like the

1882
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,239
first one

1883
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:17,919
doesn't get shifted up at all like the

1884
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:18,638
second one gets shifted up 10 or

1885
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,560
whatever

1886
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:28,480
right um the next one gets shifted up

1887
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:32,000
20 and the final one gets shifted up

1888
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:33,839
30 right uh and so it's

1889
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,279
it's nothing special it's just pretty

1890
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,560
much what you would expect

1891
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:41,359
uh but that's how you do

1892
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,400
is this oh so this is backwards also we

1893
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:45,119
have one more thing

1894
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,319
in our bindings here apps four-footer

1895
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,679
bindings

1896
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:52,880
the mapping for home is

1897
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,239
is broken so it's it's actually the

1898
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:57,840
opposite of what it's supposed to be

1899
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:57,839
so this

1900
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:02,719
and this are flipped

1901
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,679
let's try that again

1902
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:12,959
so if i exit out of here

1903
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:16,159
and load back up there's probably a key

1904
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:20,639
to like reload the bindings or something

1905
01:22:16,158 --> 01:22:20,638
um but i don't know what it is

1906
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:29,360
so

1907
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:33,760
okay much better so if we

1908
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:37,119
assume that we have this way of

1909
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:42,639
generating a tag hash then yeah like

1910
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:42,639
all we need is just to remember that

1911
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:47,359
for any piece that we might have and

1912
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:49,759
like i said it would be compelling to

1913
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:53,119
force these things to always fit

1914
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:56,400
um into a u32

1915
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:57,119
just for compactness sake so i'm sort of

1916
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,079
tempted

1917
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:02,158
to say we should just say that you only

1918
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:06,000
get three of them

1919
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:08,399
uh because i think eight bits is too

1920
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,399
small

1921
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:12,960
like we definitely want more than eight

1922
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,199
eight bits

1923
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,198
but

1924
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:21,439
i don't know even 1024 is is a little

1925
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,079
bit

1926
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,599
squinky so like if you assume 64-bit you

1927
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,760
could even say like each one of these

1928
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:32,159
things could be 16 bits

1929
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:34,880
right um and you would still be fine

1930
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,559
so four tags 16 bits per tag still fits

1931
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,239
into u64 and you can use that for

1932
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,120
perfect matching no matter what it is

1933
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:41,759
like there's no

1934
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:44,238
possibilities that you have any issues

1935
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,480
so that does seem pretty good to me so

1936
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:47,439
it

1937
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:48,559
i mean maybe we just do that and so if

1938
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,799
you

1939
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,719
if you think back now to the problem

1940
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,639
that i was having before and was

1941
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:57,439
was worried about now this just gets a

1942
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,239
lot simpler

1943
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:02,000
simpler as we start to want this entity

1944
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:04,399
system to actually be good

1945
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,119
uh and we start to think about how what

1946
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:07,198
we're going to

1947
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:09,840
be doing to it to make it actually you

1948
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:12,559
know useful

1949
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,360
this is just sucks right it's hard to

1950
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,800
deal with

1951
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:16,799
these sorts of things you don't want to

1952
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,239
have variable length things lying around

1953
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,960
if you can avoid it you you know because

1954
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:25,439
they always lead to inefficiencies

1955
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,439
um whatever your final implication is

1956
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:36,399
basically anything that is variable

1957
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:38,559
length is always an extra consideration

1958
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,198
um when you when it comes time to think

1959
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,840
about performance

1960
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:44,559
if you ever choose to think about

1961
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,920
performance and so

1962
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,600
i tend to try and eliminate those things

1963
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,199
where possible and obviously sometimes

1964
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,079
it's not possible and that's fine you

1965
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:51,839
know you deal with

1966
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:53,198
those sorts of things or you don't if

1967
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,159
you like i said don't care about the

1968
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:55,359
performance

1969
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,960
then you just don't have to care because

1970
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:58,158
you can do whatever you want but

1971
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,600
assuming you're actually trying to think

1972
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:01,039
about the efficiency of the overall

1973
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,239
thing

1974
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:04,639
then when you actually look at something

1975
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:06,000
like this um

1976
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,440
you know it just looks ugly and you're

1977
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,039
like you can kind of see that this sort

1978
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,000
of wanted to be a variable thing and it

1979
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:12,719
just kind of isn't

1980
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,960
it's just like a weird like oh you know

1981
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,960
um

1982
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:19,279
we've got sort of eight of them i guess

1983
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:21,198
or something like that

1984
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,599
and it's just like it still takes up way

1985
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:25,839
too much room and blah blah blah blah

1986
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,800
and it's got values and a flexible count

1987
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,560
a lot of stuff

1988
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,159
so something like this is way easier we

1989
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,600
just say look at 64 bits

1990
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:33,920
we fit the thing in there and it can be

1991
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,199
a direct dispatch on that is much nicer

1992
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,800
right so in here and then oh and also

1993
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:40,238
and now we don't care about that we can

1994
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,920
put them directly in the pieces because

1995
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:43,919
they're relatively compact

1996
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,639
so they can just go in here and say look

1997
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,639
there's a tag

1998
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:52,239
hash on this and so

1999
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,119
the basic category plus the tag hash

2000
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:56,238
gives you

2001
01:25:53,119 --> 01:26:00,319
what you need right and

2002
01:25:56,238 --> 01:26:01,759
i don't know that we actually want the

2003
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:03,198
we could so there's a decision to make

2004
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,800
here which is do we want the asset

2005
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:09,839
category and the tag hash to be welded

2006
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:11,279
together or not

2007
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,119
and of course i don't really know the

2008
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:16,399
answer to that question

2009
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:18,479
because on the one hand

2010
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:20,559
it seems somewhat compelling to be able

2011
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,000
to just pass around one value and so if

2012
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,400
you imagined

2013
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,238
so let's say you took this right and you

2014
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:27,839
said well the asset category is fairly

2015
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:30,238
small so if you imagine

2016
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,079
shaving a few bits off of this you could

2017
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,519
actually fit the asset category in here

2018
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:35,198
basically for free because we're not

2019
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,280
going to have 65 000

2020
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:40,238
tags like i couldn't even understand

2021
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:42,158
them all if there were that many tags

2022
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,079
maybe if you're red dead redemption 2

2023
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:45,759
you can have 65 000 tires because you

2024
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,198
have like a project manager for every

2025
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,480
tag

2026
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:52,559
um but like

2027
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:53,759
you know on on a game where one person's

2028
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,159
doing all the programming that's just

2029
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,000
not

2030
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:57,439
gonna happen right it doesn't even make

2031
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,198
sense because they couldn't possibly

2032
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:00,559
write enough interesting stuff to even

2033
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:04,158
use that many tags

2034
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,199
by themselves so it would seem somewhat

2035
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:07,920
compelling to say

2036
01:27:05,198 --> 01:27:08,238
let's just float the basic category in

2037
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,639
there

2038
01:27:08,238 --> 01:27:12,479
and so you would then have like okay so

2039
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,480
there's

2040
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:16,559
there's four asset tags and also an

2041
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,959
asset basic category

2042
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,000
i'm attempted to sort of say yeah let's

2043
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,039
do that

2044
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:26,880
so in here we would do um

2045
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,880
the tags would would all be

2046
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:31,439
shifted up slightly so we'd say like

2047
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:33,759
okay you know maybe

2048
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:36,079
asset basic category if we look at this

2049
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,079
thing

2050
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:40,239
most of this is garbage like right now

2051
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:42,158
it's mostly just

2052
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:43,359
a couple of these for the basic

2053
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:46,559
categories there's

2054
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:46,559
you know these are not really

2055
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,198
actually representative you know what

2056
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,800
i'm saying so

2057
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:54,559
if you look at how many there are like

2058
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,119
it looks like it's pretty unlikely that

2059
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,120
there would be

2060
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:04,000
uh more than 16 of these anyway

2061
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:04,639
but even if we wanted to be very safe

2062
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,198
and

2063
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:09,520
call it let's say eight that would only

2064
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:12,559
be two bits less per

2065
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:13,199
um so we could just do that right we

2066
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,639
could say

2067
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:18,638
all right there's the asset category and

2068
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:22,480
that doesn't get shifted up at all

2069
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,480
um then we or in

2070
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,119
uh that needs an extra parentheses

2071
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,880
there we go uh then we orient everything

2072
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:33,359
and these just get shifted up by that

2073
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,359
eight

2074
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:40,639
so you know uh we start out eight

2075
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:43,759
up here then rather than adding

2076
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:45,199
16 right we just take two from each one

2077
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,000
to make up the difference

2078
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:49,039
uh in the eighth that we lost so instead

2079
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,238
of adding 16

2080
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:55,359
we add 14 to the eight uh

2081
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:57,119
so this this only goes up to 22 instead

2082
01:28:55,359 --> 01:29:00,158
of to 24.

2083
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,439
um and then again we add 14 instead of

2084
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:04,559
16 again

2085
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:05,678
so we end up with 36 and then we add it

2086
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,400
one more time

2087
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:10,000
so we were at 50 and then 14 would bring

2088
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:13,599
us 64. so that's correct

2089
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,439
right so this tag hash

2090
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,440
would just give you the entire thing and

2091
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:20,638
then when we look it up we may not look

2092
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:23,919
it up as a tag hash quite in that way

2093
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,639
um or we might you know i don't know uh

2094
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,719
so anyway

2095
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:29,520
this tag hash would be all we would need

2096
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:32,880
then so then if we went into

2097
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,000
the uh if if we went into the asset

2098
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,079
system

2099
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,520
where we're actually would be looking

2100
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:38,639
these up

2101
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,080
or i guess i should say in the entity

2102
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,600
system where we're actually specifying

2103
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,119
what we're going to look up

2104
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,280
instead of having the asset basic

2105
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:47,439
category here and have the asset

2106
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:50,079
category

2107
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:51,439
piece there we would just have the tag

2108
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:54,639
hash

2109
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:58,879
part of things and we would

2110
01:29:54,639 --> 01:30:01,279
use just that for the lookup right

2111
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,719
and so probably that's like a primal

2112
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:04,479
thing that's basically saying look this

2113
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:07,840
is what we're getting and then we have

2114
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:07,839
like these other pieces here

2115
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,440
that we're using and i think that's all

2116
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,480
we really would

2117
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:18,399
need and so then this becomes

2118
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:20,079
a lot easier to work with because now

2119
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:22,559
the tags on the entity

2120
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:23,119
we just would get rid of so you wouldn't

2121
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,280
actually

2122
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:27,840
need the tags on the entity anymore at

2123
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:30,960
all like this stuff

2124
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,600
wouldn't need to be there right um

2125
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,000
so now if we actually do a compilation

2126
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,440
here

2127
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,600
we can sort of take care of some of

2128
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:40,638
these errors um

2129
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:44,960
i'm also going to write down like

2130
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:49,840
full width compilation

2131
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:49,840
window all right

2132
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:54,960
um so this goes behind my head so i'm

2133
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:57,039
saying like you know having this over

2134
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,880
here would be pretty nice right um

2135
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,719
so switching the way that this thing

2136
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,239
works back to the old way i had it would

2137
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:03,840
be nice it looks like we've got a syntax

2138
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:06,879
error here probably because

2139
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,920
we've got um just sloppy sloppy parens

2140
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,319
right

2141
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:13,119
um so let's try and fix that so if we

2142
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:13,119
look at this

2143
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:17,279
what's going on with that indentation

2144
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,400
like that's

2145
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:24,639
should line up with that right um

2146
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:24,638
but for some reason it doesn't

2147
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:28,880
is that like some kind of four coder

2148
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:31,600
nonsense this used to work just fine so

2149
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,719
i don't feel like it's something's weird

2150
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,679
about that

2151
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,679
anyone know what that is

2152
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:41,359
right i mean that should line up

2153
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:42,839
properly with the parentheses but it

2154
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:47,119
doesn't

2155
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:47,119
like foo equals

2156
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:53,920
yeah that's just weird right i don't

2157
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:55,289
know what's going on there

2158
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,279
let's see paren

2159
01:31:55,289 --> 01:32:01,519
[Music]

2160
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:03,519
indenting busted

2161
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:06,320
man my handwriting is terrible today

2162
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:10,159
i'll be lucky if i can even read that

2163
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:12,399
um so yeah that

2164
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:13,759
should be lining up properly and isn't

2165
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:15,359
that's going to be really annoying

2166
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,440
but we'll have to figure out what's

2167
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:20,880
going on with that later

2168
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:25,039
here's our shift stuff

2169
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:27,090
you can see here that it's all lined up

2170
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,800
like so um

2171
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:31,600
[Music]

2172
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,159
and then we can balance our parentheses

2173
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,719
so

2174
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,719
should be that oops not that

2175
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:44,079
there we go so i think that's all good

2176
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,880
um so now if we take a look at what

2177
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:47,279
happens here

2178
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,000
right where we do get best match bitmap

2179
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:50,319
from

2180
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
hopefully now we can just turn this into

2181
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:55,840
a straightforward lookup

2182
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,119
where we just hand it that 64-bit

2183
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,880
identifier which is

2184
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:01,119
like the welding together of the tags in

2185
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:04,239
the category and such

2186
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:07,439
and hopefully then it will just do

2187
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:10,479
what it needs to do directly now

2188
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:12,000
the problem that we'll have and like i

2189
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:14,158
said we need to

2190
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,920
this probably will affect the import and

2191
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:17,039
we'll take a look at that next week

2192
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,440
because i don't think a lot of time

2193
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,840
today but

2194
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:24,000
when we look at the tag matching here we

2195
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,440
don't want any of this stuff anymore

2196
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,840
right

2197
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:29,119
so what we actually want to do is we

2198
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,400
want to pass down

2199
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:34,559
just a simple vector of the parameters

2200
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:35,519
and you can see what the parameters are

2201
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,880
already

2202
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,880
right um

2203
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:45,198
we already have them defined here and if

2204
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,880
you imagine getting rid of the weight

2205
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:50,319
vector because the weight vector

2206
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,920
is not useful right

2207
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:53,759
um so we imagine getting rid of the

2208
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,119
weight vector so weight vector goes

2209
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,280
goodbye

2210
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,800
um and we take a look at how the tags

2211
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:00,800
are these tags are now going to get

2212
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,960
replaced so we don't care about these

2213
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,480
i'm not sure what the heck this was

2214
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:08,158
about

2215
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:12,238
so if the thing is

2216
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:13,679
grass it wants to weight that more

2217
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:15,119
heavily and that must have been some

2218
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,639
hack for like getting the picking

2219
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:19,039
correct or whatever right like i don't

2220
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:21,119
even know

2221
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:22,639
but anyway we have like an entity facing

2222
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:25,679
direction here

2223
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:27,520
and so the entity facing direction is an

2224
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,480
example of a parameter that actually

2225
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,600
needs to go

2226
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:33,519
into the tag matrix

2227
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,960
um part of things which again like i

2228
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,360
said now can just be

2229
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,158
more of a direct match kind of a thing

2230
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:41,439
but we still

2231
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:42,960
do need that so when we actually call

2232
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:47,039
the matching

2233
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:50,560
uh we need in addition when we go

2234
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:51,359
and pass the the asset hash entry stuff

2235
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,760
right

2236
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:55,198
we also do need to pass like something

2237
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,520
like a vect4

2238
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:58,238
that has like the parameters for this

2239
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:00,320
thing

2240
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:02,238
that include like the facing direction

2241
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:04,399
[Music]

2242
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:06,000
and anything else that's parametric

2243
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:10,000
along the

2244
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,679
uh you know inside that matrix and

2245
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,359
the thing that i don't know is to what

2246
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:16,800
extent we actually have

2247
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:20,238
anything happening in there

2248
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,800
so we've got like i think there's like

2249
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:24,079
the dodging is in there but i don't i

2250
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,119
don't know if we

2251
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:29,679
actually use it i think we don't um

2252
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:32,238
so to the extent that we ever have this

2253
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:35,118
it's usually like just variance

2254
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:37,839
is mostly what is going on with that

2255
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:37,839
picking right

2256
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:46,560
um

2257
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:49,920
so i i it may just be facing directions

2258
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:53,440
and and i don't know like

2259
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,319
if it's like like the the the horizontal

2260
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:57,678
axis

2261
01:35:54,319 --> 01:36:01,039
just is not really used for anything

2262
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:04,239
um other than variance as far as i know

2263
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:08,840
so so we kind of have to like

2264
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:12,079
um see how that progresses a little bit

2265
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:14,239
more but at the very least at the moment

2266
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:16,079
we can say pretty definitively that like

2267
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,000
it just doesn't matter

2268
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:20,399
at all because all we've been using is

2269
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,359
that so maybe in the future we don't

2270
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:27,439
like it's unclear that we even use

2271
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:29,279
um those slots for anything

2272
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:31,639
it looks like there's some expressions

2273
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:33,198
in here so there maybe is an expression

2274
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:36,079
[Music]

2275
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:39,439
um feel but like basically we're just

2276
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:41,760
talking about passing

2277
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:43,519
a few things down so i think we can

2278
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,280
afford to do something like this

2279
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,920
which is like our match vector or

2280
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:50,079
something and just say look

2281
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,239
we're just gonna pass down the facing

2282
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,760
direction for now

2283
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:55,439
and we're not going to pass down

2284
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,880
anything else

2285
01:36:55,439 --> 01:37:01,759
right so this goes away and all this

2286
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:05,199
crap goes away

2287
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:07,119
goodbye um and you know we'll

2288
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:08,799
see what develops if we ever need

2289
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:10,639
anything else it may be that we end up

2290
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:13,360
with it's not even using

2291
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:14,239
everything in a v4 anyway because none

2292
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:17,039
of our stuff

2293
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:18,479
actually cares i don't know but what we

2294
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:20,560
would say is all right

2295
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:21,678
there's the assets here we know there's

2296
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,360
a tag hash

2297
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:27,359
that we're getting from there we're

2298
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:29,599
gonna pass in a single v4 match vector

2299
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:31,118
um and that's it like that's how we

2300
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,400
match our bitmaps now

2301
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:38,079
right so if we look at get match

2302
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:39,439
get best batch uh bitmap

2303
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:41,439
and we look at what that's actually

2304
01:37:39,439 --> 01:37:45,279
going to use now oh

2305
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,279
uh can we turn this thing off

2306
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,920
um no

2307
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,279
like i really strongly dislike that

2308
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,800
thing it it

2309
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:58,079
makes it impossible for me to see my

2310
01:37:54,800 --> 01:38:01,360
code um

2311
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:02,000
so while you know i don't mind that like

2312
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:04,079
it's helpful

2313
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,800
that it's showing this information but

2314
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,479
it should show it like over here

2315
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,039
right or something like it should show

2316
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,879
it some it should pick a location on the

2317
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:14,840
screen that's the least likely to be

2318
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:18,159
something that i would actually

2319
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:20,960
see um another option would be

2320
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,679
so okay here's an idea is ryan here he's

2321
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,118
probably not

2322
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,118
why would he be um

2323
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:30,400
um i don't know why he's here but or if

2324
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,960
he was here or

2325
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:36,079
what but here's the proposal ryan this

2326
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:40,319
is what i'm going to propose right now

2327
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:40,319
is ryan on the chat let's see

2328
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:46,719
i don't i don't see any flurry in there

2329
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,719
but here's my oh he is here all right

2330
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:50,480
never mind

2331
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:51,920
so here's the thing ryan i've got an

2332
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:54,079
idea

2333
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,960
so i like this thing that shows the

2334
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:57,039
stuff

2335
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,960
but it's always in the way like i can't

2336
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:00,960
see my code when it's up

2337
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,158
here's my new proposal are you ready for

2338
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:06,319
this

2339
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:09,519
it's just like it's just where it's at

2340
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:11,359
so rather than this thing we do a single

2341
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,080
window across the bottom like i used to

2342
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:15,759
have that's like

2343
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:19,039
only four lines long this thing

2344
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:20,880
just shows up down there right so you

2345
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:22,719
can always look down there for the

2346
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,400
for this stuff it doesn't interrupt code

2347
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:28,239
when you build

2348
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:30,238
if you when you hit next error it will

2349
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:31,678
show you the build happening in that

2350
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:34,718
same window so it's just like

2351
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:36,399
the multi-purpose crap that you need

2352
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:38,000
to see occasionally but that you don't

2353
01:39:36,399 --> 01:39:42,479
want to overwrite your stuff

2354
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,479
window does that seem plausible

2355
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:55,840
maybe

2356
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,719
i don't know what else to do because

2357
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,000
basically like it does seem like i mean

2358
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:05,520
i'm not used to it

2359
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,158
i would just turn it off for now because

2360
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:10,639
i'm not used to looking at it anyway

2361
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:11,198
but it does show useful information so

2362
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:13,199
if i

2363
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,399
started getting used to it i would

2364
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:17,519
probably use it

2365
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:18,879
but i can't handle that it overwrites

2366
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,960
what i'm looking at

2367
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,118
so i feel like it just needs to be moved

2368
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,198
somewhere but i don't know where

2369
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:26,799
but if we took the compile window and

2370
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:29,919
made that be the constant

2371
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:33,520
like hud basically

2372
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:36,158
um then we could show that stuff

2373
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,199
and it would possibly solve both

2374
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:40,319
problems i don't know

2375
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:42,238
maybe it doesn't i'm not sure

2376
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:43,759
my other idea was that you put it over

2377
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:46,079
on the opposite pane

2378
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,679
so like it's across from you but then

2379
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:49,279
that probably obscures something you

2380
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:53,840
were trying to look at as well so

2381
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:53,840
i just don't know um

2382
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:57,519
i don't know

2383
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:02,559
anyway i gotta send i gotta make a bunch

2384
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,679
of changes and then send you my changes

2385
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,239
anyway maybe i'll try that and see what

2386
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,319
happens

2387
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:09,919
i don't know it might be just a bad idea

2388
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:12,238
i have no idea

2389
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,239
um

2390
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:19,118
yeah we could make it be that the

2391
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:19,359
control key pops it up i think there's a

2392
01:41:19,118 --> 01:41:21,279
co

2393
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:23,279
the code peak thing there already is a

2394
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:27,679
code peak thing that happens

2395
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:31,118
that i don't really know much about um

2396
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:34,319
that right

2397
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:36,479
uh so it like it

2398
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:37,759
it pops up like a whole thing there's

2399
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:41,039
just a like

2400
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:42,960
there's a lot of stuff in here now

2401
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:44,639
that's actually really cool like you

2402
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,960
know you can just hover over something

2403
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:47,679
like get first asset from or something

2404
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,960
and

2405
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:52,158
um and hit that although so like random

2406
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,000
choice right

2407
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:55,359
and then you can hit the code peak

2408
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,039
thingy so you can say

2409
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,399
like which i don't have bound anything

2410
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:01,279
right now but

2411
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:01,920
um the flurry code peak thing it'll just

2412
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:04,158
jump you

2413
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,199
and show you like it'll jump you right

2414
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:06,719
to that

2415
01:42:05,198 --> 01:42:09,039
thing and show you what it is in like a

2416
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:11,279
pop-up which is great

2417
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,880
in theory but just not particularly

2418
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:16,079
useful in practice because

2419
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,079
it's unclear like

2420
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:21,840
it's unclear how i keep editing and

2421
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:24,560
still make use of this information

2422
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,679
so i feel like it's very useful but it

2423
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,960
needs to have

2424
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:31,199
some way to show itself

2425
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,480
in a location that doesn't make it

2426
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:34,799
impossible to keep

2427
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:36,959
working and that's the part that i'm not

2428
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:42,560
sure

2429
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:45,279
um exactly what the right decision is

2430
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,239
i still need to think about it i don't

2431
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:47,840
know

2432
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:50,158
but that's the problem like right now

2433
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:52,079
the problem is actually design

2434
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:53,679
not features like there's more features

2435
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:57,840
than fit in the like

2436
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:57,840
graphic design of what's going on

2437
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:11,840
if that makes sense

2438
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,600
well think about it yeah the a peak

2439
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,960
buffer that you stick into a panel is

2440
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,360
not a bad idea but

2441
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,359
again

2442
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:37,679
i just think the problem is

2443
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,520
fundamentally speaking it needs to be

2444
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,840
smarter about what's going on

2445
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,600
so when you're doing like a code peek it

2446
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:47,360
needs to try to get out of your way

2447
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,360
i mean i might almost suggest like

2448
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:52,399
it goes in the other pane on the

2449
01:43:50,238 --> 01:44:07,759
opposite half of the screen

2450
01:43:52,399 --> 01:44:10,238
from where you are right

2451
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:12,079
yeah jump to definition i use a lot as

2452
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:14,158
well people are talking about that and

2453
01:44:12,079 --> 01:44:15,760
and i made a new key command actually

2454
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:18,638
also which i think

2455
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:20,560
didn't i go to code peak i don't know if

2456
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:25,679
that's bound to anything though

2457
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:25,679
um is it let's see

2458
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:40,639
uh quote so i do have

2459
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:42,719
here like if i go um if i want to go to

2460
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:46,840
the definition of random choice

2461
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:50,158
i can just hit quote um and there i am

2462
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:53,279
right so

2463
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:56,238
i do have the jump version of this

2464
01:44:53,279 --> 01:44:57,118
where i do already do have that one

2465
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:00,158
right

2466
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:01,519
um and that seems pretty good like it

2467
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:03,679
does seem like a good

2468
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,639
feature i have to get used to actually

2469
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:08,399
using it but

2470
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:10,480
it seems pretty good right um

2471
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:11,439
so yeah what if you only have one paint

2472
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:13,039
i don't care

2473
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:14,399
i don't care at all what happens to

2474
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:16,079
people who only have one pain that's

2475
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:18,479
their problem

2476
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:21,039
if you only have one pain then you need

2477
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:24,079
to do your own design

2478
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:27,920
work right um

2479
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:29,600
i strictly do double pane editing so

2480
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:33,359
i'm only really concerned about things

2481
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:36,719
that happen with dual pane editing

2482
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:40,479
um so yeah jump history

2483
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:44,000
well i have jump history um

2484
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:47,359
in my in my normal editor that i use

2485
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,198
for day to day work um i don't know if

2486
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:51,198
four coder has the jump history stuff it

2487
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:53,439
i think it does

2488
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:54,799
anyway doesn't matter point being here's

2489
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:58,000
the get best match

2490
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:01,199
uh bitmap stuff and really

2491
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,800
this bitmap id nonsense um is just a way

2492
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:04,238
of making sure we keep things straight

2493
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,159
this is going to be the same lookup for

2494
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:07,919
all of the different assets we now no

2495
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:09,839
longer need this stuff so we're really

2496
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:12,800
just talking about

2497
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,199
one of those tags we probably should try

2498
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,679
to

2499
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:16,479
insulate ourselves a little bit here and

2500
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,600
say

2501
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:22,399
that you know asset tag hash

2502
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,400
something like that

2503
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:28,400
i probably should make sure that this is

2504
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:30,719
an actual type we've defined

2505
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:31,839
and that way we know that you know

2506
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:35,359
people aren't just

2507
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:36,639
accidentally passing an integer like uh

2508
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:38,000
because they got the function order

2509
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:40,239
wrong or something just to keep us a

2510
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,439
little bit more type checked

2511
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:44,158
and just lean on the power a little bit

2512
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:47,039
there for that but otherwise we're fine

2513
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:49,839
so we've got the the tag hash and the

2514
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:53,439
match vector

2515
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:57,119
those two things would just go in here

2516
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:59,839
and yeah and off we would go

2517
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:02,079
so this all should be basically the same

2518
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,079
um

2519
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:11,039
i guess for get first bitmap from

2520
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:13,360
i don't really know that that

2521
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:14,960
matters anymore but we'll humor them and

2522
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:18,479
just say well you just pass

2523
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:21,359
zeros as the match vector and that's

2524
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:21,678
you know you call it a day so when you

2525
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:26,399
call

2526
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:26,399
get uh also why

2527
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:33,520
yeah this this is not really gonna make

2528
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:35,118
much sense anymore so so really

2529
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:37,119
none of this it's not even best match

2530
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:38,399
like none of this this this is just

2531
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:40,319
gonna there's just gonna be one thing

2532
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:43,679
it's gonna be called get asset from

2533
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:45,118
right so it's always gonna be now called

2534
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:46,880
get asset from you're gonna

2535
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:49,039
pass at the assets you're gonna pass it

2536
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,719
the tag hash

2537
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:55,920
and the match vector it's gonna do

2538
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:59,359
this whole rigmarole you can see

2539
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,399
so random uh assets we're not using at

2540
01:47:59,359 --> 01:48:02,799
the moment which is fine

2541
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,799
and we don't care about that anyway so

2542
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:08,400
really this is the match

2543
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:14,159
bit here and

2544
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:14,158
so we need this to get superseded here

2545
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:20,479
so we're going to say get asset from it

2546
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:21,439
returns the u32

2547
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:22,399
i don't know that it really needs to be

2548
01:48:21,439 --> 01:48:23,839
a time function anymore because it

2549
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:26,879
should be quite fast

2550
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:29,840
now whereas it was quite slow before

2551
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:31,920
but uh when we do a get asset from we're

2552
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:35,039
going to look it up in the hash table so

2553
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:37,199
if we now look at what this was doing

2554
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:38,238
it's going to do something uh quite

2555
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:40,638
different so

2556
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:42,000
we shouldn't need to do this anymore we

2557
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:43,359
should be able to look up directly into

2558
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,960
the hash table

2559
01:48:43,359 --> 01:48:46,399
so there should just be this this tag

2560
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,920
hash um

2561
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:49,839
we wouldn't need this first asset of

2562
01:48:47,920 --> 01:49:01,840
type uh

2563
01:48:49,840 --> 01:49:01,840
i don't think for anything anymore

2564
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:06,880
um and

2565
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,440
i don't know if i should delete it just

2566
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:19,039
yet i'll just make a note

2567
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:21,279
but in here we would take the tag hash

2568
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:23,840
value and look it up in the hash table

2569
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:24,719
so it would basically just be hey yeah

2570
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,239
mod by

2571
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:30,639
whatever this thing is um

2572
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:32,399
and unfortunately we may need this to be

2573
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:34,639
sort of a prime number hash

2574
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:34,638
uh

2575
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:42,639
we can take a look at that and the

2576
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:44,479
reason that i say that is because

2577
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,840
what we're going to get here is the

2578
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:48,238
problem of

2579
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,560
we wouldn't really get any mixing on

2580
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:52,799
these tags

2581
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,560
we stack them in the order that we

2582
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:58,400
actually care about them and that's

2583
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:59,520
great but the problem is so you can see

2584
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:02,559
well you can already see what the

2585
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:05,760
problem is so in order to look this up

2586
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:08,560
in a relatively oh

2587
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:09,679
well actually but we can just mix it

2588
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,560
first

2589
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:14,239
because we actually have the power of a

2590
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:16,950
thousand suns

2591
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:20,019
if we want right um

2592
01:50:16,949 --> 01:50:20,019
[Music]

2593
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:25,118
because i think we allow sse4 or

2594
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:28,000
whatever right don't we

2595
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:28,559
what's our what's our situation here

2596
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,479
don't we

2597
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:32,080
i don't really know i don't really know

2598
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:33,359
what we allow and what we don't allow to

2599
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:37,118
be completely honest with you

2600
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:39,279
um at this point i have no idea

2601
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:40,639
about what we're actually using and what

2602
01:50:39,279 --> 01:50:42,960
we're not

2603
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:42,960
um

2604
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:53,840
yeah i don't know but if we wanted to

2605
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:07,839
so we just have a to do for this right

2606
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,840
um

2607
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,639
so i don't know like i don't know why we

2608
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,760
would at this point because we've gotten

2609
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:15,920
to the point where

2610
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,199
you know if we just take long enough to

2611
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,840
make handmade hero

2612
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:21,839
we don't have to worry about backwards

2613
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,840
compatibility

2614
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:27,679
basically the longer you take to make a

2615
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:27,679
game the easier it gets to make a game

2616
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:32,079
which is not true at all in the mental

2617
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:33,439
sense but it's definitely true in the

2618
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:36,559
compatibility sense

2619
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:38,879
so if you look here it's like it's

2620
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,800
basically complete like nobody on steam

2621
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,520
can't do that

2622
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:45,679
um so you pretty much can just ship i

2623
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,119
mean you could ship avx nowadays if you

2624
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:49,520
wanted to you're talking about seven

2625
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:52,639
percent of the user base on steam

2626
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:53,360
that you would be worried about not so

2627
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:56,800
much ssc

2628
01:51:53,359 --> 01:51:59,039
4a nobody really likes that um

2629
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:01,440
but there you go don't ship avx 512

2630
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:04,639
though folks

2631
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:09,039
not great market penetration there intel

2632
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:12,639
um so you know we probably just can

2633
01:52:09,039 --> 01:52:13,519
uh if we want to so what that means is

2634
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:16,319
if we wanted to

2635
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:17,520
we could just do you know some some

2636
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:21,279
hardcore

2637
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:25,280
hashing here right so if we have

2638
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:29,198
one of these tag hashes maybe we just

2639
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:29,198
maybe we just actually do

2640
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:36,238
um something fancy here

2641
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:39,598
you know like we want to produce

2642
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:43,118
a 32-bit look-up

2643
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:46,319
um from like

2644
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:49,439
some 64-bit values or whatever

2645
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:53,599
i don't know right so

2646
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:59,198
uh we want to call some kind of hash

2647
01:52:53,599 --> 01:53:00,639
or something

2648
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:02,879
maybe i'll call it hash 32 because it

2649
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:03,679
produces 32. you pass it two of these or

2650
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,279
something

2651
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:07,279
and we just want to produce a perfectly

2652
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:09,599
distributed number from that so we

2653
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:10,639
we don't want to have to use prime

2654
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:12,719
number

2655
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:14,880
slots and weird divides and crap like

2656
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:16,480
that

2657
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,639
and still get kind of questionable

2658
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:19,039
results so maybe we'll just have a hash

2659
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:21,359
here

2660
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:23,359
and what we'll do is we'll pass in the

2661
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:25,279
tag hash value thing so we'll just say

2662
01:53:23,359 --> 01:53:29,679
okay the tag hash

2663
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:32,960
value uh we we do a hash 32 of that

2664
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:33,760
and then we uh mod off which here which

2665
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,800
would just

2666
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:38,840
you know do a truncate and that gives us

2667
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:41,679
our hash slot

2668
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:45,679
right

2669
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:49,118
and to do this uh we we can just do

2670
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:53,199
um we can just do some

2671
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:54,719
aes rounds so basically like aes rounds

2672
01:53:53,198 --> 01:53:56,399
you know they're they're specifically

2673
01:53:54,719 --> 01:54:00,560
made for

2674
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:02,960
doing encryption right so they're

2675
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:05,280
they are specifically made to scramble

2676
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,198
the bits of a sequence

2677
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:08,719
in ways that are exactly what we would

2678
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:10,960
want for a hash table

2679
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:12,639
because they're very unpredictable and

2680
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,840
so they shouldn't

2681
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:15,679
they should take all the bits and

2682
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,520
scramble them

2683
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:23,039
a single round of aes only

2684
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:27,119
gets you bite

2685
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:30,238
to 32 so it goes each bit

2686
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:33,279
goes out to 32 bits worth of

2687
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:35,198
variance right and

2688
01:54:33,279 --> 01:54:37,118
so we need to run two rounds to make

2689
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:38,719
sure that we propagate our bits forward

2690
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:41,039
enough but that's all we should really

2691
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:43,039
need to do to get a pretty perfect hash

2692
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:48,158
out of it i would think

2693
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:48,158
so if we just said okay you know the

2694
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:51,840
uh

2695
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:00,559
if we just run a few rounds of this so

2696
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:03,760
we basically say like okay the

2697
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:06,480
the hash value is going to be an deck

2698
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:06,800
of whatever the value is starting with

2699
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:08,638
so

2700
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:10,159
we would just need something where we

2701
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:13,039
can load

2702
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:14,879
um two of these i don't actually know

2703
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:15,679
what the most efficient intrinsic is to

2704
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:18,400
tell it to take

2705
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:19,359
two 64 bits because there isn't really

2706
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:22,638
such a thing

2707
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:25,598
you but so you kind of need to

2708
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:26,960
load into each side and or is probably

2709
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:28,319
what you would do but let me just check

2710
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,480
what the

2711
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:32,639
intrinsics are for this sort of thing

2712
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,158
these days

2713
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:47,840
so assuming that we're doing something

2714
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:47,839
like this

2715
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:53,520
um that's actually loading from so

2716
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:55,118
do i want to call this convert what is

2717
01:55:53,520 --> 01:56:00,400
what is your terminology here

2718
01:55:55,118 --> 01:56:03,279
mr intel

2719
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:04,238
all right so so this is this is probably

2720
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:07,759
what would tell

2721
01:56:04,238 --> 01:56:08,158
the compiler what we want for the most

2722
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,599
part

2723
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:14,719
so like set epix48x

2724
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:16,480
right that's what we're trying to do so

2725
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:18,079
i think that would tell the compiler as

2726
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:19,039
best as possible like we're trying to

2727
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:22,719
put these things

2728
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:22,719
in to uh you know

2729
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,880
uh into a single register so i'm gonna

2730
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:29,198
try this

2731
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:31,118
and and hope that that tells compiler

2732
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:34,638
well enough what i'm trying to do

2733
01:56:31,118 --> 01:56:36,319
right so here there you go

2734
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:37,679
um we don't care about the order it

2735
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:39,279
doesn't matter because we're hashing

2736
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:40,639
them so as long as they both go in there

2737
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:42,800
it's fine

2738
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:43,760
um so then we would just need basically

2739
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,440
like a seed

2740
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:51,760
here so i'm gonna make sure that

2741
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:55,598
the seed is loaded up in there

2742
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:59,360
and i'll just hash this twice

2743
01:56:55,599 --> 01:57:04,079
and then we'll call it a day

2744
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:04,079
so the result of the hash um

2745
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:13,279
we would then need to do an mm convert

2746
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:15,039
so that we can pull out the

2747
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:17,359
i don't remember the syntax they use for

2748
01:57:15,039 --> 01:57:18,800
these but we basically need to do a

2749
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:22,559
convert

2750
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:26,560
out to a register

2751
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:31,520
this intel syntax always drives me nuts

2752
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:35,280
because i never remember um so

2753
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:39,840
not that um

2754
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,840
not that either

2755
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:46,960
oh for the love of god just extract the

2756
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:52,560
thing okay

2757
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:55,840
uh it's this

2758
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,960
so let's convert si 128 so the si120

2759
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:00,159
goes on the inside

2760
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:01,920
so it would be mm well actually you know

2761
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:06,238
what it's probably an extract

2762
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:10,158
technically though right

2763
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:13,198
yeah so

2764
01:58:10,158 --> 01:58:14,799
we only need 32 out of it and we just

2765
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:18,000
need the zero with one so

2766
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:21,440
presumably that's the right one to do

2767
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:25,920
i don't know i mean arguably you

2768
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:26,319
maybe ju if you only want the bottom one

2769
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,880
they

2770
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:30,479
might have had a better one so i could

2771
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:34,159
see

2772
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:35,839
um asking for an epi 32 here just to

2773
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:39,359
make sure

2774
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:41,199
that i'm not totally wrong about that

2775
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:42,399
so those all still seem like the same

2776
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:48,319
level so

2777
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:50,559
i'm not sure that it really helps but

2778
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:52,639
just looking because that's the one that

2779
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:54,880
that would do what we want

2780
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:54,880
right

2781
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:00,800
i mean it looks like that's the only one

2782
01:59:00,479 --> 01:59:02,399
so

2783
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:04,560
i'm just going to say that that's maybe

2784
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:06,879
what we want so it's extract dpi

2785
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:06,880
you know

2786
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:21,840
so extract dpr32

2787
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:25,198
and a immediate so

2788
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:28,800
it would just be hash zero

2789
01:59:25,198 --> 01:59:32,638
so that would give us a pretty nice hash

2790
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:34,719
right and it you know it it takes

2791
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:36,639
probably like that would be something

2792
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:40,719
like

2793
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:41,599
eight cycles to get a really nice hash

2794
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:44,480
which seems

2795
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:45,840
fine um i mean even if we just think

2796
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:49,118
about like what the divide

2797
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:52,159
just the divide would have cost us

2798
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:57,279
just to get the prime part um

2799
01:59:52,158 --> 02:00:00,638
of it right uh a div on an integer

2800
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:02,238
is is pretty bad right um it's it's not

2801
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:05,520
really what we want to be doing

2802
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:09,839
so if we do a div

2803
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,840
uh or i should say a mod um

2804
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:13,840
let's see here

2805
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:19,520
i mean it's just bad right

2806
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:25,679
it's just bad so eight cycles for a

2807
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:26,159
perfectly distributed hash is very good

2808
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:28,560
because

2809
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:31,920
even just the divide alone would cost us

2810
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:31,920
probably almost that much

2811
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:39,118
so i would say we just stick with this

2812
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:43,119
and and go from there so we'd

2813
02:00:39,118 --> 02:00:46,000
load the hash slot this way um and

2814
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:47,039
yeah the seed value we just need some

2815
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,599
random seed

2816
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:50,079
that we can use so it would you know

2817
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:52,000
it's just

2818
02:00:50,079 --> 02:00:53,599
garbage it doesn't matter in fact i can

2819
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,000
just put it in here

2820
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:57,520
so there's just some seed value that's

2821
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,719
16 bytes long

2822
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:03,760
that is what we would hash with and

2823
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:06,800
you know for the sake of of you know

2824
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:08,880
being a a good random

2825
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,920
user can i just get some randomness in

2826
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:12,239
here

2827
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,239
um

2828
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:18,859
so

2829
02:01:15,319 --> 02:01:18,858
[Music]

2830
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:24,399
sequences maybe or raw bites

2831
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:31,039
i would like hexadecimal bites

2832
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:34,479
16 please

2833
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:37,920
look at these delicious random bites

2834
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:37,919
all right so there's my seed

2835
02:01:39,198 --> 02:01:42,960
value which is just a mixing value

2836
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:46,000
because aes deck

2837
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:49,760
xors you know it's going to xor

2838
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:53,279
um we don't really care about that xor

2839
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:56,960
at all um because we don't

2840
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:59,279
really need it to do that so we could

2841
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:01,198
just xor it we could probably just xor

2842
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:03,519
it with zero if we wanted if we honestly

2843
02:02:01,198 --> 02:02:06,559
if we wanted to would be fine

2844
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:10,000
um but

2845
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:11,199
you know for the sake of since we're

2846
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,079
gonna

2847
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:14,719
see it anyway we might as well just do a

2848
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:17,760
mem up

2849
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:21,039
and point it there it's basically free

2850
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:24,159
for these purposes so you know

2851
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:26,560
it should be fine all right so whoa

2852
02:02:24,158 --> 02:02:27,679
i don't know what's going on here

2853
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:33,840
something's unhappy oh

2854
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:33,840
just the commas

2855
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,800
all right so

2856
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,440
we can just pass zero for the second one

2857
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,960
and actually i'll probably make that a

2858
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:47,759
default parameter so that people don't

2859
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,520
have to care

2860
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,119
so so that it's clear that they don't

2861
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:54,639
need it so you know

2862
02:02:51,118 --> 02:02:57,279
let's do that um

2863
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:59,039
and then uh this part here where we've

2864
02:02:57,279 --> 02:03:01,840
got the tag hash

2865
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:01,840
uh

2866
02:03:02,319 --> 02:03:07,118
assets by tag is probably a better name

2867
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:08,960
for that and i'm supposed to stop

2868
02:03:07,118 --> 02:03:12,079
programming now i think because

2869
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:15,599
we're out of time right but

2870
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:18,719
that's what we would be doing

2871
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:20,000
this after we look it up none of this is

2872
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:23,599
now necessary

2873
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,719
um except for one thing which is the

2874
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:28,079
match vector

2875
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:31,520
needs to be able to generate an index

2876
02:03:28,079 --> 02:03:33,519
based on the actual

2877
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:35,360
uh so you can see it like looping

2878
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,320
through the tags of the particular asset

2879
02:03:35,359 --> 02:03:38,079
right

2880
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:40,000
and we don't actually want that what we

2881
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:42,158
want to be able to do is

2882
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,679
basically use a lookup that goes

2883
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:46,960
directly to

2884
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:50,800
the index in question based on the

2885
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:53,118
type of thing that this particular file

2886
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:55,360
type whatever that is

2887
02:03:53,118 --> 02:03:57,118
uses so facing direction is the only

2888
02:03:55,359 --> 02:03:59,679
thing we have right now and may be the

2889
02:03:57,118 --> 02:04:01,039
only thing we ever have

2890
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:03,359
but there was something in a file like

2891
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:06,560
that had expression so

2892
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:10,960
facing direction going down

2893
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:13,520
and a variant going across

2894
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:14,560
seems like the sort of thing we would

2895
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,239
need to know

2896
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:21,679
there's also particle files which have

2897
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:24,078
variant going across and down

2898
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,960
so we need something here that's

2899
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:28,639
produces

2900
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:30,560
like that coordinate if you will uh

2901
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:31,679
like the thing that basically says like

2902
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:34,880
here's the look up

2903
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:38,239
here's the way we would look up

2904
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,679
that 2d grid and so that's really the

2905
02:04:38,238 --> 02:04:42,078
only other thing we would be doing

2906
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:43,118
and the way we need to do that is to

2907
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:46,479
look at which

2908
02:04:43,118 --> 02:04:48,479
kind of asset it actually is and make

2909
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:51,759
sure that the match vector

2910
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:54,238
pulls out the correct two pieces uh

2911
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,520
for the x and the y so it would be

2912
02:04:54,238 --> 02:04:59,439
something like this

2913
02:04:55,520 --> 02:05:03,840
right like x index y index right

2914
02:04:59,439 --> 02:05:03,839
and it would be like you know match

2915
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:09,360
vector

2916
02:05:06,319 --> 02:05:12,479
and in both cases we would have pulled

2917
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:15,920
so the tag hash value we would pull the

2918
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:15,919
asset basic category

2919
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:22,399
out of the tag hash which is trivial

2920
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:25,520
because it's just the bottom

2921
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:26,158
eight bits right so at any time we can

2922
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:29,760
just say

2923
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:32,638
the asset basic category um

2924
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:35,440
just kind of comes out so like get

2925
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:39,679
category from

2926
02:05:35,439 --> 02:05:39,678
tag hash by the way this should

2927
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:47,679
obviously produce one of these things

2928
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,719
like so what is going on with that

2929
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:50,800
indentation

2930
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:52,319
someone tell me right now i do not

2931
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,560
understand

2932
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:54,559
um

2933
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:01,520
so the asset tag hash produces this it

2934
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,840
can then undo that

2935
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,840
right

2936
02:06:06,479 --> 02:06:20,959
by just saying

2937
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:20,960
uh the bottom eight bits

2938
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,159
produce the

2939
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:33,198
the category right so

2940
02:06:29,118 --> 02:06:35,519
these are pretty straightforward

2941
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:35,519
um

2942
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:40,000
so once we have the basic category we

2943
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:41,679
would just need to know these two pieces

2944
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,920
of information

2945
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:48,399
uh and then we would need to know how to

2946
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:51,199
actually expand the value and round it

2947
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:53,198
so all of this code that was really bad

2948
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:55,839
and dangerous right

2949
02:06:53,198 --> 02:06:59,839
um would presumably go away and then we

2950
02:06:55,840 --> 02:07:13,119
would have that look up

2951
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:15,360
pretty straightforward the problem

2952
02:07:13,118 --> 02:07:15,359
oh

2953
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:27,840
so okay actually

2954
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:32,799
we might as well just also match on that

2955
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:42,800
so if you think about it once you know

2956
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:48,319
which of these you're going to do

2957
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:48,320
you can roll them into the hash

2958
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:56,559
which would also make a ton of sense and

2959
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:58,079
hey guess what we have the extra room to

2960
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:00,560
do that

2961
02:07:58,078 --> 02:08:02,479
because in addition to that base tag

2962
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:05,599
hash value

2963
02:08:02,479 --> 02:08:06,559
we could also just say well we have the

2964
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:09,840
coordinate

2965
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:12,480
value right

2966
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:13,199
that comes in here as another u64 which

2967
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:16,799
is just the

2968
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:20,158
two coordinates packed together

2969
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:22,320
right so if you imagine producing here

2970
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:24,078
from the match vector with like the

2971
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:27,359
facing direction all that crap

2972
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:29,198
right um we should be able to do that

2973
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:32,078
now there are some

2974
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:33,839
difficulties here you can see that we

2975
02:08:32,078 --> 02:08:36,559
kind of have this problem

2976
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:38,159
where for matching things like the

2977
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,320
facing direction

2978
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:41,679
it kind of does need to be like fussed

2979
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:43,920
with a little bit

2980
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:45,599
and honestly that kind of seems like

2981
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:48,800
something that should probably be

2982
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:50,239
back in the other um that should

2983
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:53,520
probably be in the code that happens

2984
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:54,718
before we pass it down

2985
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,560
so i'm going to leave it to do we should

2986
02:08:54,719 --> 02:09:00,000
stop i'm overtime to do

2987
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:01,520
um you know move

2988
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,679
i'll try to remind ourselves of what

2989
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:07,360
we're doing here so

2990
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:10,960
move coordinates into hash move

2991
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:15,039
uh sort of preparation

2992
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:18,480
of facing direction out

2993
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:22,078
into um

2994
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:25,359
the calling code so it prepares

2995
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:28,719
the match vector

2996
02:09:25,359 --> 02:09:32,719
properly and maybe like

2997
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:35,920
maybe match vector is actually

2998
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:39,679
called something else and

2999
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:42,960
is just an integer set

3000
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:44,319
or something i think probably

3001
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:45,920
like it probably should just be an

3002
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:47,279
integer set like it probably should just

3003
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:50,319
be this

3004
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:51,759
so there's an asset tag hash right

3005
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:53,439
and then there's a separate thing you

3006
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:57,199
have which is

3007
02:09:53,439 --> 02:10:00,238
an asset like chord hash right

3008
02:09:57,198 --> 02:10:03,039
and that's

3009
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:03,839
a separate way of packing in what those

3010
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:06,719
coordinates

3011
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:08,000
are right um we don't i don't know if we

3012
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:10,239
want to find that way but it would

3013
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,078
so we would then have a thing called an

3014
02:10:10,238 --> 02:10:15,118
asset match vector

3015
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:16,399
and that would actually just be a series

3016
02:10:15,118 --> 02:10:18,799
of parameters

3017
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:20,399
so it's it's effectively like however

3018
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:22,320
many of those we have like facing

3019
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:24,960
direction whatever whatever

3020
02:10:22,319 --> 02:10:25,759
you would pass those down like as the

3021
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:28,480
match vector

3022
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:29,920
it's not actually floats anymore because

3023
02:10:28,479 --> 02:10:32,000
it's assumed the person who's calling

3024
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:33,840
in has already prepped each of the ones

3025
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,479
based on the type of thing that they are

3026
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:36,560
so

3027
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:39,839
facing direction gets bucketed into the

3028
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:42,079
four facing directions and so on

3029
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,760
and so then here before we actually go

3030
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:47,039
to do the lookup what we would do

3031
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:50,159
is say okay the indexes here we

3032
02:10:47,039 --> 02:10:52,158
pull out of the basic asset category

3033
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:53,198
depending on which category it is we

3034
02:10:52,158 --> 02:10:56,879
would say all right

3035
02:10:53,198 --> 02:11:00,638
for the assets um there's like a layout

3036
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,639
you know like a uh

3037
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:05,519
like a category layout we pull the

3038
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:08,319
category layout

3039
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:10,079
for whatever this category is and then

3040
02:11:08,319 --> 02:11:14,000
we know that for each

3041
02:11:10,078 --> 02:11:25,279
of these things we have

3042
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:27,520
which ones we use so

3043
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:28,880
so once we get the layout we would then

3044
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:32,239
know that oh okay

3045
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:35,118
we pick the x element and the y

3046
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:35,439
element right so out of the match vector

3047
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:36,960
which

3048
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:38,960
we could have as many of these as we

3049
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:40,480
want that's getting fed forward by the

3050
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:41,920
entity system it's like look here's the

3051
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:43,598
parameters we have

3052
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:45,440
we just say look for this particular

3053
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:47,440
type of asset like if it's a head or a

3054
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:49,118
body or a particle

3055
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:50,879
what's the layout like how do we

3056
02:11:49,118 --> 02:11:54,880
actually produce those things

3057
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:54,880
right and then it pulls them out

3058
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:59,359
you know what i'm saying so once it has

3059
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:01,039
those then it would just say all right

3060
02:11:59,359 --> 02:12:02,880
weld those together

3061
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:04,078
in fact we don't even really need to do

3062
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:06,719
this we could just say

3063
02:12:04,078 --> 02:12:07,840
look weld them together directly well

3064
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:10,960
you know we'll

3065
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:11,199
sure we'll we'll do it why not so then

3066
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:13,760
we

3067
02:12:11,198 --> 02:12:15,439
just say the coordinate lookup is just

3068
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:18,840
the x index

3069
02:12:15,439 --> 02:12:21,839
um or with the y index

3070
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:21,840
right

3071
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:28,879
so then you just hash these in the whole

3072
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:31,599
thing

3073
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:31,599
and off you go

3074
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,679
so that looks really nice because now

3075
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:40,719
all of this crap goes away

3076
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:42,560
right like this is all gone and so now

3077
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:44,480
it's a very straightforward process to

3078
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:48,560
actually get this thing

3079
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:51,919
so you hash it you

3080
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:54,000
you know run through the slot you find

3081
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:55,840
it you know if you found the match

3082
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,679
good for you congratulations you're a

3083
02:12:55,840 --> 02:13:01,360
huge hero

3084
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:04,800
um if you didn't you just returned zero

3085
02:13:01,359 --> 02:13:04,799
right um

3086
02:13:08,319 --> 02:13:12,479
so we would just run through the hash

3087
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:13,360
slot here and we would just look for

3088
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:15,359
matches that

3089
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:17,118
now which ones exactly match this and

3090
02:13:15,359 --> 02:13:19,519
then we return it right

3091
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:20,479
so that would be like way faster than

3092
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,679
this garbage

3093
02:13:20,479 --> 02:13:25,919
i mean this was terrible right i mean

3094
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:27,440
computers are so fast these days that we

3095
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,800
weren't really struggling

3096
02:13:27,439 --> 02:13:30,960
even though this code is complete

3097
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,400
garbage because it's just amazing like

3098
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:34,399
i don't know how people manage to make

3099
02:13:32,399 --> 02:13:35,920
things as slow as they do when i look at

3100
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:39,920
some of the things that i make

3101
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:40,639
that are running at still like 60 frames

3102
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,239
a second

3103
02:13:40,639 --> 02:13:44,400
and you're just like this is complete

3104
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:46,718
garbage code i don't know how you manage

3105
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:49,118
to make it so garbage that it's like

3106
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:50,480
web browser slow but you know they do

3107
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:53,679
somehow

3108
02:13:50,479 --> 02:13:58,158
so i don't know so we'll stop here

3109
02:13:53,679 --> 02:14:02,480
and then we'll move on um

3110
02:13:58,158 --> 02:14:05,920
uh we'll we'll we'll stop here for now

3111
02:14:02,479 --> 02:14:10,078
and we'll move on next week uh

3112
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:13,840
to finishing that okay questions

3113
02:14:10,078 --> 02:14:13,840
from people

3114
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:44,320
just put four vms in front of the code

3115
02:14:42,238 --> 02:14:47,678
well it's not just for vms right

3116
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:48,559
um it's like also just like straight up

3117
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:51,118
interpreters

3118
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:53,599
like a lot of people use like php or

3119
02:14:51,118 --> 02:15:09,839
python or stuff that's not even like

3120
02:14:53,599 --> 02:15:09,840
compiled to bite code

3121
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:27,118
off topic feel free to ignore but

3122
02:15:24,078 --> 02:15:29,359
someone told me that on playstation

3123
02:15:27,118 --> 02:15:31,279
games run in a sandbox and if you forget

3124
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:33,359
to free any memory you allocated when

3125
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:36,880
you exit that sandbox will be kept alive

3126
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:37,289
in the background

3127
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:40,380
um

3128
02:15:37,289 --> 02:15:40,380
[Music]

3129
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,840
i guess i don't know

3130
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:52,399
i'm not really a playstation expert

3131
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:56,800
my recollection on like the playstation

3132
02:15:54,960 --> 02:16:01,599
4 was that it's just got a

3133
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:04,800
map primitive so

3134
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:06,719
i mean you wouldn't be allocating

3135
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:08,000
memory per se in the same way that

3136
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:08,639
you're talking about it there like

3137
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,439
there's no

3138
02:16:08,639 --> 02:16:13,760
forget to free quote unquote like you

3139
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:15,598
would have to have

3140
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:17,199
the base layer that does the mem mapping

3141
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:19,440
remember to unmap

3142
02:16:17,198 --> 02:16:20,638
stuff at map but you can't you wouldn't

3143
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:24,078
be doing an map

3144
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:25,199
per alloc anyway so you've already got a

3145
02:16:24,078 --> 02:16:27,039
system at the bottom

3146
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:29,198
and it would be trivial for that system

3147
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:31,198
to just chain its maps together so

3148
02:16:29,198 --> 02:16:32,959
even if you were worried about something

3149
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:35,359
like that you could just

3150
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:36,879
keep a list of you know the 30m maps you

3151
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:39,120
actually did or something

3152
02:16:36,879 --> 02:16:40,318
and when you want to exit the program

3153
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:43,280
just on and

3154
02:16:40,318 --> 02:16:43,840
un mem map them you wouldn't have to

3155
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:46,639
worry about

3156
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:47,920
actually freeing per se individual

3157
02:16:46,638 --> 02:16:49,839
allocations because

3158
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,760
you aren't doing individual allocations

3159
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:55,760
through mmap right

3160
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:58,880
or if you are haven't helped you um

3161
02:16:55,760 --> 02:17:00,478
you've got other problems but

3162
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:03,039
i don't know i'm not really a

3163
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:06,079
playstation person and i don't have

3164
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:07,679
um like you said it may have something

3165
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:09,840
that like i may not be able to talk

3166
02:17:07,679 --> 02:17:13,040
about more smoothly without an nda

3167
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:15,280
breaking thing anyway uh but

3168
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:16,479
the real answer is i just don't remember

3169
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:17,679
and or no

3170
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:19,760
uh because i don't do a lot of

3171
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:21,679
playstation programming so

3172
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:22,880
it's it's less about nda and more about

3173
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:25,318
just like that's not something i'm super

3174
02:17:22,879 --> 02:17:27,438
familiar with like i've programmed the

3175
02:17:25,318 --> 02:17:31,039
ps3

3176
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:34,000
two and four never the three

3177
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:35,599
um and i didn't really program the two

3178
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,799
like i sort of just ported some stuff to

3179
02:17:35,599 --> 02:17:38,478
the tube but i didn't really like

3180
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:43,840
seriously do

3181
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:43,840
fancy stuff on it

3182
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:56,398
i'd like to hear a discussion between me

3183
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,439
and john about mega programming metaphor

3184
02:17:56,398 --> 02:17:58,799
and philosophy as soon as you asked

3185
02:17:57,439 --> 02:17:59,920
what's that driver satisfied in terms of

3186
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:00,879
meta programming he said the way

3187
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,000
throughout the program is really

3188
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:04,079
different from the way he thinks of it

3189
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,638
he thinks i'm wrong about it

3190
02:18:04,079 --> 02:18:08,558
um yeah i mean john and i don't think

3191
02:18:06,638 --> 02:18:11,759
about programming similarly at all

3192
02:18:08,558 --> 02:18:15,199
is a probably a better way to say it

3193
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:17,200
um and so

3194
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:18,559
it wouldn't really even just be like

3195
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:19,920
meta programming that we think about

3196
02:18:18,558 --> 02:18:21,279
differently

3197
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:22,719
it's also one of the reasons that i

3198
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,920
can't say for sure that i would end up

3199
02:18:22,718 --> 02:18:27,438
switching to jai

3200
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:29,200
because my guess is that the way that it

3201
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:31,519
probably works is not really the way

3202
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:35,120
that i think about things anyway

3203
02:18:31,519 --> 02:18:37,920
um so i don't know

3204
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:39,599
but i don't think there's a wrong or

3205
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:40,879
right there and if john thinks i'm wrong

3206
02:18:39,599 --> 02:18:44,239
about meta programming

3207
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:44,239
that's a little weird because

3208
02:18:44,638 --> 02:18:47,598
i don't know he doesn't do a whole lot

3209
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:49,120
of meta programming so i don't know what

3210
02:18:47,599 --> 02:18:51,120
the chances are that i'm like

3211
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:52,719
like wrong wrong but i definitely think

3212
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:55,599
there's probably

3213
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:56,079
multiple ways of trying to conceptualize

3214
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:59,920
that

3215
02:18:56,079 --> 02:19:03,120
and you have to sort of decide it's

3216
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,840
you can't have it all one way or the

3217
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:06,079
other so

3218
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:08,079
there's probably not a universal right

3219
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:10,318
answer

3220
02:19:08,079 --> 02:19:10,318
right

3221
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:17,200
so you know but if john thinks there is

3222
02:19:16,718 --> 02:19:20,239
then

3223
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:23,359
you know he thinks there is but i

3224
02:19:20,239 --> 02:19:25,119
couldn't say uh about that right i like

3225
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:26,800
the fact that ji takes meta programming

3226
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:28,079
seriously it's got a lot better features

3227
02:19:26,799 --> 02:19:30,718
than most things

3228
02:19:28,079 --> 02:19:32,239
but it's not the way that i would do it

3229
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:34,398
um

3230
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:35,519
right because so the way that john

3231
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:36,799
thinks about meta programming as far as

3232
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:39,280
i can tell is that

3233
02:19:36,799 --> 02:19:42,638
the language is still mostly not about

3234
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:45,920
meta programming in the sense that

3235
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:48,159
it's still very defined in terms of that

3236
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:51,120
the language is this thing that

3237
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:52,318
you've specified a bunch of policy for

3238
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:55,439
and then meta programming is just the

3239
02:19:52,318 --> 02:19:58,639
thing that lets you mutate the ast

3240
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:58,639
when you start right

3241
02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:03,840
and that's uh

3242
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
that's still way better than most

3243
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:09,280
programming languages which don't really

3244
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,359
let you do that very much

3245
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:13,280
they're really clunky like ji seems to

3246
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:17,920
let you do meta programming in a more

3247
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:18,640
like as a more serious operation that's

3248
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:22,318
not

3249
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:24,500
busted right um

3250
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:25,840
but i still think like meta programming

3251
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:28,719
[Music]

3252
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:29,680
is actually about full chain flexibility

3253
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:31,279
like

3254
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:33,600
like the ability to write out an

3255
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,040
executable

3256
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:36,720
should be something that's written into

3257
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:39,840
the meta program to me

3258
02:20:36,719 --> 02:20:41,279
right that's the way i would do it and

3259
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:45,120
the reason is just because i

3260
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:46,560
and i so often

3261
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:48,399
encounter all of these things that i

3262
02:20:46,559 --> 02:20:49,920
need to be able to do and i can't do

3263
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:51,439
them because the compiler just does them

3264
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:52,239
in one particular way and you can't

3265
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:59,840
actually

3266
02:20:52,239 --> 02:20:59,840
do anything about it right so

3267
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:12,639
so many questions that are totally

3268
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:14,960
random i have no idea

3269
02:21:12,639 --> 02:21:14,959
um

3270
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:28,240
why are new compression techniques such

3271
02:21:26,639 --> 02:21:30,398
as microsoft direct storage

3272
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:31,520
ps5 compression needed for instant

3273
02:21:30,398 --> 02:21:34,159
loading

3274
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:36,960
why are nvme speeds not enough what's

3275
02:21:34,159 --> 02:21:36,959
the bottleneck

3276
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:43,600
well sorry right

3277
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:48,000
um if you take a look

3278
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:58,000
i mean let's try to get

3279
02:21:54,719 --> 02:22:00,318
a value here right

3280
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,318
um

3281
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,800
where's my speed crunch

3282
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:10,800
so you know i don't know

3283
02:22:08,719 --> 02:22:13,279
i just randomly ask you because i don't

3284
02:22:10,799 --> 02:22:15,679
know exactly what the current rate

3285
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,960
for read write speeds on these things

3286
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:21,040
are

3287
02:22:16,959 --> 02:22:24,639
but you know 32 giga

3288
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:27,920
is that gigabytes per second yes

3289
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:32,159
if it's 32 gigabytes per second is the

3290
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:36,398
um nvme speed

3291
02:22:32,159 --> 02:22:38,639
i don't know what the speed is

3292
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:39,840
of a drive that can be placed in the

3293
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:43,119
playstation because

3294
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:46,398
that may be much more expensive right

3295
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:49,120
as well so let's take a look let me see

3296
02:22:46,398 --> 02:22:49,119
ps5

3297
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:55,680
ssd speed so it's 5.5 gigabytes per

3298
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,680
second so

3299
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:59,040
the first thing to understand right

3300
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,640
there is if we're looking at those two

3301
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:01,280
numbers let's assume they're accurate

3302
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:03,039
for now

3303
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:05,359
because i don't remember these numbers

3304
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:08,880
at all but let's say they're accurate

3305
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:12,318
then you're talking about like at least

3306
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:16,879
you know something like six

3307
02:23:12,318 --> 02:23:18,478
there's a 6x drop in nvme speed

3308
02:23:16,879 --> 02:23:20,639
in terms of what you're actually going

3309
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:23,760
to get from your playstation

3310
02:23:20,639 --> 02:23:24,079
because it you know this this is it's

3311
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,000
not

3312
02:23:24,079 --> 02:23:27,359
a two thousand dollar piece of hardware

3313
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,760
it's like a what i don't know what they

3314
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:30,399
cost

3315
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:30,800
six hundred dollars four hundred dollars

3316
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:34,079
so

3317
02:23:30,799 --> 02:23:36,159
the ssd that's in the playstation

3318
02:23:34,079 --> 02:23:38,159
is not going to be like the ultimate

3319
02:23:36,159 --> 02:23:41,359
data center ssd or something

3320
02:23:38,159 --> 02:23:44,639
it's it's got to be like

3321
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:46,880
cost effective enough right

3322
02:23:44,639 --> 02:23:48,398
so you're instantly down to 5.5

3323
02:23:46,879 --> 02:23:50,799
gigabytes per second

3324
02:23:48,398 --> 02:23:52,000
if you think about 5.5 gigabytes per

3325
02:23:50,799 --> 02:23:55,438
spec per second

3326
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:57,600
right so 5.5 gigabytes per second

3327
02:23:55,439 --> 02:24:00,239
um and then we say like well how much

3328
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:04,559
memory does the ps uh

3329
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:04,559
5 have right um

3330
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:12,319
where is the that's

3331
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:15,840
not memory can we get memory please

3332
02:24:12,318 --> 02:24:15,840
is it 16

3333
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:23,439
okay everyone wants me to accept their

3334
02:24:22,398 --> 02:24:26,840
cookies

3335
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:28,800
what if i don't want to accept the

3336
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:32,239
cookies

3337
02:24:28,799 --> 02:24:36,559
um so 16 gigabytes

3338
02:24:32,239 --> 02:24:38,000
right so if you assume 5.5 gigabytes

3339
02:24:36,559 --> 02:24:41,439
second peak throughput

3340
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,120
and you take 16 gigabytes of memory and

3341
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:43,760
you say how long does it take me to load

3342
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:46,160
a game

3343
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:48,398
that take that you know to load in the

3344
02:24:46,159 --> 02:24:52,000
full memory of the game

3345
02:24:48,398 --> 02:24:54,840
well it's three seconds right even if

3346
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,840
nothing else had to happen it's three

3347
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:57,840
seconds

3348
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:03,840
so if you want instant loading and

3349
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:06,799
you've got 16 megabytes of memory

3350
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:08,559
and you know your drive can only produce

3351
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:11,438
5.5 gigabytes

3352
02:25:08,559 --> 02:25:13,439
per second peak throughput then if you

3353
02:25:11,439 --> 02:25:14,239
want instant loading you are a factor of

3354
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:16,398
three

3355
02:25:14,239 --> 02:25:17,520
at least away and that's if you accept

3356
02:25:16,398 --> 02:25:19,680
the second loading

3357
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:22,640
what if you want it to be like a

3358
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,639
fraction of a second

3359
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:28,000
right so

3360
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:29,200
when you look at this you're like if we

3361
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,879
can boost this

3362
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,880
by getting let's say two to one

3363
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:35,039
compression out of it or something

3364
02:25:32,879 --> 02:25:36,559
it starts to look a lot better 1.5

3365
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:37,600
seconds is a lot better than three

3366
02:25:36,559 --> 02:25:40,879
seconds

3367
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:43,600
right um

3368
02:25:40,879 --> 02:25:44,239
so if in practice you're getting 5.5

3369
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,600
peak

3370
02:25:44,239 --> 02:25:49,600
and you know you've got 16 to fill

3371
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:51,600
hopefully that gives you an idea of why

3372
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:56,159
this isn't a solved problem

3373
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:59,760
right so nvme bandwidth is 32 gigabytes

3374
02:25:56,159 --> 02:26:02,079
max at that rate it would take half a

3375
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:04,639
second to fill the memory

3376
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:05,359
so even if you imagined a theoretically

3377
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:07,760
maximal

3378
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:09,280
nvme drive which like i just said they

3379
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:10,159
can't afford anyway because that would

3380
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:13,439
be some

3381
02:26:10,159 --> 02:26:14,639
heinous gigantic array of chips with

3382
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:16,239
extremely

3383
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:17,680
massive heat dissipation or something

3384
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:21,039
right

3385
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:23,680
um so

3386
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:25,280
this is why it's not a solved problem

3387
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:27,200
just to say well we don't need

3388
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:28,159
compression because we can just load the

3389
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:32,240
thing

3390
02:26:28,159 --> 02:26:34,000
right and so it makes perfect sense why

3391
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:37,119
they would want to invest in really

3392
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,600
good compression technology and try to

3393
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,399
do

3394
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:42,318
chip assisted decompression and stuff

3395
02:26:40,398 --> 02:26:44,079
because

3396
02:26:42,318 --> 02:26:46,239
it's simply not a solved problem if

3397
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:49,200
you're trying to get down to instant

3398
02:26:46,239 --> 02:26:50,079
right if you just want relatively short

3399
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:52,640
loading screens

3400
02:26:50,079 --> 02:26:54,639
i totally like that's probably fine

3401
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:57,119
three seconds

3402
02:26:54,639 --> 02:26:58,879
you know i don't like that kind of delay

3403
02:26:57,120 --> 02:27:00,399
but that's probably something gamers

3404
02:26:58,879 --> 02:27:01,438
would tolerate but if you're trying to

3405
02:27:00,398 --> 02:27:04,719
get to

3406
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:07,439
instant to like this is really instant

3407
02:27:04,719 --> 02:27:09,199
it's not a solved problem to just say

3408
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:10,159
well the ssds are fast enough because

3409
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:13,439
they're not

3410
02:27:10,159 --> 02:27:15,439
right so

3411
02:27:13,439 --> 02:27:17,840
does that answer the question i don't

3412
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:17,840
know

3413
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:31,840
um

3414
02:27:50,719 --> 02:27:54,478
i don't know what all the questions are

3415
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:59,840
here

3416
02:28:05,120 --> 02:28:07,439
um

3417
02:28:10,318 --> 02:28:13,840
way too many topics

3418
02:28:14,639 --> 02:28:21,519
i just oh uh is that you roman

3419
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:23,439
i i moved to the east side i just moved

3420
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:25,680
out of seattle i'm still

3421
02:28:23,439 --> 02:28:29,680
in the like greater washington area but

3422
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:29,680
i i don't live in the city

3423
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:42,640
if i go from ssd to nvme speeds

3424
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:45,920
are not improved well okay but so

3425
02:28:42,639 --> 02:28:49,439
just to be clear ssd and nvme

3426
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:52,559
are not different things right so

3427
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:53,120
ssd is just solid state drive it just

3428
02:28:52,559 --> 02:28:56,639
means

3429
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:59,760
that the thing is a memory based

3430
02:28:56,639 --> 02:29:02,478
architecture like right like not

3431
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:04,000
a spinning platter nvme is a bus

3432
02:29:02,478 --> 02:29:07,199
specification

3433
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:09,200
so nvme is just saying this is

3434
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:11,359
how the thing will communicate and and

3435
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:11,359
so

3436
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:14,720
do you are you meaning to say if you go

3437
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:18,239
from sata

3438
02:29:14,719 --> 02:29:21,039
to nvme is what you mean or something

3439
02:29:18,239 --> 02:29:22,000
like i'm not ssd and nvme are not things

3440
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:25,040
you go from or

3441
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:26,959
to like an nvme drive is an ssd drive

3442
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:28,560
right it's it's sol it's a solid-state

3443
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:31,119
drive yeah

3444
02:29:28,559 --> 02:29:33,279
so nvme is just a protocol difference

3445
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:33,600
designed to allow for higher bandwidth

3446
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:36,800
but

3447
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:37,200
if the ssd isn't itself particularly

3448
02:29:36,799 --> 02:29:41,039
much

3449
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:43,920
better then the speed doesn't get

3450
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:46,000
particularly better right so nvme

3451
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:49,200
enables much faster speeds

3452
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,520
but the actual drive you buy may not

3453
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:52,800
may top out well before that and

3454
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:55,520
therefore you wouldn't see

3455
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:57,279
you know some drives don't wouldn't even

3456
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:58,720
saturate

3457
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:02,720
your whatever the thing is you were

3458
02:29:58,719 --> 02:30:02,719
switching from right and so

3459
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,920
all right there's just too many

3460
02:30:30,159 --> 02:30:34,239
questions i'm going to wrap it up for

3461
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:34,239
today

3462
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:40,319
let's close this down

3463
02:30:42,478 --> 02:30:45,920
all right thank you everyone for joining

3464
02:30:44,318 --> 02:30:47,519
me for another episode of handmade hero

3465
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:49,120
it's been a pleasure coding with you as

3466
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:50,239
always if you would like to follow the

3467
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:52,079
series at home you could always create a

3468
02:30:50,239 --> 02:30:53,600
game on handmadehero.org and it comes

3469
02:30:52,079 --> 02:30:54,959
with the source code

3470
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:56,559
also i saw a lot of people in the chat

3471
02:30:54,959 --> 02:30:57,519
asking about star code galaxy and when

3472
02:30:56,559 --> 02:31:00,719
it could be available

3473
02:30:57,520 --> 02:31:02,479
um i'm hoping it will be available soon

3474
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:05,358
i am working pretty hard to try and get

3475
02:31:02,478 --> 02:31:07,599
it out in short order uh if you

3476
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:08,800
want to be notified when it is available

3477
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:10,880
you can just put your name

3478
02:31:08,799 --> 02:31:12,239
in here go to the star code galaxy

3479
02:31:10,879 --> 02:31:14,719
website and put your

3480
02:31:12,239 --> 02:31:16,478
address in here and hit subscribe and

3481
02:31:14,719 --> 02:31:19,920
then it will tell you

3482
02:31:16,478 --> 02:31:21,840
um when it is available that's it for

3483
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:24,318
today i'll be back here next week

3484
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:25,600
and at that point um i'll go ahead and

3485
02:31:24,318 --> 02:31:27,439
implement the tag

3486
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:30,800
system that we just talked about today

3487
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:32,159
and basically did the first half of

3488
02:31:30,799 --> 02:31:33,759
cleaning that up i think will be pretty

3489
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:34,239
great and it'll just let us really

3490
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:36,478
quickly

3491
02:31:34,239 --> 02:31:37,840
put match what assets we want in which

3492
02:31:36,478 --> 02:31:38,719
places which was kind of really onerous

3493
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:40,398
and annoying right now

3494
02:31:38,719 --> 02:31:42,639
so pretty soon we should be able to get

3495
02:31:40,398 --> 02:31:43,358
that straightened out uh and then i'll

3496
02:31:42,639 --> 02:31:45,039
probably just

3497
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:46,800
do some stuff where i just try to add a

3498
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:48,560
bunch of stuff to the game and we should

3499
02:31:46,799 --> 02:31:51,438
be able to see

3500
02:31:48,559 --> 02:31:52,879
like what's annoying pretty early on

3501
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:53,600
right like we should be able to get a

3502
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:56,959
good feel

3503
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:58,960
at that point for

3504
