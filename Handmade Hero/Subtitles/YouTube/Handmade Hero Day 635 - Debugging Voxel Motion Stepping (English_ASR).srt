00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,639
hello everybody and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,320
hero show recorded complete game live

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:12,080
on stream um i just wanted to

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,519
do um a little bit of collision

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,399
detection work today uh

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,320
we more or less i mean yeah you know we

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,479
more or less have the design we want

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
i'm pretty sure i i more or less have

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
what i want

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,679
uh to have happen sketched out here

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,159
um but we we kind of uh

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,159
of need to

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,558
we have to start getting down into the

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,280
meticulous details here uh which is

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,000
going to be

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
slow and difficult so you know i have

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
oops

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:47,519
that's not where i wanted to run that um

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,159
so i do apologize uh for that it's just

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
gonna be

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,679
a bit of a slog and the reason that i

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,520
say that

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,238
is because um we're now at the point

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
where

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,358
there's it's i don't think we've got

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
much of a

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,000
big concept kind of thing to do now uh

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,840
we're really just gonna have to start

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,200
looking at you know

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,439
uh probably

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,118
a way to dump diagrams out because we're

32
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,319
gonna like debugging this is not gonna

33
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,920
be really possible to do

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,879
by inspection probably

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
so we're probably gonna have to do

36
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,079
something with diagramming uh unless we

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,520
just magically bingo it

38
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,200
early on which which we're probably not

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,438
gonna uh

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
and and then we're gonna have to also

41
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:32,078
look very carefully

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,560
at some you know of of uh

43
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:38,399
the the specific way that the algorithm

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,200
makes movement decisions to make sure

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,399
that those

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,079
rules actually work uh and are solid in

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,399
practice

48
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:50,559
um so let's go

49
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,239
ahead and do that um some folks are

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,799
asking about sarco galaxy by the way on

51
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,319
that let me just quickly say

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,360
um star code galaxy here

53
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,559
uh circlecox.com uh if you sign up for

54
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,359
this

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,960
um if you put your name in this mailing

56
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,560
list we almost never send out mailings

57
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,159
so the only mailings you'll get are like

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,120
when our projects are being announced or

59
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,120
whatever

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,680
um so uh yes this is for beginners

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,640
uh up through experts the course is

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
actually designed

63
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:25,039
to to basically accommodate everybody um

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,439
it's a non-linear programming course uh

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,719
it's a very very different from anything

66
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,520
that you've seen before i guarantee you

67
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,519
that

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
um i had originally wanted to kind of

69
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,800
come out this month if i could

70
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,639
but i know it's not going to make it

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
i've just got too many things to polish

72
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,119
up

73
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,840
uh and videos to finish so uh it's

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
coming out

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
pretty soon the early version the early

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
version

77
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:51,280
uh is is like

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
it's basically module based and so the

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,840
early version

80
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,199
um is the one that's starting at

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,640
nothing uh but it actually also has tons

82
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:02,318
of stuff for experts in it too

83
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,759
uh and just just to give like a little

84
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,639
bit of a perspective on the way that

85
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,120
works

86
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,158
so if you are if you've never programmed

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,080
anything before

88
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,840
or you've never programmed c or anything

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
like that this starts

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,759
from nothing so it's like here's how to

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,560
install like a dev environment and

92
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,919
here's how c

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,080
works and here's like what an if

94
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,518
statement is has all that stuff in it

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,440
so you can start from nothing and go

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,560
but if you're an expert so you already

97
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,719
know how to program c

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,479
you already know you know you're good at

99
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,239
all that

100
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,598
you can actually also take the beginner

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,200
section of the course and the reason for

102
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,919
that is because it's so non-linear

103
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,839
what you do is you go through basically

104
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,318
these challenge doors so so you go

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
through these areas that are

106
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,000
doing the same things as the beginner

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,479
section does but instead

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,439
of me teaching you how to do them i

109
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,798
challenge you to

110
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,680
do them in certain ways so like for

111
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280
example

112
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
i might challenge you to do something

113
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
that you would normally do in floats in

114
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,318
fixed point

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
to see if you can do it right and then

116
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,280
i'll challenge like so

117
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
so things that i teach you how to do in

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,479
the beginner course i then

119
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,919
challenge you to do if you're an expert

120
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,959
so you can still take the beginner

121
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,798
course

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,719
and basically challenge yourself to see

123
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,719
if you know all the stuff

124
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,399
as well as you think you do or if it's

125
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,279
like oh geez you know i never thought

126
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
about how i would

127
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,000
how would i do this without a function

128
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,160
pointer or how would i do this

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,439
without needing to serialize something

130
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,560
or how would it write like

131
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,600
so that i i basically have two

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
ways to go through it one is for people

133
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
who have no idea what they're doing and

134
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,240
the other is for people

135
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,918
who think they should probably know

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,560
everything in there and it's sort of

137
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,039
like

138
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,240
uh a ref not normally refresher but more

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
like a

140
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,600
a way to challenge yourself to see if

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
you really do know

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
everything uh or if you know there's

143
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,279
parts that you're missing or

144
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,799
if you're if you've one of the things

145
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,119
that happens to programmers sometimes

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,240
maybe you're working at a job where you

147
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,519
just are

148
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,639
it's very monotonous and you haven't

149
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,839
really had a chance to challenge

150
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,800
yourself to do creative programming

151
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,319
things in a while

152
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
this just gives you a structure to do

153
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,879
that right and kind of waking those

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,478
parts up that

155
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,439
that maybe you knew how to do and and

156
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:12,319
they've forgotten right

157
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,120
so so that's the idea behind it uh you

158
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,519
can

159
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,199
get it probably you know i'm really

160
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,560
hoping maybe next month if not at the

161
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
very least this summer because

162
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,839
you know i it is finishing up i just

163
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,599
have to

164
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,719
um crank through all the stuff that i

165
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,879
think needs to happen

166
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
uh in order to really make the initial

167
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,000
one be okay it's it's an ongoing process

168
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,800
so like i said oh that's only the

169
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,879
intersection

170
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,919
so i i'm not requiring the other

171
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,879
sections be

172
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,279
be ready at all uh or polished at all

173
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,800
for the

174
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,198
initial release because they won't be in

175
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,960
there so you know

176
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
i i don't have too lofty of a goal for

177
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,719
when i will put out the first

178
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,159
like early access version of the course

179
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
uh so that's fine but

180
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,759
but i do want it like especially like

181
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,160
the the front end and everything should

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,680
be

183
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,639
you know uh

184
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,560
lined up for it so all right uh anyway

185
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,079
so back to collision detection

186
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,079
so if you take a look in here where

187
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,359
we're doing um move entity

188
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,918
so uh this render group by the way was

189
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
here for

190
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,439
doing debug drawing and we may start to

191
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,720
replace that then with some kind of

192
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,360
debug thing where we can stream

193
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,960
stuff out we'll see but if you take a

194
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,879
look at how this thing worked it's a

195
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,918
fairly straightforward routine now

196
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,478
actually uh and let's go ahead through

197
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,478
it because it's not

198
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,639
it's not working yet i mean it it does

199
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
something meaning it is like functional

200
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
but we only just got it working and we

201
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
haven't really

202
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,079
tried to ensure that it's working um the

203
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,240
way we think it is yet

204
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,839
and so if you take a look uh at what it

205
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
does when you run it

206
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,079
um is this this may be a debug build

207
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,080
here yeah this is a debug build

208
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:52,079
uh if you take a look at what happens uh

209
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,439
when you run it it's it's not really

210
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:59,038
uh let me

211
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,038
get rid of the debug build part

212
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,359
um it's not really working from the

213
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,478
standpoint of like

214
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,759
making sure that the code uh actually

215
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:08,800
does like robust collision text or

216
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,560
anything but it is working from the

217
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
standpoint of its moving things

218
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,160
um and they do kind of collide right you

219
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,519
can see but they they're still

220
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,520
they're like there's some tunneling in

221
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,918
weird ways it's not clear

222
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,519
um like why is that able to go through

223
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,639
there right so so it looks

224
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:27,680
kind of you know looking to me it

225
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,598
it doesn't look like if i had to guess

226
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,199
it doesn't look like the routine is

227
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,959
actually working properly yet

228
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,879
you know there's there's two stages

229
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,638
right of that sort of thing

230
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,279
there's um there's

231
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,598
does our algorithm work meaning meaning

232
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,758
do we do we do some things that mean

233
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,079
that this like that this algorithm will

234
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,919
just

235
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:55,598
produce bad results and that could be

236
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,959
but looking at that just roughly it

237
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,199
kind of looks to me like there's just

238
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,719
bugs in it so i don't think we're at the

239
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,079
point yet where we're assessing whether

240
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
the algorithm works

241
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,758
i think that all the weird stuff we're

242
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,400
seeing we're probably still at the point

243
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,680
where the code is buggy so we have to

244
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,198
kind of look through

245
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
and start doing the debugging work there

246
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,520
before we can start to make assessments

247
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,439
of whether this

248
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,120
actual algorithm design is working as

249
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,120
well as we hope that it will

250
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
so that's what we're doing now is trying

251
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,240
to clean

252
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,280
that up oh my goodness

253
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,560
so john blue was almost done i assumed

254
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,119
he would go for a while that's why we

255
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
started i

256
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,879
probably should have waited i i

257
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,839
apologize um

258
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,599
we we were we were taking a look at uh

259
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,039
at the stream before

260
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,560
and i i i didn't know uh

261
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,240
that it was going to end soon because i

262
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,239
knew it started at nine and we took a

263
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
look we started it around like 11 30 or

264
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
something and

265
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,278
and i was just like well it might go for

266
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,519
a while or it'll probably go for a while

267
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,958
right cause i assumed that it would but

268
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,240
but i guess it didn't we should have

269
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,639
waited uh we should have waited

270
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,919
so i apologize for that i hope that you

271
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:06,080
enjoyed that stream

272
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,639
um uh it sounded cool

273
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,320
i think the notes feature is awesome uh

274
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,799
just inject like

275
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,200
in general i feel like being able to

276
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,838
annotate things that you can then use

277
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,920
in code especially during the

278
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,680
pre-compile phase

279
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,399
well it's not pre-compile and ji is just

280
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,319
compile but like in my world it would be

281
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,200
meta programming right because

282
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
you know c and c plus don't have those

283
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,399
features

284
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:38,080
um so like uh

285
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,839
i feel like markup user specific markup

286
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,759
plus the ability to like act on that

287
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,480
markup is so

288
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,200
like solves so many simple problems that

289
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
you have

290
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
that become that would have been very

291
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,920
simple

292
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,639
right if you have that but because c

293
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,159
and c don't have that they become very

294
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,879
complicated problems right

295
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,399
you end up writing a bunch of stupid

296
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,399
code for no reason

297
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,679
where just the ability to like mark

298
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
something and

299
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,799
then have like an if statement on that

300
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,920
um somewhere in your code

301
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,359
it's like two lines of code total that

302
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,199
completely solve the problem that you

303
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,159
had and instead in c and c

304
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,440
plus plus it's this huge disaster

305
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,919
because now you're like okay

306
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
like i need to make up a system now for

307
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,039
dealing with the fact that i've got

308
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,879
these certain things that have to happen

309
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,399
so now i have to like rethink how all

310
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,958
that stuff is happening it's just really

311
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,799
annoying

312
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,479
whereas like all you really want to do

313
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,319
is just like tag one thing

314
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,039
right um so yeah so so

315
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,320
uh you know i think it's a it'll be

316
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,000
exciting to see

317
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,519
what john's gonna do with it sounds like

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,759
he wants to do

319
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,879
uh because it already kind of like jay i

320
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,838
started already had

321
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,200
what i'm talking about so you know

322
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,320
talking more about like pushing it

323
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
further i thought there's some good

324
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
questions like the question about how

325
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
you like

326
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,479
where when we had to switch to doing the

327
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,879
stream was i liked that question

328
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
that they had about uh somebody asked

329
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,240
like how do you add your notes to

330
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,039
something that you like you didn't write

331
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
i thought that was a really good

332
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,000
question it's not something i ever think

333
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,278
about because i tend to always use my

334
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,399
own stuff

335
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,320
but like when you're thinking about in

336
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,039
like the wider world and you imagine

337
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
like oh you

338
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,278
you know you're using someone else's

339
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,639
library rather than having to upstream

340
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,799
some patch you know you could put notes

341
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,639
on it if you could put notes on it

342
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,199
remotely like tag someone else's stuff

343
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,000
with a note and then

344
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,440
some systems can just work together by

345
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,278
having those notes kind of basically

346
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,399
pass through you know in a sense it's

347
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,519
just you're adding them and they're

348
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,278
transparent to the library because the

349
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,039
library's not looking for those notes

350
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,399
but then you know um

351
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,399
the whole thing kind of reminds me of

352
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,559
like the good parts of

353
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,078
gnu emax's system that used to actually

354
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,078
work well

355
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,838
which are like the ability for these

356
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,919
like modules that have never

357
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,920
thought about or talk to each other to

358
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,479
put like tags and hooks

359
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,838
on each other's stuff and it like

360
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,639
they're able to accomplish some really

361
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,240
crazy stuff

362
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,799
in ways that you would never be able to

363
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,799
do you know

364
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:13,119
so anyway um i i i do think that like

365
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,519
that stuff is pretty exciting anyway

366
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,879
back to our story

367
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,839
here um so just to go over how this

368
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,360
collision

369
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,160
collision routine is supposed to work

370
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
so we can start debugging it here's

371
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,039
where we're going to

372
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
move the entity and what you can see

373
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,278
here is we

374
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,480
first produce kind of the obvious things

375
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,480
that you would think of

376
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,480
we say here's where the entity is and

377
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
here's where the entity would go

378
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
if there was no collision so we're just

379
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,679
talking about basically the two

380
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,120
end points of the motion line

381
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:54,559
um where the entity goes from

382
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,320
and to uh and this is the point

383
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,559
so the the actual you know an entity is

384
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
a

385
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,319
is a volume right it occupies a certain

386
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,719
amount of space

387
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,440
so when we talk about a line what we

388
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,399
mean here

389
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,200
is that uh in this particular case we're

390
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,120
talking about

391
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,120
just the concept of the entity's

392
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,440
position goes from here to here

393
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,799
and the collision geometry is offset

394
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,079
somewhere from that

395
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,838
and for the purposes of the way we wrote

396
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,399
this routine we don't really care about

397
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,320
that

398
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,039
because we're not doing anything like a

399
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
minkowski some style thing here

400
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,879
so we don't really have to think too

401
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,759
hard about what this line means it's

402
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,679
just

403
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,240
this is the representation of the

404
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,278
position of the entity and we know that

405
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,278
the collision

406
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,639
geometry can be represented by

407
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,679
displacement from that

408
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,480
that we know right

409
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
um so if we then look at what happens

410
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,519
here

411
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,679
we have a fundamental value that we call

412
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,959
motion displacement size

413
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:56,239
and this value is just a value that we

414
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:59,679
are setting up at the outset to tune and

415
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,360
what we what this means is basically

416
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:07,359
a it's a value that is talking about

417
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:11,199
how thick do you want

418
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,560
something to be uh that will actually

419
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,078
obstruct motion right so the way that i

420
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,359
tend to like collision detectors is i

421
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:18,000
usually think of them pretty differently

422
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
now

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,879
especially after doing work on the

424
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,399
witness actually for those of you who

425
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,480
joined for john blowstream

426
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,799
from doing the the collision code on the

427
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
witness

428
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,599
the way i like to think about collision

429
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
detectors is not the normal way you

430
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
think about

431
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,198
them i tend to think about clitoris in a

432
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,639
different way i think of them

433
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,278
as making a definition of a function

434
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,198
that says

435
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:44,240
where the player can go and the primary

436
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:47,519
value that you that you tune

437
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,759
for that is what is the minimum

438
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
thickness that an obstruction would have

439
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,879
to be before you would consider it

440
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,199
stopping the player so so

441
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,000
you know basically the the world has a

442
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,359
concept

443
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,360
of what is a a thickness that

444
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,079
that constitutes like a spatially

445
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,278
occupying thing and the reason for that

446
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:12,719
is that i don't want lots of little

447
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:15,278
shardy sharp geometries

448
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,360
sticking getting you stuck i don't want

449
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,679
anyone creating a little tiny thin

450
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
wall and expecting that to stop anything

451
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,719
right

452
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
i want the game to be like okay there's

453
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
a certain bulk that's required to stop

454
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,959
the player

455
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,000
and anything smaller than that we just

456
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,078
discard as garbage

457
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,278
bad artifacts of somebody made a bad

458
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,599
collision thing like

459
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,360
that's like get rid of it right and the

460
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,079
reason for that is i don't like the

461
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
feel of games where every little crispy

462
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,359
piece of geometry

463
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,879
stops your motion it just doesn't feel

464
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,919
good so it's like no when you're

465
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,360
designing this game

466
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,120
when you put in collision geometry it's

467
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,959
got to be this thickness or

468
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,039
larger if you expect it to stop the

469
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,679
player anything thinner we throw out as

470
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,360
irrelevant

471
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,399
that does not stop the player don't

472
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,879
expect to stop the player or something

473
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
like that

474
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,198
so that way sharp edges get kind of

475
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
rounded out and it's easier to move

476
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:09,838
around

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,839
right um so

478
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,680
so that means that we take this size

479
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,759
here and we take

480
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,799
uh and we basically construct a little

481
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,600
voxel cell

482
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,159
around the player and what you can see

483
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
here

484
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,958
uh my font is so large because of

485
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,639
streaming that it's hard to see like

486
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,479
reasonably sized lines of code even on

487
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,720
one line but you can see here

488
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,879
uh what we do is we take the motion

489
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,399
displacement size

490
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,879
and we use it to floor the uh

491
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,480
place where the player starts and it's

492
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,838
player is the wrong term just entity

493
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,879
here i always say player because i think

494
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,519
of it as moving the player because

495
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,198
that's like

496
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,959
again witness-centric thinking since

497
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,078
these this that's the last time i did a

498
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,198
commercial

499
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:55,359
collision detection here um but

500
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,198
uh what we're basically doing is saying

501
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,919
produce a voxel cell but

502
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,879
but make sure that the voxel cell is

503
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,519
rooted

504
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,199
in some evenly spaced grid and the

505
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,599
reason for this is we want to get the

506
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,919
same results for movement in an area

507
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,838
that we would get at any time we don't

508
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,559
want the position of the player

509
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,759
to be something that actually changes

510
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,918
how we consider

511
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:23,119
the rules for motion so we basically put

512
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,640
um we basically put this

513
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,558
so that it's on fixed grid

514
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
in the world a fixed grid in the world

515
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,240
at that resolution

516
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
so we build a voxel and you can see us

517
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,400
doing it here

518
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,600
right so we build that and the first

519
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,720
thing we ask is

520
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:43,279
are we colliding right

521
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,240
uh at the position that we are in right

522
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,599
so like are we

523
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
inside or outside and i can already see

524
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,319
there's a bug in this routine

525
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,160
like just having walked through it

526
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,960
because we only finished this this this

527
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
is wrong

528
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,480
um that is not uh

529
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:02,480
that is not how you do that so

530
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,919
uh i think we just kind of were throwing

531
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,200
this in there and i probably hadn't like

532
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,280
walked through the whole thing yet and

533
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,120
talked about it so so that's wrong

534
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,480
the reason that this is incorrect is

535
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,959
because in general

536
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,400
you you don't really want to think about

537
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,720
collision

538
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,320
as you're colliding or not colliding

539
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,558
based on a position

540
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,480
if if you think about collision or not

541
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,440
collision as

542
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,798
the location that the entity is in space

543
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,279
then you're kind of going to open

544
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,400
yourself

545
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,678
up to a lot of numerical imprecision

546
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,320
problems

547
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,679
uh or issues that that have to do with

548
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,678
like you move two things

549
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,640
and now like they're sort of

550
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,480
interpenetrating or whatever

551
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,919
so you typically don't want to do that

552
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,360
right what you

553
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,520
or at least i don't like to do it that

554
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,558
way i feel like it's too error-prone

555
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:53,918
so what we really want here is not

556
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:57,119
this we actually don't want to ask about

557
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,240
uh the collision of the position entity

558
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:01,599
what we want to ask

559
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,880
is is this cell inside or outside

560
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:07,038
so if this cell is inside or outside

561
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
that is what we would actually use to

562
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,319
determine whether or not we could place

563
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,440
you in the cell or not

564
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,439
so this may not be a correct line of

565
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,000
code

566
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,439
uh so it depends on how we're going to

567
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,319
use it so let's continue walking through

568
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,840
the routine so

569
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:34,879
so we may we may need it

570
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:37,279
we may not um but

571
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,480
but uh you know yeah i can already see

572
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,319
like that that would probably cause a

573
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
bug if i if it's usually i think it's

574
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,319
going to be used

575
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:53,839
you know not right

576
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:53,839
um so yeah

577
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,279
okay um so then we've got here when

578
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,720
we're going through the cliche we've got

579
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,720
the direction and the side

580
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,798
uh vectors here and these are basically

581
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,519
just tests to determine

582
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,720
like all these are uh our tests to

583
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,359
determine like

584
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,159
when inside the voxel where are we

585
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,000
trying to go

586
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,440
like like what's the movement that we're

587
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,960
trying to do

588
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,000
yeah and so if you take a look at what's

589
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,960
going on in here we've

590
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,839
got our um our voxel that we come up

591
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,600
with now we say

592
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,879
okay you know we we start with a

593
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,279
particular one

594
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,320
that we're going to assume is the best

595
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,798
voxel

596
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,558
location that we can get and you can see

597
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,158
that in order to do the distance squared

598
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,440
we start out by saying well

599
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:43,840
the distance squared uh that we

600
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,840
consider to be the um

601
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,279
the distance squared that we considered

602
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:54,158
to be the best

603
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,158
so far is it oh my goodness

604
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:02,640
say hello puss how you doing

605
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,720
what's going on well surely

606
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,240
we now will be able to do a good job

607
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,480
debugging this collision routine because

608
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,200
the puss has joined us

609
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,558
and when the puss arrive it is good

610
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,679
right

611
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:20,079
it is a good programming omen um

612
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,840
somebody asked me last night actually uh

613
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,720
when i was playing satisfactory on

614
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,359
stream

615
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
uh somebody asked me if to be a good

616
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,479
programmer is it a requirement that you

617
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,720
own a cat

618
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,200
and i said well i think john is a good

619
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,400
programmer and he doesn't own a cat

620
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,679
so i guess not but he does

621
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,038
like cats like he doesn't dislike cats

622
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,400
so it might be that to be a good

623
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:46,240
programmer you have to at least

624
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,038
like cats i'm not sure it's hard to say

625
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,919
i do think that having a cat will

626
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,038
increase

627
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,080
your skill as a programmer clearly so i

628
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,759
do think that if

629
00:21:54,079 --> 00:22:00,879
john got a cat he would become an

630
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:04,000
even better programmer uh which

631
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,679
seems unlikely to because he's a very

632
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,558
good programmer but you know

633
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,919
i mean we don't know you don't know how

634
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:13,200
well john might program

635
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,840
if he had a cat you know

636
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,440
maybe it would be even better so so you

637
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,759
because you never know

638
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
what the ceiling is what the ceiling is

639
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,519
for somebody

640
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,159
it's always worth getting a cat to check

641
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,879
right

642
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,840
you could be even better if you had a

643
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
puss

644
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,759
uh to help you program so you know that

645
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,279
that's all i'm saying

646
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,640
you know i'm not i'm not saying john

647
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,879
should get a cat i'm just saying if he

648
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
got a cat

649
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
you know he might he might even surprise

650
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,919
himself you might be like i thought this

651
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,320
was the best i could program and then i

652
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,200
got a cat and like i'm even better now

653
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,558
you know it could happen that's all i'm

654
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,960
saying

655
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,960
that's a good puss that's a good puss

656
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,599
so anyway we need to now the the the

657
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:58,879
core of this routine it's very simple

658
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,119
routine actually

659
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
you know it's maybe not as well designed

660
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,519
as it could be so far

661
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,079
because we're just sort of starting so

662
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,798
we may make some improvements to it but

663
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,918
uh it's still pretty simple even in our

664
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,119
first pass

665
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:16,240
all we do is we start by saying well

666
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,158
this is the cell that the player

667
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,359
or the entity that we're moving i'm just

668
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,960
gonna say player from now on so i have

669
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:24,158
to think about it

670
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,279
this is the cell that the player

671
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,320
starts out in uh and then we create

672
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,639
a uh you know a rectangle out of that

673
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,639
just

674
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,240
this is just a convenient bundling by

675
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,080
saying look we're going to track the

676
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,000
minimum corner um

677
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,918
of this thing as vauxhall min corner you

678
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,359
can see it here so we're gonna create

679
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,799
soft bean soft bean

680
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,959
i'm afraid you're gonna start entering

681
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,440
keys baby can you come up can you come

682
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,880
up here

683
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,240
okay there we go there we go

684
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:00,000
okay okay that's a good puss

685
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,960
all right um so if you if you look at

686
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,839
what happens here we're going to start

687
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,159
with this min

688
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,000
this voxelman corner here and here's the

689
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,120
motion displacement size thing so

690
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,079
this is is doing that uh aligning to the

691
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,038
grid

692
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,798
and then we start with this best cell by

693
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,440
just saying look assume that the best

694
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,519
place to

695
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,798
the best voxel cell to leave the player

696
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,720
in is

697
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,558
whatever the one is that they started on

698
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,839
and the distance that we're going to say

699
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:28,960
is the best like the closest distance

700
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:32,480
to the uh to the target

701
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,960
which is 2p right is going to be

702
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,798
whatever the closest point is in the

703
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,720
cell that they start in

704
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,879
right to the the place you're trying to

705
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,480
get to that's the closest distance so

706
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
basically initialize by saying

707
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,558
you're in this cell here is the the

708
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,320
closest we could get you

709
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:53,119
while you're in this cell is this right

710
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,319
uh and then we start the loop we create

711
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,000
the cell that you're in

712
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,918
which at this point you haven't actually

713
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,440
moved so it's just starting

714
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
it's creating the exact same cell that

715
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,720
you're already in uh

716
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:09,360
not it's not hasn't moved yet oh babe

717
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,759
okay okay that's a good puss um

718
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,119
so then it goes ahead and gets the

719
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,119
center of that cell

720
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,959
and why we get the center of that cell i

721
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,319
don't know is that of this digital

722
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,840
remain

723
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,519
yeah it is i was going to say i don't

724
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,038
think that's necessary for the algorithm

725
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,038
so i'm like that's a little bit weird

726
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,599
we get the center of the cell for no

727
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:31,038
reason just to prove we can

728
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:33,519
um so then what we do is we have this

729
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,480
uh system here which which oh pus is

730
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,079
moving the mouse

731
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,000
that's the mouse cursor is being moved

732
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,480
by pus now

733
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,640
uh so we go ahead and get the cell and

734
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,519
we look at the corners of the cell to

735
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,799
see

736
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,759
whether the the entity in question could

737
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,558
be placed at the corners of that cell

738
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,640
right

739
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,480
so that's all this is doing it just says

740
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
look we're going to look at the eight

741
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,319
corners and we don't do any saving of

742
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,199
that right now like it

743
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,038
we could easily save every time we walk

744
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,400
this voxel

745
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:09,440
we could easily save uh at least

746
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,759
four well i guess in some cases we can

747
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,679
only save one if we move diagonally

748
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,519
for lateral moves we can save four for

749
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,360
diagonal we can only save one but we can

750
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:21,599
reuse these points

751
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:24,639
right um so you know

752
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,599
so anyway uh we do uh

753
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,440
a collision check to see whether you

754
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,798
could place the entity at each of the

755
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,519
corners of the voxel

756
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,599
and that produces an occupy uh

757
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,400
[Music]

758
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,879
an array of occupancy to say what you

759
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,120
could

760
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,919
stand in what you couldn't and what you

761
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,759
can see here

762
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:52,559
is that what we then do is say if

763
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:55,119
um you know you

764
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,399
if the player or if the entity could

765
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,399
have been placed

766
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,000
uh in the maximal direction

767
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,640
of movement so meaning

768
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,159
uh if you imagine you know you can see

769
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,038
here this side parameter

770
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,000
looked and said uh for x y and z do we

771
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,200
want to go

772
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,079
in you know to to like to the left or

773
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,919
the right

774
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,798
up or down um forwards or backwards

775
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,520
right

776
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:24,240
this produces that map this side thing

777
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,079
here

778
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,679
and so this is saying if we could move

779
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,000
diagonally directly where we'd want to

780
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,640
go

781
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,679
we do an update best uh with that

782
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,399
direction

783
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,519
right and that's just the the movement

784
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,000
diagonally

785
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,720
towards where we want to go and then

786
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,519
these

787
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,480
are movements that are lateral like like

788
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,879
only

789
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,558
out of face so this is a movement out of

790
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,480
vertex of the voxel

791
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,720
these are ones out the faces of the

792
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,798
voxel that are coming off that vertex

793
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,558
and if you look at the update best call

794
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,119
what you can see here is it says all

795
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,960
right

796
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,079
uh here is the the actual cell in

797
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,399
question

798
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,398
um

799
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:10,719
that we would end up in after this move

800
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,000
so if we did the move that we're talking

801
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,120
about here

802
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,440
when we do that move here is

803
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:22,398
the result right the cell we would be in

804
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,558
and then we just say where would we be

805
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:27,199
if we did that move

806
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,359
and then tried to get to the target

807
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,480
right

808
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:37,439
and so that is yeah i mean that's the

809
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,440
that's that's it

810
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,080
nothing else to say um so we do that we

811
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,640
say

812
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,839
that's where we would be we then say oh

813
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,960
is that

814
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,558
better so like is the distance from

815
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
where we could place ourselves to where

816
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,000
we're trying to go

817
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,798
is that better or worse than the best

818
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,558
thing we've found

819
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,918
if it's better meaning that the thing

820
00:28:56,558 --> 00:28:59,599
that currently the

821
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,240
the total distance that we were gonna

822
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,798
have before right

823
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,319
um if that's better we accept this as

824
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,839
the new move

825
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:11,200
right and we also say that you know we

826
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:13,759
did move so the move equals true

827
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
so we go through testing each of these

828
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,879
if we can

829
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,080
move out of a face uh or a vertex

830
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:24,720
then we do right uh and

831
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,158
we pick the one that will put us closest

832
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,798
to our goal

833
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,120
you know what i'm saying it assuming

834
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,720
that we were able to move

835
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,798
so assuming that something was able to

836
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,640
move we we accept the move

837
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,639
right and off we go

838
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,240
uh so it

839
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,959
it occurs to me that i didn't see

840
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,879
so this doesn't get used

841
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:03,439
actually um so

842
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,918
we didn't it looks like we didn't finish

843
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,000
because we were gonna use this

844
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,038
and uh i remember that when we were

845
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
putting it in there we were like well

846
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,158
we're gonna have to let people get out

847
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,519
of things if they're stuck

848
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,559
so we were gonna use this but then we

849
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,759
didn't um so i guess for now

850
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:22,158
uh we just turned it off but that's yeah

851
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,599
a bit weird

852
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,159
okay so when we are done

853
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,158
uh we it's basically we couldn't find a

854
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,640
place that would have put us closer

855
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,480
so once we can't do that we then say all

856
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,038
right let's find out

857
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,159
for the cell we're in we're gonna try

858
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,278
and look

859
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,760
along the line uh from

860
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,960
where we are to where we're going and

861
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,599
we're going to see

862
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,200
where uh if we can place the player

863
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:51,439
anywhere along that line

864
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,200
inside this cell so this is basically

865
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,240
just a refinement step

866
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,038
right um it's just a step that

867
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,480
tries to put the the uh entity that

868
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,519
we're moving

869
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,640
in the correct place inside the voxel

870
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,440
uh to to make the motion appear more

871
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,679
smooth

872
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,960
but it it doesn't contain any logic to

873
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,440
it right

874
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,440
so so technically we could just place it

875
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,240
at the center of the voxel cell and

876
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,880
things shouldn't change and in fact what

877
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,880
i might

878
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,919
argue should happen is for debugging

879
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,960
purposes

880
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,080
let's start without this so i'm going to

881
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,120
turn this off

882
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:32,960
so we're not going to do that

883
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:34,558
in fact and let's just do this

884
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,679
and what we're going to do is we're just

885
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,678
going to place entities

886
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:43,199
at the center of the

887
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,558
we're going to place them at the center

888
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,038
of the cell that they ended up in

889
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,918
right and that's it so we're going to

890
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,798
take refinement

891
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,360
out of the equation because we just want

892
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:55,038
to see

893
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,719
right so things should move like in

894
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,720
little steps if we did this

895
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,159
in fact the fact that that appears to

896
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,519
have broken

897
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,480
things uh is a good example of why we

898
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,319
should start with this because there

899
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,200
shouldn't be any weird this should not

900
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,319
be

901
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,759
looking like this right um that

902
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:19,359
that looks messed up so i'm not sure

903
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,720
why that happened oh i guess we hadn't

904
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,918
i guess i wasn't building i thought i

905
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,600
was building a release when did i change

906
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,038
that back to dubai all right never mind

907
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:29,678
didn't break it um

908
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,960
so if you take a look at at uh how this

909
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,720
is running here right

910
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:39,120
uh i'm moving around like so um

911
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,278
and everything is moving on the voxel it

912
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,479
it kind of looks smoother than you might

913
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,720
think but you can see

914
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,679
you can see that it's that that they're

915
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,919
snapping

916
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:53,200
sort of right um although man

917
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,000
it looks almost like too smooth uh

918
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,798
maybe just because that's those voxel

919
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,558
cells are

920
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:05,839
large i mean you can see it snapping but

921
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,839
it's it's shockingly let me see

922
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,600
yeah it's it's funny how your eye just

923
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,839
like i

924
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,879
think that it's snapping but it's funny

925
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,879
how your eye just

926
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,839
it interpolates it so well that like it

927
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,000
almost

928
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,918
looks it only looks like it snaps at the

929
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,079
end am i wrong

930
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,200
like is it actually not snapping i

931
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,119
should slow the time step down

932
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,480
we had that at one point i don't know i

933
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:39,119
may have removed it

934
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:42,798
um i should slow the time step down to c

935
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:45,119
because it sure looks like

936
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,119
um

937
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,720
uh yeah i don't know what to make of

938
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:55,519
that

939
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,960
uh it sure looks like it's not um

940
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,798
yeah it looks like we need to put that

941
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,240
back in like just a time

942
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:07,278
because because you should be able to

943
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:10,079
see it snapping

944
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,440
you know to to various locations and and

945
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,720
and that's

946
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,240
disturbingly not very snappy

947
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:21,598
um not a very good way to say that

948
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:25,519
but oops

949
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,519
i i don't know what to make of that um

950
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
again it might just be i'm getting too

951
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,240
old so you know my brain isn't fast

952
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,520
enough

953
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,118
and it like

954
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,119
i don't know um

955
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,359
yeah uh that's a little disturbing

956
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,719
anyway

957
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:48,719
i'm gonna draw the cell uh

958
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:50,319
real quick and uh let's

959
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,918
look at push volume outline real quick

960
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,960
and and just say uh okay so there's a

961
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:00,078
there's a rectangle three the best cell

962
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,199
is the is the thing we wanna draw um

963
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,960
the cell color we don't really have

964
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:08,559
a concept of here uh because we're

965
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,559
you know we're just placing the player

966
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,799
in this for snapping purposes so

967
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,199
you know this this isn't useful but you

968
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,320
know i'll set it to uh

969
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:22,319
um maybe a nice yellow

970
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,519
here and this is just me looking to see

971
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,440
so i can i can see what

972
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,599
this was we'll start by just drawing

973
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,358
that and make sure we can see it

974
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,039
which you know i can't really

975
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,598
so again a little weirded out because

976
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:41,039
that that should be showing up

977
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,039
right um

978
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
so i'm not sure what's going on here so

979
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,640
i want to debug this first

980
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,320
because i should be able to see this

981
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,358
pretty clearly and i'm not seeing

982
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,519
anything right

983
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,039
like you can see this this blue part

984
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,880
here

985
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,440
oh there it is so it's actually just

986
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,480
inside the glove

987
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,960
i guess those are smaller so so i guess

988
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,320
that's

989
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,039
why the snapping didn't look uh as much

990
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,240
as i thought

991
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:08,480
it's just because like where we were

992
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:13,279
looking at it they're very tiny

993
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:16,800
so actually that snapping i guess

994
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,240
i guess that's fair that snapping uh

995
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,280
is is so tiny at the scale we were

996
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:25,439
looking at

997
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,480
um that that we don't care right

998
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,519
um all right so that's fair uh and you

999
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,559
can kind of see

1000
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,559
like uh

1001
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:38,639
you can see us passing through stuff

1002
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,640
here

1003
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,440
right you can see that it hits that and

1004
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:47,358
stops

1005
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,679
right um so actually that particular

1006
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:52,639
move

1007
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,358
so it actually looks pretty stable there

1008
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,039
which is

1009
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,039
weird um

1010
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,440
and there you can kind of see it get

1011
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,440
stuck right

1012
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,440
that got stuck underneath something and

1013
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,440
can't get out so that's a good bug

1014
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,880
right i mean i guess it's not that it

1015
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
can't get out it's just it kind of gets

1016
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,519
stuck

1017
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,760
wedged in between things um

1018
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,199
so all right so okay we can see that

1019
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,640
relatively clearly now

1020
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:23,199
so i'll go ahead and

1021
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,838
uh put in a thing here where we just

1022
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,838
look at

1023
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:31,039
the uh where we look at the volumes

1024
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,320
and maybe what we'll do i'm not sure

1025
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:33,759
what i want to do here

1026
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,640
like i said i think we may have to add

1027
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,480
something for looking at the

1028
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,319
visualization because the steps of this

1029
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
we'd like to see them

1030
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,000
uh and we're not really gonna be able to

1031
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,119
see them much right like we're just

1032
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,079
gonna see

1033
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,358
you know a trail of stuff and and it's

1034
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,680
we're not gonna be able to make sense of

1035
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,719
it

1036
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:53,679
it's gonna go by too fast right

1037
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,118
so you can see like the uh you can see

1038
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,480
the

1039
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:05,838
magenta there is is the path in question

1040
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,838
so right

1041
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:13,919
and you know so here's what i will say

1042
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:13,920
i don't

1043
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,320
oh that's because bestsell isn't updated

1044
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,838
here so uh the reason that we're not

1045
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,760
seeing it is because we actually want to

1046
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,799
use cell because best cell

1047
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
actually doesn't get updated um it's

1048
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,599
just

1049
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:35,760
cell that we use for all this stuff

1050
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,760
so that's all right um

1051
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,358
all right so looking at it here there we

1052
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:46,639
go so like i say it should like i said

1053
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,319
it should look like a trail

1054
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,639
and you can see it looks like a trail

1055
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,838
now right

1056
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,420
um all right so looking at that

1057
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,509
um

1058
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,510
[Music]

1059
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,760
i mean i guess the first yeah i think

1060
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,919
we're gonna like i can't see

1061
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,839
any uh there's not like weird stuff like

1062
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,800
those are the voxels you would expect it

1063
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,440
to trace

1064
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,640
right like you know i just wanted to

1065
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,039
throw that in because i was like well if

1066
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:16,400
we see anything we get a freebie but

1067
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:19,358
i don't see any possibility of us

1068
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,358
really um

1069
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,440
debugging what's going on with just this

1070
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,039
you know

1071
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,480
um like you can see that

1072
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:33,679
it's moving it was able to move in there

1073
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,679
right um

1074
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,800
and i and in theory that should be

1075
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,240
totally impossible

1076
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,480
right like it should not have been

1077
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:42,879
allowed to move in there because

1078
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,920
the voxel you know it looks like it's

1079
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,280
testing

1080
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,838
the voxel uh so

1081
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,359
so i think we just have some core bugs

1082
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,400
in here

1083
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:58,400
like this must be just wrong

1084
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,400
you know what i'm saying um

1085
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,240
so maybe i'll inspect it

1086
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,400
uh and see let me just take a look here

1087
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,679
and see if there's anything

1088
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:25,838
un unseemly here

1089
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,358
so

1090
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,279
in the case we want to do a diagonal

1091
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,838
move we're looking to see whether

1092
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,839
it's not occupied

1093
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,679
in the maxwell direction you're going in

1094
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,719
the diagonal direction

1095
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:52,639
right side z

1096
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,919
y x

1097
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,639
and then it's going to update with this

1098
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,639
direction now i guess one thing

1099
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,599
is if these were wrong uh

1100
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,119
so if delta p is less than zero for any

1101
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,400
of the components

1102
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,240
then we would set the uh direction of

1103
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,680
motion here

1104
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,000
and and you can see the direction of

1105
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:20,559
motion it's just going to move

1106
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,119
you're going to be moving

1107
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,318
uh by that direction here so so the

1108
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,000
motion that happens

1109
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:31,440
is this that's the cell dim

1110
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,639
in that direction right so

1111
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,679
if if any of these were wrong like

1112
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:41,118
like if we tested you know the x

1113
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,719
but we moved in y or if we tested the

1114
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,400
negative x direction but then moved in

1115
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:45,759
the positive x direction

1116
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,599
you know things like that could

1117
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,640
certainly

1118
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:54,079
create an issue right uh

1119
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,078
and so i don't know

1120
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,280
so so i this is what i would like to

1121
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,680
draw and and to a certain extent we

1122
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,319
probably

1123
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:07,440
could draw that test so we could do

1124
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:10,090
um in update best

1125
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,000
we could make that um

1126
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:15,280
[Music]

1127
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,519
be the thing that draws

1128
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,240
so we can see whether or not

1129
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,000
you looked in a particular direction

1130
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,719
although well you know what that's not

1131
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,480
gonna help

1132
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:32,159
us really um although i could

1133
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,440
make it do that so so let's actually

1134
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,879
change this slightly so

1135
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,639
i'm going to do this strictly for

1136
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,280
visualization purposes

1137
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,920
what i'm going to do here is say okay

1138
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,119
there's

1139
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,838
like a conditional

1140
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,119
called a loud uh and we're just gonna

1141
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:53,039
predicate

1142
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,838
the motion the the check on that

1143
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,519
so we're not gonna like do and and you

1144
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:01,838
know we could actually have

1145
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,838
this b here for now

1146
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:07,440
and again this is not because this is

1147
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,318
how you would want to write this code

1148
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,280
none of this is this is just so that we

1149
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:13,199
can

1150
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,560
have a better understanding of what's

1151
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,239
going on

1152
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:22,000
so if we're allowed to do this right

1153
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:24,239
um then we will

1154
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,318
consider the move and then what i'm

1155
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,279
going to do is i'm going to move

1156
00:43:26,318 --> 00:43:29,920
what we put in here and in fact we can

1157
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,880
we can

1158
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,800
get rid of the knot as well so we can do

1159
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,160
this

1160
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,519
right so that up here when we do

1161
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,399
our test uh we can put like

1162
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,119
um occupied so we just pass that

1163
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,480
directly

1164
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,119
so then we can say look if not occupied

1165
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,838
and we can move there right and so

1166
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,680
that's

1167
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,440
that'll be kind of nice because then why

1168
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,159
is this not okay there we go

1169
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,639
um so then we can we can pass those

1170
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,239
through

1171
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,920
and that will allow us to do a thing

1172
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:04,719
that does a simple

1173
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,240
uh that does simple drawing of which

1174
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:07,118
ones were considered and which ones

1175
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,279
weren't

1176
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,119
for coder's indentation is still busted

1177
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,560
for some reason

1178
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,480
i don't i don't know if if that's ever

1179
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:20,159
gonna get fixed i'm not sure why

1180
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,400
like i i it wasn't and then it was

1181
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,000
this is the only machine that has a four

1182
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,358
coder on it so i don't really know what

1183
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,800
happened there

1184
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,719
but at some point it would be really

1185
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,560
nice if that were fixed

1186
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:39,838
that's what i'm saying um

1187
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:43,119
all right so

1188
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:46,000
building now

1189
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,800
uh i think this is now the same routine

1190
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,599
effectively

1191
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,079
right so we're passing uh the occupied

1192
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,200
flag

1193
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,519
down to the update best routine and then

1194
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,719
uh assuming that it's not occupied and

1195
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,759
it's a better move

1196
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,118
uh it will do the move and again the

1197
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,640
reason for that is that should do

1198
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,318
exactly the same thing and it seems like

1199
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,879
it's the same kind of bugginess

1200
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,119
uh so you know hasn't changed anything

1201
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,079
uh the reason is now i can draw this so

1202
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,519
now what i can do

1203
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:18,560
is say uh okay like maybe there's

1204
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:21,838
you know a couple tiers of this um

1205
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:25,279
happening uh and then i can do like a

1206
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:29,039
uh you know cell color thing

1207
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,440
where we just specify the cell color

1208
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,599
uh in a couple different ways and that

1209
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,318
way we can draw the cell colors

1210
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,318
as they were considered and we can

1211
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,599
see what was tested and what was picked

1212
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:49,199
you know uh so we

1213
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,519
will pick a cell color here

1214
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,118
um we'll say that things that are picked

1215
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,239
are green

1216
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,599
um things that are considered are like

1217
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,559
yellow

1218
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,680
uh and things that are uh occupied or

1219
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,920
red

1220
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:04,719
and so we should be able to see like

1221
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,318
something

1222
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,318
here i think oops

1223
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:10,959
um

1224
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:19,200
i guess that's

1225
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:22,800
needs an alpha channel um

1226
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,679
so what we want to do uh we just kind of

1227
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,800
want

1228
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:29,838
our what is the thing is it what

1229
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,839
what are you complaining about

1230
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,358
oh it's not complaining about that my

1231
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:40,078
bad

1232
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:43,199
i forgot we have to pass

1233
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,359
something that you used to draw um

1234
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,358
so

1235
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,560
what is this thing called just debug

1236
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,519
all right um so now we can see these

1237
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,279
hopefully

1238
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,800
and like i said i think we're gonna have

1239
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,200
to do some like sort of

1240
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,480
capture stuff here because i still think

1241
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:06,159
it's probably just gonna go

1242
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,639
by too quickly um i i don't think we're

1243
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,078
gonna

1244
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,679
see anything uh

1245
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,519
it's just gonna be like a blur of

1246
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:17,598
colored cubes

1247
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:19,838
and you know uh

1248
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,200
like you know right like i can't really

1249
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,799
tell what's going on there

1250
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:24,239
you can see what's being considered but

1251
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,760
you can't really see

1252
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:30,000
much else um

1253
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,520
so yeah like you know you can even see

1254
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,599
that there's a flash of red

1255
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,599
around those

1256
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,838
so it does seem

1257
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,960
this is why i say like we kind of need

1258
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,599
some capture now it does seem

1259
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,480
like something squinky uh is going on

1260
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,760
there

1261
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,358
so we can kind of tell that we've got

1262
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,160
some something buggy there's like

1263
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,598
red detection happening around that

1264
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,039
collision point but it's not actually

1265
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,200
stopping

1266
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,480
uh the move from being considered and we

1267
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,799
don't really know why

1268
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,159
and you know is that because and so now

1269
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,839
this is why i say we need some kind of

1270
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,000
capture because without it

1271
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:13,759
i'm not sure how we would really see uh

1272
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,519
this stuff

1273
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,280
uh like what what is actually happening

1274
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,719
so i'll do a pass through it now and

1275
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,079
then after that i think we just have to

1276
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:24,078
bite the bullet and build some capture

1277
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,680
stuff so that we can actually debug this

1278
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,200
because i don't think there's really any

1279
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,719
other way to do it i certainly don't

1280
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,078
know of another way you either get lucky

1281
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,439
when you inspect it but

1282
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,200
even then you're not sure if it's really

1283
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,318
working like capture stuff is kind of

1284
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,159
just necessary because

1285
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,159
in order to really debug a geometric

1286
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:42,879
routine you just you need to see it

1287
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:45,920
you just need to see it you know so

1288
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,800
anyway so one thing that could be wrong

1289
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,119
is this could be wrong

1290
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,039
right so collides at p could just be

1291
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,920
buggy and it's producing

1292
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:56,000
uh completely erroneous values here uh

1293
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,880
or the vox alliterator may be busted you

1294
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,119
know

1295
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,039
there's all that kind of crap could

1296
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:05,358
certainly be happening

1297
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:06,079
um so we can sort of take a look at that

1298
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:07,759
and see

1299
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,359
if there's anything weird happening here

1300
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,720
this is the routine that's got kind of

1301
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:11,358
the mark for like hey we gotta optimize

1302
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,639
this

1303
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,960
uh after we're done with the collision

1304
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,719
routine this is the thing that you know

1305
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,079
iterates over all the entities computers

1306
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:18,959
are so fast nowadays there's nuts that

1307
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,519
you can even do this

1308
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,720
um so it'll test like all 8 000 entities

1309
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,440
or something every

1310
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:26,639
every time every time it checks the

1311
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,599
voxel

1312
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,159
uh corner and somehow that still runs in

1313
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,838
real time

1314
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,960
computers are ridiculous um so anyway

1315
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,480
uh this is the part that we have to

1316
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,240
optimize but all we care about right now

1317
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,159
is that it produces a correct result

1318
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,598
even though it's slow uh you can see

1319
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:42,960
it's doing rectangles intersect here

1320
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,838
it's taking mover and test

1321
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,838
the mover rectangle

1322
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,760
is the one that we take the collision

1323
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,040
volume of the entity we're testing

1324
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:56,400
in this case right and the p value

1325
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,719
uh is is where we're trying to place

1326
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,680
right which is the min corner plus the

1327
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,039
cell dim

1328
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,399
offset for whatever uh vox corner we're

1329
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:07,039
on

1330
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,318
and we try to produce the corners this

1331
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,358
way

1332
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,000
so we go ahead and we produce the the

1333
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:13,679
rectangle there

1334
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,199
we iterate over everybody else we offset

1335
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,279
their collision volumes

1336
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,598
by their positions so wherever everyone

1337
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,640
else is in the world just stationary

1338
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,960
uh and assuming that we find

1339
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,719
uh somebody who collides we set the

1340
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,440
result to true so that means it is

1341
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,719
occupied

1342
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,159
right now that looks pretty

1343
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,558
straightforward to me

1344
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,078
um like it doesn't look like the kind of

1345
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,480
thing that would have a ton of bugs in

1346
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,039
it

1347
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,639
um that doesn't mean it doesn't it just

1348
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,920
means it's not something i would flag

1349
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:45,440
for early

1350
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,639
uh dissection right so over here

1351
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,559
we more or less assume that this true

1352
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:53,039
value is getting set properly

1353
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,680
uh during class of p and it's putting it

1354
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:57,759
in z

1355
00:50:53,679 --> 00:51:00,879
y x into the uh you know into the

1356
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:05,440
array here that all starts out at false

1357
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:09,280
um i don't know what the point

1358
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,960
of this is um

1359
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,800
other than i guess this thing needs to

1360
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,240
know so this is kind of a waste

1361
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,920
we were iterating a rock this is not

1362
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,719
even really a vox alliteration anymore

1363
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,519
right

1364
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,759
it's just doing one cell so it's kind of

1365
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,599
stupid to even bother using this

1366
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,880
we'll probably just write this out

1367
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,680
longhand

1368
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,880
but you know it should be fine right i

1369
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:30,239
mean that should produce the desired

1370
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:37,838
result

1371
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:37,838
it should be fine um

1372
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,838
we don't really need this anymore i'm

1373
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:46,558
going to pull this out

1374
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:48,960
temporarily so we might use it later

1375
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,839
but i just want to simplify it down real

1376
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,838
quick

1377
00:51:51,920 --> 00:52:05,838
okay so when we

1378
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,039
when we produce this you can see we

1379
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,920
start off in assuming that we we assume

1380
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,358
we can't

1381
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,200
move or didn't move we set the best

1382
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:20,719
corner and the original corner both to

1383
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,078
voxel min corner

1384
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:26,879
right we are then checking

1385
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,400
the side so all of these pointing the

1386
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,280
same direction and then we'll do a der

1387
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,599
move

1388
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,240
if we check z so we check the points of

1389
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,318
the z

1390
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,399
face either so that's going to be the

1391
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:41,358
top or the bottom face

1392
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,318
we will move in that in whatever z

1393
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,598
direction we wanted to go

1394
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:49,119
if that face is clear um

1395
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,119
same thing with y

1396
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:57,039
right and same thing with x

1397
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,838
and i don't see anything fishy there

1398
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:02,639
right

1399
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:05,279
um so it basic you know it's just oring

1400
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,279
these together

1401
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,480
um so it's basically saying if any of

1402
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:16,719
these were occupied

1403
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,719
right uh it doesn't go that direction

1404
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,400
if if any of them were occupied which

1405
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,920
which is like overly conservative

1406
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,680
right it's saying look we're not gonna

1407
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,400
allow you to move out of this face

1408
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,199
if anybody was blocking the face which

1409
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,440
is which is almost

1410
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:35,679
more than we probably wanted to do right

1411
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,679
um

1412
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:41,759
so we like we could probably add some

1413
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,200
like moving out of edges

1414
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,839
code in there right

1415
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,239
so it's really weird given the fact that

1416
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:51,759
we're

1417
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:54,799
starting like that seems

1418
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,839
kind of odd given that we're

1419
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,839
starting from that

1420
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,960
that we're having trouble with like

1421
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,640
allowing people to move you'd think

1422
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,480
you'd have the opposite

1423
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,279
like you'd think you'd be having trouble

1424
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,760
not moving people

1425
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,960
so something's fishy is what i'm trying

1426
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,400
to say

1427
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:21,679
um so that's

1428
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:25,680
weird in my opinion

1429
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:29,919
um and i'm trying to even come up with a

1430
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:33,440
argument for why that would be happening

1431
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,559
and i don't know what it is

1432
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:41,358
i don't have an argument

1433
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,359
for why that would be happening um

1434
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:56,399
so that's weird

1435
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,919
that's that's weird um let me take a

1436
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,838
look at how this works again so it's

1437
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,960
taking the original move corner

1438
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,558
and then doing the displacement that's

1439
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,838
what you'd expect

1440
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,839
uh producing

1441
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,159
the noose test cell it's using that cell

1442
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,799
to

1443
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,000
get how close you could get in the best

1444
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,838
case scenario

1445
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,480
to where you were trying to go uh it

1446
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:23,599
subtracts

1447
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:27,280
from that and then does the delta p

1448
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,000
if it accepts the move it sets the best

1449
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:33,280
min corner to the testament corner

1450
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,119
uh and sets the move to true

1451
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,160
remembers what distance it was as well

1452
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,160
yeah that just seems

1453
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,280
that's a real puzzler for me if i'm

1454
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,400
honest about it because that seems like

1455
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,798
if we were gonna have a bug we would

1456
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,079
the first bugs we would see are overly

1457
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:55,920
conservative movement

1458
00:55:52,079 --> 00:56:00,720
meaning you can't move into a wall

1459
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:03,760
um or or between two walls or something

1460
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:17,838
where you think you should be able to

1461
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:17,839
and so that is

1462
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,838
so that that is bizarre

1463
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,280
so by the way js krist there uh you were

1464
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:45,838
saying it looks like the test volume is

1465
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,119
so small

1466
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:48,400
it's only colliding at the wall boundary

1467
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,519
and when the test cell pushes far enough

1468
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,960
into the wall it is no longer tech

1469
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:55,838
collision um

1470
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,838
so the reason that that uh

1471
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,798
i mean obviously we have a bug so

1472
00:56:57,358 --> 00:56:59,598
something's happening but the reason

1473
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:01,599
that that

1474
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,280
algorithmically shouldn't happen and

1475
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,680
that's the reason why i'm confused about

1476
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,559
it

1477
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:07,440
is because the test cells are on a fixed

1478
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,880
grid

1479
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,159
right so you shouldn't be

1480
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,760
able to push the test into the wall

1481
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,358
because you never should have gotten

1482
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,599
there right

1483
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:20,480
so what we want to see and what we're

1484
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,880
not seeing

1485
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,519
and this is why i say we need capture so

1486
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,680
it's it's

1487
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:26,960
it's a pain so we're gonna have to go

1488
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,078
but write a bunch of code

1489
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,838
so we're you know we're gonna have to

1490
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,240
basically stop what we're doing put in

1491
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:31,599
some

1492
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,838
a bunch of code for inspecting this

1493
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:37,119
stuff

1494
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:37,920
um but the reason we need that is

1495
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,559
because

1496
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,519
there's no if the algorithm were working

1497
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,680
as intended

1498
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:44,639
there is no way for it to do what you're

1499
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,759
talking about

1500
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:50,480
right yet it obviously is

1501
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,119
so the question is how is it able to do

1502
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,838
that

1503
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,880
given that it shouldn't ever be able to

1504
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:57,440
none of these

1505
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,838
because of these tests none of these

1506
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:03,358
once you got to the boundary

1507
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:07,199
none of those should be legal

1508
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:10,318
right so somehow they are so that these

1509
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,439
tests are like allowing it to go in

1510
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:13,679
there

1511
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,920
and but it shouldn't be able to go in

1512
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,239
there right

1513
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,240
um

1514
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:23,599
right so the size should it shouldn't

1515
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,838
matter

1516
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,599
what you set that size to right this

1517
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:29,519
size can be anything you want

1518
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,640
it will still never be able to get into

1519
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,280
the wall

1520
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,400
logically i mean until you set it to

1521
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,119
being larger than

1522
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,039
the wall size right you would never

1523
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,240
actually be able to go through the wall

1524
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:45,199
because you'll always just have

1525
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,078
your four points that are on the inside

1526
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,118
of the wall

1527
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,160
when the cell straddles the wall will

1528
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,798
always be

1529
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,679
occupied so you can't move in that

1530
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:55,920
direction

1531
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:55,919
right

1532
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:08,640
you know what i'm saying

1533
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,280
so uh and uh and mind mark

1534
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,798
42 as you can see here you don't need to

1535
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,798
do any growing because

1536
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:16,000
uh you've got two collision volumes and

1537
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,960
you're testing to see whether the

1538
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,599
collision volumes themselves intersect

1539
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,039
so you don't need to do any minkowski

1540
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,559
operations because you're literally just

1541
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,079
testing two rectangles against each

1542
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:32,480
other

1543
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:37,039
right um

1544
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,039
so so

1545
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,200
so yeah um so i think we're just gonna

1546
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,199
have to take a look at what happens

1547
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:46,318
i don't really know uh any other way to

1548
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,960
do it uh

1549
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,519
and if we look at the uh in-game edit

1550
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,358
code

1551
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:56,400
like we've got some random crap here

1552
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:58,639
uh so it's

1553
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,440
so so like there's random crap in this

1554
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:03,519
thing

1555
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:06,639
you can see for like this stuff right

1556
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:10,239
um you know what i'm saying and so

1557
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:13,598
we can do uh we can put in

1558
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:17,118
something like maybe f9 or something

1559
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:21,119
might be uh a key we're not using

1560
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,119
right now and uh

1561
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,079
i think there's f key stuff oh right

1562
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,199
this isn't my editor

1563
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:32,318
uh so you can't do that you can do this

1564
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,879
yeah maybe no

1565
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:34,880
um

1566
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,559
so i don't know how to search this

1567
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,480
effectively sorry this

1568
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,160
the editor on stream versus editor in

1569
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,838
real life is always

1570
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,838
tough for me um

1571
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:53,838
we need some way of looking at the f

1572
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,599
keys

1573
01:00:53,838 --> 01:01:01,199
right uh we just want to go put in

1574
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,318
you know an f key that makes sense so so

1575
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,558
this code right here

1576
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:04,558
right

1577
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,039
um and what we want to do is say in this

1578
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,559
code

1579
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:15,519
so how did it not find that

1580
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,519
what the heck dude

1581
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:21,759
so was is that is that oh is that

1582
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,880
because it's k and eight would have done

1583
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,200
okay so it's eight

1584
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,640
uh sorry l it's l that does that okay

1585
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,759
that's fine

1586
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:31,759
uh right because there it is so anyway

1587
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,079
uh if we wanted to put in one of these

1588
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,400
things uh so we put in like collision

1589
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,359
detection here on nine

1590
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,838
um then what we could do is say like all

1591
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:43,679
right

1592
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:44,480
dev mode memory um we've got this little

1593
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:47,598
list here

1594
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,599
uh we could just do

1595
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,838
collision i don't know what dev mode

1596
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:53,838
dump is

1597
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,039
does anyone

1598
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:10,798
all right i guess that's

1599
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,559
something i don't think we use that

1600
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:14,639
doesn't know if that's bound to anything

1601
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,798
so you can't actually get dev mode dump

1602
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:18,838
i guess it's just in there and you can't

1603
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:22,079
use it

1604
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:22,639
um so if we take a look at the in-game

1605
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,839
editor

1606
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:27,199
here what we could do is try to put in a

1607
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:32,480
thing

1608
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:36,078
that will uh that will allow us to do

1609
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:40,159
the uh the editor in here so

1610
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:42,480
so like you know i don't know

1611
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,480
um

1612
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:52,640
we can put

1613
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:57,118
dev mode collision and you know

1614
01:02:52,639 --> 01:03:00,159
collision editor or something

1615
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:03,200
um and you can see we've got

1616
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:06,078
this i don't

1617
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:08,480
really know i guess this would be the

1618
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,480
same

1619
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,519
and then we can just look at this camera

1620
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,039
editor thing and see what we did here so

1621
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:18,079
it you know

1622
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,079
looks sane

1623
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:31,679
so here it is uh we can make buttons

1624
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:36,000
i guess uh and we probably want to

1625
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:36,000
so we probably want to say

1626
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:45,838
um

1627
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:51,440
what on earth is that

1628
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:01,838
what did we were just screwing around to

1629
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,838
see if we could plate

1630
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,119
and were we just screwing around to see

1631
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:09,440
if we could put in little like

1632
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,318
i don't have any any idea what that is

1633
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,000
uh all right

1634
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,759
so anyway uh if we want to put in a

1635
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,920
collision section here we can

1636
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,520
do this we could we could just say like

1637
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:27,838
you know

1638
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:27,838
i don't know um

1639
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:37,838
here's the collision recorder um i don't

1640
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:37,838
know

1641
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,838
maybe like

1642
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:49,440
like time step

1643
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,079
should be in here um so in here i could

1644
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,519
do like

1645
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:58,079
world mode like um

1646
01:04:53,519 --> 01:05:01,500
time step scale

1647
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:04,559
um and you know something

1648
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:08,239
[Music]

1649
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:11,519
where we could sort of do various scales

1650
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,519
i i don't know

1651
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:18,798
um so we'll go ahead and do

1652
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:20,400
do that and and i'll ignore this for now

1653
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:24,079
and we'll just build this and we'll see

1654
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,079
what happens um

1655
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:34,838
we need to have that actual scale

1656
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:37,679
so in the world mode code

1657
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:40,880
um let me just zoom down here

1658
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:44,798
so in the world mode code

1659
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:48,559
um here

1660
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:52,000
we should be using a dt

1661
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,370
when we do like collision movement

1662
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,318
so when we do

1663
01:05:53,369 --> 01:06:00,639
[Music]

1664
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:03,679
our update like this simulates stuff

1665
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:06,719
right you can see the dt

1666
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:08,469
here so i think if we

1667
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,719
want to um

1668
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:14,239
[Music]

1669
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:19,838
we should be able to say that there is a

1670
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:19,838
world mode like

1671
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,920
time step scale uh

1672
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,199
and and it just like multiplies that out

1673
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:33,679
right

1674
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:34,239
now if i run it now what we would expect

1675
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:36,719
to see is

1676
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,318
that no one can move right so you can

1677
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,719
see it we just stop

1678
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:43,038
we can never get anywhere uh because we

1679
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:46,239
would need to initialize it to zero

1680
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:49,760
when we create the world initially

1681
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:52,719
um and so you know

1682
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,200
that's kind of a separate issue so when

1683
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:58,639
we initially create the world mode

1684
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:01,838
um that's gonna be

1685
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,838
probably in here right

1686
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:14,960
nope i thought this got fixed

1687
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:16,798
at some point evidently i'm wrong it did

1688
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:20,559
not get fixed

1689
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:22,159
uh so here's us creating the world mode

1690
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,240
um so in here i'll just set the time

1691
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,879
step scale to one

1692
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,239
and now we should just have it operating

1693
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,559
normally

1694
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:34,078
right um and uh

1695
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,760
you know here's the game running as

1696
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:38,640
normal and then

1697
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,760
you know we want to try and get the

1698
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:41,358
looks like f9

1699
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,480
that doesn't seem to actually be setting

1700
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:44,480
that mode

1701
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,798
did i do something wrong

1702
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:00,798
is the f9 key like not something that

1703
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,798
happens in here

1704
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,599
so another well you know what i was

1705
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,798
thinking um it may not call the editor

1706
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,039
for that though

1707
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:13,038
i'm not sure about that part let me take

1708
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:17,039
a look at

1709
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,039
dev mode camera just to see

1710
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:25,838
where that's happening

1711
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:39,838
because all that seems sane

1712
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:48,479
ah there we go

1713
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:50,838
so it looks like we cabined off ones

1714
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,238
that are supposed to be handed to the

1715
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:53,759
editor

1716
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:56,238
not the greatest way to do that but

1717
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,238
that's fine

1718
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,239
so still a little weird

1719
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,759
probably because i did that

1720
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:25,600
there we go um

1721
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:29,199
so this would let us set you know

1722
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:32,640
extremely slow uh time step

1723
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:36,798
right speed um which is what i wanted

1724
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,000
to start with right so at extremely slow

1725
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:42,560
time step

1726
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:46,838
you can see i mean the thing only moves

1727
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:52,480
uh along one one thing

1728
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:52,479
um as it hops along

1729
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,560
it's kind of fun uh so we should be able

1730
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,279
to like

1731
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:05,280
if we want to zoom in on

1732
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,399
on this here

1733
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:17,840
and just see it's checking

1734
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,840
so to be completely honest

1735
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:35,519
i don't quite

1736
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,520
follow that

1737
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,449
um

1738
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:39,449
[Music]

1739
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,119
so i think we have a bug even just

1740
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,800
before we start

1741
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:50,000
so like that's a configuration of boxes

1742
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,239
that you should never

1743
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,960
be able to see right because

1744
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:58,399
you should only ever see essentially

1745
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:02,158
like little like

1746
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:05,359
tetrahedral configurations and this

1747
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:08,479
is one that has

1748
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:13,839
yeah like like that's just not correct

1749
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:16,559
so so um it's already broken

1750
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,319
even just looking at that i don't know

1751
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,280
why i didn't see that originally

1752
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:23,039
but um even just that is wrong we

1753
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:24,319
haven't even captured anything yet and

1754
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:27,039
we're already

1755
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:28,238
seeing a bug so something about this

1756
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:32,399
directional movement

1757
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:34,799
is wrong um meaning it's

1758
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,639
not not not even occupied because there

1759
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,400
was no colliders

1760
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:43,360
so so just like what are the boxes

1761
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,399
that are involved it's picking the wrong

1762
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,759
boxes

1763
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:51,039
so so this right the der extra y

1764
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:54,239
jersey der that set was like

1765
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:57,279
wrong unless i'm misinterpreting it

1766
01:11:54,238 --> 01:12:00,319
you know what i'm saying it's

1767
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,039
somehow picking these in a way that

1768
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:04,238
isn't

1769
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:06,719
what you would expect right or that

1770
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:06,718
isn't what i

1771
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,079
expected

1772
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,079
oh

1773
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,880
no that's not that's not true so all

1774
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:26,960
right so

1775
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,000
that's good information i'm i'm pretty

1776
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,760
happy to hear that

1777
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,679
uh because that means i've got something

1778
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,440
to debug right off the bat

1779
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,840
but what i do want to do there is i

1780
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:38,079
would like to know

1781
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:41,039
so yeah i'd love to know what

1782
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:42,880
what is producing that configuration so

1783
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:44,238
maybe what i should do is step through

1784
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,279
the code there

1785
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:48,479
um try to think if there's anything i

1786
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,559
could draw

1787
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:51,519
that would allow me to see who was at

1788
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,440
fault there

1789
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:58,719
um so so one thing we could do

1790
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:02,639
is change the color rule

1791
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,439
uh and say so like direction gets passed

1792
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,360
here

1793
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,519
what we could do is say well we don't

1794
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,039
care about this right now so let's just

1795
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,840
draw the direction

1796
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:12,640
as the color right so then we would be

1797
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,079
able to see

1798
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,719
like in terms of rg or b who was at

1799
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:19,119
fault

1800
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,800
because positive and negative like we

1801
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:23,920
don't want to distinguish the directions

1802
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:29,360
what we really want is that we don't

1803
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:29,359
have an absolute value for vectors do we

1804
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,840
um

1805
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:41,600
well we do for okay so we we do for

1806
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:45,439
vectors of cindy

1807
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:50,480
but we don't have um

1808
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:53,599
uh we don't have one for vectors of uh

1809
01:13:50,479 --> 01:14:01,839
of regular nature uh okay

1810
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:01,840
so let me do it this way

1811
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:07,359
and we'll do it by hand there we go

1812
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:11,279
um so this is just a way of making sure

1813
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:13,920
that the negatives

1814
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:16,000
become positives so we can just we just

1815
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:20,239
see which axis

1816
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,520
each one is uh and so if i go and look

1817
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,359
we have to reproduce

1818
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,600
that weird configuration but it looks

1819
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,960
like we already have it right

1820
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:32,320
so you can see here where we've got

1821
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:37,119
that is the corner move right

1822
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:37,119
that one is the corner move um

1823
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,880
and so yeah i don't

1824
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,079
i'm not sure how to interpret this at

1825
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,640
all now maybe there's

1826
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:50,640
overdraw happening here um

1827
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:54,639
but how could there be overdraw because

1828
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:59,359
your the movement

1829
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,360
amount is zero so it should only check

1830
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,439
one set like we're not seeing two

1831
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,480
iterations

1832
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:09,919
right so if you look here the

1833
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:11,198
white box is the one that's supposedly

1834
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,960
would be testing

1835
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:17,919
a lateral movement right i mean

1836
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,920
a diagonal movement

1837
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:24,800
blue is testing a z move

1838
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,560
right which means that it you know

1839
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,560
ostensibly would be this cell here so

1840
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,840
that's blue

1841
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:34,239
um okay so

1842
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:34,960
so maybe i panicked for no reason that

1843
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,039
actually

1844
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,158
i forgot the fact that it's not drawing

1845
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:40,158
the cell that you're in

1846
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:44,960
so there's the cell you're in and it's

1847
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,440
producing the tetrahedron shape

1848
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,439
correctly

1849
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,360
okay so so i'm i'm less nervous i was

1850
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,480
super nervous there but i forgot the

1851
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:53,198
fact that we're not drawing the cell

1852
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:55,198
you're in

1853
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,519
so if you drew the cell you were in you

1854
01:15:55,198 --> 01:16:01,279
would see it right there

1855
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:05,280
yeah okay so that's actually fine

1856
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:08,960
um no need to panic as i had

1857
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:12,158
um here oh this is kind of handy

1858
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:15,439
pun intended so here is the hand

1859
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:18,000
stuck inside this thing right

1860
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:21,839
let's draw the cell we're in so to make

1861
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,840
that a little easier on ourselves

1862
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:27,839
and the way i'm going to do this is just

1863
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,880
taking the starting best cell so this

1864
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,400
thing right here

1865
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,159
i'm just going to draw this and i'm

1866
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:35,679
going to draw this in a color um maybe

1867
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:39,198
we'll just do it pure block

1868
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:39,199
so so that's where you're starting

1869
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,079
i'm just gonna draw that uh

1870
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,239
leaning on the hot code reloading here

1871
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:51,439
to help us out um

1872
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:54,959
so there's our uh there's our movement

1873
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:58,479
you can see uh let me see

1874
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,439
if i back up okay so we know that this

1875
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,718
is trying to get

1876
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:02,719
over here right

1877
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:08,158
and you can see where it starts and you

1878
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,440
can see it trying to

1879
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:13,920
uh like it's testing these cells

1880
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:15,599
and i assume that this this makes

1881
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,079
perfect sense of why it's stuck

1882
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,600
because this is actually a correct

1883
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:20,640
result since we haven't put in the thing

1884
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,760
that allows it to move

1885
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,000
out that was what this was going to be

1886
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,000
for

1887
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:31,840
so we haven't put in

1888
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:36,640
the detection for the case where you're

1889
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:40,960
inside something trying to get out

1890
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:42,400
so actually that's fine uh to me i think

1891
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,239
i don't have any problem with what's

1892
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:48,158
happening there

1893
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:49,919
so uh yeah the question though is again

1894
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:50,479
the same bug must be happening on both

1895
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,000
sides

1896
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,759
because there's no explanation for how

1897
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,800
you would get out of that

1898
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,760
um i have no idea it might be that this

1899
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:02,079
guy moved

1900
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:05,760
right um but yeah

1901
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:07,359
so if i look at pushing against that guy

1902
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,920
let me hold this down here so you can

1903
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,920
kind of see

1904
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:27,840
just trying to see how we get stuck

1905
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,119
all right

1906
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:46,239
um excuse me

1907
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:49,439
so um i'm now going to say

1908
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:49,439
i'm going to put this back in

1909
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,840
and then i'm going to start doing

1910
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,840
recording

1911
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,080
all right um so what i'd like to do is

1912
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,079
probably like to set up a case where

1913
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:16,319
it's easier to look at this stuff so the

1914
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:19,359
other thing i might do here

1915
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:24,319
is i might go into the world gen code

1916
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:28,479
and just instead of placing

1917
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:31,840
excuse me instead of placing the

1918
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,799
uh player in the dungeon there which is

1919
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,279
what's happening

1920
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,079
i might place them in the outside world

1921
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,359
but so there's no

1922
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:42,479
ceiling you know what i mean

1923
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:44,479
so in here where we do uh orphanage or a

1924
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:47,519
bedroom later we do this thing

1925
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,039
and i'm just going to get rid of that um

1926
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,640
so i'm just going to have it so it

1927
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:53,519
starts up in the

1928
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:54,640
the place where there's no ceiling right

1929
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,600
and that way when i

1930
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,320
if i right click on this here you can

1931
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,079
see that

1932
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,238
there's no ceiling above us it's easier

1933
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:04,238
for me to look at what's going on

1934
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:05,839
and also we're in a kind of easier place

1935
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:09,039
for collision you know i can

1936
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:12,159
just immediately uh

1937
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:16,079
punch these walls here right um

1938
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:18,638
and uh and and make that happen so

1939
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:20,719
um so it seems pretty easy to punch into

1940
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,359
this wall so let's make that be our test

1941
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,439
case here

1942
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,960
right we should not be able to do that i

1943
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:27,839
i don't know i don't have an

1944
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,840
argument for why that should happen um

1945
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:33,600
so let's see if we can figure out

1946
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:37,199
uh that procedure uh and again the way

1947
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,199
that we want to do this oh

1948
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,880
wait

1949
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,879
so so here's a question for you

1950
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:58,238
something i had not considered um

1951
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,279
so suppose i was to say like okay we're

1952
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:02,158
going to look at this

1953
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:04,319
and we set the time step down to like

1954
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:07,198
some really low number

1955
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:07,198
is that a good number

1956
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:23,039
so suppose i set the time step down to

1957
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:25,600
really low number

1958
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:26,880
um can i get this thing stuck in the

1959
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:31,840
wall

1960
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:35,440
or not i was kind of hoping i could

1961
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,079
um because i wanted to be able to run

1962
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:38,319
into

1963
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:39,920
a small time step but it almost looks

1964
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:41,840
like this is very interesting because

1965
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,639
this we also shouldn't be sensitive to

1966
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,560
time step

1967
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,079
so that's another good clue to where our

1968
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,320
bug is because if i

1969
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:49,600
can't get this stuck in the wall at a

1970
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:51,519
slow time step

1971
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,400
it suggests that something weird is

1972
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,880
happening with the position tracking

1973
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,158
that's making it dependent on that in a

1974
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,239
way that i

1975
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:01,519
didn't anticipate yeah like that just

1976
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:03,359
goes straight through

1977
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,199
wow okay so there's all kinds of stuff

1978
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,719
clues here for us

1979
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:12,238
so that suggests that having 2p

1980
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:15,359
placed further in

1981
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,359
like further away

1982
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,119
changes the algorithm which it shouldn't

1983
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,840
do right

1984
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:26,639
so that's a very important clue as well

1985
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:29,520
um to what's going on here

1986
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,119
because we really shouldn't be using 2p

1987
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,800
for anything other than just which

1988
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,479
direction we're trying to go

1989
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,079
that's the only thing that it should be

1990
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,959
doing and so

1991
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:39,519
something's busted if the changing to

1992
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,079
cause

1993
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,199
what the time step will change is how

1994
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:46,399
far

1995
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:49,839
2p is displaced from from p

1996
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:52,238
right so that should not

1997
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,880
actually be affecting us so the fact

1998
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:56,000
that that

1999
01:22:52,880 --> 01:23:00,000
is affecting us um

2000
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,679
is really peculiar and we absolutely

2001
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,158
should track that down first because

2002
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:06,079
that's

2003
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:09,759
super weird right that's super super

2004
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:13,359
super weird um

2005
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:21,840
so maybe it's because of this part here

2006
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:21,839
i'm not sure um

2007
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:28,639
like is this somehow failing

2008
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:30,399
you know what i mean like is somehow

2009
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:35,840
this producing

2010
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:35,839
values that are

2011
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:49,839
that are broken let me let me check that

2012
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:49,840
real quick

2013
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,880
so i think we never really want this

2014
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:59,198
thing to be yeah well i mean

2015
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,560
we've got work to do here but it's okay

2016
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:03,839
so we have our refinement

2017
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,719
test here it's always going to produce a

2018
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,159
value

2019
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:11,198
that's between from p and 2p if t

2020
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:14,238
test is within bounds so what i might do

2021
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:18,319
though just to be careful

2022
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:18,319
is let's make sure it is

2023
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:25,279
right it should never be able to put us

2024
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:29,119
past 2p or from p on either end

2025
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:31,119
so let me just quickly sanity check that

2026
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:32,319
because that would obviously create an

2027
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:36,800
issue

2028
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:36,799
oops i closed my editor for no reason

2029
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:49,119
try that again

2030
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:52,560
uh yeah so should be fine

2031
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:55,359
no issues uh so so that's not

2032
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,360
implicated there

2033
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:02,079
so yeah so the 2p and from p should now

2034
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,359
be truncated

2035
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:08,399
so one thing we could do perhaps is

2036
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:12,799
draw these steps uh

2037
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:15,599
as well right and use collides

2038
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,320
uh in in drawing it so i'm gonna go

2039
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,600
ahead and

2040
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:23,439
and just upgrade now uh um

2041
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,440
our our drawing of this

2042
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,880
i got sidetracked i was thinking of

2043
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,360
doing something totally different but

2044
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,119
i'm like

2045
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:34,399
that now we've got an even better

2046
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:36,238
uh thing to track down here so

2047
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:37,679
you know you got to go where you got to

2048
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:38,399
go where the getting is good you know

2049
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:41,279
what i'm saying

2050
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,319
when you're debugging um so in here what

2051
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:45,599
i might say is

2052
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:47,920
let's draw the lerp test so

2053
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,199
when we do these tests we get a collide

2054
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,239
value

2055
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:53,599
you know out of that let's draw that so

2056
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:56,799
in here we'll draw

2057
01:25:53,600 --> 01:26:00,000
like a magenta or something um

2058
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:03,360
like a really tiny uh

2059
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,079
you know uh volume

2060
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,079
oops uh

2061
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,039
that's just the width of the cell uh and

2062
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:14,000
so i guess we'll just do a

2063
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:15,198
rect center dim and we'll just say look

2064
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,840
that's the center

2065
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:19,759
the dimension is going to be something

2066
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,440
uh extremely small

2067
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,039
uh because it's just like a point

2068
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:26,319
basically

2069
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:28,238
um so something like that

2070
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:29,759
uh and so that way we can kind of see

2071
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:33,678
like where these are

2072
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:37,520
and then the the color we want to do

2073
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:41,840
uh based on if it collides or not

2074
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:45,280
so we'll do like uh something like uh

2075
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:47,840
i don't know uh we'll do magenta if it

2076
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:51,359
collides in cyan if it doesn't right so

2077
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:56,560
cyan is like you could put it here

2078
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:56,559
magenta is you couldn't uh and

2079
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,800
yeah so let's just see if we can see

2080
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:06,000
that at all

2081
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:08,639
um so if i bring up that

2082
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,840
uh time step test again and just you

2083
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,760
know

2084
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:16,880
crank that down to something smaller

2085
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,639
right so there it is um

2086
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,079
and then we try to take a look here you

2087
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:23,119
know can we see

2088
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:25,679
that placement yeah you can kind of see

2089
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:27,279
right you can see the refinement

2090
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,800
placement there

2091
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:34,479
um very small right it's it's barely

2092
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,480
doing any refinement placement at all

2093
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:46,480
yeah so now what i want to be able to do

2094
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:50,159
is i think we want um

2095
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:53,439
a different thing so the time step

2096
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:56,879
is great and all that's fine

2097
01:27:53,439 --> 01:28:00,000
um but i think what we actually want to

2098
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,560
have there is like a frame hold

2099
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,279
kind of a thing you know what i'm saying

2100
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:09,600
so we can kind of like single step

2101
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:09,599
if that makes sense and so

2102
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,840
um

2103
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:29,600
easier said than done

2104
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:32,719
largely just because of routing but

2105
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:36,239
basically what i'm talking about here is

2106
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:37,198
inside the that little thing that was

2107
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:43,839
like hey

2108
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:43,839
editor uh

2109
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,480
where we did the collision editor we

2110
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,760
kind of want the ability to just single

2111
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:52,799
step this stuff

2112
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,600
uh and in you know in the witness like i

2113
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,039
built this really

2114
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,560
good one that you could like record

2115
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:57,359
things and scrub through them and all

2116
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,600
that stuff and

2117
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:00,719
that's probably a bridge too far here

2118
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,679
but

2119
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,439
you know we could do is if there's like

2120
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:08,560
a way to do like a toggle

2121
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:10,158
button um

2122
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,840
you know i don't remember any of this

2123
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:13,439
stuff that we did

2124
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,800
obviously we wrote it all because the

2125
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:16,238
only person who's programmed anything on

2126
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,360
this is me

2127
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:21,279
um but uh i don't know

2128
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:23,279
what we've got here for the yeah we do

2129
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:26,319
so so we can do a toggle button so

2130
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:28,559
what i might suggest is we have a

2131
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:33,679
boolean button here

2132
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:33,679
and we say well uh we've got this

2133
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:44,238
um is it bundle z what's bundle z

2134
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:44,238
yeah um so

2135
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:52,880
we have a thing that's like single step

2136
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:58,000
right that you can like turn on

2137
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:58,000
and uh that'll be like a you know

2138
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:02,960
a thing that when we're ready to debug

2139
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:07,840
we like turn on single stepping

2140
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,840
and uh

2141
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:13,519
and then we just kind of click through

2142
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,039
it i guess yeah it's a little annoying

2143
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,920
because you'd have to hold down the

2144
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:18,399
input

2145
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,199
which would be annoying but uh so we

2146
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:21,519
have like

2147
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:23,439
highlight and interaction here so i'm

2148
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:26,000
gonna i don't since i don't know

2149
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:27,039
uh very much about how we wrote this i'm

2150
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,079
just gonna

2151
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:31,519
look for where we've used it uh and you

2152
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:32,399
can see actually i guess there's quite a

2153
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,840
few

2154
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:35,839
um of these things here

2155
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:40,559
so it looks like

2156
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:49,279
looks like that was used mostly for

2157
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:52,319
working in that system

2158
01:30:49,279 --> 01:31:02,000
in the in the edit system there so

2159
01:30:52,319 --> 01:31:06,960
yeah not fabulous

2160
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,960
but shouldn't we be able to do

2161
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:12,400
shouldn't this just have a normal i'm

2162
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,840
confused

2163
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:24,960
yeah so this is i guess this is pretty

2164
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,960
straightforward actually

2165
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,079
so basically what we would want is like

2166
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:33,599
you know

2167
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:37,920
world mode uh single step

2168
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,920
and then we would just do um

2169
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:47,198
edit of that thing

2170
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:49,599
and this just says we want to set this

2171
01:31:47,198 --> 01:31:52,399
value like that's the interaction

2172
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,520
and for debug ids uh i guess we just

2173
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,158
want

2174
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,360
some way of you know of producing one of

2175
01:31:56,158 --> 01:32:00,879
these things

2176
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:05,039
i don't totally understand exactly

2177
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:06,480
how this stuff is is working um

2178
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,119
because again it's just been so long

2179
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:12,000
since we wrote any of this stuff

2180
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:13,519
and our debug system sucked uh i've said

2181
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,800
that many times like it was just not

2182
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,320
done very well

2183
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,000
so you know that's just one of the

2184
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:20,399
consequences of programming on stream

2185
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,520
sometimes you just don't do a very good

2186
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:24,399
job compared to what

2187
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,520
you know should probably be happening um

2188
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:28,879
but

2189
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,719
uh so in terms of those the difference

2190
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,880
there because there was like dev ids

2191
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,960
versus uh debug ids and there really

2192
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,400
wasn't much of a reason for this

2193
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,399
um because you can see like there's dev

2194
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:42,158
id values and then there's uh

2195
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:45,439
the debug id stuff which i think

2196
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:47,119
uh oh no it is the same okay

2197
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:48,399
uh so i guess we did unify this so i

2198
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:51,039
don't really understand so like if you

2199
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:55,599
look at dev id from pointer there

2200
01:32:51,039 --> 01:33:00,639
um so so i guess it actually works fine

2201
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:03,120
never mind um it's still a crappy system

2202
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,760
i i think i don't want to say that it's

2203
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,359
good

2204
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,719
because it's not um

2205
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:22,960
so let's go ahead and go to the world

2206
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:25,439
mode and add that though

2207
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,439
right here

2208
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:33,760
um and so we should now be able to

2209
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:36,000
enable single single stepping which will

2210
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:39,520
give us a flag we can use

2211
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:42,560
um to do you know some stuff for debug

2212
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:51,840
purposes right um so

2213
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:51,840
you know uh or not

2214
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:06,319
i'm not sure why that failed

2215
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,439
this is why i say the debug system sucks

2216
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:08,000
because this should be a pretty simple

2217
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:09,599
thing

2218
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,679
but it's just too complicated like

2219
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,760
there's too much of this nonsense

2220
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,800
um because it tried to do like too much

2221
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,600
stuff

2222
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,560
really is mostly mostly the stupid part

2223
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,560
of it

2224
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:22,560
if it had just been scoped smaller you

2225
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,000
wouldn't need a lot of this stuff

2226
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,679
uh and so it just becomes kind of

2227
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,279
annoying but you can see here like that

2228
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:30,560
interaction did not work

2229
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:30,559
right um

2230
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:37,859
and so it's just kind of annoying and

2231
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:37,859
[Music]

2232
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:48,639
um

2233
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,400
i mean it looks like maybe the better

2234
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,920
thing to do would just be to not do any

2235
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:54,559
of that like it looks like you can also

2236
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,560
just do this

2237
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:01,839
so maybe we just should

2238
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,840
i mean that seems a lot easier right

2239
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,960
um

2240
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:29,439
yeah but for some reason we don't oh uh

2241
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:30,960
okay i see so that's like enabled or

2242
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:33,279
disabled

2243
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,198
i guess uh so

2244
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:43,840
[Music]

2245
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:43,839
maybe that

2246
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:52,319
what does this take this button function

2247
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,079
enabled and then back to color yeah so

2248
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:02,319
so i think

2249
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:03,679
um i i don't even have to do this i

2250
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,559
could just say like

2251
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:08,960
okay you know there's a a backdrop color

2252
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:11,840
and the backdrop color is based on

2253
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,840
you know

2254
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:25,839
whether or not you're single stepping

2255
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:39,759
why is that still disabled didn't i say

2256
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,920
it was enabled

2257
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,520
oh none of the two overloads could

2258
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:53,840
convert okay

2259
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:53,840
so what's your problem we have

2260
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,960
i see so there's like a more more

2261
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:02,399
fancier

2262
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,679
version which is this one and it's like

2263
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:07,920
the dev id

2264
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:11,840
a classifier which

2265
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:16,639
in these cases it just uses zero

2266
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,639
so i guess we don't care what that is

2267
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,920
so we've got layout the dev id a

2268
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,039
classifier

2269
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:29,118
the label text oops

2270
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:30,560
that went in the wrong place the label

2271
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:33,118
text and then i think we've got all the

2272
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,119
stuff passed

2273
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:40,800
um so that allows me to turn it on and

2274
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:43,439
off right

2275
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,600
and then we can use that to to do some

2276
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,238
like single stepping stuff where

2277
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,639
um we can because we just need to watch

2278
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:50,479
it

2279
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:53,118
we just want to watch what it does when

2280
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:55,359
it passes through the wall boundary

2281
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:58,319
so in order to do that it's a little

2282
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:58,319
tough like

2283
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,840
um

2284
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,079
it's a little bit tough to figure out

2285
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:16,079
what i really

2286
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:20,479
want to have happen there exactly

2287
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:20,479
so um

2288
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,760
i guess what i would do is i just say

2289
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:29,359
look

2290
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:32,480
there's gonna be a button

2291
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:34,960
um that does the single step

2292
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:34,959
latch

2293
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,840
uh and

2294
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:45,840
when it triggers uh

2295
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,280
we set it

2296
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,238
right

2297
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:59,839
that is like so freaking annoying um

2298
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:05,118
and i guess we're we're only going to do

2299
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,800
like one step so

2300
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:08,158
uh so we'll have a little thing that

2301
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,199
like we can trigger

2302
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:13,359
and then when we do uh move entity

2303
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:14,879
like maybe this gets passed into the sim

2304
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:15,920
region where we can look at the fact

2305
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,279
that we're doing that because that's the

2306
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,399
reason i say it's kind of a little bit

2307
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:20,800
annoying

2308
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:22,319
is because you know really i probably

2309
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,639
should put it more in like a

2310
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:25,519
in a purely debug state so you're just

2311
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:28,400
looking at the

2312
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,440
like a debug value but like i said the

2313
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,839
debug system

2314
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:33,198
kind of sucks so i'm just avoiding using

2315
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,560
it you know i'm not going to go like

2316
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:36,799
actually try to make it good

2317
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,800
now

2318
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,840
so when we're in here and we do that

2319
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:43,839
step latch what i want to be able to do

2320
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,679
is just kind of like click to move and

2321
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,199
so what we want to do is have a thing

2322
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:48,079
that essentially like you know does all

2323
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:49,198
this work

2324
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:50,960
and you can see that we're going to do

2325
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:51,439
refined voxel placement here and what i

2326
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,840
want

2327
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:54,719
is now just a way to say like new

2328
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,360
placement

2329
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,158
right is here and i say entity p equals

2330
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:01,439
new p

2331
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:05,279
right uh and what i want to do is say

2332
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:05,279
if uh

2333
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:08,638
you know we should do it then do it if

2334
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,079
not then don't

2335
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:16,960
right and so the way to look at this is

2336
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:16,960
uh you know if we're single stepping

2337
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,760
i i mean the right way to do this is

2338
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:27,520
like let's just say the sim region

2339
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:31,440
has a like uh uh prevent movement

2340
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:33,600
right and we just look to say

2341
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:36,319
look if the prevent movement thing is

2342
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:38,719
set then we just we just don't move

2343
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:40,079
the entity uh with the collision

2344
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,960
detector

2345
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:43,679
um and so the sim region then i thought

2346
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,960
like did this

2347
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:48,399
not get fixed what am i missing

2348
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,639
i thought this was supposed to be fixed

2349
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:52,319
that you could look

2350
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,159
i don't know i have to ask ryan about

2351
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:56,238
that i thought it wasn't supposed to be

2352
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:56,638
doing that anymore like nobody wants to

2353
01:40:56,238 --> 01:40:59,759
see

2354
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:01,359
forward declaration jump points um but

2355
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,719
i'm not sure why it's still showing them

2356
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:03,759
because i thought that got fixed but i

2357
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:06,480
guess it didn't

2358
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,239
not sure what's going on there anyway so

2359
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:09,599
you know if you imagine we just stick a

2360
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:11,919
debug thing

2361
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:15,280
in here that shouldn't actually be there

2362
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,279
but you know it's there now

2363
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:22,480
uh then what we do is in the world mode

2364
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:22,479
update uh

2365
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:30,079
here we just say look if

2366
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,760
we if this was latched right

2367
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:33,760
then the sim regions debug current

2368
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,719
movement should be set to true

2369
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,360
right so we'll prevent it um so we just

2370
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,439
say

2371
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:41,439
all right looking at the world mode and

2372
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:43,599
we can also set the step latch

2373
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:46,238
to false we can say looking at the world

2374
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:49,280
mode if we're single stepping

2375
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:50,559
right um well if we're not single

2376
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:53,840
stepping

2377
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:58,239
uh and then uh that

2378
01:41:53,840 --> 01:42:01,840
would be true to prevent movement uh and

2379
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,839
the step latch is not set

2380
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,440
because every time we set the step latch

2381
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:08,079
we do want it to to do it right so

2382
01:42:05,439 --> 01:42:09,519
if this were true we want this to also

2383
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:12,238
um

2384
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,239
uh have to be

2385
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:19,679
we want them both to be false right

2386
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:19,679
if they're

2387
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,000
if single stepping is true it should

2388
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,198
prevent movement so

2389
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,399
that's right single step turns on you

2390
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:33,839
prevent movement

2391
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:36,000
and the step latch should be false

2392
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,360
because if that's true then you

2393
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,039
should allow the movement because just

2394
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:41,118
that one time

2395
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:43,359
um and so when we create the sim region

2396
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:47,359
here uh

2397
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:50,559
you can you can see us doing a begin sim

2398
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:53,599
right and

2399
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:55,520
when this thing creates the sim region

2400
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,039
which it looks like it does here uh we

2401
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,119
want to just

2402
01:42:57,039 --> 01:43:00,399
like right before we do our simulate

2403
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:03,439
call

2404
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:04,719
i just want to do like a world sim sim

2405
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:08,000
region

2406
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:11,198
uh set that debug

2407
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:14,238
that piece of debug information there um

2408
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:16,719
correctly now when we create a sim

2409
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:16,718
region

2410
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:20,880
i don't really know how those are

2411
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:23,360
getting pushed right now so

2412
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,679
i might want to do a thing that's like

2413
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:29,039
check and begin sim

2414
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:31,118
here right and when we do begin world

2415
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:34,719
change

2416
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:39,118
um i just want this to probably

2417
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:42,800
initialize that value

2418
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:46,719
right um

2419
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,719
and i think that's fine

2420
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:54,639
because it see it's a no clear like most

2421
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:57,920
things get cleared but that one doesn't

2422
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:57,920
okay um

2423
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:06,000
so i don't know that's just the start

2424
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:10,000
so if you imagine turning on single

2425
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
stepping um

2426
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,079
so yeah i mean i guess it just kind of

2427
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:20,479
works right

2428
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:22,158
i mean there's a single step that's

2429
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:24,479
trying to take

2430
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:24,479
um

2431
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:35,839
how is it able to go that far

2432
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:35,840
though

2433
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:44,159
can it really travel that far does it

2434
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:44,158
really have that strong of a spring

2435
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:50,399
i guess so well

2436
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:51,039
anyway um so this does basically what i

2437
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:54,158
want right

2438
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:56,319
and i can step it uh and

2439
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:57,759
to a particular place and you know you

2440
01:44:56,319 --> 01:45:00,079
get the answer

2441
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:02,000
um it's not single stepping the game

2442
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:03,439
right so the game is producing totally

2443
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,800
new stuff every frame

2444
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:10,158
as it normally would but uh it just

2445
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:13,840
prevents any motion so we can look

2446
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:15,198
at you know it the glove like trying to

2447
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:19,279
get somewhere in particular

2448
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:19,279
or whatever is happening right

2449
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:25,840
um so i think if i now

2450
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,920
you know go ahead and push this you know

2451
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,039
i could push it into the wall and i

2452
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,520
should be able to

2453
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:32,079
to basically get a single step that goes

2454
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:36,080
in there

2455
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:39,118
right i mean i think um

2456
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:40,960
so if we turn single stepping on right

2457
01:45:39,118 --> 01:45:43,039
and i crank it through the wall like we

2458
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:46,639
can actually just watch it

2459
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:50,079
do that right um

2460
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:51,920
that's kind of cool so we actually

2461
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:55,679
should be able to look

2462
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:56,319
at that sort of thing pretty easily

2463
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,719
actually

2464
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:00,079
which is kind of nice and if we crank

2465
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:00,719
the time step up it can move even

2466
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:04,238
further

2467
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:07,520
right so we can kind of look and see

2468
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:09,759
what's going on here like even without

2469
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,520
doing any recording yet we can actually

2470
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:13,199
look at what happens when we push this

2471
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,480
thing through

2472
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:16,479
um and

2473
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:20,399
you know it it's just able to tunnel

2474
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,000
directly through that

2475
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:24,238
it's it's not doing any of the stuff

2476
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,800
that i think it's doing right

2477
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:27,439
which is what we would expect because we

2478
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,400
know

2479
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:32,559
that it doesn't work but it's we now

2480
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:35,839
have the ability to draw stuff

2481
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:38,560
that would show us uh you know hopefully

2482
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:41,840
why right like like how is it

2483
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:41,840
determining that

2484
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:46,319
so one thing i would like to do is draw

2485
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:50,638
those

2486
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:54,158
um you know so so maybe like

2487
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:57,840
this is not telling us very much we know

2488
01:46:54,158 --> 01:47:00,960
um you know

2489
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,319
we now know that the movement direction

2490
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:05,439
checking

2491
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:06,319
seems sane to a certain degree it was

2492
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:08,879
weird that it

2493
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:10,238
hopped on one of those so there are some

2494
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,279
things there that don't make a lot of

2495
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,718
sense

2496
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:16,238
um but uh we we can sort of look here

2497
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:19,279
and see like okay so

2498
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:22,718
what does this look like

2499
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:25,759
we can even look in side the wall

2500
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:26,399
like so what does this look like when we

2501
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,600
go through

2502
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:32,960
and you know what's

2503
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,280
really disturbing about that is it looks

2504
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,359
like

2505
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:36,880
it's just entirely based on which

2506
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:40,399
direction you were going

2507
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:43,840
it's like it doesn't matter uh

2508
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:46,000
at all what direction i mean

2509
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,039
what what the position in the world is

2510
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,639
it's just like what direction you're

2511
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:52,399
going determines

2512
01:47:48,639 --> 01:48:05,840
so like this occupied czech stuff here

2513
01:47:52,399 --> 01:48:05,839
must be really stupid um

2514
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,840
right

2515
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:27,440
like like this stuff must just be must

2516
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,440
just be dumb

2517
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,158
and

2518
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:37,840
so so like let's let's

2519
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:39,760
pretend like so we know right which way

2520
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:42,480
we're going

2521
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:45,199
in this test case right we're going in

2522
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:45,198
positive x

2523
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,960
so let's say i sub i turn everything

2524
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:51,679
else off

2525
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:53,198
right um and then i turn on the single

2526
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:55,600
stepping and i go and i look

2527
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:56,638
and like what happens you know what i

2528
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:00,400
mean

2529
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:03,600
so i turn the cell stack on and like

2530
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:05,439
hey that just kind of works

2531
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,199
right and let's suppose i cranked the

2532
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:09,279
time step up

2533
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:10,399
it still works or at least it looks like

2534
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:15,840
it does right

2535
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:15,839
let me see if i can go through there

2536
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:26,839
so like that's like rock solid and works

2537
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:30,159
exactly the way that i think it should

2538
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:33,520
right so what

2539
01:49:30,158 --> 01:49:36,559
now so like okay

2540
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:38,320
these are actually allowing

2541
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:41,360
things that are not the direction we're

2542
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:46,079
going are allowing me to kind of hop

2543
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:46,079
in through there is it this

2544
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:57,679
let's just here let's see

2545
01:49:54,479 --> 01:50:01,359
if the enabling the other

2546
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:03,679
side directional stuff so so we're just

2547
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:06,399
moving out of faces

2548
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:06,880
do those let me tunnel they don't yes

2549
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:11,039
they do

2550
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:13,039
no they do there it did right

2551
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:14,719
well you know what i don't know that we

2552
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:16,639
tested it fairly enough so so let me

2553
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:17,439
just play around with it with just this

2554
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:25,840
one on

2555
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:25,839
so only x motion

2556
01:50:46,158 --> 01:50:49,839
so no uh i don't know about that so

2557
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:53,039
let's turn these on

2558
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:55,520
uh one at a time so suppose i turn on

2559
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:56,158
y so now we're doing two dimensional

2560
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,599
motion

2561
01:50:56,158 --> 01:51:06,559
x y only out faces

2562
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:10,000
can we tunnel easily or not

2563
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:13,760
yes right so we were able to

2564
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,760
we need like a wireframe toggle

2565
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:17,439
if ever there was a need for a wireframe

2566
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:20,800
toggle

2567
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:24,479
it's now like where's the glove

2568
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:27,920
right um

2569
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:27,919
nobody knows where it went

2570
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:37,679
um

2571
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:42,159
so if just having

2572
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:44,560
just those two is enough to do it

2573
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:45,198
then that's great because i think well

2574
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,239
okay

2575
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:49,598
so let's try something else if i am is

2576
01:51:48,238 --> 01:51:52,238
it the fact that you have

2577
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:53,520
two of them right is it the fact that

2578
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:56,079
you're doing two of them

2579
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,719
or is it which one you're doing meaning

2580
01:51:56,079 --> 01:52:00,800
would y

2581
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:04,239
by itself be enough to cause the problem

2582
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:08,320
so so let's test that so here's just y

2583
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:11,519
motion right um and and let me see

2584
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:17,840
to what extent we can get

2585
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:17,840
stuck in things um here

2586
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,520
so it seems like it's like a problem

2587
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:27,119
with the fact that you can do

2588
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:29,280
uh other motions right like like

2589
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:31,839
that there's more than one it's more of

2590
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:31,840
the issue

2591
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:40,799
and part of it is like so if you're only

2592
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:42,000
ever allowed to move out of cells in

2593
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,840
that direction

2594
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,920
so you can you can basically already see

2595
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,840
there's a bug it's that

2596
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:50,639
which is the fact that you're allowed to

2597
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:53,520
move out of the cell that you're in

2598
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:56,319
in the positive direction right which

2599
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,320
makes some sense

2600
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:03,759
but we don't want to allow that right so

2601
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:07,359
so we do have a bug here right the bug

2602
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:11,039
is that the get uh when we put you

2603
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:14,639
into the box we need to clamp you

2604
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:16,639
to that box right um

2605
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:18,400
and we're not doing that so like get

2606
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:23,359
closest point

2607
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:23,359
in box is actually putting you

2608
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:31,279
into the next box because this right

2609
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,279
is what does that

2610
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:36,000
so that actually probably should be

2611
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:40,158
fixed

2612
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:43,840
separately um

2613
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:43,839
when we place the player

2614
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,118
we we really shouldn't allow you to do

2615
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,920
that

2616
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:54,479
so when we do this this needs to be

2617
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,719
clamped

2618
01:53:54,479 --> 01:53:58,079
in meaning like it has to be placed

2619
01:53:56,719 --> 01:54:00,000
epsilon back

2620
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:01,439
so that when you're you always want to

2621
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,679
be classified as

2622
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:05,039
being in the same cell that you were in

2623
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:08,639
when you started

2624
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:11,279
right um

2625
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,920
and so when we do this we want to

2626
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:15,279
basically

2627
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:18,399
shave off a little bit uh

2628
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:20,800
of the cell right we want you to have to

2629
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:20,799
start

2630
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:24,000
um

2631
01:54:22,158 --> 01:54:25,759
on the next frame we want you to start

2632
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,760
back in the cell that you were on and we

2633
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:31,920
don't ever want you to be able to hop

2634
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:33,599
into the next cell um

2635
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:36,158
just by virtue of the fact that you were

2636
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:39,440
placed all the way at the edge of

2637
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:40,000
one right so i do think that needs to be

2638
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:42,399
fixed

2639
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,639
as a separate issue so this get this

2640
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:49,279
part here where we do the from

2641
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:51,520
and the two when they're you know um

2642
01:54:49,279 --> 01:54:53,439
locked into the best cell what we need

2643
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,000
is this get closest point in box

2644
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:56,319
function

2645
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,599
we need a conservative version of it

2646
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:02,479
right

2647
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:02,480
so in here where we do um

2648
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:06,158
all of this stuff

2649
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:10,560
uh we need a conservative version of

2650
01:55:09,359 --> 01:55:14,639
this

2651
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:17,599
where any time we were uh doing

2652
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:18,719
the get closest point in box thing it

2653
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:22,400
really should do it

2654
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,399
conservatively right

2655
01:55:29,159 --> 01:55:33,679
[Music]

2656
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:37,520
um

2657
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:39,840
yeah uh so when we do get closest point

2658
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,880
in box conservative then what we want is

2659
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,920
we want to

2660
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:45,599
make it so that when we do the max right

2661
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:49,039
we're actually looking at like an

2662
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:49,039
epsilon off of the max

2663
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:01,439
um so we want to take that box and we

2664
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:06,158
want to basically

2665
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:06,158
like map you into it and and this is

2666
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,800
this is a little bit of an issue because

2667
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:15,839
we really want to be doing these tests

2668
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,840
the other way around

2669
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:29,840
so

2670
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:35,439
because numerically speaking we would

2671
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,800
like these all to be based off of like

2672
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:38,000
zero to one or something so we have a

2673
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,079
fixed domain

2674
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,760
that we're testing in and there's no

2675
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:44,319
reason for us not to do that

2676
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:46,079
it's just sloppiness so i think we

2677
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:49,118
should do this now we're

2678
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:52,319
we can cheese this we would be saved

2679
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:55,679
here we could easily cheese this

2680
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:57,439
and the reason that for that is because

2681
01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:01,039
uh

2682
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:01,519
cheesing it here the fact that the whole

2683
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:04,000
engine

2684
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,960
is built around localized regions means

2685
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,960
that you can never

2686
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:11,359
have large v3s so we're always in

2687
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,399
a very small domain to begin with so if

2688
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:16,158
we want to

2689
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:18,479
we can totally cheese this out here

2690
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:21,118
by just putting in an epsilon and this

2691
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:24,319
actually will probably work just fine

2692
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:28,799
you could just do this and it would work

2693
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:30,880
um but we can do it better than that

2694
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,079
we don't even have to cheese it quite

2695
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:36,159
that way

2696
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:39,920
um i don't think uh

2697
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:41,679
but but you know cheesy cheesiness here

2698
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:45,039
let's just put that in because i want to

2699
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:47,440
make sure we cheese properly yeah

2700
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:48,158
so now as you see it can't move it can

2701
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:50,238
only

2702
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:52,158
uh i can't move laterally it can only go

2703
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:52,479
inside the cell it's in and it can't get

2704
01:57:52,158 --> 01:57:54,799
out

2705
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:56,000
of that which is what i want and of

2706
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:59,199
course it can move

2707
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,960
forward and backward like so now i don't

2708
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:02,319
think that would have an effect on the

2709
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,760
bugs that we're seeing but before i

2710
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:05,198
continue to try and look for the bugs

2711
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,719
that we're seeing i do want to make sure

2712
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:07,598
that didn't change the behavior in some

2713
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:09,520
material way

2714
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:10,800
so let me just make sure that even with

2715
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,679
that in place we can still

2716
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:14,000
get into the bad situations because i

2717
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:15,760
mean

2718
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,359
i guess i don't know for sure that that

2719
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,000
wasn't a significant contributor to

2720
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:19,118
these bugs

2721
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,560
so i don't want to spend a bunch of time

2722
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:22,319
looking for something that i can't repro

2723
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:25,440
produce anymore thinking that i

2724
01:58:22,319 --> 01:58:25,439
can still reproduce it

2725
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:30,239
okay so actually that seems to have done

2726
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:31,118
a bit but not enough right so there you

2727
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:32,638
go so right

2728
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:34,000
so as i was saying like i wouldn't have

2729
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:34,960
thought that could have produced the bug

2730
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,639
and it

2731
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:38,158
or or at least it couldn't produce all

2732
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:39,118
the badness we were seeing and you can

2733
01:58:38,158 --> 01:58:41,759
see that we still

2734
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:44,158
uh can easily get stuck there uh let me

2735
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:47,679
see how easy it is to

2736
01:58:44,158 --> 01:58:49,839
reproduce that so it looks like if you

2737
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:52,000
are pushing in two directions at once

2738
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:55,760
you can reproduce it pretty easily

2739
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,800
um you just need to be in a reasonable

2740
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:00,719
location

2741
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:04,079
yeah see so let's see about

2742
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:06,079
what it looks like if we uh

2743
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:07,679
hold down those those single step

2744
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:10,399
directions uh

2745
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:11,599
like so i'm gonna go ahead and turn that

2746
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:14,839
on

2747
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:17,840
uh and let's just see what this looks

2748
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:17,840
like

2749
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,319
well unfortunately it looks like i need

2750
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,239
to put the glove in

2751
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:27,599
an even different position to get it to

2752
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:29,678
really happen i can't

2753
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:45,840
quite oh but like you know what this

2754
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:45,840
will probably do it right

2755
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:59,840
there's a good one do that again there

2756
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,840
we go

2757
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,280
that might be a bridge too far here

2758
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:16,800
it's like going way too far um

2759
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:18,399
yeah so i don't know i this this may be

2760
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,000
too difficult to do

2761
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:21,920
uh this way i may need to add a little

2762
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,800
bit more recording in here for this to

2763
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:27,840
work

2764
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,840
um well that was easy

2765
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:42,639
maybe i can just do it that way

2766
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,960
yeah i mean all i really had to do was

2767
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:48,880
hop

2768
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,880
and it got stuck in there right

2769
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:56,158
and again i just want to check again

2770
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:56,158
just to be sure

2771
02:00:56,399 --> 02:01:01,359
if i can only move in one direction does

2772
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,360
it still get stuck

2773
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:14,609
okay so this is even better so hopping

2774
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:15,679
gets me stuck right um

2775
02:01:14,609 --> 02:01:18,799
[Music]

2776
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:18,800
hopping gets me stuck

2777
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:22,960
although i guess that could argue just

2778
02:01:21,118 --> 02:01:24,000
because there's nothing else you can

2779
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,679
really do

2780
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:30,800
meaning in this case you're pushing

2781
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:33,359
two two things together

2782
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,719
that i guess there's not really any

2783
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:36,989
other option

2784
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:38,319
for it like that is just pushing

2785
02:01:36,989 --> 02:01:40,079
[Music]

2786
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:42,079
it's it's it's pushing from both sides

2787
02:01:40,079 --> 02:01:44,238
so maybe that you would argue there's

2788
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:47,198
really nothing it could have done there

2789
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:48,799
so that's probably not a good test and

2790
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:50,238
we don't care about that because if you

2791
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,400
push something into a wall it will come

2792
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:54,158
back out of the wall

2793
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:56,079
when we enable the ability of things to

2794
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:58,319
move out of walls right

2795
02:01:56,079 --> 02:01:59,519
um so we'll have to think about what we

2796
02:01:58,319 --> 02:02:01,679
want to do in that

2797
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,719
case but yeah like that's a problem

2798
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:07,520
because

2799
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:10,079
it's pretty easy i the the game

2800
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,440
does not stop you from pushing into

2801
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:13,118
something like that so you're

2802
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:14,799
technically allowed to just push it in

2803
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:18,399
that way right

2804
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:21,679
um so it's hard to say right

2805
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:23,359
uh so so i don't know so i don't really

2806
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:33,840
want to start with that case

2807
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:33,839
um but yeah like this part here

2808
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:41,599
it really does seem like in order to get

2809
02:02:39,039 --> 02:02:47,118
stuck yourself

2810
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:49,119
um it needs to have been

2811
02:02:47,118 --> 02:02:51,920
it needs to have the ability to move in

2812
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:51,920
two directions

2813
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:57,280
it just if you only have one it doesn't

2814
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:59,039
seem to do it

2815
02:02:57,279 --> 02:03:00,639
so i guess one other question i would

2816
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:02,960
have is then

2817
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:04,480
what if the one that you get is the

2818
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:07,039
ability to move in two directions at the

2819
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:07,039
same time

2820
02:03:08,158 --> 02:03:14,399
right can this one get stuck by itself

2821
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:16,879
or is it that you need two actual calls

2822
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:20,399
to update best

2823
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:21,279
right okay so being able to move through

2824
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:23,839
corners

2825
02:03:21,279 --> 02:03:24,960
is sufficient to enable allow you to do

2826
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,199
anything you want

2827
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,719
right look it just goes all the way

2828
02:03:27,198 --> 02:03:32,799
through there

2829
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:32,800
so that is great

2830
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:47,439
okay so according to this

2831
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:51,198
it's just legal to do that move

2832
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:52,879
right um and i guess well okay so

2833
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:57,839
that is actually true right it's it's

2834
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:57,840
allowed to go upward

2835
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:10,000
and i guess the thing i don't quite

2836
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:12,719
quite understand there is how is that

2837
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,399
closer to the thing you're trying to get

2838
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:16,719
to

2839
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:16,719
um

2840
02:04:18,479 --> 02:04:23,439
i mean i guess technically it is so i

2841
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:26,559
guess that's not wrong

2842
02:04:23,439 --> 02:04:28,000
um so all right but i need to get myself

2843
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:29,679
into a position where i can see this

2844
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,319
thing colliding

2845
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:33,118
so let's turn off single stepping real

2846
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:35,519
quick

2847
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:37,679
um and try to put myself in a position

2848
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:40,719
where we can see it hit the wall

2849
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:43,279
right the easiest way to do that might

2850
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:43,279
be here

2851
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:56,400
and if i now take a look that

2852
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:56,399
right

2853
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,639
and i'm gonna turn this time step up a

2854
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:07,840
bit

2855
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:07,840
so that just doesn't work

2856
02:05:09,039 --> 02:05:15,920
right and and for reasons i

2857
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:18,079
do not know right like like it's

2858
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,599
testing it's testing it should be

2859
02:05:18,078 --> 02:05:21,840
testing that corner

2860
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:23,760
right and when it gets to here that

2861
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:27,199
corner should be obstructed which means

2862
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,199
you shouldn't be able to move

2863
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:32,639
so fundamentally speaking that seems

2864
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:36,480
like our

2865
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:38,359
corner test is broken like this just

2866
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:41,459
isn't working um

2867
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:41,460
[Music]

2868
02:05:42,319 --> 02:05:46,639
great news because that's easier to

2869
02:05:45,198 --> 02:05:49,779
debug than something

2870
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:52,880
more complicated certainly um

2871
02:05:49,779 --> 02:05:52,880
[Music]

2872
02:05:53,520 --> 02:06:03,920
i guess but i can't say i know offhand

2873
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:07,839
uh why that would be

2874
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:10,719
so that's a little confusing but

2875
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:12,319
all right so if that's the case the

2876
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:15,439
first thing we probably want to do

2877
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:18,000
then is we want to draw like that

2878
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:20,319
placement right so we probably want to

2879
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,319
draw

2880
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:31,840
um

2881
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:36,639
do you have a way to draw points more

2882
02:06:34,319 --> 02:06:40,479
easily than what i'm doing

2883
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:44,319
by the way no

2884
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:47,598
all right um so what we want to do

2885
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:50,238
here is just draw those because i don't

2886
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:50,239
understand

2887
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:57,760
okay did you guys see this the entire

2888
02:06:57,039 --> 02:07:13,840
time

2889
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:13,840
and nobody mentioned it

2890
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:19,750
[Laughter]

2891
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:27,840
i like that sure we saw it

2892
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:37,279
all right you don't you don't get to

2893
02:07:34,078 --> 02:07:37,279
pretend you saw it

2894
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:40,799
did anyone mention that in the chat is

2895
02:07:40,078 --> 02:07:43,679
the thing

2896
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:47,199
like like if i scroll back am i gonna

2897
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:47,199
see anyone mention it

2898
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:50,238
or not

2899
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:56,078
okay all right so hey we need this

2900
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:59,039
entire thing to be filled out

2901
02:07:56,078 --> 02:07:59,439
and we stop the first time we find one

2902
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:01,920
that

2903
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:01,919
that's true

2904
02:08:03,039 --> 02:08:08,000
so that's obviously completely bogus

2905
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:10,239
because we need the entire

2906
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:12,960
eight set of eight to be filled out and

2907
02:08:10,238 --> 02:08:16,959
we're not doing that

2908
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:17,679
so obviously that's going to not work at

2909
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:18,590
all

2910
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:21,440
right um

2911
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:25,119
[Music]

2912
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:27,598
uh and and shockingly now it's

2913
02:08:25,118 --> 02:08:29,118
not able to get stuck using one

2914
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:30,719
direction of motion all right so let's

2915
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:32,559
turn on the other directions of motion

2916
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:36,000
and let's see

2917
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:39,760
um to

2918
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:43,279
you know to what extent

2919
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:45,280
that uh allows us to to prevent getting

2920
02:08:43,279 --> 02:08:47,279
stuck in geometry here i'm pushing

2921
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:51,840
against all the walls just to see

2922
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:51,840
um what's up here

2923
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,238
much more stable much more stable now

2924
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:05,840
so there's one

2925
02:09:08,238 --> 02:09:14,078
oh although it's not stuck

2926
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:17,039
uh it's actually in a correct location

2927
02:09:14,078 --> 02:09:19,599
it just got on top of things

2928
02:09:17,039 --> 02:09:20,800
and we have to work on the gliding like

2929
02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:24,000
uh

2930
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:26,800
code like we don't really have

2931
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,840
a lot of explanation for how we want the

2932
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:29,920
gliding to work

2933
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,880
so that's actually not stuck in geometry

2934
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:33,199
it just got

2935
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:34,960
on top of things and now there's it's

2936
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:37,519
it's asking to try and move into it and

2937
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:40,960
of course it can't

2938
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:42,400
all right um so i'd say that we're in a

2939
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,840
that's great like we've gotten to a

2940
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:47,839
pretty nice place actually

2941
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,840
um

2942
02:09:54,238 --> 02:09:59,519
much more stable um

2943
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,719
and really what we what we have now is

2944
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,520
the problem with edge

2945
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:06,000
with with getting stuck in places where

2946
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:07,679
it can't go where you're asking it to go

2947
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,439
and so first of all changing to a

2948
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:11,199
cylinder which i'd like to do

2949
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:12,479
will help a little bit with that but

2950
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:15,198
we're probably going to have to do

2951
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:16,158
more than just that um like we're

2952
02:10:15,198 --> 02:10:29,839
probably gonna have to do

2953
02:10:16,158 --> 02:10:29,839
more than just that work right

2954
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:38,159
uh because yeah we're gonna have to

2955
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:39,199
think about some just a bunch of

2956
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:39,679
different things because like for

2957
02:10:39,198 --> 02:10:42,158
example

2958
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:42,960
yeah moving up on top of stuff like that

2959
02:10:42,158 --> 02:10:44,960
that it can do

2960
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:46,000
and also moving underneath people we're

2961
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:47,359
going to think about what we want to do

2962
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,560
about those things but we're going to

2963
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:52,000
have to handle them right at some point

2964
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:54,560
and and figure out what we want to do

2965
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,359
there i mean maybe one answer is we

2966
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:58,239
we reduce the ability to move in z in

2967
02:10:57,359 --> 02:11:01,598
general

2968
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:05,919
you know um

2969
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:08,960
but i don't know uh so yeah

2970
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:10,960
i'm pretty happy with that um

2971
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:13,198
this is in pretty good shape now right

2972
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:16,800
that's like quite stable actually

2973
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:18,559
the collision detection part of it um

2974
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:19,920
it's actually surprisingly fast

2975
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:20,480
considering the fact that we are still

2976
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:23,520
testing

2977
02:11:20,479 --> 02:11:25,839
every entity every time on every corner

2978
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:27,760
and in the refinement it is nuts how

2979
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:29,039
fast computers are this should be dog

2980
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:31,520
slow

2981
02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:32,800
uh and it's actually not so yeah so i

2982
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,320
would say like gliding we have to

2983
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,760
improve and then we have to come up with

2984
02:11:34,319 --> 02:11:38,238
what we're gonna do

2985
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:38,960
i mean some of that is just the thing

2986
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:40,959
itself

2987
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:42,319
like we can improve the gliding behavior

2988
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,800
to be better

2989
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:45,599
um but the thing itself may have to be

2990
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:47,279
smarter

2991
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:49,039
right like it may have to do a little

2992
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:52,479
bit of path finding to get out of

2993
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:53,679
situations right um but i do think

2994
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:56,879
that's pretty stable

2995
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:57,199
though i'm not seeing it really able to

2996
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:01,599
get

2997
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:01,598
stuck into things at all uh

2998
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:05,840
and it's this is not a this is not a

2999
02:12:04,078 --> 02:12:07,118
complete test obviously but you know so

3000
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:08,880
you can see the only time we ever get

3001
02:12:07,118 --> 02:12:11,198
stuck is it gets on top of stuff

3002
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:12,719
and it's trying to move down and can't

3003
02:12:11,198 --> 02:12:14,238
and that's why i say the gliding

3004
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:15,449
behavior looks a bit

3005
02:12:14,238 --> 02:12:18,519
busted

3006
02:12:15,449 --> 02:12:18,519
[Music]

3007
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:21,839
right like

3008
02:12:24,719 --> 02:12:27,920
it seems like it almost gets it itself

3009
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,239
into a position

3010
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:31,920
where it it may be like so that there

3011
02:12:30,238 --> 02:12:33,598
may be some bugs in there where it's

3012
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:34,319
like gotten itself into a position where

3013
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:37,679
it's

3014
02:12:34,319 --> 02:12:39,359
it is sort of stuck meaning

3015
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:40,480
it should be it shouldn't really be able

3016
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:41,839
to place itself in a place where it

3017
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:44,718
couldn't move laterally

3018
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:46,000
and it somehow did that right um so

3019
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:47,840
there may still be some bugs in there

3020
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,039
that are directionality based like like

3021
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:50,639
you can move

3022
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:52,319
up into the position but not out of

3023
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:56,078
position downward

3024
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:56,078
um right

3025
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,279
so right

3026
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:05,119
all right we can take a couple questions

3027
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:07,118
real quick but but i think that's good

3028
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:08,479
for today like like we're in great shape

3029
02:13:07,118 --> 02:13:11,519
we've got more work to do but that's

3030
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:13,118
that's pretty good right

3031
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:14,639
can you still hop push glove into the

3032
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:16,559
wall i mean

3033
02:13:14,639 --> 02:13:18,400
yes you must be able to because there's

3034
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:23,280
no solution to that problem

3035
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:23,279
so you must be able to right

3036
02:13:29,439 --> 02:13:32,879
i guess i mean surprisingly no i can't

3037
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:35,520
but

3038
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,960
you sh the glove has nowhere to go right

3039
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:39,199
i'm smooshing it between

3040
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:40,960
two things that don't move right so it's

3041
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:43,519
two forced objects

3042
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:44,078
and it i guess it's good that it picks

3043
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:46,480
the one

3044
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:48,000
that's the movable one but that's

3045
02:13:46,479 --> 02:13:49,678
probably just an accident

3046
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,279
of the order in which the entities are

3047
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:54,319
evaluated or something so it's

3048
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:55,279
look right like i don't know that that's

3049
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:58,399
a

3050
02:13:55,279 --> 02:14:00,719
because the routine is smart um

3051
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:02,238
so so no it doesn't get stuck in the

3052
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:04,319
wall but

3053
02:14:02,238 --> 02:14:05,919
but i kind of feel like it could still

3054
02:14:04,319 --> 02:14:07,920
it probably just doesn't

3055
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:11,359
because it gets stuck it get it happens

3056
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:13,840
to get stuck in the person first

3057
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:13,839
um

3058
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:24,399
yeah i don't know it's better it's

3059
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,079
better behaved than i thought that would

3060
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:27,359
be because that's kind of a non

3061
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:29,759
that's a situation the collision

3062
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:33,759
detector alone can't solve

3063
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:34,800
um and and even when it gets so so you

3064
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:36,400
can see that like that's just the

3065
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:38,239
gliding behavior isn't great

3066
02:14:36,399 --> 02:14:39,598
because like we want that to roll off

3067
02:14:38,238 --> 02:14:41,519
the wall and

3068
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:42,880
the cylinder switching to a cylinder

3069
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:45,199
might help there but we also have to

3070
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:47,599
kind of have good rules for motion

3071
02:14:45,198 --> 02:14:48,960
um that that probably produce better

3072
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:55,840
outcomes there

3073
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:55,840
um because i

3074
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,800
i just feel like that should probably

3075
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:06,799
still be sliding and it's not

3076
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:11,920
um is the thing

3077
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:18,239
so it kind of feels like it's getting

3078
02:15:16,238 --> 02:15:22,319
itself into a position

3079
02:15:18,238 --> 02:15:23,839
where it it's not testing some

3080
02:15:22,319 --> 02:15:26,799
things that it should be testing or

3081
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:28,719
something like right it shouldn't be

3082
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:30,480
it should be in a place where if if you

3083
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:31,118
were able to put yourself there to begin

3084
02:15:30,479 --> 02:15:34,078
with

3085
02:15:31,118 --> 02:15:35,598
and this thing is is a horizontal

3086
02:15:34,078 --> 02:15:37,599
vertical surface

3087
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:39,360
you should be able to look at the voxels

3088
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:44,239
near nearby right

3089
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:44,238
um so so i feel like that part is broken

3090
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:50,320
uh and so so

3091
02:15:49,039 --> 02:15:52,238
i like to look at that because i think

3092
02:15:50,319 --> 02:16:05,840
that that's probably broken

3093
02:15:52,238 --> 02:16:05,839
and not doing what it should be doing um

3094
02:16:10,479 --> 02:16:13,279
shouldn't you also add epsilon to the

3095
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,679
min side of the conservative stuff i

3096
02:16:13,279 --> 02:16:17,279
don't

3097
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:18,639
think so i i i'm not willing to say yes

3098
02:16:17,279 --> 02:16:22,000
or no but

3099
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:24,239
um because boxes are

3100
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,118
considered to like start at their min

3101
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:28,000
and extend

3102
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:30,559
to like one minus you know their max

3103
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,560
effectively

3104
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:33,840
right

3105
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,679
let's let's see

3106
02:16:42,239 --> 02:16:45,519
so i guess yeah i mean

3107
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:51,040
you can see this being a bit busted

3108
02:16:48,638 --> 02:16:53,438
like it looks like these tests are the

3109
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:57,280
wrong way around

3110
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:59,439
like is in rectangle is doing it one way

3111
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:01,200
uh and rectangle's intersect is doing it

3112
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,760
the other way

3113
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:06,399
and so so this is probably just bad like

3114
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:09,519
this should not look like it looks

3115
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:13,199
um it should be that

3116
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:16,239
uh you have

3117
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:18,960
a one side greater than and one

3118
02:17:16,239 --> 02:17:20,959
equal to and one side less than and

3119
02:17:18,959 --> 02:17:24,879
that's not

3120
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:29,759
uh what's happening here

3121
02:17:24,879 --> 02:17:43,839
so you know

3122
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:43,840
i guess what i would say is

3123
02:17:54,840 --> 02:18:02,000
um

3124
02:17:57,200 --> 02:18:02,000
so you know uh

3125
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:11,839
i do think like that part of it needs to

3126
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:11,840
probably get cleaned up

3127
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,840
what kind of pathfinding would you use

3128
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:27,679
for the gloves return path

3129
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:27,679
um so i don't know

3130
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:34,719
i i don't know what we want to do there

3131
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:36,319
because moving the glove around is like

3132
02:18:34,718 --> 02:18:39,678
a gameplay element

3133
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:43,119
so my guess is we don't probably want

3134
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:44,638
pathfinding per se we might want it to

3135
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,439
be something that's more directly

3136
02:18:44,638 --> 02:18:47,920
controllable

3137
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:49,040
by the player so that they can so that

3138
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:50,799
it's like a job

3139
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:52,399
for you and also that you have more

3140
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:56,398
control over where it goes

3141
02:18:52,398 --> 02:18:56,398
so i'm not sure right

3142
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:01,679
would you differently for collision

3143
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:02,639
section in non-aabb geometry uh no that

3144
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:05,679
this doesn't

3145
02:19:02,638 --> 02:19:08,159
care at all about that

3146
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:10,239
this would work with any geometry at all

3147
02:19:08,159 --> 02:19:13,920
right

3148
02:19:10,239 --> 02:19:16,959
this this test can be any test you want

3149
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,960
for this collision detector

3150
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:24,639
so the answer is like nothing you do it

3151
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:24,638
exactly the same way

3152
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:29,040
i think the c model of programming is a

3153
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,559
bit time consuming in that we need to

3154
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,920
compile and look at the result and go

3155
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:32,558
back and forth fix the problem do you

3156
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:33,760
think

3157
02:19:32,558 --> 02:19:35,438
what would be better model programming

3158
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:37,040
and i also i don't mean the scripting

3159
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:39,280
language

3160
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,280
um

3161
02:19:42,799 --> 02:19:46,638
what do you mean do you just mean like

3162
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:55,040
to to visualize stuff better

3163
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:56,640
um because like hot code reloading

3164
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,160
helps with the fact that you don't have

3165
02:19:56,639 --> 02:20:00,159
to like you know i can

3166
02:19:58,159 --> 02:20:02,719
i can do stuff and watch it happen right

3167
02:20:00,159 --> 02:20:04,318
so if i'm in here and i'm like oh i want

3168
02:20:02,719 --> 02:20:06,318
you know it to draw something else i can

3169
02:20:04,318 --> 02:20:06,799
just go in here and draw that something

3170
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:10,639
else

3171
02:20:06,799 --> 02:20:12,639
right um which i don't know like suppose

3172
02:20:10,639 --> 02:20:15,119
we wanted to look at what the

3173
02:20:12,639 --> 02:20:16,639
target was i'm trying to think of what

3174
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,560
we should draw here

3175
02:20:16,639 --> 02:20:20,799
um but like if we want to draw something

3176
02:20:18,559 --> 02:20:23,359
like what what's the target

3177
02:20:20,799 --> 02:20:24,959
um that's the starting cell i could draw

3178
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:29,040
like a thing that's like

3179
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:32,318
you know um a uh

3180
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:35,840
you know uh a white thing at the

3181
02:20:32,318 --> 02:20:35,840
the position of

3182
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:45,840
the target so 2p

3183
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,840
and i don't know

3184
02:20:48,318 --> 02:20:52,159
um so i can start drawing the target

3185
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:53,760
right and i i've never closed the game

3186
02:20:52,159 --> 02:20:55,680
the game's still running so now i'm

3187
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:57,120
drawing the target right you can see it

3188
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:59,200
that's that little white dot moving

3189
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:01,359
around there and i could say like oh it

3190
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:03,200
needs to be bigger

3191
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:06,239
like i can't see it well enough i can

3192
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:06,240
just do that right

3193
02:21:06,318 --> 02:21:11,439
um and you know there it is

3194
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:13,120
you can see it right that's the target

3195
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:17,040
it's trying to get to

3196
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:18,800
um so you know like code reloading is

3197
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:20,880
a thing that helps with that but i don't

3198
02:21:18,799 --> 02:21:22,799
know what else you mean

3199
02:21:20,879 --> 02:21:24,318
uh in terms of like like i'm not sure

3200
02:21:22,799 --> 02:21:26,879
there are other things you might mean

3201
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:29,199
but i'm not sure what exactly they are

3202
02:21:26,879 --> 02:21:29,199
right

3203
02:21:34,559 --> 02:21:38,318
so you can see this is an example of

3204
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,640
being stuck

3205
02:21:38,318 --> 02:21:41,680
sort of and you can see that it's like

3206
02:21:40,639 --> 02:21:44,478
it's just

3207
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:45,120
it can't move itself around that corner

3208
02:21:44,478 --> 02:21:47,599
which again

3209
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:48,560
a changing to cylinders which we want to

3210
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:52,840
do

3211
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:55,840
or spheres um would help

3212
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:55,840
right

3213
02:21:56,559 --> 02:21:59,760
would it have been worth it to make a

3214
02:21:58,159 --> 02:22:00,318
visualization code before actually

3215
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:02,559
writing it

3216
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:02,559
um

3217
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:10,720
so i guess what i would say is in a in a

3218
02:22:10,159 --> 02:22:13,520
world

3219
02:22:10,719 --> 02:22:15,438
where you were you know not just

3220
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:17,280
programming on stream

3221
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:18,800
usually what you do is you build a

3222
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:20,399
little visualization system

3223
02:22:18,799 --> 02:22:22,159
that's just designed to be quick and

3224
02:22:20,398 --> 02:22:23,680
dirty that you can just use for

3225
02:22:22,159 --> 02:22:26,559
everything like you wouldn't

3226
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:28,398
just have for collision detection and

3227
02:22:26,559 --> 02:22:31,279
then you just kind of have that

3228
02:22:28,398 --> 02:22:34,840
and you just anytime you want you just

3229
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:37,760
draw some stuff into it and it works

3230
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:41,200
right um

3231
02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:44,478
so so i would say like uh

3232
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:46,319
i i don't know like that you need to

3233
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:48,000
think about it as like should i write a

3234
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:49,519
thing for visualizing section before

3235
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,680
collision deduction or not it's more

3236
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:53,439
just like look just

3237
02:22:51,680 --> 02:22:55,520
you should just generally have a little

3238
02:22:53,439 --> 02:22:59,200
visualizer thing in there to begin with

3239
02:22:55,520 --> 02:23:05,840
you know what i mean um

3240
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:05,840
so you know

3241
02:23:11,359 --> 02:23:15,359
so the thing that's sort of wonky that i

3242
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:16,479
don't understand is it seems like it's

3243
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:19,200
able to get itself

3244
02:23:16,478 --> 02:23:20,799
into a position where it's sticking

3245
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:24,880
right

3246
02:23:20,799 --> 02:23:28,318
um and can't glide

3247
02:23:24,879 --> 02:23:32,719
like even though what's in there now

3248
02:23:28,318 --> 02:23:33,519
should be able to glide so that's a

3249
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:37,840
little

3250
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:47,840
weird um

3251
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:47,840
right like

3252
02:24:02,159 --> 02:24:05,840
like it still just looks like it's doing

3253
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:10,239
something fundamentally odd

3254
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:10,239
right like if i if i go like that

3255
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:17,920
it's saying i can't place in any of

3256
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:17,920
those cells like all those cells are red

3257
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:33,680
oh yes they are

3258
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:43,840
wait a minute so

3259
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:43,840
really um

3260
02:24:44,318 --> 02:24:49,039
you know what if we did the more

3261
02:24:46,959 --> 02:24:51,679
permissive version of this like how bad

3262
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:51,680
would that be

3263
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:55,680
so the permissive version of this is if

3264
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:58,159
any if there was any way to move out

3265
02:24:55,680 --> 02:25:00,398
that side of the cell you do

3266
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:00,398
right

3267
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:05,760
um and and i don't know how bad that

3268
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:11,200
gets

3269
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:13,600
but we could certainly look right um

3270
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:15,920
and you can see how it glides now right

3271
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,920
um

3272
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:21,760
so that might be the more correct way to

3273
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:23,600
do it um

3274
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:25,439
right because now it can glide all over

3275
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:26,960
the place you can see it gliding much

3276
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:28,800
nicer which is kind of what i wanted

3277
02:25:26,959 --> 02:25:30,799
originally

3278
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:32,799
so yeah we may have switched to the

3279
02:25:30,799 --> 02:25:36,239
conservative version of that

3280
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:36,239
before but

3281
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:40,399
and it still doesn't quite work like you

3282
02:25:38,478 --> 02:25:40,959
can see it gets stuck underneath the

3283
02:25:40,398 --> 02:25:44,239
player

3284
02:25:40,959 --> 02:25:45,679
there uh you know you couldn't it was

3285
02:25:44,239 --> 02:25:47,199
kind of a random occurrence but

3286
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:50,000
let's see if i could make it happen

3287
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:50,000
again there there we go

3288
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:55,920
um so you can see like well although

3289
02:25:54,639 --> 02:25:58,879
that's probably just because the player

3290
02:25:55,920 --> 02:26:01,920
is moving on to it

3291
02:25:58,879 --> 02:26:03,519
right and we don't push you back out so

3292
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,280
that's actually fine

3293
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:06,960
uh we're gonna we're gonna solve that

3294
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:09,760
when we go ahead and do the like

3295
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:10,318
what do you do if you find yourself in

3296
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:11,920
like

3297
02:26:10,318 --> 02:26:13,760
if you find that somebody has moved on

3298
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:15,840
top of you that's that's not

3299
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:17,200
subject to physical motion so that's

3300
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:21,280
actually fine

3301
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:23,920
um but yeah that's really smooth now

3302
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:24,960
like like that that glides really nicely

3303
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:26,879
actually

3304
02:26:24,959 --> 02:26:28,799
uh you could see it you saw it around

3305
02:26:26,879 --> 02:26:32,079
that corner and that's

3306
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:32,079
without being a cylinder

3307
02:26:32,639 --> 02:26:37,039
um so that's that's pretty great

3308
02:26:34,639 --> 02:26:37,039
actually

3309
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:44,640
that's really nice and smooth so yeah

3310
02:26:42,318 --> 02:26:46,879
very good a little too smooth it glided

3311
02:26:44,639 --> 02:26:48,318
up all the way over the top

3312
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:49,599
what we're gonna do about getting out of

3313
02:26:48,318 --> 02:26:52,079
the top i don't know we might have to

3314
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,239
put in like collision volumes to cap

3315
02:26:52,079 --> 02:26:55,600
because you know the rules of the

3316
02:26:54,239 --> 02:26:56,799
collision are you can just go straight

3317
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:58,318
over the top of those things

3318
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:00,000
and you don't really want the glove to

3319
02:26:58,318 --> 02:27:01,359
be able to do that because it's they're

3320
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,359
sort of more of a cutaway so you

3321
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:06,640
probably have to put a ceiling

3322
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:10,479
at least collision ceiling

3323
02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:10,478
that's not visible but there

3324
02:27:10,879 --> 02:27:17,839
but looking really good um

3325
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,560
so far right

3326
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:31,840
that looks stuck that looks stucky

3327
02:27:26,318 --> 02:27:31,840
what's wrong with that

3328
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:38,559
so yeah we i don't know one of the

3329
02:27:36,398 --> 02:27:41,760
problems is because we

3330
02:27:38,559 --> 02:27:42,318
don't currently like you know when like

3331
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:44,880
i said

3332
02:27:42,318 --> 02:27:46,398
we can push you the the thing can push

3333
02:27:44,879 --> 02:27:48,719
you into something

3334
02:27:46,398 --> 02:27:50,318
um and we don't have the code in yet for

3335
02:27:48,719 --> 02:27:51,840
doing the escaping which is what we

3336
02:27:50,318 --> 02:27:54,079
should do next time

3337
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:56,000
uh which is if you get interpenetrated

3338
02:27:54,079 --> 02:28:00,398
if if you're stuck in something

3339
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:00,398
what what allows you to get out right

3340
02:28:00,959 --> 02:28:12,478
and so uh that's the next step which is

3341
02:28:04,398 --> 02:28:15,840
you know

3342
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:15,840
and we'll see because i don't know

3343
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:27,840
right

3344
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:33,039
so uh i shouldn't have said cylinders

3345
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:34,159
because honestly we probably just want

3346
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:36,560
spheres

3347
02:28:34,159 --> 02:28:37,920
because everything so things in this

3348
02:28:36,559 --> 02:28:41,119
game

3349
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:42,318
that move around like walking they hop

3350
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:44,800
and they don't use the collision

3351
02:28:42,318 --> 02:28:48,559
detector they're just only allowed to go

3352
02:28:44,799 --> 02:28:48,559
on squares or not go on squares

3353
02:28:48,639 --> 02:28:53,680
so what we probably need to do is

3354
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:56,159
for floating things it's probably just a

3355
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:58,398
sphere is better

3356
02:28:56,159 --> 02:28:58,398
so

3357
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:03,200
couldn't you simply clamp to x y what

3358
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:04,239
does having z axis movement on the glove

3359
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:06,159
in this problem space

3360
02:29:04,239 --> 02:29:07,280
accomplished well i mean you just saw it

3361
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:10,719
right

3362
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:13,600
in this game you know you you hop around

3363
02:29:10,719 --> 02:29:14,959
and eventually you know you get to

3364
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:18,559
places

3365
02:29:14,959 --> 02:29:21,119
um where you can go like up and down

3366
02:29:18,559 --> 02:29:22,398
levels so the problem would be you know

3367
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:24,479
we're running the game

3368
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:26,000
and you get here you know and then you

3369
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:28,959
want to like hop

3370
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,000
down right you want to you want to do

3371
02:29:28,959 --> 02:29:33,039
that

3372
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:34,318
and the glove needs to know whether it

3373
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:36,560
can do that or not

3374
02:29:34,318 --> 02:29:37,519
right you you need some code path to

3375
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:40,159
handle it

3376
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:41,439
so we could like special case it or

3377
02:29:40,159 --> 02:29:43,920
something

3378
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:45,439
but we'd rather have the system if you

3379
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:46,239
can do that in the game we'd like to

3380
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:50,639
have the system

3381
02:29:46,239 --> 02:29:53,760
do like allow you to do that you know

3382
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:57,840
um so i think we need to handle 3d there

3383
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:57,840
you know whether we like it or not um

3384
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:03,760
uh and so you know i think we want to

3385
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:05,760
try and handle z as best we can

3386
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:07,200
and if we have to do some hacky stuff uh

3387
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:08,000
to make it work the way we think it

3388
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:10,720
should

3389
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,439
uh because it is still sort of a 2d ish

3390
02:30:10,719 --> 02:30:13,840
game

3391
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:14,559
we can but i'd rather make it work with

3392
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:18,960
z

3393
02:30:14,559 --> 02:30:20,719
uh you know to the center it can

3394
02:30:18,959 --> 02:30:22,639
i do need to make those guys collision

3395
02:30:20,719 --> 02:30:24,398
volumes lower because

3396
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:26,799
at the moment the glove can just go

3397
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:30,159
right underneath them if it wants to

3398
02:30:26,799 --> 02:30:30,159
right see that

3399
02:30:30,840 --> 02:30:33,840
um

3400
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:56,559
but and just to be clear like i don't

3401
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,680
think it's hard right we just all we

3402
02:30:56,559 --> 02:31:00,879
have to do is just add a collision

3403
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:02,559
volume for the ceiling that's it

3404
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:04,799
right and then you and then it won't go

3405
02:31:02,559 --> 02:31:05,439
so it's it's such a simple fix it

3406
02:31:04,799 --> 02:31:07,759
doesn't

3407
02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:09,200
really make any sense why we wouldn't

3408
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,159
just add

3409
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:13,200
a ceiling collision volume right

3410
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:17,359
collision volumes

3411
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:19,600
don't have to have visible geometry

3412
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:21,120
so it's literally free every time we're

3413
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:22,960
dropping down one of those cells it's

3414
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:24,000
like totally free for us to just slap a

3415
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:28,719
collision volume on

3416
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:31,920
on the top of the cell and it's done

3417
02:31:28,719 --> 02:31:33,599
right so it seems like that's

3418
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:35,520
the way you would do it because why

3419
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:35,920
would you bother adding like all of this

3420
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:37,920
like

3421
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:40,840
hacky special case code or something to

3422
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:42,960
deal with z when you can literally just

3423
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:44,880
like

3424
02:31:42,959 --> 02:31:46,559
slop that on top and plus you're going

3425
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:47,199
to need that for like the other floating

3426
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:51,119
entities

3427
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:53,120
you don't want them going like

3428
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:55,040
out through the ceiling either right so

3429
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:56,640
you're you're

3430
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:58,240
you're saying something about the world

3431
02:31:56,639 --> 02:31:59,039
that's actually true like the world

3432
02:31:58,239 --> 02:32:01,920
actually does

3433
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:03,200
have a blocker there right um so it's

3434
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:05,600
it's not like weird

3435
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:06,399
it's what is there technically there is

3436
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:12,159
a ceiling

3437
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:12,159
right um so

3438
02:32:12,239 --> 02:32:16,559
anyway all right pretty good work today

3439
02:32:14,879 --> 02:32:18,959
uh we're not quite

3440
02:32:16,559 --> 02:32:20,799
there yet to be sure we're gonna have to

3441
02:32:18,959 --> 02:32:22,719
do a lot more work but

3442
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:24,478
loads better than what we started with

3443
02:32:22,719 --> 02:32:25,920
right like the original cushion detector

3444
02:32:24,478 --> 02:32:28,239
was terrible this one's getting

3445
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:28,960
getting pretty respectable so i think

3446
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:32,719
we'll

3447
02:32:28,959 --> 02:32:34,159
uh be in good shape eventually all right

3448
02:32:32,719 --> 02:32:35,199
uh but let's wrap it up thank you

3449
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:36,318
everyone for joining me for the episode

3450
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,200
handmade hero it's been a pleasure

3451
02:32:36,318 --> 02:32:38,559
coding with you as

3452
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:40,479
always if you would like to follow along

3453
02:32:38,559 --> 02:32:43,039
with series at home you can always

3454
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:44,239
go to handmadehero.org and pre-order the

3455
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,080
game it comes with source code so you

3456
02:32:44,239 --> 02:32:48,318
can play around with it yourself

3457
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:49,439
uh if you would like to go ahead and do

3458
02:32:48,318 --> 02:32:52,719
the rest of

3459
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:55,120
the collision detection work you could

3460
02:32:52,719 --> 02:32:57,119
you could go beat me to it i won't be i

3461
02:32:55,120 --> 02:33:01,200
only programmed the two hours a week

3462
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:04,399
on this game so you've got all week

3463
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:07,439
uh to beat me to the punch

3464
02:33:04,398 --> 02:33:10,478
pun intended uh so if you're interested

3465
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:13,840
go for it that's it for today i

3466
02:33:10,478 --> 02:33:16,879
will be back here next weekend to

3467
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:18,478
uh there's a schedule but yeah it's

3468
02:33:16,879 --> 02:33:20,398
already i've been on there

3469
02:33:18,478 --> 02:33:22,000
um i will be back here next weekend

3470
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:23,039
where i will start to look at polishing

3471
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,559
that routine up

3472
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:26,560
it needs the ability to take

3473
02:33:24,559 --> 02:33:27,840
intersecting objects and separate them

3474
02:33:26,559 --> 02:33:29,680
that's the biggest thing that's missing

3475
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,439
right now so we'll take a look at that

3476
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:33,040
uh and then we'll probably add some more

3477
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:34,318
visualization stuff so we can

3478
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:35,680
make sure there aren't bugs in there

3479
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:37,279
maybe we'll switch to the spheres as

3480
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:38,880
well like a couple of those things

3481
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:40,159
so we have polish work to do we'll do

3482
02:33:38,879 --> 02:33:41,519
that and then we'll switch back to

3483
02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:42,478
gameplay code because at that point i

3484
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,520
think our collision texture will be

3485
02:33:42,478 --> 02:33:45,920
pretty solid

3486
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:47,680
um we don't have to completely bullet

3487
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:49,120
proof it yet

3488
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:51,200
but you know it'll be nice and solid and

3489
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:52,640
it won't be like ruining our

3490
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:53,840
attempts to like make gameplay code

3491
02:33:52,639 --> 02:33:54,398
because it's like screwing up or

3492
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:55,680
anything

3493
02:33:54,398 --> 02:33:57,439
so we can go back to gameplay code and

3494
02:33:55,680 --> 02:34:00,239
add some combat stuff in there

3495
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:00,559
um and we'll see how it goes uh that's

3496
02:34:00,239 --> 02:34:02,079
it

3497
02:34:00,559 --> 02:34:03,680
till till then have fun program

3498
02:34:02,079 --> 02:34:04,639
everybody and i'll see you on the

3499
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:08,000
internet

3500
02:34:04,639 --> 02:34:08,000
take it easy
