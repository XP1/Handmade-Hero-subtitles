00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:04,410
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:06,689
hero the show that we code a complete

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,940
game live on stream we took a week off

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,820
because I was fairly dejected after last

5
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:14,489
week's stream where not only did visual

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,528
studio break but n site also broke and

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,439
the installation of the drivers that

8
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:20,640
insight requested not only broke the

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,559
program we were trying to use but also

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,750
broke our old ability news insights so

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,348
everything was in complete shambles now

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,899
amusingly enough

13
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,899
not only have I had Microsoft contact me

14
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,780
back when I filled out that survey on

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,189
stream about what they could do to fix

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,480
Visual Studio I seriously doubt that

17
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,369
much will get fixed and Visual Studio

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,140
because it's not the first time

19
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:44,339
Microsoft has asked me and so I don't

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,370
think it'll be the first time that they

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,039
ignore me but this time around

22
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,169
Nvidia also contacted me about the

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,530
problems with insight they were very

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,370
nice about it and apologetic and they

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,660
asked me if I could try doing a couple

26
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:02,339
things because they weren't sure they

27
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,558
were understanding what was happening

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,478
they actually looked at the crash dumps

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:10,289
which is more than I can say for

30
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:12,569
Microsoft and they were saying that the

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,210
crash was occurring in a call to wiggle

32
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:18,599
get proc address and it was occurring

33
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:20,519
inside the old driver now this is very

34
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,949
unusual I don't really understand it

35
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:25,469
because it shouldn't be occurring inside

36
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,540
the old driver since we installed the

37
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,728
new one in the new one said it completed

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,560
but it raises the question about whether

39
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,609
their installer was messed up and maybe

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,500
something where it happened

41
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,969
so at the beginning of today's stream I

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,379
would like to do them the courtesy of

43
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,030
gathering some information for them

44
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,129
because in my opinion if someone is

45
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,140
willing to help get the development

46
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:46,228
environment working then I am more than

47
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,469
happy to help them and hope that they

48
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:50,640
can so I'm gonna go ahead and just take

49
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:53,429
a look at some of those things they

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,228
asked me to take a look at and see if we

51
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,500
can figure out any more information

52
00:01:55,228 --> 00:02:00,629
about what actually happened they

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,700
downloaded the source to handmade hero

54
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,859
and we're only able to reproduce it so

55
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,228
again like I said the nvidia team

56
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,628
definitely taking an interest and really

57
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:12,989
trying to fix things which i feel like

58
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,870
they should be commended for I really do

59
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,030
appreciate

60
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,400
that someone took the time to try and

61
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,419
figure out what was going wrong so let's

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,549
see if we can give them some information

63
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:24,539
to help here I'm gonna click on system

64
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:29,379
information here so I'm able to verify

65
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:31,598
at least as far as the control panel is

66
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:32,919
concerned that the driver version is in

67
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,869
fact the one that we thought was

68
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,030
installed so I'm not sure what's

69
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,579
happening on their ends or why they're

70
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,739
seeing that crash report reporting as

71
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:43,810
being in the old driver because it does

72
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,700
seem like the new driver at least is the

73
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,049
one that's happening here now one thing

74
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:49,119
that could have happened is maybe the

75
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,799
machine has rebooted since then maybe it

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,409
didn't take the first time maybe it took

77
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,299
now so maybe let me try running our

78
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:57,389
program again let's verify that it still

79
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,069
crashes send them another crash dump

80
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:01,899
hopefully that is at least a second

81
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:04,839
benchmark point and then they also said

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,219
installing the driver clean might help

83
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,628
maybe there was something that got left

84
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,859
on there they couldn't tell because

85
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:11,078
again they said they weren't really sure

86
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:13,989
why it was getting a report from the old

87
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:16,090
driver version because of course they

88
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:18,819
could see on stream that we installed

89
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,950
the new one so again I have no idea what

90
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:22,509
was going on there right so let's go

91
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,738
ahead and try hand-made here again this

92
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,370
is the thing we made for it now

93
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,189
presumably

94
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,889
if unless it was the case that the old

95
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:31,689
you know that there was a reboot or

96
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:35,620
something that that helped fix it in

97
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:37,750
this case what we should see is the same

98
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,669
crash again if we don't then it fixed

99
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:45,519
itself but no it's definitely crashing

100
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:48,579
let me go ahead and tag this here this

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,810
is a crash report with the Nvidia

102
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:58,389
control panel affirmatively confirming

103
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,680
that we are on 1903 90 101 I think that

104
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,060
was what it was what it was and we just

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,219
double check that don't want to

106
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,219
accidentally send them the wrong number

107
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:33,839
3:9 101 so hopefully they can take a

108
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,870
look at that and tell us what's going on

109
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,729
there I don't really know I don't know

110
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,340
if save meanie dump is something that's

111
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:47,100
worth doing here so I'm just gonna do it

112
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:55,500
and initial or let's say this is mini

113
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:57,689
dump zero zero right that way if they

114
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,699
need these mini dumps I don't know if

115
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,709
the send report sends the mini dump I

116
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,180
assume it does so I don't think we need

117
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,549
to save that but I don't know how their

118
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,490
crash reporting tool works so figure

119
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,370
better safe than sorry

120
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:14,250
all right so now that we know that

121
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,860
that's what's happening again we can try

122
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,170
just a couple simple things I'm going to

123
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,000
go ahead and reboot the system with a

124
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,009
clean install of the driver and we'll

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,168
see if that helps again I'm assuming

126
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,079
that it won't but we don't really know

127
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:30,299
right so let's go ahead and try that I

128
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:33,349
did when we installed it the first time

129
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,930
I did save just perhaps prophetically

130
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:39,120
the driver installation that we used so

131
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:44,280
if I double click on this here and we go

132
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,689
ahead and let it run here is the the 391

133
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,969
oh one driver just getting installed

134
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:50,310
fresh this time I'll do the exact same

135
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,050
install that I did but I will go ahead

136
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,240
and click on the clean install button

137
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,829
hopefully that will wipe everything else

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,110
off of the machine that might have been

139
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,629
on here that could still be causing some

140
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,550
kind of a weird old driver compat load

141
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:04,829
thing I don't really know how they were

142
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,230
getting a crash jump from 388 it seems

143
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:08,339
kind of unlikely but you know I don't

144
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,689
know how their system works so maybe

145
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,709
there's some explanation for that that I

146
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,709
can't fathom right

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:23,610
Coffee time there are very few things in

148
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:26,908
the world better than coffee I just like

149
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:32,158
to point that out one of the things that

150
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:33,750
I figured out kind of later in life I'll

151
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:36,060
a second let me make sure we check that

152
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,810
perform clean installation we don't need

153
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,579
any of this stuff so I think just those

154
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,930
two and clean installation that should

155
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:45,060
wipe everything and we should be left

156
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,949
with only a 391 driver and the HD audio

157
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:52,319
driver which we need for the streaming

158
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:54,870
setup and I go hit next and office

159
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,240
should go one of the things I noticed is

160
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:03,718
like coffee for me is sort of like it's

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,668
definitely like a psychoactive drug in a

162
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:11,519
sense I mean obviously it is for

163
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:16,528
everybody but the same sort of effects

164
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:18,448
that like ADHD people or whatever say

165
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:20,550
they get from like rid winter adderall

166
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,699
or things like this I totally get from

167
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,259
drinking just a little bit of coffee as

168
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,740
far as I can tell

169
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:32,310
so like the difference between me

170
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,860
drinking coffee once a day just like one

171
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,709
or two shots of espresso so like like a

172
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,110
hundred milligrams a hundred ish

173
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:44,028
milligrams of coffee let's of caffeine

174
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:48,150
let's say per day the difference in my

175
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:49,978
level of product on a concentrated task

176
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:55,728
is nuts

177
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:58,438
like it's just massively different I

178
00:07:55,728 --> 00:08:01,079
think I probably would have scored like

179
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:02,669
much higher on my SATs for example if I

180
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,139
had just drink and some drank some

181
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:09,028
coffee before taking them I it's kind of

182
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,218
funny like the difference is kind of

183
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:14,819
massive and it's generally because like

184
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:16,408
when I when I my brain kind of has two

185
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,629
modes and they're sort of controlled by

186
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:20,728
coffee like one is very whimsical and

187
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,169
imaginative and one is like can be more

188
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:24,538
concrete and focused on technical

189
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,218
details and coffee generally picks which

190
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,110
one of those I'm in or I should say

191
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:32,860
caffeine in this case I suppose

192
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,830
and so in a lot of cases wait did that

193
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:42,159
just kill me so this has killed my

194
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:44,980
monitor is off now my monitor it didn't

195
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,379
it only came back on the HDMI output

196
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,750
I suppose that's fine I will go ahead

197
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:50,860
and just use the other one but you're

198
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,200
gonna lose audio in a second so I'm

199
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,039
gonna stop talking because when this

200
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,040
closes the

201
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,518
you

202
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:07,590
hello can you hear me now

203
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:21,880
all right so um that was a clean install

204
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:24,670
in all possible ways like everything was

205
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,320
removed so it's about as clean as it

206
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:31,360
gets and so we now have an installation

207
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:33,909
it was running Microsoft basic display

208
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:39,789
driver before now it's running 3 9 101

209
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:42,250
right and I'm going to try to install

210
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:43,720
insight graphics which is this right

211
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,869
here

212
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,789
and this is the best we can do we can't

213
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:52,029
do anything better than this it's a

214
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:56,470
clean install we verify the driver

215
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:59,250
number and so if it crashes this time I

216
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,299
got nothing I don't know what's going on

217
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,990
because there's really nothing else we

218
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:07,769
can do beyond that I don't know what

219
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,769
this is right here

220
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,409
doesn't seem like I can get rid of it

221
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:19,730
Microsoft has decided that you cannot

222
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:19,730
unpin this from the taskbar

223
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,960
dear Microsoft maybe you're confused

224
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:35,219
about what unpin from tasks are means

225
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,140
Believe It or Not unpin from taskbar

226
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:44,038
doesn't mean leave it on the taskbar

227
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:47,159
just like it was before I love I love

228
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,298
this do you want to allow this app to

229
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:54,630
make changes to your device

230
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:56,908
9b 7 6 DMS I like of course the average

231
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,730
user is going to be well aware of the

232
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:03,450
security implications of Microsoft

233
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:05,278
asking them if 9 B 7 6 DMS I should be

234
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,890
given permission to make changes to the

235
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:10,769
device they just make me laugh so hard

236
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:15,120
with their ridiculous security security

237
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:17,278
stuff would you like to allow a program

238
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:21,889
you don't recognize to do something we

239
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:21,890
won't tell you what it is yes or no

240
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:29,189
Windows is such a pile all right so we

241
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:30,898
have now reinstalled insight graphics at

242
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:34,169
least in theory unfortunately the old

243
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:36,329
insight graphics thing is super confused

244
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:39,299
I don't know how we got I don't know

245
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:42,418
what's going on here I'm ok there we go

246
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:44,579
finally got it removed so hopefully now

247
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:47,070
we can use the existing insight graphics

248
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:51,839
thing I'm gonna go ahead and make our

249
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:54,509
drive as we normally do there's our

250
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,519
handmade hero directory so we're back in

251
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:59,879
business now I'm gonna go ahead and do

252
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,099
insight let's go ahead and launch the

253
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,630
insight graphics tool we'd probably have

254
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:05,069
to remake this oh no we don't so it

255
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,740
saved this in some place that the

256
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:11,730
uninstall didn't remove so I can load it

257
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:15,839
again let's launch it and see how we go

258
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:18,509
all right so we now have our insight

259
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,220
working which means that something did

260
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:25,619
in fact go wrong with their installer

261
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:28,409
they just don't know what I don't know

262
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:31,589
what to make of that necessarily since

263
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:34,020
obviously the it would be nice if it got

264
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:35,548
fixed but I suppose at this point they

265
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,918
don't necessarily have the information

266
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:39,129
they would need to fix it which I

267
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,470
suppose is a bit of an issue

268
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,990
but it does look like our insight is

269
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:47,890
working so that's good I'm not actually

270
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,210
100% sure what we will do with insight

271
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,590
here at the moment I don't think we have

272
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,380
an immediate use for it we just wanted

273
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:56,889
to install it and now it is installed so

274
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,740
that's good I assume that we can now do

275
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:08,400
all the things that we wanted to do with

276
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:12,089
I don't know what happened here we have

277
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,090
crashed or something

278
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:32,250
I'm not sure what's going on there so it

279
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:38,339
looks like maybe we can't exit properly

280
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:40,779
possibly that's not really a problem

281
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:43,269
like I don't really care if that's a bug

282
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:46,289
or whatever there may be something we're

283
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:48,700
doing on termination that's bad

284
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:49,869
or maybe something we're not doing we

285
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,240
were fussing with this a little bit

286
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:56,409
trying to working so it's entirely

287
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,059
possible that that we just need to fix

288
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,490
something that we're doing busted there

289
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:03,669
but it looks like we can run just fine

290
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:06,549
but yeah when I hit up Altaf or maybe

291
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,740
it's just breaking into this for some

292
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:12,069
reason like maybe it just stops on exit

293
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:15,579
by like maybe that's just what it does

294
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:17,559
you know I don't I don't really know cuz

295
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:21,279
we've never used this tool before maybe

296
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:23,379
that's expected right so if we take a

297
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,089
look in here it looks like it's pretty

298
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,160
good like it's got all our stuff so

299
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:29,709
that's nice right these are our shaders

300
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,300
that we define in code so it's it's gone

301
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,799
ahead and laid the map for us which is

302
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:36,279
kind of nice

303
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,259
that's pretty sweet we presumably can

304
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:41,049
analyze some part of the pipeline if we

305
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:42,670
stop and capture a frame so maybe let's

306
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:46,450
go ahead and do that I'm gonna go ahead

307
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:51,220
and run this again is there just a run

308
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:54,549
like a command to run I guess they call

309
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,710
it connect so if I go ahead and run it

310
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,710
here what is what is that

311
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,039
control shift see looks like what that

312
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,039
is

313
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:12,038
all right so if I hit ctrl shift C to

314
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,319
bring this up then I can hit launch

315
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:16,028
there should be like an automatic launch

316
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,519
I feel like but at least this is working

317
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:20,558
here in theory now if I just do capture

318
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,888
for live analysis presumably it will

319
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:26,980
capture a frame in the same way that it

320
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:29,408
used to with the plugin for visual

321
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,288
studio I don't actually know but we'll

322
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:39,070
see it's it seems like it's trying to

323
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:40,629
anyway it's working on it all right

324
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:42,398
and so it looks to me like this is

325
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,929
basically the same as the plug-in only

326
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,668
thankfully it's outside of Visual Studio

327
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,080
now which kind of makes it a lot easier

328
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,929
for us to use so I'm pretty happy about

329
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,609
that it also looks like maybe this is a

330
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,019
little bit better than the one we had

331
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:54,579
maybe because they've upgraded since

332
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:56,409
then or maybe we have using an old

333
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:57,730
version of plug-in I don't know but it

334
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,340
looks a little bit more full-featured

335
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,740
and having it full view is kind of nice

336
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:05,199
as well but this is kind of nice and you

337
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,329
can see here this is this is pretty

338
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,038
great actually you can see all of our

339
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:11,528
calls just in a big old stream which is

340
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,028
great and you can also see like I mean

341
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:14,919
you know we talked about this but you

342
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:16,569
can see remember I've said very many

343
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,580
times we kind of need to use a texture

344
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:20,109
we need to do some texture packing if

345
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:21,699
you want to be efficient you can see how

346
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:24,189
inefficient this is right you see all

347
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,899
these draw by and draw by and draw Brian

348
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,250
nonsense right like you don't want to do

349
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:32,349
that and you can see it happening right

350
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,638
here as a very simple example right so

351
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:35,918
it's kind of nice I mean let's say we

352
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:37,898
didn't know that you know like maybe we

353
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,250
just haven't thought it through or

354
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:40,778
whatever you know it's kind of again

355
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,190
it's just a nice thing to have utility

356
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:43,630
like this where you can just see it now

357
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,070
it's pretty obvious to you what you're

358
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,110
doing right you can just see this in be

359
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:48,460
like oh I didn't realize how many of

360
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:52,689
those you were issuing or something

361
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,009
right so again like you know we kind of

362
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,380
know some of the things that we're doing

363
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:58,148
wrong so maybe that's not as useful here

364
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,590
but you can imagine a lot of

365
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:01,028
circumstances where especially in more

366
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:02,980
complicated graphics pipelines you

367
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:04,240
wouldn't have known all the things that

368
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,710
you might have been doing wrong or weird

369
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,230
patterns that may have emerged so it's

370
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:10,690
kind of nice be able to look at them

371
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,548
that way as well so you can kind of see

372
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,009
here the frame we can scrub through it I

373
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:18,398
guess right and I don't know what it's

374
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:19,809
decided to color code these bars as it

375
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:22,289
looks like maybe when you stop

376
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:26,200
hitting 30 frames a second it gets read

377
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:30,990
uh but I'm not sure look I don't know

378
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,990
what green blue and red are does it say

379
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,039
not really so we've got some learning to

380
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:38,859
do here because we don't actually

381
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,879
necessarily know what these things are

382
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:44,679
again one nice thing about this too is

383
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:48,220
it looks like if we scroll through these

384
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,140
we can see what the frame would be so

385
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,049
that's pretty cool right like we can say

386
00:26:50,140 --> 00:27:01,150
oh let's go you know back here or

387
00:26:53,049 --> 00:27:03,579
something and it looks ups looks like we

388
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:08,460
can sort of pop through the draw calls

389
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:12,309
and see where we were drawing you know

390
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,900
which is pretty nice as well

391
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:15,279
blah blah blah and then this we're

392
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,720
pretty familiar with like we've seen

393
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,700
this before we kind of played with it

394
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,950
before but it looks like it's all there

395
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,150
from the previous one which is nice and

396
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,990
we can look at the different textures

397
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,990
and so on right

398
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,269
so here's a one of our buffers and so

399
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:40,309
this is probably one of our deaf people

400
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:41,720
buffers right and so again this I feel

401
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,609
like this is pretty cool this will let

402
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,269
us see a lot more about what we were

403
00:27:43,609 --> 00:27:50,750
trying to do there this looks like so

404
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:51,980
this is our third game's window and it

405
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,190
looks like we've got a bunch of options

406
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:58,610
here as well so in the game's window

407
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:02,390
itself it looks like we're able to do a

408
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:05,629
little bit of inspection here like if we

409
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:10,190
want to keep running like we do it looks

410
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:17,780
like we can stop at any time I'm not

411
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:20,720
sure what this allows us to do here know

412
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:24,369
what zoom does so that zoom looks like

413
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,370
let's take a look at the frame maybe I

414
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,509
can't quite tell it's not very

415
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:36,039
responsive in here so I'm not sure like

416
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:36,039
the cursor doesn't really seem to work

417
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:45,399
americo's I think maybe it was just

418
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:49,079
capturing maybe I don't really know yeah

419
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,079
because the cursor seems to work now oh

420
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:00,808
I see software cursor hardware cursor

421
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,720
so yeah this is pretty great right like

422
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:16,549
here's the start of the frame you can

423
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:19,039
see us like building it up right and now

424
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:21,159
we're building up the death feel and now

425
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,849
we're building up to the last depth peel

426
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:27,950
right and then we do our composite of

427
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:30,439
the depth peels and then we're drawing

428
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,390
those guys in there I don't know if we

429
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,080
can manipulate this in three dimensions

430
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:38,120
probably not I know maybe we can change

431
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,399
wireframe mode if you rent arced up

432
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:50,359
stencil texture and normalization

433
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:53,090
options export capture so I mean yeah

434
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:55,039
like I don't know we are neophytes at

435
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:56,779
the tool at the moment so I can't really

436
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,399
say much more about it but it sure looks

437
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:01,309
nice right I mean there's a lot of stuff

438
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,990
here that we could use and that's just a

439
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:04,730
really great when we go to fine start

440
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:08,329
you know cleaning up our graphics

441
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:10,120
pipeline which after the lighting pretty

442
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:12,109
much there's nothing else going into it

443
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,369
we may want to play with the particle

444
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:16,219
systems a little bit I think is the only

445
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:18,259
other thing that we might want to kind

446
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,220
of go back and revisit quickly because

447
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:23,420
we never really quite put much in there

448
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,120
you know this you can see why this would

449
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:29,210
be really handy right because it allows

450
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:31,159
us to really take a good close look at

451
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:32,809
what we're actually doing and it makes

452
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:36,800
it just a lot easier to see bugs or a

453
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:38,419
room for improvement as we go right and

454
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,250
it also kind of lets you see what like

455
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,350
those def peels look like so we don't

456
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,690
have to like put in lots of Moe's to

457
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:46,879
view them and again that's exactly what

458
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,200
you really want a debugger to do the

459
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
whole point of a debugger because you

460
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,410
could always debug without a debugger

461
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,299
but the whole point of the debugger is

462
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:55,310
to save you time by quickly giving you

463
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,109
access to information that would

464
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,899
otherwise cost you development time to

465
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,089
get right and so this is kind of nice

466
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,650
it's just a really fluid it's pretty

467
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:08,539
responsive after it captures the frame

468
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:10,550
as well so I would say good on NVIDIA so

469
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,769
it looks like the primary problem was

470
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:14,829
their installer must have some issues we

471
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:17,029
don't know what those issues are

472
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:19,669
fortunately I guess they won't haunt us

473
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,319
again for the time being because we can

474
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,910
just stay with this but yeah something's

475
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,529
up

476
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:27,850
with the install and we don't really

477
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:30,369
know what it is but point being where

478
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:36,029
we're now good to go I hopefully won't

479
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:38,500
need my little message board any further

480
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:40,178
but this is good if I pin this guy to

481
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,519
the taskbar now we should be able to go

482
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:45,600
ahead and get graphics debugging going

483
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,490
when we need it which I'm sure we will

484
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,169
in the near future all right

485
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,048
I'll save this mini dump in case they

486
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,759
want it but than that I think we're good

487
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:59,829
here okay

488
00:31:54,759 --> 00:32:01,660
so let's see Oh

489
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:04,449
internal static void is saying you have

490
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,009
to close it in insight so I guess that's

491
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:09,400
someone confirming the thing that I have

492
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:11,710
was hypothesizing about how you can't

493
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,120
close the program outside of insight

494
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,789
because when you close it it will hold

495
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,279
it open it looks like so that's probably

496
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:20,470
just so that you can close and inspect

497
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:23,889
sort of endgame stuff or something

498
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:26,048
similar to that all right

499
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,790
so someone was asking can you summarize

500
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:29,889
how the issue is fixed so basically

501
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:31,960
complete uninstall and reinstall of all

502
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,610
the Nvidia stuff is what fixed it but we

503
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,440
don't know exactly what it was that's

504
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:36,729
just what they were recommending so

505
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,490
there must have been some kind of a

506
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:46,870
cross crufty situation I don't know

507
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:49,870
exactly what it was so let's go ahead

508
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:53,159
and load up our handmade hero stuff now

509
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:53,159
that we've taken care of that

510
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:13,849
and I did that okay so back to our

511
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:18,140
regularly scheduled program non graphics

512
00:33:13,849 --> 00:33:20,689
to plugging addition so where we were at

513
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,130
is pretty simple we had done a bunch of

514
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,390
optimization work on the lighting and

515
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:27,260
honestly I think the lighting was

516
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:29,570
getting to a pretty nice place and what

517
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,400
we were trying to figure out was if we

518
00:33:29,569 --> 00:33:33,439
could get rid of cosine weighted

519
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,540
sampling in our system by just waiting

520
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,180
our samples proportional to the cosine

521
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:40,670
in the first place and this is just a

522
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,610
standard sampling technique that's used

523
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:48,350
pretty often and essentially what it

524
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:50,119
does is it prevents you from it prevents

525
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:52,129
you from using a lot of your sample

526
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,959
samples simply to get a known

527
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,470
distribution that you already are saying

528
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,840
are there one way to look at it would be

529
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:02,269
that we know that every term in our

530
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,250
summation of the inbound lighting for a

531
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:07,039
particular point e is multiplied by

532
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,648
cosine theta what that means is that if

533
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,469
we just blindly do random sampling of

534
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:13,909
say the Hemisphere and we look at that

535
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,349
Hemisphere and say okay

536
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,809
each one of the things that comes in is

537
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:18,440
getting multiplied by cosine theta

538
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:20,539
essentially what we're doing is we're

539
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:24,010
integrating two things we're integrating

540
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:27,610
cosine theta whose integral we just know

541
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:30,320
right we're treating cosine theta and

542
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:32,990
we're integrating the actual lighting

543
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,210
that's coming in right and so what we'd

544
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:37,789
rather do is take the cosine theta

545
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:39,260
integration out of the picture and just

546
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:40,969
say look we know that we're gonna

547
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,370
integrate cosine theta into this let's

548
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:46,969
just put the samples in a pattern that

549
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,648
already waits by cosine theta and that

550
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:50,989
way we don't have to take account of

551
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:52,639
that term and we should converge faster

552
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:54,889
on a good solution because we're

553
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,839
concentrating our samples in places that

554
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,549
will be highly weighted rather than

555
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,090
concentrating our samples in places

556
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,380
where they won't be highly weighted

557
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,720
which also just helps get a better

558
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,220
answer with less samples and so that's

559
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:09,019
what we're doing right now this what

560
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:10,469
we're actually seeing on the screen at

561
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:11,849
the moment in fact

562
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:14,279
if I go ahead and bring this up to full

563
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:18,119
screen what we're seeing on screen at

564
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,950
the moment is literally just the version

565
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,349
with no cosine waiting where we have

566
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:24,689
adjusted the samples to be sort of

567
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:26,250
cosine weighted but one of the things

568
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,858
that we noticed when we did this is we

569
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,358
got significantly more light than we

570
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:36,838
would have gotten when we were using the

571
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:38,759
system before we had had a sample that

572
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,170
was we had a version that was waiting by

573
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,140
cosign samples and was using a pure

574
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:46,470
random distribution and we didn't see

575
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:49,409
anything we didn't see equivalent

576
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:54,649
amounts of light and so I am a little

577
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:56,879
concerned about the accuracy of that and

578
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,619
whether or not we need to concentrate

579
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,140
our samples in the slightly different

580
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:03,269
ways or whether we've got some kind of a

581
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,309
problem in there where we're not quite

582
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:07,050
right unfortunately the number of

583
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:08,909
samples we're taking is so low that we

584
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,818
can't really count and converge in the

585
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:13,139
first place so it's not necessarily

586
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:15,539
clear to me that we're really doing

587
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,690
anything wrong so much as just being

588
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:20,909
inaccurate which we already knew was the

589
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,950
case because let's face it we're trying

590
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:24,719
to simulate lighting with not a whole

591
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:30,318
lot of samples and we know that that's

592
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:32,608
just not really strictly possible right

593
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:34,679
so what I'd like to do now is take a

594
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:37,529
look at how we can sort of wrap up the

595
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:39,750
lighting to be maybe to just finish up

596
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,190
with it and move on and the reason for

597
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,989
that is that it's starting to be pretty

598
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,450
good like I'm actually lighting the

599
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:48,809
liking the way the Lighting's working I

600
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:50,279
feel like a lot of what we have on the

601
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:52,199
screen right now just looks really cool

602
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,589
to me like I'm really liking the way

603
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,629
that it feels and it seems like you know

604
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:59,400
a system that's that's fairly reasonable

605
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,338
there's a couple of things we may want

606
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:06,809
to do to kind of get it maybe into a

607
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:07,889
more shippable state for example one of

608
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,929
the things that we're not doing right

609
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:12,960
now that we could do is we don't have a

610
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:15,029
light distribution prepass so for

611
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,389
example right now we only do gathering

612
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:20,099
right and the fact that we only do

613
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:22,318
gathering may cause certain

614
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,789
circumstances like in the case of these

615
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:25,829
tiny lights

616
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:28,199
that are on the little hoppers here may

617
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:29,519
cause those to get undersampled now it

618
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,989
doesn't really look like it's causing

619
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,340
much of a problem because it does look

620
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:36,089
like we're getting a lot of light coming

621
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,470
from those tiny lights so it might be

622
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,640
that we're just fine and we don't need

623
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:41,579
to worry about it but like for example

624
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,710
these walls I don't know how much light

625
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:44,489
they're really picking up from these

626
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,960
guys here

627
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:48,750
maybe compared to what they should be

628
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,360
picking up because again it's hard to

629
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:53,429
hit little lights with these rays and so

630
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,260
one thing that you could imagine is

631
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:58,199
putting a little bit of a bias into the

632
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,270
system where we do a pre pass on things

633
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,359
that we know are illumination sources

634
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:05,820
that we want to emphasize again it's

635
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,849
just straight-up cheating but it's

636
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:12,300
something that lets us ensure that

637
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:14,250
elements that we know are emitters get a

638
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,010
little more attention we can do that we

639
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,510
don't have to do that you know maybe we

640
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,070
want to just remain pure and just say

641
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,540
look that's not the goal of the system I

642
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:23,280
don't know so we can do stuff like that

643
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:24,690
another thing that we need to do is

644
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,190
think about the performance a little bit

645
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,050
we've gotten it to a pretty good place

646
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,179
but we can probably do a little bit more

647
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:31,800
there so cleaning that up and making

648
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:33,179
sure that's compact and then finally

649
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,640
they're really the biggest thing that I

650
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:37,500
think we really want to do is figure out

651
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:39,710
a way to make the interpolation of the

652
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,139
lighting be a little bit more coherent

653
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:46,230
and so what I'd like to do is when we do

654
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,909
our world-building for example we need

655
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,090
to be able to do something where we're

656
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:53,429
going to use intelligent neighborhoods

657
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:56,010
of samples to produce the final lighting

658
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:58,289
and so what I'd like to do there is we

659
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,990
want to start looking at how we're doing

660
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:04,050
our lighting interpolation and we want

661
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:06,329
to make our lighting interpolation be

662
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,890
more of a focus so you know previously

663
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:11,299
all the stuff we were working on for the

664
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:13,920
most part was entirely based on

665
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,850
computing the lighting at sample points

666
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,920
and that's what we've been working on

667
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:19,319
the whole time we haven't spent any time

668
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,320
working on how we interpolate the

669
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,660
lighting after we stopped trying the

670
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,580
voxel stuff we haven't really gone and

671
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:28,529
paid attention to that now that we have

672
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:29,969
a good way to sample the lighting so I

673
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:33,150
think that's what I want to move on to

674
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:35,039
now and so the the two main areas to

675
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,460
focus well first will do that so we'll

676
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,349
try to get a good and we'll get

677
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,409
final looking thing and then we'll just

678
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:42,970
move on to a few more performance

679
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:44,980
optimization work sorts of stuff to make

680
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:47,879
sure that we can run this in real time

681
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:51,460
reasonably and right now we don't really

682
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,410
do that I think we're a little

683
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,750
overweight because this is a fast system

684
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:58,949
and so if this system can't run it

685
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,880
handily then we're gonna have problems

686
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:02,529
because some people will want to run

687
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
handmade here on slower systems than

688
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,290
this one

689
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,980
even when handmade hero is finally out

690
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:11,800
you know this might be a example of a

691
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,630
system that's a medium specification but

692
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,720
it's still you know it's not fast enough

693
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:18,519
right it's got to be faster than this so

694
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,049
yeah that's what we've got to do but

695
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,670
other than that I'm really liking it I

696
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,980
mean I think the lighting I think we did

697
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,570
a good job we went into it not having

698
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,389
any idea how we would do lighting in

699
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,550
this world and I think we came a wave

700
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:32,469
with a pretty cool system that does

701
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,690
captures a lot of interesting effects I

702
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:37,868
mean I love what's going on here right

703
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:40,809
you get this kind of blue lighting from

704
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:43,809
from bouncing off the walls here and you

705
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:48,159
get some nice little red kick back there

706
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:52,989
which is a blue red kick back and like

707
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:54,399
as you move across you know if you watch

708
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:58,209
what happens here you can kind of see

709
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,070
the red kick back change it's just it's

710
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,990
really nice I mean it adds a lot of

711
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:04,838
character to the scene and health make

712
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:06,250
it feel more like a nighttime scene this

713
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,940
game is supposed to take place at night

714
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:13,358
and so a lot of kind of light and dark

715
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,730
kinds of contrasts I think it really

716
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,789
helps make you feel like you're part of

717
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,320
that situation so like I said I think I

718
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:22,480
think we've done a good job what I want

719
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,490
to focus on now I think is to ping pong

720
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,179
away from the actual letting computation

721
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:30,069
for a little bit we'll come back to it

722
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:32,588
to sort of finalize it but get back into

723
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,000
interpolation and you know another

724
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:35,650
reason we want to do that is because you

725
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,079
take a look here and you've got like say

726
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:41,019
these trees we have to light those as

727
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,059
well and again that doesn't change the

728
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:44,710
lighting equations at all it just means

729
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:47,858
we need some way of applying the

730
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:50,260
lighting like to our sprites and so on

731
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:53,110
and so there's a lot of stuff like that

732
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,910
we want to be able to do and and you

733
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,700
know we want to insert fake lighting

734
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:59,769
objects where the trees are for example

735
00:41:56,699 --> 00:42:00,879
that will catch light they're all that

736
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:03,369
sort of stuff

737
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,809
we want to be able to do and we really

738
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:07,000
just haven't thought that part through

739
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:08,829
because for the most part we've just

740
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,360
been working on the light simulation

741
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:12,639
part which admittedly is the hardest

742
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,650
part of the problem but now we Kurt sort

743
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:18,670
of have just the finicky part which is

744
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:21,519
the bookkeeping how do we go from our

745
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,900
scene to an understanding of where the

746
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,000
light needs to be collected and what the

747
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,760
occluders are and then from that

748
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,019
solution back map it back to how does

749
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,670
everything want to be interpolated so

750
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:36,280
since it's our first day back after kind

751
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,530
of a big upset there let's just take it

752
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,710
easy let's take a quick gander at our

753
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:44,860
OpenGL code we've got our shader here

754
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:45,940
which is the shader for the Z bias

755
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,760
program which is the program that

756
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,700
basically does everything for our basic

757
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,020
rendering and what you can see this is

758
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:55,569
the vertex shader what you can see here

759
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:58,690
is in the pixel shader is we have this

760
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:01,090
sunlight function and what the Sun line

761
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:03,760
function does is it reads in a light

762
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:06,340
count loops over the count of the lights

763
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,470
that it needs to sample and it

764
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,960
integrates them right it basically says

765
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:12,759
like okay well integrates the wrong word

766
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,420
that's the mathematical term I shouldn't

767
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:20,620
use that it blends them together based

768
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:23,769
on their distance so if I've got a few

769
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:25,150
different light sample points that are

770
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:27,579
being considered for this particular

771
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:30,250
surface what I'm doing is I'm reading in

772
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:32,259
each light sample point and then I am

773
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:35,920
saying okay that light sample point is

774
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,540
getting used in this way right and so

775
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,670
you can see here it's taking the

776
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:41,860
distance to the light sample point it's

777
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:45,730
using that distance as a way of

778
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,620
determining how it wants the light

779
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,990
sample to be computed so you can see

780
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:51,730
here for example it says all right I'm

781
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:55,059
gonna take the light distance X the

782
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:57,309
light distance Y those are both encoded

783
00:43:55,059 --> 00:44:00,009
in the FSR the light Direction X

784
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:02,070
electrician Y those are both encoded I'm

785
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,280
going to take the direction Z get that

786
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,750
once I have that I know which direction

787
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,019
coming from I already have the position

788
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:10,489
of the light it's in it's mentioned here

789
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:12,409
here I compute the distance from the

790
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:14,209
light to the place in the world that I

791
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:16,609
am rendering which allows me to know how

792
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:19,429
to wait those light fall offs and then

793
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:21,590
here I do the basically the fall off

794
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:25,339
with the normal so I can tell based on

795
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:28,160
the lighting direction that's being

796
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:30,079
specified here what my surface direction

797
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,690
is versus that gives me the other

798
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:38,179
fall-off term and then I combine those

799
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:40,309
together to get my final term right so

800
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:42,139
that's what we're doing here and there's

801
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:45,409
a lot of ways that we might want to

802
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:47,629
reconsider how this is working so what's

803
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:50,440
our main goal well our main goal is to

804
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:53,300
take a scattered set of lighting samples

805
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,760
that we are computing because we know we

806
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,960
can't compute the light at every pixel

807
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,750
because you saw how expensive it is to

808
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,039
complete the lighting in general so

809
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,610
we're trying to take a scattered set of

810
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:06,139
lighting samples and take those and

811
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:09,620
recombine them into something that

812
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,969
allows us to shade our scene now there

813
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:13,339
was a couple of ways that we could do

814
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,849
this but they all have their kind of

815
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,590
drawbacks

816
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:18,289
we started off trying a voxel based

817
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:21,350
scheme where everybody who wanted to do

818
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:23,059
lighting would look up into the voxel

819
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:27,289
and see what their lighting should have

820
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:29,900
been you know based on where they were

821
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:32,029
in the voxel grid I didn't love that

822
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,680
system because it really ended up making

823
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:38,600
the lighting be kind of to diffuse

824
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:40,599
almost and it creates problems where

825
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:45,400
you're trying to figure out kind of what

826
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:48,259
yeah it's just hard to figure out how to

827
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,170
make sense of such a sparse grid of

828
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:53,090
lighting data and by necessity a voxel

829
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,980
has to be pretty sparse three

830
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,559
dimensional data can't be very dense if

831
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,059
it is it rapidly overwhelms memory and

832
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:03,170
processing power because three

833
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:04,519
dimensions is a cubed problem right it

834
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,010
doesn't take a very high dimension

835
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:09,380
number for something cube to become

836
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,030
intractable quickly something squared is

837
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,940
pretty bad something cubed is even worse

838
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,850
and so that's why it seemed like that

839
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,079
would probably be a bad idea

840
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:20,869
so what we decided to go with instead

841
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:24,559
is a system whereby everybody in the

842
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:27,170
game kind of knows what lighting sample

843
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,610
points they're actually using and those

844
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:34,840
lighting sample points are kind of

845
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:37,039
inferred back so any given element knows

846
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,350
which lighting samples it should

847
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:42,320
consider when it's reconstructing its

848
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:44,779
lighting now this has positive and

849
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,220
negative aspects the positive aspects is

850
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,440
we can have complete control when we

851
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:51,939
create a scene to place lighting sample

852
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,530
points and then gather them for our

853
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:58,789
surfaces the problem that we'll have

854
00:46:54,530 --> 00:47:02,840
there is that we can't handle dynamic

855
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:04,130
entities as well as we might like to and

856
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,480
we're gonna have to figure out how we

857
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:09,800
want to account for that problem so

858
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:17,329
let's go to the blackboard for a minute

859
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:20,000
and see I could use some could use some

860
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:23,049
liquid holo second I want to see if

861
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,050
there's any liquid available

862
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:44,368
it turns out there is mm-hmm

863
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:49,639
I do have some sufficiently watered down

864
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:49,640
lemonade which will be perfect for this

865
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:58,729
sorry my throat was getting real dry too

866
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:06,688
much talking

867
00:47:58,728 --> 00:48:15,389
alright um bring up Milton here and this

868
00:48:06,688 --> 00:48:17,699
is going to be oh you know what we lost

869
00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:19,588
our little day number because we had to

870
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:29,358
reboot the system and it's not in the

871
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:29,358
startup sequence so let's try that again

872
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:47,179
mmm is it for 42 is it for free to me

873
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,179
blow bud no may blow what day is today

874
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:19,079
for Fright - for free - so essentially

875
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:25,619
what I'm talking about here is you know

876
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:28,019
we've got things like a wall and what I

877
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:30,240
would like to do is place sample points

878
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:34,699
on the wall in like this kind of a

879
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:38,699
fashion right so rather than placing

880
00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:41,489
four sample points per plate

881
00:49:38,699 --> 00:49:44,519
I would rather place to sample points

882
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:46,889
along the seam instead of two on either

883
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:49,170
side of the seam for each plate right

884
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:51,328
and then I would like these two sort of

885
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:57,180
interpolate together you know that

886
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:59,210
that'd be my my my preference now

887
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:06,629
there's a number of reasons why this

888
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:08,338
might be a problem but I think that

889
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,769
generally speaking if we create worlds

890
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,538
like and have the world's just kind of

891
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:16,048
work like this I think we'll get away

892
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:17,490
with it most of the time so I think what

893
00:50:16,048 --> 00:50:19,469
we can do is when we're creating our

894
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:21,568
stuff you know we know the game will

895
00:50:19,469 --> 00:50:24,239
know when it creates a continuous wall

896
00:50:21,568 --> 00:50:26,159
and it'll just place lighting points

897
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,939
along the wall you know like this if

898
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,469
this is top down right if I'm creating a

899
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,960
dungeon area like this sort of thing

900
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:35,879
right and it'll just know to place the

901
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:38,250
lighting points like this and then it'll

902
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,568
just you know assign this face to these

903
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:44,880
four this face to those four and so on

904
00:50:41,568 --> 00:50:46,920
so essentially what we want for all of

905
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,230
our scenery is the ability to share

906
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,880
these lighting points in that fashion

907
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:54,298
right I think that's what we basically

908
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,010
want to have happen and so what we want

909
00:50:54,298 --> 00:50:59,940
to do is tune our ability to specify

910
00:50:56,010 --> 00:51:00,930
levy points in that way now I think that

911
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,048
will work

912
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:05,909
it'll take a little bit of

913
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:12,179
finesse to make sure that we do it just

914
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:14,788
right so there it's you know there's a

915
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:16,920
little bit of finesse involved in making

916
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:18,449
that work efficiently I'm guessing what

917
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,429
we'll probably do because I don't think

918
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:22,829
we want to use a lot of indirection in

919
00:51:20,429 --> 00:51:25,380
the pixel shaders is we'll probably do a

920
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:28,559
forward copy pass so it actually

921
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:32,429
probably you know probably be more like

922
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:34,439
having these points be in an array where

923
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:38,338
there are four unique points and then

924
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:39,389
four more unique points so this plate is

925
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:40,889
reading from those and this place

926
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:42,208
reading from those and probably what

927
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:44,699
will happen is I'll just be one forward

928
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:47,759
pass at the before we start running the

929
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:52,170
scene that copies the result from save

930
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:54,539
these two and the you know the lighting

931
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:59,269
system will only compute two points and

932
00:51:54,539 --> 00:52:03,179
it'll broadcast those results out to the

933
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:05,659
more complete texture right so I think

934
00:52:03,179 --> 00:52:09,329
something like that will probably happen

935
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:13,139
to avoid using lots of indirection in

936
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:16,170
our shader which wouldn't probably be be

937
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:19,949
great so I think that part is pretty

938
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:21,838
reasonable so for our flat walls I don't

939
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:24,688
think we're gonna have a huge problem I

940
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:28,318
think we can make that work fairly

941
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:31,469
cleanly and we'll see how it goes

942
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:34,108
what is more troubling to me is the

943
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:38,130
individual elements running around in

944
00:52:34,108 --> 00:52:39,449
here so for example you know we've got a

945
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:44,640
couple different things we've got those

946
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:47,159
trees right that are in the game and

947
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:50,548
then we've got like the hero who's in

948
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:53,188
the game you know and so the question is

949
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:55,349
how do we light them appropriately you

950
00:52:53,188 --> 00:52:59,098
know how do we how do we deal with that

951
00:52:55,349 --> 00:53:01,170
and to my mind probably what we want to

952
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:03,630
do right we need to put an occluder in

953
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:07,170
so we need to put a synthetic one of our

954
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:10,048
light blockers in there and that's

955
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:14,159
probably gonna have one plate and one

956
00:53:10,048 --> 00:53:17,608
sample point you know per direction so I

957
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:29,368
probably be like six sample points and

958
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:33,630
six phases for occlusion right and yeah

959
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:36,900
so that'll be six sample points and six

960
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:41,400
phases for occlusion and those faces for

961
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,079
occlusion will just be there to make it

962
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,759
so that things get dimmer where people

963
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:45,809
are standing right which is what we want

964
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:47,789
to have happened right there they're

965
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:50,970
taking light out of the system at that

966
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:53,849
location and the thing that I want to

967
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:57,028
focus on then is so once we figure out

968
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:58,920
what's going on with that once we figure

969
00:53:57,028 --> 00:54:00,778
out what these lighting values are we

970
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,460
then need to write those lighting values

971
00:54:00,778 --> 00:54:05,190
into something that can be used to light

972
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,720
one of our sprites and so at first I

973
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,670
think probably what we'd want to do is

974
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:12,088
just light the sprite by using these

975
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:14,970
lighting values to just like maybe just

976
00:54:12,088 --> 00:54:17,909
pick this one and use it at first or you

977
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:21,238
know or average these together like this

978
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:22,710
one this one in this one or whatever and

979
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:24,778
then eventually if we ever have normal

980
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,338
maps for our sprites for example we

981
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:28,259
could use the normal map to figure out

982
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:30,358
which direction we're closest to and

983
00:54:28,259 --> 00:54:32,489
blend between them that way sort of use

984
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:37,048
this almost like a cube map with one

985
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:38,730
pixel per face right so that's probably

986
00:54:37,048 --> 00:54:40,199
what we'd want to do for those and the

987
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,460
only thing that worries me about that is

988
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:42,989
the number of them that we're gonna have

989
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:46,170
because it really increases our

990
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:50,249
occlusion level pretty dramatically and

991
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:51,690
you know yeah I mean I just I I don't

992
00:54:50,248 --> 00:54:53,568
know how problematic that's gonna be in

993
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,440
terms of proliferating and number of

994
00:54:53,568 --> 00:54:59,190
occluders that we actually have in the

995
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,710
system but the point I'm trying to get

996
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:05,039
to there is you as you can kind of see

997
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:07,528
there's two very different oops

998
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:09,690
as I drop that there's two very

999
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:11,338
different types of things going on there

1000
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:13,349
and we have to kind of think about how

1001
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:19,889
we want those to work now one of the

1002
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:20,670
things that's particularly sort of one

1003
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:22,889
of the things that's a little bit

1004
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,809
questionable there is you know do we

1005
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:28,618
actually want to do it that way or do we

1006
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:31,170
want a sparser method or a different

1007
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:33,150
method for lighting things because

1008
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,159
for example one thing we could do is say

1009
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:38,789
look we don't even consider movable

1010
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:40,318
objects at all in the system so we're

1011
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:42,329
shouldn't say movable objects we don't

1012
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,400
consider sprites in the system at all

1013
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:46,410
they just don't participate instead what

1014
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,559
we do is we use like the lights and

1015
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:52,409
letting points that are in the system at

1016
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:55,440
wherever they're near and we map them to

1017
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:57,598
those lighting points right so one

1018
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,349
example would be let's suppose that we

1019
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,818
took a rectangular area that represented

1020
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:05,338
the world here and we just have you know

1021
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:06,900
some trees around the outside like we do

1022
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:08,670
right now or whatever's going on and

1023
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,818
maybe there's a wall here in a wall here

1024
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:16,099
like we have and we scatter some

1025
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:18,568
lighting points around sort of the

1026
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:21,960
general vicinity and those letting

1027
00:56:18,568 --> 00:56:24,690
points just go into a spatial hierarchy

1028
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,818
that we pull from when we want to light

1029
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:29,608
a particular person we know where they

1030
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:31,529
are and we just grab the nearby lighting

1031
00:56:29,608 --> 00:56:36,358
points and assign those lighting points

1032
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:38,309
to them right

1033
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:40,230
so it's really just again another

1034
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:41,640
another form of broadcast it's saying

1035
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,400
look we're just gonna we're gonna

1036
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:47,159
compute a standard distribution of

1037
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:52,160
points for lighting throughout the scene

1038
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:56,219
and that's all you know we're gonna do

1039
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,659
and off we go so and that would work

1040
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:59,548
fine with the system as we have it now

1041
00:56:57,659 --> 00:57:02,969
because right now our system has the

1042
00:56:59,548 --> 00:57:05,338
concept of a gather and that gather

1043
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:08,608
doesn't have to be hemispherical we can

1044
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:10,710
have spherical gather so we can have

1045
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:12,358
points that are spherical gather points

1046
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,769
that are just strewn throughout the

1047
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:15,029
world that just gather what the lighting

1048
00:57:13,769 --> 00:57:19,440
is at that point and then you're done

1049
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:21,030
right and maybe that's a smarter way to

1050
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,039
do it because then we just have a fixed

1051
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:25,440
number of points strewn throughout the

1052
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:33,449
world and people hopping around in the

1053
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:36,119
world just get lit by those points again

1054
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:38,399
really don't know what the right way to

1055
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:42,150
do it is I'm just hypothesizing here

1056
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,700
some of the ways in which we could make

1057
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:46,950
this work and I think that that the

1058
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:52,019
justing thing the reason that that way

1059
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:54,809
may be useful is because it doesn't

1060
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:57,210
proliferate the number of things based

1061
00:57:54,809 --> 00:58:01,019
on how many entities are in the scene so

1062
00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:03,150
it's a fixed cost to do for any scene

1063
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:06,719
whether you've got a hundred entities in

1064
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:08,730
it or five entities in it and all your

1065
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,679
paying different is just the space

1066
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:12,300
you'll look up per entity to figure out

1067
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:15,029
what points are nearby which isn't a

1068
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:17,400
very hard thing to do by comparison to

1069
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,200
throwing more and more points and

1070
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:29,190
include errs into the system for every

1071
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:32,939
entity so I you know that's that's about

1072
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:35,670
all I can really say about that I don't

1073
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:37,889
have super strong feelings about it one

1074
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:40,500
way or the other it just sometimes it

1075
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:42,299
behooves you to pick algorithms which

1076
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,519
have a flat performance profile like

1077
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:47,010
that because then you know once you get

1078
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:49,889
them reasonable that's just the quality

1079
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:51,839
level and performance of the algorithm

1080
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:54,328
and you don't have to constantly be

1081
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:58,139
worrying about it limiting your game

1082
00:58:54,329 --> 00:59:00,420
because the game now can't add a hundred

1083
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:01,588
enemies to a scene because all of a

1084
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,019
sudden you know the lighting will roll

1085
00:59:01,588 --> 00:59:05,489
over and die even if the rest of the

1086
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:07,588
game systems would be just fine with a

1087
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:09,568
hundred entities hopping around you've

1088
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:11,608
introduced this really nasty dependency

1089
00:59:09,568 --> 00:59:14,940
on a really difficult problem that you

1090
00:59:11,608 --> 00:59:16,949
know you won't be able to improve so

1091
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,470
that to me sort of argues in a gameplay

1092
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:20,789
sense to avoid constricting what is

1093
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:22,799
possible in the game and what we might

1094
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:24,529
want to do there that does kind of

1095
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:28,200
suggest for that sort of loose network

1096
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:31,290
so I think you know putting all of that

1097
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:33,328
out out there on the table I think

1098
00:59:31,289 --> 00:59:38,338
probably the way that I would look at it

1099
00:59:33,329 --> 00:59:41,329
is very specifically to say oh you know

1100
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:41,328
what I just forgot to do by the way

1101
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:51,838
I don't know how to start the session

1102
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:55,318
again we're so far of our session

1103
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:58,949
alright well we'll just leave it for now

1104
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:03,298
I should have a thing that says like put

1105
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:09,328
the little the little blocker up just

1106
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:11,219
just do it so anyway you know I think

1107
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:12,780
that just to me says okay

1108
01:00:11,219 --> 01:00:14,759
based on our experience of letting so

1109
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,079
far we know it's hard we know that we

1110
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,150
have to do a lot of approximations we

1111
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,068
know that we can't throw in points ad

1112
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:21,809
infinitum we can definitely speed it up

1113
01:00:20,068 --> 01:00:23,338
a lot more than it is now but but there

1114
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:25,589
will be a limit to how much we can speed

1115
01:00:23,338 --> 01:00:28,139
it up and there also are quality

1116
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:30,659
implications potentially involved in any

1117
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:32,519
speed ups that we do so that to me says

1118
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:34,348
maybe what I want to do is try to do

1119
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:37,259
something where we just distribute out a

1120
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:38,760
network of points hemispherical points

1121
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,710
in spherical points potentially so we've

1122
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,030
got two different kinds of points and

1123
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:43,619
those points capture the lighting

1124
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:45,839
information with the system that we have

1125
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:49,500
currently and then we just do a

1126
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:54,210
distribution broadcast out to the lookup

1127
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:59,699
parts for every one of our elements in

1128
01:00:54,210 --> 01:01:01,949
the system and and off we go that's

1129
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:03,598
that's all I got that's all I got for

1130
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:06,028
you I don't know how you feel about it

1131
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,940
but that's that's what I'm thinking and

1132
01:01:06,028 --> 01:01:12,239
so I'm gonna go ahead and try that I

1133
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:15,179
think just let that be the first thing

1134
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:18,028
that we kind of work with and I think to

1135
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:20,129
a certain extent what that means is that

1136
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:22,289
we can really simplify the way that

1137
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:24,390
we're doing the lighting in the pixel

1138
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:25,950
shader right now because if you think

1139
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,989
about what that means we can probably

1140
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:31,759
make it so that the lighting kind of

1141
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:34,259
comes in in a much more coherent fashion

1142
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,180
where it doesn't have to do scattered

1143
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,799
interpolation which allow us to make our

1144
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:39,808
pixel shader much faster and possibly

1145
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,079
just path data at vertices and leave it

1146
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:42,869
at that

1147
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,880
right because as long as we interpolate

1148
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:47,880
the lighting information rather than the

1149
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:53,670
lighting solution across our triangles

1150
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:55,200
we should be okay from there so I'm just

1151
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:56,909
gonna hypothesize that all of the things

1152
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:57,689
that I just said are true even though we

1153
01:01:56,909 --> 01:01:59,609
have no real

1154
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:01,650
way of knowing whether they're true and

1155
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:03,539
that's how we're going to proceed to try

1156
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:06,420
and get down to a nice shippable

1157
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:09,150
lighting solution that we can use for

1158
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,680
our game and like I said I'm pretty

1159
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:14,150
happy with where we ended up with that

1160
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:15,869
it's kind of cool looking in my opinion

1161
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:17,700
and I think it's gonna be pretty

1162
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:19,829
interesting so what I'm talking about

1163
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:21,119
here is basically inside this sunlight

1164
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:23,329
function what I'm basically saying is

1165
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,679
let's stop doing all of this nonsense

1166
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:27,599
because it's just too complicated and

1167
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:28,799
it's gonna cost us a lot of time in our

1168
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,849
pixel shader and we really don't want to

1169
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,740
spend a lot of time on our pixel shader

1170
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:34,319
if at the end of the day we don't really

1171
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:36,000
use that information as much right so

1172
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,710
what I want to do instead is I want to

1173
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,750
focus on a way to get this to be more

1174
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:42,389
vertex based and so what I'm thinking

1175
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:44,849
curious will basically take our vertices

1176
01:02:42,389 --> 01:02:46,500
and we'll pass in along with our

1177
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:48,289
vertices will pass in the lighting

1178
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,960
information at the vertices because

1179
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:54,029
that's sort of how we're going to be

1180
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:57,179
screwing them about and like I was

1181
01:02:54,030 --> 01:03:00,300
saying we just don't have the ability at

1182
01:02:57,179 --> 01:03:03,029
this point to really generate dense

1183
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,560
enough lighting samples anyway to care

1184
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,200
about getting letting samples in the

1185
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:09,090
middle of triangles and stuff like that

1186
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,710
so what I'd rather do is is figure out a

1187
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:17,700
way to pass down something like that now

1188
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:20,220
granted one thing that is true is saying

1189
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:25,919
vertices is a little bit difficult

1190
01:03:20,219 --> 01:03:27,799
perhaps to process properly and the

1191
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,079
reason that I say that is just because

1192
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:36,210
well you know if you think about what's

1193
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:41,000
happening in this environment you know

1194
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:41,000
if I have two cubes next to each other

1195
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:50,309
say like this when I'm drawing these

1196
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:56,519
cubes the place where I want the

1197
01:03:50,309 --> 01:04:02,389
lighting samples is like here but the

1198
01:03:56,519 --> 01:04:02,389
vertices are actually here right

1199
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:08,980
so it puts us in sort of a difficult

1200
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:13,569
position because what it means is that

1201
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:15,789
these are not really vertices so part of

1202
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:19,240
the problem is we do sort of want to

1203
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:21,369
pass additional information so that we

1204
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:24,368
know how to do our interplant properly

1205
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:27,970
right uh and what we will end up with

1206
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:31,000
there I think is we just need to know

1207
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:33,069
for this face we just need to have some

1208
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,570
information about how we want to render

1209
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:39,130
it we still need to know the locations

1210
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:43,150
of these things that we're interpolating

1211
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:45,730
between and so that's kind of a it's not

1212
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:47,579
as simple as passing information at the

1213
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:51,670
vertices that's literally interpolated

1214
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:53,769
along the vertices so that may argue

1215
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:55,539
that we still want to pass it as part of

1216
01:04:53,769 --> 01:05:01,480
a texture that we look up in the pixel

1217
01:04:55,539 --> 01:05:04,599
shader it's hard to say right we could

1218
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:08,440
still pass it at the vertices but then

1219
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:11,469
use the additional information that's

1220
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,700
supplied as part of it to figure out how

1221
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:16,358
we actually want to do the interpolation

1222
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:18,549
or we can do an extrapolation where we

1223
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:21,099
just figure out what the values would

1224
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:22,750
have been at the vertices in order to

1225
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:25,210
produce the interpolated point that we

1226
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:27,400
have so for example if we know that we

1227
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:28,240
actually want the point to be here but

1228
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,340
we know we're going to be passing

1229
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:33,129
something here we can just take whatever

1230
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:34,570
value this was and take the inverse of

1231
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,400
the linear blend that would happen

1232
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:47,650
between these two to figure out what we

1233
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:49,570
should pass this as if we assume that we

1234
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:53,200
pass down full floating-point values

1235
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:57,420
that's probably fine because we could

1236
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,419
always pick values that would work

1237
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:12,030
but it feels a little touchy to me the

1238
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:15,029
real really the reason it feels a little

1239
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:16,940
touching to me is because interpolations

1240
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:19,019
always very well behaved an

1241
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:20,429
extrapolation even when you're

1242
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:22,679
extrapolating to know that you're just

1243
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:24,449
producing an interpolated value can get

1244
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:26,279
kind of numerically unstable in that way

1245
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:27,779
depending on what the Delta is that

1246
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:31,710
you're trying to reproduce between the

1247
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:33,120
two points I feel like this is

1248
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:34,440
especially dangerous when you consider

1249
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,819
that we're trying to interpolate

1250
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,450
something one of the components is a

1251
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:42,570
direction so ideally I think what I'd

1252
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:45,239
like to do is be able to pass downn for

1253
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:47,970
lighting points in addition to the for

1254
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:51,799
geometry points and I would like to

1255
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:53,819
interpolate between them by linearly I

1256
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:57,480
think that's what I would still like to

1257
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:59,190
do now that's a little bit harder to do

1258
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,360
than we would like because now what we

1259
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:04,079
have to do is like sort of reverse

1260
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:06,410
figure out where we are among those four

1261
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,409
points

1262
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:27,130
but I don't really know that that's all

1263
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,130
that problematic right

1264
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:42,439
it's really hard to say let's try

1265
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:44,900
playing with a few things first so if

1266
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,030
you recall one of our big problems is

1267
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,970
that our pixel shader is too slow even

1268
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:52,940
at the moment because it's doing a nasty

1269
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:55,279
loop and all sorts of things there and

1270
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:58,070
so one of the things that you can see in

1271
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,570
sort of a at least that we were getting

1272
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:01,160
before maybe this is not happening

1273
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:03,470
anymore in fact it isn't with the new

1274
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:05,420
driver it looks like it looks like we

1275
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:08,839
maintain 30 frames a second now because

1276
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:12,470
we didn't used to right did they fix

1277
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:15,410
something because we I feel like we used

1278
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:18,170
to have a problem where we wouldn't hit

1279
01:08:15,409 --> 01:08:19,818
30 frames a second if you zoom if you

1280
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:22,250
were actually getting some pixel shading

1281
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:23,810
I feel like they may have like fixed

1282
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:25,579
something in the pixel shader compiler

1283
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:33,048
or something because didn't we used to

1284
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:34,338
shoot up to 40 milliseconds I really

1285
01:08:33,048 --> 01:08:37,548
thought we did

1286
01:08:34,338 --> 01:08:39,649
when we were doing big fills there so I

1287
01:08:37,548 --> 01:08:43,338
don't know maybe maybe this is a bad

1288
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:44,629
extrapolation to make anyway I'm gonna

1289
01:08:43,338 --> 01:08:46,789
go ahead and start cleaning some of this

1290
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:47,930
stuff up but I wanted to talk about that

1291
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,939
lighting a little bit there if we just

1292
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:51,500
assumed that we were only gonna do a

1293
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:52,759
couple little things with the lighting I

1294
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:55,039
wanted to see how that would affect the

1295
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,690
performance but if the if the pixel

1296
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:58,640
shader is no longer actually causing a

1297
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:59,989
performance from then this is kind of a

1298
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,079
little bit academic at that point

1299
01:08:59,989 --> 01:09:04,909
because it was before and you know maybe

1300
01:09:03,079 --> 01:09:07,609
it isn't now

1301
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:13,309
but anyway so let's go ahead and take a

1302
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:16,548
look here at what we're what we're sort

1303
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:18,230
of looking through we kind of have a lot

1304
01:09:16,548 --> 01:09:19,850
of test code going on here and I want to

1305
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:24,789
kind of get some of it out of here at

1306
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,789
the moment so we've got this point

1307
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:33,350
distributor drawing thing here I'm gonna

1308
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,449
get rid of that now so we'll get rid of

1309
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:38,560
that little yellow blossom that we sort

1310
01:09:35,449 --> 01:09:38,559
of created in the middle of things

1311
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:48,460
okay and there you can kind of see so so

1312
01:09:45,788 --> 01:09:52,059
now you can see it happening right now

1313
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:54,038
you can see that that time delay I was

1314
01:09:52,059 --> 01:09:56,920
talking about so maybe the blossom just

1315
01:09:54,038 --> 01:09:59,229
had enough added enough additional draw

1316
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,090
calls to make it Oh II slow right but

1317
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:02,859
now we're down you can see the effect of

1318
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:04,690
the pixel shader there we're like we

1319
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:06,670
zoom in and we're getting 30

1320
01:10:04,689 --> 01:10:07,899
milliseconds per frame ish we zoom out

1321
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,460
and we're getting 20 milliseconds per

1322
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:11,469
frame or pretty you know you don't even

1323
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:13,480
need to measure it with a real with any

1324
01:10:11,469 --> 01:10:15,010
accuracy you can see what a difference

1325
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:16,468
that's making and again the lighting is

1326
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,670
not changing here that's just

1327
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:20,880
reconstruction of the lighting in the

1328
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:22,779
pixel shader that's causing that problem

1329
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:27,788
right that's the that's what we're

1330
01:10:22,779 --> 01:10:29,198
seeing there so if we wanted to play

1331
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:30,880
around with that a little look I was

1332
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:39,698
saying I'm interested to know what

1333
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:41,529
happens if this is no longer a loop so

1334
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:44,649
if in here we just assume that the light

1335
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:47,288
count is always four lights I'm

1336
01:10:44,649 --> 01:10:50,618
interested to know to what extent the

1337
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:52,840
optimization would get better or what

1338
01:10:50,618 --> 01:10:55,868
things we could do if we just know that

1339
01:10:52,840 --> 01:11:01,809
we are always going to fetch four lights

1340
01:10:55,868 --> 01:11:05,738
right so yeah if we just said light

1341
01:11:01,809 --> 01:11:09,730
count where is frag light count right

1342
01:11:05,738 --> 01:11:12,848
count Franklin counties here you can see

1343
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:14,379
frag light indexes there that's where

1344
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:17,498
we're starting to fetch from so if I

1345
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:21,609
just set that instead to frag light

1346
01:11:17,498 --> 01:11:23,679
count equaling four I don't suspect this

1347
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:29,189
will be much of a difference I just

1348
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:29,190
wanted to see if it changed at all

1349
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:37,510
and oddly enough even just that change

1350
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,670
does make a difference right I don't

1351
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:41,710
know if you can see that but even just

1352
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:45,190
that change knocked about two

1353
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:47,470
milliseconds off the time right and so

1354
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:51,250
again I think regularizing this code a

1355
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:53,020
little bit more would be good so you can

1356
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:55,720
see us doing our textile fetching here

1357
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:58,120
where we do a textile fetch with the

1358
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,159
light index and those light index going

1359
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:03,519
order we fetch them the two different

1360
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:10,119
light samplers and so one thing we could

1361
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:12,460
do because we sort of know what those we

1362
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:15,460
know that those four light values that

1363
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:18,489
are coming in here are values that we

1364
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:20,170
want to interpolate we could probably do

1365
01:12:18,489 --> 01:12:23,139
something a little bit clever more

1366
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:26,500
clever where we just let the regular

1367
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:34,000
textile fetch figure this out for us

1368
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:36,100
right so you know just pretend pretend

1369
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,760
this pretend to pretend we're doing this

1370
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:44,590
right so what we're doing right now is

1371
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:48,130
we're packing four of these in like this

1372
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:49,840
right and so what we have to do is fetch

1373
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:52,359
this one fetch this one fetch this one

1374
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:55,090
fetch this one and then we blend them

1375
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:58,929
together but what we could potentially

1376
01:12:55,090 --> 01:13:04,930
do right another option is pack those

1377
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:09,909
like this have a U and V value that we

1378
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:12,850
use that does this for us right so set

1379
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:16,989
using V's on these vertices that say how

1380
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:20,079
we want a sample so for example this UV

1381
01:13:16,989 --> 01:13:22,569
value or whatever this would be 2 and

1382
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,880
this would be 0 so that it would run

1383
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:27,369
from 0 to 1 right here and then just to

1384
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,409
2 there that'd be very well behaved and

1385
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:31,420
it would clamp right here which is what

1386
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:34,630
we want it to do at the sample points

1387
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:37,000
right and then we could just align these

1388
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:38,770
points into that texture such that we

1389
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,659
could just use the regular bilinear

1390
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:45,230
sampling to blend these together for us

1391
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:47,238
right

1392
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:48,859
so we could potentially speed this up a

1393
01:13:47,238 --> 01:13:51,169
bunch because we know we're just trying

1394
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:54,939
to interpolate a region well what if we

1395
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:57,619
just made that region be more sensible

1396
01:13:54,939 --> 01:14:00,349
right seems like a pretty sane thing to

1397
01:13:57,619 --> 01:14:02,090
do and then we could interpolate the

1398
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:04,940
things together now it's a little bit

1399
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:07,539
harder than it sounds because again we

1400
01:14:04,939 --> 01:14:09,469
sort of have this nasty issue where

1401
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:13,460
because we want to do the interpolation

1402
01:14:09,469 --> 01:14:16,069
ourselves because we are encoding the

1403
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:17,899
values in a particular way interpolating

1404
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:20,659
the values ourselves might be more

1405
01:14:17,899 --> 01:14:22,488
difficult but I don't necessarily know

1406
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:26,869
that it would be because this light Z

1407
01:14:22,488 --> 01:14:32,979
reconstruction I think could happen

1408
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:32,979
either way and so yeah

1409
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:48,180
I guess what I'm saying is the problem

1410
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:51,869
that we have here is just looking at

1411
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:53,520
whether or not the light D value is

1412
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:55,019
positive or negative that's the one

1413
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,320
thing that stops us from using a

1414
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:00,660
built-in interpolator there because

1415
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:03,840
that's gonna oscillate it's just

1416
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:10,529
encoding it's it's doing an encoding of

1417
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:14,699
a negative value for the reconstructed

1418
01:15:10,529 --> 01:15:19,619
square root so yeah that is a little bit

1419
01:15:14,699 --> 01:15:20,970
nasty but actually it's not that nasty

1420
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:22,739
because if you think about what's gonna

1421
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:24,270
happen here if you pass those U and V

1422
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:27,079
values you don't need the light position

1423
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:30,050
anymore at that point the light position

1424
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:32,579
color and direction actually we can just

1425
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:39,630
encode this stuff directly at that point

1426
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:48,840
I think right really wish I hadn't run

1427
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:50,130
out of lemonade so if we take a look at

1428
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,909
what we're passing down here to the

1429
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:56,300
renderer in terms of those those

1430
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:56,300
textures

1431
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:12,029
we were encoding this as the position X

1432
01:16:08,489 --> 01:16:14,880
Y Z and then the direction X and

1433
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:17,429
Direction Y and then the color was in

1434
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,500
here but if we wanted to change the way

1435
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:22,020
these were encoded we could do that

1436
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,640
pretty easily right you could see us

1437
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:26,430
doing a different encoding that looks

1438
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,810
like this actually encode the full

1439
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:29,700
direction which would allow us to do

1440
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:33,300
spiracle samples as well as

1441
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:35,189
hemispherical samples and interpolate

1442
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:39,630
them properly using automated

1443
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:45,269
interpolation right as if that was an

1444
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:55,789
RGB texture and then in here we would

1445
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:58,770
just have the color so that would be a

1446
01:16:55,789 --> 01:17:02,310
direction and color both encoded and

1447
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:03,750
those could be encoded more concisely as

1448
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:06,270
well that could be encoded instead of as

1449
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:08,100
floats of 16-bit values for example and

1450
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:10,650
that would give us probably print plenty

1451
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:13,950
of of material there so you could

1452
01:17:10,649 --> 01:17:16,229
imagine using these two as just an

1453
01:17:13,949 --> 01:17:20,369
encoding of the lighting input at that

1454
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:23,279
point and then each of our vertices

1455
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:28,590
would just have its UV value into its

1456
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:31,349
light region and that would be it and

1457
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:38,610
that's pretty straightforward I think

1458
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:39,960
for us to do it's something to think

1459
01:17:38,609 --> 01:17:44,309
about I think that would be a pretty

1460
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:47,270
efficient way to to do it so I'm not

1461
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:47,270
going to start with that

1462
01:17:56,359 --> 01:18:01,880
because I feel like that's maybe taking

1463
01:17:59,789 --> 01:18:04,380
too many steps at once and since this is

1464
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,850
gpu-based where although we do have a

1465
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,170
nice new debugger to play with which

1466
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,910
maybe would make it a little bit easier

1467
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:10,500
on us you typically don't want to take

1468
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:12,989
too many big steps because it's very

1469
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:16,350
hard to get into the data and really see

1470
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:19,039
what's going wrong so what I'd like to

1471
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:23,400
do first is maybe change the sunlight

1472
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:25,649
into a thing that's doing UV based

1473
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:29,869
interpolation for example I think that

1474
01:18:25,649 --> 01:18:33,449
would be a more useful thing to do and

1475
01:18:29,869 --> 01:18:36,180
we'll get that working first then we

1476
01:18:33,449 --> 01:18:41,639
will go and try to encode the data more

1477
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:46,470
compactly later on right so we'll start

1478
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,760
by removing px py and PZ from use so

1479
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:50,520
we'll get them out of the equation

1480
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,079
entirely and then we will go and

1481
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:55,470
re-encode once we know that they're out

1482
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:58,559
of there and yeah like I said we can

1483
01:18:55,470 --> 01:19:05,340
move to this sort of encoding and

1484
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:06,420
whether or not you know we can also the

1485
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,420
other thing we can do is we could

1486
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:11,399
normalize this vector so what we could

1487
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:14,100
do is to use the length of this vector

1488
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:18,750
to tell us something so for example this

1489
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:26,810
CRC this CR CGC B we could store this 8

1490
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:31,100
bit and we could make this dxdydz

1491
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:31,100
be like color intensity

1492
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:40,579
so then we only need one non 8-bit

1493
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:44,539
texture like this would be an 8-bit RGB

1494
01:19:40,579 --> 01:19:46,069
texture and this would be an actual

1495
01:19:44,539 --> 01:19:49,760
floating point or 16-bit

1496
01:19:46,069 --> 01:19:51,920
higher dynamic range texture and then

1497
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:55,039
we're not wasting all of the information

1498
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:58,010
in there right because you only really

1499
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:59,899
need two values like I said but we

1500
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:03,770
because we need to interpolate and may

1501
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:08,479
want to use built-in interpolation I you

1502
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:13,370
know it's hard to say how we want to do

1503
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:17,659
that so we'll see at the very least this

1504
01:20:13,369 --> 01:20:21,289
texture would be pretty easy to do

1505
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:24,500
automatic interpolation on because of

1506
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:29,149
course it's just color and we definitely

1507
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:32,300
could make it just just do 8-bit there

1508
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:33,859
although well yeah mmmm you know now I

1509
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:36,230
think about it even that doesn't really

1510
01:20:33,859 --> 01:20:38,960
thrill me because since the if you want

1511
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:41,779
the interpolation to work right if these

1512
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,239
are supposed to be values that get you

1513
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:45,859
know arbitrarily high then when you

1514
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,179
interpolate between them you need to

1515
01:20:45,859 --> 01:20:52,279
make sure that the interpolation takes

1516
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:56,390
in that difference in size as well so

1517
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:59,119
yeah I don't know we don't need to think

1518
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:02,630
about too hard just yet let's just focus

1519
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:05,119
on the basics all right

1520
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:08,989
so in here we've got a smooth in Veck to

1521
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:11,390
frag UV right and we're going to need

1522
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:13,099
additional information beyond that UV

1523
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:15,470
we're going to need like a lighting UV

1524
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:19,880
if that makes sense

1525
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:25,900
and so yeah when you take a look at what

1526
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:30,020
one of the vertices is this right here

1527
01:21:25,899 --> 01:21:32,750
this is not going to require a light

1528
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:35,450
count anymore we're just going to say

1529
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:39,109
that the light count is out of the out

1530
01:21:35,449 --> 01:21:42,409
of the picture but in here where we're

1531
01:21:39,109 --> 01:21:45,349
passing the point the normal and the UV

1532
01:21:42,409 --> 01:21:47,789
for the texture we're also going to want

1533
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:49,860
to point put a UV in there

1534
01:21:47,789 --> 01:21:53,220
so although we're removing one u16 we're

1535
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:54,719
going to want to add back in a UV for

1536
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:58,699
the lighting so there basically be like

1537
01:21:54,720 --> 01:22:01,230
a light UV so you know we're sort of

1538
01:21:58,699 --> 01:22:05,909
expanding a little bit from what we had

1539
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:10,469
before and the emission value for this

1540
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:13,710
vertex I don't know what that was for

1541
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:16,770
and I feel like that isn't necessary

1542
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:18,420
anymore is that even getting used

1543
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:29,370
anywhere hold on one second before I do

1544
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:30,899
this change so it's not so let's just go

1545
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:33,090
ahead and remove that right off the bat

1546
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:34,619
because we don't need our for our

1547
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:36,239
emission values go into the lighting

1548
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:38,369
system they don't go into the vertex

1549
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:40,829
stream so let's just get rid of that

1550
01:22:38,369 --> 01:22:42,599
emission value altogether because it's

1551
01:22:40,829 --> 01:22:43,949
simply not relevant to the way we've

1552
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,410
structured our system that was sort of

1553
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:48,569
an old part of the process that no one

1554
01:22:46,409 --> 01:22:50,579
cares about anymore and so we might have

1555
01:22:48,569 --> 01:22:52,969
to get rid of it so now if we look at

1556
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:55,170
how this is laid out we have our p value

1557
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:58,590
which we really can't touch we have our

1558
01:22:55,170 --> 01:23:01,649
V our n value and our n value at least

1559
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:04,170
at the moment really doesn't vary it's

1560
01:23:01,649 --> 01:23:06,719
actually constant per primitive but that

1561
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:08,369
may change when we start doing more

1562
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:13,680
stuff with our sprites so it's hard to

1563
01:23:08,369 --> 01:23:17,059
say I strongly suspect that this

1564
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:20,789
probably for all intents and purposes

1565
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:23,130
that probably can be moved down here so

1566
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:25,140
I suspect that we could have a per

1567
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:27,750
primitive buffer that that specifies

1568
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:31,500
normals because really it's just the P

1569
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:34,770
in the UV that we really vary and the in

1570
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:36,329
the color but not not the normal the

1571
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:39,260
normal just points in a direction and

1572
01:23:36,329 --> 01:23:42,199
then it doesn't really do anything else

1573
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:45,480
so yeah if we look at how much is is

1574
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:51,420
being spent up here you can kind of see

1575
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:53,909
that if we were to do this what we end

1576
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:56,550
up there is there's probably just way

1577
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:59,460
too much accuracy being specified in

1578
01:23:56,550 --> 01:24:01,690
these two things floating point values

1579
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:04,149
for these really just probably aren't

1580
01:24:01,689 --> 01:24:08,079
sorry so these can also probably be

1581
01:24:04,149 --> 01:24:09,849
compacted quite a bit too 8-bit values

1582
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:14,289
for the light UV would probably be

1583
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:16,210
plenty and probably for this UV as well

1584
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:17,560
because we tend to only use like whole

1585
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:18,939
sprites we don't really have much

1586
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:22,090
packing or anything maybe in the future

1587
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:25,750
we would but these actually could

1588
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:29,619
probably be 16 bits each honestly so we

1589
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:31,359
could get this down to quite small one

1590
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:33,189
problem that we would have there is I

1591
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:37,659
don't know how good OpenGL is it as

1592
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:39,189
accepting normalized you v's I think

1593
01:24:37,659 --> 01:24:41,319
it's pretty straightforward out you used

1594
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:45,460
to actually be kind of bad at it

1595
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:47,049
but I think it's OK at it now so if we

1596
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:54,369
wanted to you know this could easily be

1597
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:56,079
something more like this if that was

1598
01:24:54,369 --> 01:24:57,729
something we want to do and maybe that

1599
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:59,559
is something we want to do so maybe we

1600
01:24:57,729 --> 01:25:05,529
should try playing with that a little

1601
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:08,140
bit hard to say now one problem that we

1602
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:09,939
will have is the light UV the this UV

1603
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:11,710
probably can work this way very easily

1604
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:14,319
because it's just picking out sprites

1605
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:16,180
the light UV is probably not that way

1606
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:17,529
because it's got to do the sort of weird

1607
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:20,170
interpolation stuff that I was talking

1608
01:25:17,529 --> 01:25:22,929
about before so it may be that this one

1609
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:25,210
actually has to be you know a real value

1610
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:28,659
to certain extent if we take a look at

1611
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:29,920
what we've got here where we've got you

1612
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:33,130
know this would actually line up pretty

1613
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:35,680
great this would be for floats to floats

1614
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:37,329
and then essentially two more floats so

1615
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:40,300
basically be the size of eight floats

1616
01:25:37,329 --> 01:25:43,840
right and so you know if you think about

1617
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:46,719
it a 32 byte vertex kind of fits really

1618
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:49,630
nicely and it's nicely cash aligned and

1619
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:51,310
everything's great so you know that

1620
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:52,630
might be a nice way to encode things if

1621
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:55,510
this turns out to be all we need to

1622
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:58,690
specify per vertex and then this stuff

1623
01:25:55,510 --> 01:26:01,119
down here is still aligned reasonably

1624
01:25:58,689 --> 01:26:03,369
well and all that the problem is that I

1625
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:04,448
we really just don't want to specify

1626
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:06,510
this stuff at all

1627
01:26:04,448 --> 01:26:08,669
I think this stuff wants to be specified

1628
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:11,100
per vertex

1629
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:13,300
I'm sorry primitive and not per vertex

1630
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,650
so I think this is kind of extraneous

1631
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:17,659
and bad but we can

1632
01:26:15,649 --> 01:26:21,109
sort of cross that bridge when we come

1633
01:26:17,658 --> 01:26:24,979
to it all right so again if we take a

1634
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:26,389
look at how this UV stuff is working yes

1635
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:28,039
so there's a couple ways we can do this

1636
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:31,039
the other thing we can look at here with

1637
01:26:28,039 --> 01:26:32,569
the UVs is say look the light index now

1638
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:33,829
can be rolled into these UV is because

1639
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:36,738
if we're going to pack these into a

1640
01:26:33,829 --> 01:26:39,439
texture then what what we can do is into

1641
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:40,309
the light UV if that's a float we can

1642
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:43,329
just pack that in there

1643
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:46,300
so really these two can go away entirely

1644
01:26:43,329 --> 01:26:56,000
and this would just have to be specified

1645
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:58,730
per vertex right yeah and that'd be that

1646
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,469
so at that point again I'm not sure I'm

1647
01:26:58,729 --> 01:27:02,809
sorry per primitive and I don't really

1648
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:04,630
know how whether that makes sense to do

1649
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:07,429
or not it may be that that's just slower

1650
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:09,469
and it's just better to blow it out the

1651
01:27:07,429 --> 01:27:10,940
vertex with it I don't know all right

1652
01:27:09,469 --> 01:27:13,969
anyway enough hemming and hawing about

1653
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:26,379
that so that's basically what we'd be

1654
01:27:13,969 --> 01:27:28,698
doing here so if we take a look at this

1655
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:30,650
what I'm interested in doing here is is

1656
01:27:28,698 --> 01:27:31,879
making the light UV maybe encode this

1657
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:33,948
value so the first thing I do is I'm

1658
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:36,699
going to get rid of light count because

1659
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:36,698
we don't need it anymore

1660
01:27:41,579 --> 01:27:45,969
you can see here we're passing that as

1661
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:48,360
an array and we just don't want that

1662
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,359
anymore

1663
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:57,909
so I'm going to take a look at all the

1664
01:27:56,140 --> 01:28:02,219
places we were doing that we don't need

1665
01:27:57,909 --> 01:28:02,219
this vert light count thing anymore

1666
01:28:31,448 --> 01:28:34,750
and in theory that should do like

1667
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:37,599
absolutely nothing differently right

1668
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:40,329
it's just the same stuff no no big E's

1669
01:28:37,599 --> 01:28:42,670
right and we shouldn't see any

1670
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:44,439
deleterious performance implications

1671
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:48,368
from that and we don't because we're

1672
01:28:44,439 --> 01:28:59,289
just removing things right okay so next

1673
01:28:48,368 --> 01:29:01,299
step what I'd like to do here is figure

1674
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:03,279
out a better way again of accessing

1675
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:08,230
these textures so what I'm thinking

1676
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:10,359
about here is this light UV value can we

1677
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:12,399
use that to just pick out the

1678
01:29:10,359 --> 01:29:14,439
information we need and so what I'm

1679
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:17,158
going to do is I'm gonna say let's maybe

1680
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:22,299
stop with the light index part of things

1681
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:24,098
and instead use just use the light UV to

1682
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:28,000
figure out that value right

1683
01:29:24,099 --> 01:29:30,400
so yeah this requires passing the light

1684
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,738
UV down so we're gonna need a way of

1685
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:38,109
passing that information to the shaders

1686
01:29:32,738 --> 01:29:42,928
and interpolating that along as well

1687
01:29:38,109 --> 01:29:42,929
right and

1688
01:29:47,979 --> 01:29:56,019
I guess one kind of nasty aspect of this

1689
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:58,329
is that so so maybe we want to do this

1690
01:29:56,020 --> 01:30:00,790
in the opposite order maybe we want to

1691
01:29:58,329 --> 01:30:02,170
pack these into the texture in the order

1692
01:30:00,789 --> 01:30:08,619
that I was suggesting they should be

1693
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:11,819
packed and then still use the index the

1694
01:30:08,619 --> 01:30:17,229
the FET shader to do what we want to do

1695
01:30:11,819 --> 01:30:19,599
so for example inside some light here

1696
01:30:17,229 --> 01:30:22,869
you can see doing light I

1697
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:26,530
it starts at frag light index and it in

1698
01:30:22,869 --> 01:30:29,619
increments right and does this does this

1699
01:30:26,529 --> 01:30:31,119
whole thing here so probably what I

1700
01:30:29,619 --> 01:30:34,390
should do is convert this to something

1701
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:36,939
that just does the fetches into a

1702
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:38,980
texture that is laid out the way that

1703
01:30:36,939 --> 01:30:44,019
I've suggested so two rows instead of

1704
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:45,939
one so basically it fetches things that

1705
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:51,280
it knows are supposed to be bilinear

1706
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:56,259
blended instead right so in order to do

1707
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:58,599
that what I would have to do is sort of

1708
01:30:56,260 --> 01:31:00,369
convert this blend call into something

1709
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:11,230
that does more of a parameterised

1710
01:31:00,369 --> 01:31:13,630
version so if I took this out and I made

1711
01:31:11,229 --> 01:31:17,469
this call right here be something more

1712
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:23,619
like fetching some or something like

1713
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:30,010
this so what it's going to do is this is

1714
01:31:23,619 --> 01:31:36,149
going to do it's going to update this

1715
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:40,090
result value here I I'm not sure how you

1716
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:45,009
pass something to be modified in a

1717
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:48,850
shader like that now that I think about

1718
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:50,500
it my shader coding skills are poor to

1719
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:55,690
say the least I usually look up

1720
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:58,380
everything as I go what I could do here

1721
01:31:55,689 --> 01:31:58,379
is just do

1722
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:16,170
actually just like this so what I could

1723
01:32:11,829 --> 01:32:16,170
do here just say well you know the

1724
01:32:18,689 --> 01:32:31,179
they're running some value like we'll

1725
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:34,140
we'll set to zero here and then we'll

1726
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:34,140
just call this four times

1727
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:57,720
so in here we want to fetch these four

1728
01:32:54,229 --> 01:33:00,000
light positions we don't need any of

1729
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,920
this stuff really in fact I can probably

1730
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:12,569
just get rid of light I all together and

1731
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:18,600
just say look it's this do four of this

1732
01:33:12,569 --> 01:33:21,750
sums they'll sum into running sum and

1733
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:25,500
then here we'll just say results goes

1734
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:27,029
running sum so that is the yeah I'm sure

1735
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:31,199
there's a good way to pass something in

1736
01:33:27,029 --> 01:33:33,689
to fetch and sum but I don't know what

1737
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:35,340
it is anyway so then we'll do our two

1738
01:33:33,689 --> 01:33:37,949
textile fetches we'll do all of our

1739
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:40,829
computations we don't need any of this

1740
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:42,359
stuff and that will update running some

1741
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:45,000
with the value that we actually wanted

1742
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:47,639
and from there we can we should be able

1743
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:51,000
to kind of go forwards with starting to

1744
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:54,360
make it fetch in a different way so here

1745
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,710
we are doing our loading again at this

1746
01:33:54,359 --> 01:33:58,769
time we're doing it with those calls

1747
01:33:55,710 --> 01:34:00,390
instead of the loop right and again no

1748
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:02,430
real problems with the performance

1749
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:07,340
compared to the old performance so we're

1750
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:11,490
not changing anything drastic so now

1751
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:14,130
when we do this textile fetch and we're

1752
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:15,840
doing this sort of summation here now

1753
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:19,730
what I want to do is sort of change this

1754
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:22,380
over to something that's going to do

1755
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:25,169
again like I said a sort of a bilinear

1756
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:28,170
blend and so what I'd like to do is make

1757
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:29,850
it so maybe so fetch and some isn't that

1758
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:32,869
really fetching some it's just like

1759
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:32,870
fetch sample or something

1760
01:34:34,649 --> 01:34:41,149
and we can fetch the four different

1761
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:46,050
samples that we want separately and then

1762
01:34:41,149 --> 01:34:49,920
use them right now the problem that I'm

1763
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:51,239
going to have here is that again I don't

1764
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,550
really know if we want to do this way

1765
01:34:51,239 --> 01:34:56,609
because we probably want to let the

1766
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:58,350
automated summation stuff in the

1767
01:34:56,609 --> 01:35:00,299
bilinear blend in the textile fetch

1768
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:09,960
bilinear plan just do it

1769
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:11,550
for us so so I mean it may be that we

1770
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:19,859
really kind of have to make this jump

1771
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:21,779
all at once no I mean I think we just

1772
01:35:19,859 --> 01:35:27,210
still make baby steps so let's suppose

1773
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:29,729
we leave this as fetching some hoops if

1774
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:32,039
we leave this as fetch as some suppose I

1775
01:35:29,729 --> 01:35:33,899
just update these two and we pass in the

1776
01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:36,988
right values here then we should be able

1777
01:35:33,899 --> 01:35:39,328
to update those textures to have the

1778
01:35:36,988 --> 01:35:45,569
things in the order that I suggested

1779
01:35:39,328 --> 01:35:48,988
before and then it should be fine so I

1780
01:35:45,569 --> 01:35:53,488
think we can make this work in smaller

1781
01:35:48,988 --> 01:35:54,779
steps right so let's just double check

1782
01:35:53,488 --> 01:35:55,939
him and I'll see if I that's true

1783
01:35:54,779 --> 01:36:01,670
because we're almost out of time anyway

1784
01:35:55,939 --> 01:36:01,669
you got like 15 minutes left I think

1785
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:19,199
okay that all still looks pretty

1786
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,200
accurate

1787
01:36:34,579 --> 01:36:42,979
it's kind of weird one thing that's not

1788
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:58,739
doesn't make a lot of sense is why that

1789
01:36:47,479 --> 01:37:01,349
is getting wet I mean I suppose that

1790
01:36:58,738 --> 01:37:04,829
those points are getting light on them

1791
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:06,750
but yeah I guess as we start to spread

1792
01:37:04,829 --> 01:37:08,519
these light points out one of the things

1793
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:09,988
we can do is start to debug some of

1794
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:13,410
those things a little bit better because

1795
01:37:09,988 --> 01:37:15,359
right now the way that we're doing light

1796
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:21,479
placement on surfaces is also a little

1797
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:24,599
wonky and so sometimes I can't quite

1798
01:37:21,479 --> 01:37:26,099
guess if something's a bug or not and we

1799
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,719
need better ways of identifying where

1800
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:30,690
the things are bugs for stuff like this

1801
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:41,969
really liking this lighting though it's

1802
01:37:30,689 --> 01:37:43,259
so pleasant you know so yeah what I'm

1803
01:37:41,969 --> 01:37:47,670
interested in doing here is turning

1804
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:49,890
these into two-dimensional samples that

1805
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:52,649
we can use the UV for so what I want to

1806
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:56,340
do right in this case is I want to kind

1807
01:37:52,649 --> 01:38:01,099
of take this and turn it as strange as

1808
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:05,699
it seems turn it into that basically

1809
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:09,510
where we are sort of you know putting

1810
01:38:05,699 --> 01:38:10,829
those there's for the primitives we're

1811
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:13,710
having like two rows of light

1812
01:38:10,829 --> 01:38:15,149
information and we'll sort of distribute

1813
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:17,180
the light information in there

1814
01:38:15,149 --> 01:38:20,099
proportional to how we want to

1815
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:24,500
interpolate it now light data width is

1816
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:26,940
still is kind of a stupid name now and

1817
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:29,699
furthermore we really don't need these

1818
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:32,549
to be shaped this way they could be

1819
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:34,289
shaped in in any way really because if

1820
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:36,060
we actually make a light UV then

1821
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:37,939
basically we just have a light map and

1822
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:43,050
we're putting things into the light map

1823
01:38:37,939 --> 01:38:45,988
and you know that's just yeah it's it's

1824
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:46,909
not that complicated of a thing to do

1825
01:38:45,988 --> 01:38:52,459
and

1826
01:38:46,909 --> 01:38:55,130
we pretty much could use a you know a

1827
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:58,310
square texture we don't need a

1828
01:38:55,130 --> 01:39:02,119
rectangular texture anymore for that

1829
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:05,240
purpose so that part's a little bit

1830
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:09,590
trickier but we'll do it one step at a

1831
01:39:05,239 --> 01:39:11,750
time again to avoid anything that's

1832
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:15,140
going to be to dilla tereus so if we

1833
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:18,739
take a look at this here if we expanded

1834
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:21,320
these light datas to be stepped in this

1835
01:39:18,739 --> 01:39:23,389
fashion then what we need to do is we

1836
01:39:21,319 --> 01:39:25,159
need to pack those in there in a way

1837
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:28,340
that will make sense for fetching them

1838
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:30,859
out later and so what I want to do is

1839
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:33,260
when we go in and in the lighting

1840
01:39:30,859 --> 01:39:35,539
routine place the actual data in there

1841
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:38,750
as you can see here what we're doing is

1842
01:39:35,539 --> 01:39:44,600
replacing the data into this point index

1843
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:47,590
system where as we run through we know

1844
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:50,240
that every point index in the system

1845
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:52,940
corresponds to one entry in the lighting

1846
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:57,469
setup and what we'd like to do instead

1847
01:39:52,939 --> 01:40:02,739
is have a more coherent notion of where

1848
01:39:57,470 --> 01:40:06,980
these points actually get packed into

1849
01:40:02,739 --> 01:40:08,869
Malaysia get packed into texture now one

1850
01:40:06,979 --> 01:40:11,299
thing I could do again to make even more

1851
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:15,559
baby steps it so I just leave it the way

1852
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:19,300
it was and instead introduce some notion

1853
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:22,520
that the packing has to get packed

1854
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:26,060
prescriptively then when we're looking

1855
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:28,070
at these lighting points here what I can

1856
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:30,740
do is say that there has to actually be

1857
01:40:28,069 --> 01:40:32,960
some information for a given lighting

1858
01:40:30,739 --> 01:40:36,519
point that says where the lighting point

1859
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:39,140
is supposed to actually be packed right

1860
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:40,760
and so if you take a look at how these

1861
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:41,780
lighting points get added in the first

1862
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:43,460
place

1863
01:40:41,779 --> 01:40:45,349
what you can see is that when we run

1864
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:48,439
through here we go through each of the

1865
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:50,720
boxes that we have in each of those

1866
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:53,509
boxes then gets a point added to the

1867
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:56,240
system as such and so what we could do

1868
01:40:53,510 --> 01:41:00,159
here is say look since we know how we're

1869
01:40:56,239 --> 01:41:02,679
placing these points relative to the

1870
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:05,680
boxes that we're creating we should then

1871
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:08,440
also be able to say for each one of the

1872
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:15,460
points where we want it to get packed

1873
01:41:08,439 --> 01:41:18,599
back to right so for example in here we

1874
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:23,470
could just have an integer that's like

1875
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:25,660
PAC index and when we specify in here

1876
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:30,329
what we want to pack we just say that

1877
01:41:25,659 --> 01:41:34,599
like point pack index equals something

1878
01:41:30,329 --> 01:41:36,970
in here when we're doing the points we

1879
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:39,280
know how many we have so the PAC indices

1880
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:41,680
should always be valid and what we can

1881
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:43,929
do is say well alright at the moment we

1882
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:47,200
know that the PAC index is just going to

1883
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:48,940
be the same as the point index right so

1884
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:51,130
there really isn't any difference

1885
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:53,319
between those two things and they can

1886
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:54,789
just be packed directly and then when we

1887
01:41:53,319 --> 01:41:56,889
come down here and we're going to do the

1888
01:41:54,789 --> 01:41:59,109
packing normally we were saying point

1889
01:41:56,890 --> 01:42:01,360
index before but instead what we're

1890
01:41:59,109 --> 01:42:03,639
going to do here is have a PAC index

1891
01:42:01,359 --> 01:42:09,389
what we can do is take the actual point

1892
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:09,390
piece of point information get that out

1893
01:42:13,739 --> 01:42:26,349
and then in here we can just say okay

1894
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:28,390
point P point and and

1895
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:29,680
we're still doing the stuffing here and

1896
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:31,119
again that's going to be something we

1897
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,650
want to sort of when we start looking at

1898
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:35,470
the normal information we're gonna want

1899
01:42:32,649 --> 01:42:37,269
to start stop doing that I recall it

1900
01:42:35,470 --> 01:42:39,039
didn't change very much but it might

1901
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:42,580
change more as we start to distribute

1902
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:45,039
our points out in different ways so what

1903
01:42:42,579 --> 01:42:47,649
we want to do again is just say okay now

1904
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:51,010
when we go and pack these back we want

1905
01:42:47,649 --> 01:42:54,609
to use the PAC index here and again

1906
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:56,070
that's just going to be given off of the

1907
01:42:54,609 --> 01:42:59,139
point

1908
01:42:56,069 --> 01:42:59,139
[Music]

1909
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:15,130
oops what am i doing there and so now

1910
01:43:12,699 --> 01:43:17,289
we're just packing back at a place that

1911
01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:19,329
we've specified and at the moment that

1912
01:43:17,289 --> 01:43:21,399
doesn't do us anything it's the same as

1913
01:43:19,329 --> 01:43:23,289
it was before but as we move forward

1914
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:27,119
here with doing stuff where we've got a

1915
01:43:23,289 --> 01:43:29,229
more coherent notion of how these things

1916
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:33,340
should get spammed back into the

1917
01:43:29,229 --> 01:43:35,589
textures we can get more aggressive with

1918
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:37,900
that right so now if we take a look at

1919
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:39,039
these pieces of light data let's go

1920
01:43:37,899 --> 01:43:41,920
ahead and do the thing that I was saying

1921
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:44,170
before where we say all right let's pack

1922
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:47,109
these into two rows now so there's like

1923
01:43:44,170 --> 01:43:49,449
they're kind of in in more of a UV

1924
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:51,819
pattern and what I'll do there is just

1925
01:43:49,449 --> 01:43:57,369
say oK we've got two packed indices

1926
01:43:51,819 --> 01:44:00,250
let's say so maybe this is a pack row

1927
01:43:57,369 --> 01:44:03,489
value and that's a pack index value and

1928
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:07,289
then what I can do is say all right if I

1929
01:44:03,489 --> 01:44:10,689
know the pack index in the pack row I

1930
01:44:07,289 --> 01:44:13,510
can put these into the textures properly

1931
01:44:10,689 --> 01:44:16,299
and then when I can also do is when I'm

1932
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:17,890
submitting these textures I can then

1933
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:20,289
start thinking of them as things that

1934
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:22,570
could be interpolated between by using

1935
01:44:20,289 --> 01:44:25,449
it by linear sample as long as I pack

1936
01:44:22,569 --> 01:44:27,519
the pieces of information in in a known

1937
01:44:25,449 --> 01:44:29,260
orientation that makes sense for the

1938
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,420
surface so now when I come back here

1939
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:33,550
what I want to do is be a little bit

1940
01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:35,649
more prescriptive about or specific

1941
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:37,840
about how these are getting packed in so

1942
01:44:35,649 --> 01:44:40,329
if I have a row index and a pack index

1943
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,010
what I know is my row index is actually

1944
01:44:40,329 --> 01:44:44,199
given by one of these because I got an X

1945
01:44:42,010 --> 01:44:46,239
sub and a Y sub so what I could say is

1946
01:44:44,199 --> 01:44:48,069
well my row index maybe is my Y sub

1947
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:50,500
value so I have two rows that I'm

1948
01:44:48,069 --> 01:44:52,269
packing into and then my pack index for

1949
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:55,359
X is going to be whatever the light

1950
01:44:52,270 --> 01:44:57,520
index is times two since I'll stride and

1951
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:59,589
I don't really want that actually I

1952
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:02,200
guess we want an actual value here but

1953
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:04,420
plus my Y sub so I know that like I pack

1954
01:45:02,199 --> 01:45:06,609
two values in for every square right

1955
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:09,369
because this is a square of a square

1956
01:45:06,609 --> 01:45:12,009
sample pattern so I just want to do two

1957
01:45:09,369 --> 01:45:16,739
rows two columns right and then we just

1958
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:16,739
say okay my pack index right

1959
01:45:17,109 --> 01:45:23,000
Oh so yeah this actually gives me

1960
01:45:20,569 --> 01:45:25,899
roughly what I want here you can see

1961
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:31,039
that we get this box light index value

1962
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:33,219
so I could just use this value and that

1963
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:45,380
would actually be fine for the moment so

1964
01:45:33,219 --> 01:45:48,670
yeah hmm hard to say what I want to do

1965
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:48,670
about that

1966
01:45:57,859 --> 01:46:02,159
[Music]

1967
01:46:07,979 --> 01:46:12,250
so the reason that that's a little bit

1968
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:17,770
wonky is just because the line index

1969
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:19,600
that's coming down here is kind of

1970
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:21,340
separate from where we might want to

1971
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,579
pack these into the texture this light

1972
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:28,000
index goes up by four every time because

1973
01:46:24,579 --> 01:46:29,500
there are four lights well no sorry it's

1974
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,260
more than that right there's four upper

1975
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:36,430
surface so it actually goes up by 24

1976
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:39,600
points per box at the moment and we

1977
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:44,230
don't really need to obey that at all

1978
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:48,640
when we're doing our packing because

1979
01:46:44,229 --> 01:46:50,049
we've got two rows to pack into and

1980
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:52,470
we're gonna have a lot of other packing

1981
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:54,880
concerns involved so there's kind of

1982
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:56,199
yeah it kind of fights this a little bit

1983
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,789
and the way that we're doing these

1984
01:46:56,199 --> 01:46:59,260
submissions again I think needs to

1985
01:46:57,789 --> 01:47:01,060
cleaned up I don't know if you remember

1986
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:02,380
what we kind of were saying that I have

1987
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:05,590
this stuff needs to move to the world

1988
01:47:02,380 --> 01:47:08,199
generation stuff anyway how these points

1989
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:12,130
get distributed so it's kind of a little

1990
01:47:08,199 --> 01:47:17,130
bit of a mishmash yeah it's kind of a

1991
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:17,130
little bit of a of an issue there

1992
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:39,868
so I'm not sure exactly how I want to do

1993
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:41,429
that just yet like I said this parts all

1994
01:47:39,868 --> 01:47:42,839
gonna be finicky bookkeeping that's

1995
01:47:41,429 --> 01:47:44,399
really all that's going on here is

1996
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:47,038
figuring out the most efficient way for

1997
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:51,959
us to do this sort of stuff I can just

1998
01:47:47,038 --> 01:48:21,090
use the light index here probably the

1999
01:47:51,958 --> 01:48:24,229
base light index yeah I mean like for

2000
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:24,229
now I can do that

2001
01:48:27,979 --> 01:48:34,109
but admittedly it's not great we kind of

2002
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:38,970
need to start locking this out to a

2003
01:48:34,109 --> 01:48:41,219
higher level right where because the

2004
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:46,320
distribution of points is not going to

2005
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:48,770
be one-to-one with the blocks that it

2006
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:48,769
uses

2007
01:49:02,359 --> 01:49:08,899
although again we could kind of yeah

2008
01:49:14,439 --> 01:49:22,238
this requires some thought so I'm gonna

2009
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:34,310
back this out for a second

2010
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:36,488
leave this the way it was and I think

2011
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:38,989
this is where we'll pick up tomorrow

2012
01:49:36,488 --> 01:49:40,848
because what I want to do is I want to

2013
01:49:38,988 --> 01:49:43,039
figure out the most efficacious set of

2014
01:49:40,849 --> 01:49:44,810
steps to make here and I think we might

2015
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:46,760
want to do is go into the world gencode

2016
01:49:44,810 --> 01:49:49,070
and actually figure out how we want to

2017
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:51,079
generate the information about how these

2018
01:49:49,069 --> 01:49:53,630
things go together because there's two

2019
01:49:51,079 --> 01:49:56,479
ways we could do it and one of which one

2020
01:49:53,630 --> 01:50:02,900
of them is to leave boxes and light

2021
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:06,500
sample points sort of aligned with each

2022
01:50:02,899 --> 01:50:10,129
other and maybe we really want to do

2023
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:18,229
that and then just apply a blur right

2024
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:20,359
like so you know maybe a different way

2025
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:23,598
of looking at this problem would be

2026
01:50:20,359 --> 01:50:26,448
maybe we want to sort of sample the

2027
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:30,889
lighting of these faces just as faces

2028
01:50:26,448 --> 01:50:33,169
and then have a thing that operates

2029
01:50:30,889 --> 01:50:37,579
after the fact that tries to produce

2030
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:42,849
what these two points should be based on

2031
01:50:37,579 --> 01:50:42,849
the lighting here and here right

2032
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:54,669
so I kind of want to think that through

2033
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:56,019
a little bit more I don't want to do

2034
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:57,609
that at the end of the stream because we

2035
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:58,719
only got like four minutes left so I

2036
01:50:57,609 --> 01:51:00,819
think what I'd like to do is that's what

2037
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:04,000
I'll pick up on tomorrow let's go make

2038
01:51:00,819 --> 01:51:07,449
something that actually generates like

2039
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,430
you know a wall and places the points

2040
01:51:07,449 --> 01:51:11,019
where it will and just tries to figure

2041
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:12,969
out how that forward bookkeeping is

2042
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:15,790
gonna work cuz I feel like we need to

2043
01:51:12,969 --> 01:51:19,539
kind of push forward from that so we'll

2044
01:51:15,789 --> 01:51:23,130
do that that way I think that's the

2045
01:51:19,539 --> 01:51:25,300
right call so let's go ahead and go to

2046
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:26,650
muse make sure that we lift this in good

2047
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,890
state let's go ahead and go to our brief

2048
01:51:26,649 --> 01:51:28,889
Q&amp;A

2049
01:51:58,689 --> 01:52:03,549
hi Casey can you please remind the good

2050
01:52:01,210 --> 01:52:06,340
people on the stream 1y templates are

2051
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:08,590
bad to what use cases templates can be

2052
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:11,800
considered for which they are good and

2053
01:52:08,590 --> 01:52:14,560
bad for and what they can be replaced

2054
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:19,360
with even then I'm gonna take a gander

2055
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:21,280
it's metaprogramming um yes so you don't

2056
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:23,409
let's just see if we have any on topic

2057
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:26,349
questions first because that was not

2058
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:27,909
really a topic of today's stream if we

2059
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:33,910
don't have any other questions I'm happy

2060
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:39,279
to fill the 15 minutes with that but

2061
01:52:33,909 --> 01:52:40,019
it's not it's not really apropos if that

2062
01:52:39,279 --> 01:52:42,550
makes sense

2063
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:44,170
frosty Ninja has getting insight working

2064
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:52,239
boosted your morale back and recovered

2065
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:54,789
some hope well yes and no I mean I would

2066
01:52:52,238 --> 01:52:56,738
I would say not really and the reason

2067
01:52:54,789 --> 01:52:58,569
for that is just because you know it was

2068
01:52:56,738 --> 01:53:00,549
very depressing to have the whole thing

2069
01:52:58,569 --> 01:53:01,899
the other week where it's like okay we

2070
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:04,869
couldn't even get an invidious website

2071
01:53:01,899 --> 01:53:08,049
to work in whatever and that's true and

2072
01:53:04,869 --> 01:53:11,469
that sucked and all that but on the

2073
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:15,039
whole most of my experiences in the past

2074
01:53:11,469 --> 01:53:16,960
with NVIDIA have been good when I try to

2075
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:18,939
talk to programmers there or driver

2076
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,170
writers there to have them do stuff or

2077
01:53:18,939 --> 01:53:22,960
help me with something or fix something

2078
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:26,469
I have generally found them to be easy

2079
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:29,560
to work with so I wasn't like super down

2080
01:53:26,469 --> 01:53:33,250
on NVIDIA or anything so in some sense

2081
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:36,310
the fact that they you know specifically

2082
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:39,520
took the time to come and ask me if I

2083
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:42,130
needed help on getting this going while

2084
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:43,810
I'm really happy they did that they tend

2085
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:46,199
to be good like that I generally have

2086
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:49,930
positive experiences working with NVIDIA

2087
01:53:46,198 --> 01:53:51,729
you know and so I wouldn't say it

2088
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:54,039
boosted my morale all that much because

2089
01:53:51,729 --> 01:53:55,629
really it just reinforced what I already

2090
01:53:54,039 --> 01:53:56,890
thought which is that if I'm really in

2091
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:59,170
dire straits with something Nvidia

2092
01:53:56,890 --> 01:54:04,289
related I'm not that despondent because

2093
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:08,980
they seem to be pretty good right and

2094
01:54:04,289 --> 01:54:10,719
you know if they hadn't and if we still

2095
01:54:08,979 --> 01:54:12,109
couldn't use insight maybe I would be an

2096
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,840
even worse

2097
01:54:12,109 --> 01:54:18,348
mood but generally speaking nvidia is

2098
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:20,210
not the primary problem when i think of

2099
01:54:18,349 --> 01:54:26,500
people who don't care about developers

2100
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:29,989
it's not nvidia right and vidya among

2101
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:31,340
you know the folks who developers

2102
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:33,919
typically have to deal with them day to

2103
01:54:31,340 --> 01:54:36,710
day basis they are probably the least

2104
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:39,920
problematic in terms of actually getting

2105
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:43,550
them to pay attention to problems and

2106
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:46,969
help with them and they certainly tend

2107
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:53,079
to ship some of the more stable drivers

2108
01:54:46,969 --> 01:54:53,078
and tools and stuff that I use so I

2109
01:54:54,158 --> 01:55:01,729
don't know how to put it any more

2110
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:04,820
specific than that am I still doing to

2111
01:55:01,729 --> 01:55:06,529
Montana no Germany planting shadows in

2112
01:55:04,819 --> 01:55:08,359
the game no I don't really want any

2113
01:55:06,529 --> 01:55:14,420
shadows in the game not hard shadows

2114
01:55:08,359 --> 01:55:15,948
anyway the there obviously are shadows

2115
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:22,219
in the game already in the sense that

2116
01:55:15,948 --> 01:55:24,678
when you move like behind things you do

2117
01:55:22,219 --> 01:55:27,399
get shadows right so that's the shadow

2118
01:55:24,679 --> 01:55:30,289
of this wall that's why it is not there

2119
01:55:27,399 --> 01:55:33,138
so we actually have pretty advanced

2120
01:55:30,289 --> 01:55:35,179
shadowing very advanced shadowing in

2121
01:55:33,139 --> 01:55:39,289
fact at the moment what we don't have is

2122
01:55:35,179 --> 01:55:43,039
hard shadows so and I don't really want

2123
01:55:39,289 --> 01:55:46,578
to do hard shadows I don't like hard

2124
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:48,590
shadows one thing that's kind of weird

2125
01:55:46,578 --> 01:55:50,479
about the way people do shadows and

2126
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:54,679
games is like if you look at games

2127
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:56,808
generally once the game gets to a

2128
01:55:54,679 --> 01:55:58,639
certain level of graphical complexity

2129
01:55:56,809 --> 01:56:01,969
and quality oftentimes you can't see

2130
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:04,250
shadows anymore as such so for example

2131
01:56:01,969 --> 01:56:11,270
if you look at a game that looks really

2132
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:14,719
good it's a pick one from recent memory

2133
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:17,389
that I thought looked quite good you

2134
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:19,760
know if you start to look at these the

2135
01:56:17,389 --> 01:56:21,980
shadows sort of start to become fairly

2136
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:23,690
irrelevant so you look at this scene and

2137
01:56:21,979 --> 01:56:25,098
you're like well there's a little bit of

2138
01:56:23,689 --> 01:56:26,898
a direct shadow right there

2139
01:56:25,099 --> 01:56:30,378
and everything else is indirect lighting

2140
01:56:26,899 --> 01:56:34,010
right like there's no you just don't see

2141
01:56:30,378 --> 01:56:36,590
a lot of contribution of the direct

2142
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:40,340
shadowing to the overall quality of the

2143
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:42,918
scenes right and so you look at this

2144
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:46,038
stuff in you know you can see these

2145
01:56:42,918 --> 01:56:47,569
sorts of pieces here as what the this is

2146
01:56:46,038 --> 01:56:50,179
the direct illumination pass that's

2147
01:56:47,569 --> 01:56:52,429
doing that right there it's just not the

2148
01:56:50,179 --> 01:56:57,319
most important part right in terms of

2149
01:56:52,429 --> 01:56:58,760
the character again you kind of look at

2150
01:56:57,319 --> 01:57:00,558
something like this and it's just I

2151
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:05,359
can't even really see the direct shadows

2152
01:57:00,559 --> 01:57:06,918
here I guess it's that part is that this

2153
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:08,179
is Assassin's Creed all of a sudden I

2154
01:57:06,918 --> 01:57:12,469
don't know why we're also looking at

2155
01:57:08,179 --> 01:57:14,958
that and so I just tend to not think of

2156
01:57:12,469 --> 01:57:17,840
it as that important right typically

2157
01:57:14,958 --> 01:57:19,578
speaking if you just want to ground the

2158
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:21,109
player just putting in a little bit of

2159
01:57:19,578 --> 01:57:24,288
fake shadowing there tends to be good

2160
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:26,989
enough and in our cases if you think

2161
01:57:24,288 --> 01:57:29,448
about how these are generally created

2162
01:57:26,988 --> 01:57:30,948
this is actually not that hard to do

2163
01:57:29,448 --> 01:57:33,319
creating these shows because it's

2164
01:57:30,948 --> 01:57:36,378
typically a shadow passed with whatever

2165
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:37,788
your strongest direction of light is we

2166
01:57:36,378 --> 01:57:39,349
don't really have much of an option of

2167
01:57:37,788 --> 01:57:41,118
doing that because we don't have real

2168
01:57:39,349 --> 01:57:43,639
geometry for our stuff we just have

2169
01:57:41,118 --> 01:57:44,898
sprites so our shadows would be pretty

2170
01:57:43,639 --> 01:57:47,719
inaccurate as it is

2171
01:57:44,899 --> 01:57:49,729
so again just putting in just a standard

2172
01:57:47,719 --> 01:57:52,668
little darkening beneath the characters

2173
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:54,469
is all I really plan to do and again

2174
01:57:52,668 --> 01:57:56,328
when I just look at these direct

2175
01:57:54,469 --> 01:57:59,569
shadowing just doesn't contribute that

2176
01:57:56,328 --> 01:58:02,208
much right typically what you see more

2177
01:57:59,569 --> 01:58:03,858
is just the fact that back the backs of

2178
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:06,378
things aren't lit brightly and the

2179
01:58:03,859 --> 01:58:08,419
Front's are and the direct the directly

2180
01:58:06,378 --> 01:58:10,038
cache shadows really you just don't see

2181
01:58:08,418 --> 01:58:11,898
much I don't even see them at all here I

2182
01:58:10,038 --> 01:58:14,300
guess that's it right there but if that

2183
01:58:11,899 --> 01:58:16,878
wasn't there I I wouldn't even know

2184
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:20,320
right like I wouldn't even have noticed

2185
01:58:16,878 --> 01:58:20,319
it not being there

2186
01:58:20,679 --> 01:58:25,998
honestly hardly at all in this scene I

2187
01:58:23,029 --> 01:58:28,340
think it's right there right other than

2188
01:58:25,998 --> 01:58:30,529
that I don't even see any direct

2189
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:35,328
shadowing in the scene that really I

2190
01:58:30,529 --> 01:58:37,340
notice so I think like and this is true

2191
01:58:35,328 --> 01:58:39,738
of the real world too like I mean if you

2192
01:58:37,340 --> 01:58:47,389
just look at photos

2193
01:58:39,738 --> 01:58:53,750
you just don't see a lot of that I don't

2194
01:58:47,389 --> 01:58:57,828
know how to get just random photos so

2195
01:58:53,750 --> 01:59:00,800
here's a shot and again if you look at

2196
01:58:57,828 --> 01:59:03,319
what you notice in this shot in terms of

2197
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:05,900
direct shadowing you know all I see is

2198
01:59:03,319 --> 01:59:09,710
some darkening underneath the the

2199
01:59:05,899 --> 01:59:11,988
elements right I don't see any direct

2200
01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:14,840
shadowing in that scene I don't see any

2201
01:59:11,988 --> 01:59:18,709
direct shadowing in this scene none in

2202
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:22,699
that scene none in that scene none in

2203
01:59:18,710 --> 01:59:26,989
that scene none in that scene none in

2204
01:59:22,698 --> 01:59:29,839
that scene none in that scene I mean

2205
01:59:26,988 --> 01:59:31,638
it's just not there so to the extent

2206
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:33,949
where we really need to think about it

2207
01:59:31,639 --> 01:59:36,230
at all I really think the only thing we

2208
01:59:33,948 --> 01:59:37,969
need to worry about is darkening

2209
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:39,678
underneath like where the player

2210
01:59:37,969 --> 01:59:42,408
standing so they can see what they're

2211
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:44,719
standing on that that piece of visual

2212
01:59:42,408 --> 01:59:47,538
information the darkening I think is

2213
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:50,090
important everything else I think is

2214
01:59:47,538 --> 01:59:52,698
just a waste of time cuz see real scenes

2215
01:59:50,090 --> 01:59:55,819
just don't have a lot of like oh I see

2216
01:59:52,698 --> 01:59:57,408
the long like shadow being cast again

2217
01:59:55,819 --> 01:59:58,908
same thing here right there's some

2218
01:59:57,408 --> 02:00:01,488
direct shadowing happening here it's

2219
01:59:58,908 --> 02:00:05,058
just darkening where there is stuff and

2220
02:00:01,488 --> 02:00:07,908
and I don't need like I can't even

2221
02:00:05,059 --> 02:00:10,190
perceive that those are cast by this

2222
02:00:07,908 --> 02:00:12,049
thing in terms of shape I just know they

2223
02:00:10,189 --> 02:00:13,759
are because there's stuff there so again

2224
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:15,260
it's just like it's just a darkening

2225
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:17,389
that happens underneath stuff that can

2226
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:22,820
be easily faked it doesn't really

2227
02:00:17,389 --> 02:00:25,010
require any of that sort of solving and

2228
02:00:22,819 --> 02:00:26,658
so I feel like our soft shadows plus if

2229
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:30,460
we want to darken something underneath

2230
02:00:26,658 --> 02:00:30,460
things passivity is really all we need

2231
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:41,279
is the cause over brightness merely a

2232
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:42,449
change in the algorithm makes the light

2233
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:44,039
bright it's very different or is there

2234
02:00:42,449 --> 02:00:47,039
an actual bug

2235
02:00:44,039 --> 02:00:48,569
well again the reason is just because

2236
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:51,869
we're doing an approximation of the

2237
02:00:48,569 --> 02:00:54,179
integral and we aren't approximating the

2238
02:00:51,869 --> 02:00:56,279
cosine term correctly in either case

2239
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:58,680
because in one case we're under sampling

2240
02:00:56,279 --> 02:01:01,050
the Hemisphere but correctly multiplying

2241
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:02,490
by cosine theta in the other case where

2242
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:03,570
maybe sampling the atmosphere a little

2243
02:01:02,489 --> 02:01:05,130
bit better cuz we're concentrating

2244
02:01:03,569 --> 02:01:07,170
towards the points that contribute more

2245
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:11,670
but we're under sampling the cosine

2246
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:14,730
theta part so both of them are bugs in

2247
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:16,770
accuracy they may not be bugs in the

2248
02:01:14,729 --> 02:01:23,489
Apes we had a line of code wrong sense

2249
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:25,230
so well sprites be simply flat lighted

2250
02:01:23,489 --> 02:01:28,679
or do you plan to implement something to

2251
02:01:25,229 --> 02:01:30,509
give them fake 3d lighting if we end up

2252
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:31,920
having normal maps as input I don't know

2253
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:33,539
if we're gonna have any normal maps for

2254
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:36,750
input then it will light with the normal

2255
02:01:33,539 --> 02:01:37,710
map otherwise we won't lucid frost has

2256
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,939
similar is this letting mild to

2257
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:43,350
something you would find in other game

2258
02:01:38,939 --> 02:01:45,089
engines it's fairly similar I think to

2259
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:48,750
what you would find in like a high-end

2260
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:52,860
radiosity based engine so I think it's

2261
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:57,770
fairly similar to say how the Frostbite

2262
02:01:52,859 --> 02:02:11,339
engine does its indirect lighting Pass I

2263
02:01:57,770 --> 02:02:13,640
think so for example is that what it's

2264
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:13,640
called

2265
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:32,930
and I don't know I have no idea how

2266
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:36,920
enlighten works

2267
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:38,630
I know literally nothing about it so you

2268
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:41,329
know take this with a massive grain of

2269
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:44,000
salt because we are probably very

2270
02:02:41,329 --> 02:02:49,399
different in terms of how we work than

2271
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:51,859
they are but so here's an example of

2272
02:02:49,399 --> 02:02:54,409
rate of how their system works sort of a

2273
02:02:51,859 --> 02:02:55,969
little bit anyway here's a direct

2274
02:02:54,409 --> 02:02:58,189
lighting pass from the engine which they

2275
02:02:55,970 --> 02:03:00,860
can do we can't do it because for two

2276
02:02:58,189 --> 02:03:04,219
reasons one we don't limit the number of

2277
02:03:00,859 --> 02:03:05,960
lights in the scene and to their direct

2278
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:09,710
they have real geometry so they can do a

2279
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:11,659
real direct lighting pass right so they

2280
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:14,480
do a direct lighting pass and then what

2281
02:03:11,659 --> 02:03:17,569
they do is they take at various points

2282
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:19,459
in the scene and they record what the

2283
02:03:17,569 --> 02:03:22,159
direct lighting was at those points

2284
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:23,539
right and then here you go the main

2285
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:25,159
runtime for a certain lightness to map a

2286
02:03:23,539 --> 02:03:26,630
point sample description of the lighting

2287
02:03:25,159 --> 02:03:29,239
over the target mesh surface which is

2288
02:03:26,630 --> 02:03:30,859
this - a light map or light probe output

2289
02:03:29,239 --> 02:03:31,909
this is the bounce

2290
02:03:30,859 --> 02:03:35,269
anything you could stress in these terms

2291
02:03:31,909 --> 02:03:37,189
has valid input to enlighten right and

2292
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:43,190
so here's what enlightened outputs now

2293
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:48,649
looks familiar right yeah I mean that's

2294
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:50,929
a lot like what we get you know and so

2295
02:03:48,649 --> 02:03:52,639
then it goes ahead and reconstructs that

2296
02:03:50,930 --> 02:03:55,190
in a way which is what we're working on

2297
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:58,190
now how to reconstruct our version of

2298
02:03:55,189 --> 02:04:03,859
this to something that's smooth for what

2299
02:03:58,189 --> 02:04:06,049
we want and you know I don't know how

2300
02:04:03,859 --> 02:04:07,339
they're doing that exactly but I assume

2301
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:07,850
they're doing it roughly how we're doing

2302
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:10,850
it

2303
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:12,500
directional irradiance between first

2304
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:14,210
full spherical output for the spherical

2305
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:15,170
harmonics at a point so you know who

2306
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:17,270
knows what's out with the ring but

2307
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:18,529
anyway then they composite that with the

2308
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:23,450
actual scene geometry and they get that

2309
02:04:18,529 --> 02:04:24,800
right so in terms of what we're like now

2310
02:04:23,449 --> 02:04:29,750
we're kind of just like a high-end

2311
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:31,100
radiosity thing at the moment how well

2312
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:33,079
would that work for our 2-d game I don't

2313
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:36,590
know but it's doing nicely distribution

2314
02:04:33,079 --> 02:04:37,670
so I'm kind of happy with it why use in

2315
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:38,750
citing the application for a toboggan

2316
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:40,250
when you already use Visual Studio

2317
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:42,619
proceed view code debugging why not just

2318
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:43,069
use insight in Visual Studio because the

2319
02:04:42,619 --> 02:04:44,840
NSA

2320
02:04:43,069 --> 02:04:47,090
Visual Studio is really like finicky and

2321
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:50,000
like I don't like having to deal with

2322
02:04:47,090 --> 02:04:51,619
the same panels I just want a thing

2323
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,149
that's like laid out for graphics the

2324
02:04:51,618 --> 02:04:55,880
bugging only and it's optimized for that

2325
02:04:53,149 --> 02:04:59,238
so I would prefer an external tool if

2326
02:04:55,880 --> 02:05:01,279
possible and that's what that gives me

2327
02:04:59,238 --> 02:05:03,348
so I kind of like that I know a lot of

2328
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:06,170
people like I des I don't know why they

2329
02:05:03,349 --> 02:05:09,590
like ideas I can't stand them typically

2330
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:12,859
I like to have a tool for that job that

2331
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:15,650
I can rely on and works reliably for

2332
02:05:12,859 --> 02:05:17,988
that job I don't like everything crammed

2333
02:05:15,649 --> 02:05:19,759
into one thing and then it's like okay

2334
02:05:17,988 --> 02:05:21,649
this view may be right for debugging but

2335
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:23,719
now when I want to do insight all of a

2336
02:05:21,649 --> 02:05:26,238
sudden it's like jammed into it and

2337
02:05:23,719 --> 02:05:28,609
weird and it's using the same key

2338
02:05:26,238 --> 02:05:29,269
combinations which are wrong for what I

2339
02:05:28,609 --> 02:05:31,429
might want

2340
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:32,810
I like having different contexts for

2341
02:05:31,429 --> 02:05:35,359
different operations

2342
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:38,329
I'm not debugging code when I'm

2343
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:40,339
debugging graphics almost ever right

2344
02:05:38,328 --> 02:05:42,500
because they're just not similar one is

2345
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:45,529
running on GPU once ring a CPU and only

2346
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:47,479
sometimes do the twixt meet so typically

2347
02:05:45,529 --> 02:05:50,269
I'm trying to do a specific task and I

2348
02:05:47,479 --> 02:05:52,399
want something that's designed just for

2349
02:05:50,270 --> 02:05:57,320
that test I switch to and is optimized

2350
02:05:52,399 --> 02:05:59,269
for that purpose right have you

2351
02:05:57,319 --> 02:06:01,099
considered baking shadows we cannot

2352
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:04,969
really bake shadows in that way because

2353
02:06:01,099 --> 02:06:07,159
we are procedurally generated so we can

2354
02:06:04,969 --> 02:06:10,429
do some baking of shadows if we wanted

2355
02:06:07,158 --> 02:06:13,009
to have some static geometry or

2356
02:06:10,429 --> 02:06:14,599
something but I mean but also the lights

2357
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:15,610
are all moving around I mean I just

2358
02:06:14,599 --> 02:06:17,929
don't even know what that would mean

2359
02:06:15,609 --> 02:06:21,039
right it see I don't really think you

2360
02:06:17,929 --> 02:06:21,039
could make shadows in this case

2361
02:06:26,349 --> 02:06:30,190
do you think there's a small number of

2362
02:06:27,789 --> 02:06:32,979
the number that the number of small draw

2363
02:06:30,189 --> 02:06:34,598
calls might be causing GPGPU occupancy

2364
02:06:32,979 --> 02:06:36,459
issues can't remember if we saw

2365
02:06:34,599 --> 02:06:39,369
occupation in sight

2366
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:41,770
so that the small number of draw calls

2367
02:06:39,368 --> 02:06:44,828
is gonna cause a lot of unnecessary

2368
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:48,400
driver overhead period and we should get

2369
02:06:44,828 --> 02:06:49,809
rid of it and we probably will so I

2370
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:52,500
would say it's not really necessary to

2371
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:55,449
look into it particularly much because

2372
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:57,399
it's just a unnecessary thing that I

2373
02:06:55,448 --> 02:07:08,559
think I've decided I want to get rid of

2374
02:06:57,399 --> 02:07:11,078
anyway and so we probably will show what

2375
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:14,440
the game looks like now oh dude were you

2376
02:07:11,078 --> 02:07:15,670
not okay I mean did we have been running

2377
02:07:14,439 --> 02:07:22,719
the game when we've been testing the

2378
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:28,420
lighting so this is our little test area

2379
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:30,010
that we're working on here and we you

2380
02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:32,560
know we're a 2-d game so it will look

2381
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:35,260
only it will only be visible from this

2382
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:37,539
perspective in the actual version of the

2383
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:39,579
game but we can use the debug camera to

2384
02:07:37,539 --> 02:07:42,789
inspect our 3d scenes pretty easily like

2385
02:07:39,578 --> 02:07:44,229
so right and so what we're testing right

2386
02:07:42,789 --> 02:07:46,630
now is we basically just attach this

2387
02:07:44,229 --> 02:07:48,638
light to where the player would normally

2388
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:51,340
be and as you can see I'm like moving it

2389
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:52,389
around to test the lighting because

2390
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:54,909
that's what we're working on at the

2391
02:07:52,389 --> 02:07:56,578
moment and so at the moment we've gotten

2392
02:07:54,908 --> 02:07:59,078
ourselves to pretty good lighting

2393
02:07:56,578 --> 02:08:01,149
solutions that we've got right here but

2394
02:07:59,078 --> 02:08:03,969
what we haven't done yet is and what

2395
02:08:01,149 --> 02:08:06,908
we're now moving to work on is we want

2396
02:08:03,969 --> 02:08:09,819
to reconstruct our lighting in a smooth

2397
02:08:06,908 --> 02:08:12,039
fashion so you know the lighting right

2398
02:08:09,819 --> 02:08:13,658
now is basically per block surface and

2399
02:08:12,039 --> 02:08:15,279
the block surfaces aren't shared

2400
02:08:13,658 --> 02:08:18,309
together in a way that makes the

2401
02:08:15,279 --> 02:08:20,889
lighting coherent and smooth and so what

2402
02:08:18,310 --> 02:08:22,840
we want to do is just make that happen

2403
02:08:20,889 --> 02:08:25,210
so that's the part that we're doing now

2404
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:27,250
and you can also see out here so the

2405
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:28,980
white blocks are blocks that are pulled

2406
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:30,969
in to the simulation but that aren't lit

2407
02:08:28,979 --> 02:08:33,250
and so that's another thing that we

2408
02:08:30,969 --> 02:08:35,739
haven't really done too much of yet is

2409
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:38,679
determine where the lighting solution

2410
02:08:35,738 --> 02:08:39,669
happens and where it doesn't happen so

2411
02:08:38,679 --> 02:08:40,079
we'll probably do a little bit more with

2412
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:43,140
that and

2413
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:48,510
future as well um I'm gonna go

2414
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:50,039
downstairs just cuz I can again you

2415
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:51,210
could see I'm really happy with how this

2416
02:08:50,039 --> 02:08:52,739
lighting is turning out I mean that just

2417
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:53,970
looks cool you get this rim lighting

2418
02:08:52,739 --> 02:08:56,340
here from where the lights coming from

2419
02:08:53,970 --> 02:09:00,060
downstairs up here is all darker now

2420
02:08:56,340 --> 02:09:02,220
right it's just really Pleasant and we

2421
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:04,440
do suffer a little bit from our

2422
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:07,560
approximations you can see like probably

2423
02:09:04,439 --> 02:09:08,729
that shouldn't be lit right now but it

2424
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:10,740
is and of course the reason is because

2425
02:09:08,729 --> 02:09:13,349
we approximate regional lighting and we

2426
02:09:10,739 --> 02:09:14,939
don't do a whole lot to fix that but I'm

2427
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:17,430
okay with that you know it's still it's

2428
02:09:14,939 --> 02:09:19,529
still again it lighting any real-time

2429
02:09:17,430 --> 02:09:21,990
lighting is an approximation always and

2430
02:09:19,529 --> 02:09:24,840
you're gonna get glitches I don't mind

2431
02:09:21,989 --> 02:09:25,139
those kind of glitches I'm fine with

2432
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:26,340
that

2433
02:09:25,140 --> 02:09:28,500
because it still does the right

2434
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:31,199
character right it still it still

2435
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:39,119
provides the character that I want in

2436
02:09:31,199 --> 02:09:42,079
this case right so all right I think

2437
02:09:39,119 --> 02:09:42,079
we're all done

2438
02:09:53,109 --> 02:10:02,839
all righty do you think like yeah I 3d I

2439
02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:05,600
was for things like HR drawers

2440
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:06,949
I just want just blocks and the block

2441
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:09,020
can have textures on the sides of them

2442
02:10:06,949 --> 02:10:11,389
but just blocks and sprites are the only

2443
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:12,920
two things we'll have so in some sense

2444
02:10:11,390 --> 02:10:14,570
the doors will probably be blocks which

2445
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:16,819
means they are 3d objects but they won't

2446
02:10:14,569 --> 02:10:19,489
be like special 3d objects like they

2447
02:10:16,819 --> 02:10:20,840
won't be modeled didn't like Maya or

2448
02:10:19,489 --> 02:10:22,460
something they're just gonna be blocks

2449
02:10:20,840 --> 02:10:24,020
so the only input to the game should be

2450
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:28,640
textures there's not going to be 3d

2451
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:29,050
models that get input if that makes

2452
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:31,130
sense

2453
02:10:29,050 --> 02:10:32,210
all right thanks everyone for joining me

2454
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:33,650
from the episode of handmade here at

2455
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:36,230
some pleasure coding with you as always

2456
02:10:33,649 --> 02:10:39,199
if you would like to follow along with a

2457
02:10:36,229 --> 02:10:41,359
game at home you can always pre-order it

2458
02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:43,369
on handmade hero org and it comes with a

2459
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:45,289
source code that I update every time we

2460
02:10:43,369 --> 02:10:47,390
do programming on it so that you can

2461
02:10:45,289 --> 02:10:49,039
follow along at home and do your own

2462
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:50,060
experimentation maybe you'll figure out

2463
02:10:49,039 --> 02:10:52,869
interesting way of integrating the

2464
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:56,270
lighting before I do if you are a

2465
02:10:52,869 --> 02:10:57,619
intrepid sort of programmer that's about

2466
02:10:56,270 --> 02:11:00,080
it for today I will be back here

2467
02:10:57,619 --> 02:11:02,210
tomorrow when I will try to do a little

2468
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:04,039
bit of world gem code to see how we're

2469
02:11:02,210 --> 02:11:05,149
gonna place those lights and so we're

2470
02:11:04,039 --> 02:11:06,890
trying to start to streamline that

2471
02:11:05,149 --> 02:11:10,309
process because the very next thing that

2472
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:12,140
we have to do after lighting is probably

2473
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:15,560
start working on the world Jen and art

2474
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:17,329
stuff to sort of build our worlds now

2475
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:19,610
right and actually get some worlds in

2476
02:11:17,329 --> 02:11:21,140
there that we can walk around and really

2477
02:11:19,609 --> 02:11:24,710
start to clean up the engine to the

2478
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:25,940
point where we're happy with it doing

2479
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:28,340
everything that we needed to do because

2480
02:11:25,939 --> 02:11:30,439
we basically like got all the components

2481
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:32,090
that we might need but they you know

2482
02:11:30,439 --> 02:11:33,879
could kind of benefit from now pushing

2483
02:11:32,090 --> 02:11:38,239
forwards and seeing what's going on and

2484
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:39,890
so we need to start start pushing that

2485
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:41,750
and so what I want to do is get the

2486
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:44,060
lighting tied into that part of the

2487
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:45,890
process so I think that's what we're

2488
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:47,270
gonna be looking at tomorrow I hope see

2489
02:11:45,890 --> 02:11:49,010
you back there for that until then have

2490
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:50,270
fun programming everyone and I'll see

2491
02:11:49,010 --> 02:11:52,360
everybody on the Internet take it easy

2492
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:52,360
everybody
