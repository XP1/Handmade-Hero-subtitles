00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,220
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:10,099
Hero the show recode a complete game

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:13,638
live on stream we are in the middle of

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:15,929
doing some some debug interface code and

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:18,868
really what I wanted to talk about today

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,448
is we haven't done anything in our game

7
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:24,028
and you know honestly we probably for

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,890
the most part won't ever have to do

9
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:28,679
anything in the game because of its

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,649
nature as a game that deals with the

11
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,140
concept of sort of focus or UI

12
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:36,539
interactions and the reason for that is

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,850
because this is an action game and as a

14
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:41,579
result you know I want the game to be

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,620
very direct control so I don't want a

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,149
lot of modality I don't want a lot of

17
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,299
things in the game that are going to be

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,890
about the sorts of stuff that happens in

19
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,238
typical UX design sorts of situations I

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,640
want you to be wired directly into the

21
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,919
character and off you go

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,469
so we don't really have much that we're

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,059
ever probably going to do in the game

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,250
that will involve this sort of thinking

25
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,319
but I wanted to take the opportunity

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,500
here in the debug system to introduce

27
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,509
this this aspect of the thinking because

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,140
the debug system itself does have some

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,150
modality of operation to it that we can

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,950
use to sort of discuss these issues

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,650
which are relevant in general UI

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,900
programming and by that I specifically

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,868
mean stuff like you know I'm moving the

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,049
mouse around and you know I click on a

35
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:33,239
thing and release and that toggles like

36
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,829
a boolean value you know button it's

37
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,649
like a radio button like on or off or

38
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:39,809
something like this or a checkbox right

39
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,780
but if I like hold down on that that

40
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,899
thing and drag maybe I like tear off

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,978
that thing and I can move it to like a

42
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,049
different place on the screen or

43
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,789
something right I'm making this up but

44
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,159
the point is you can see that there's

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,610
sort of like an interaction model there

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,939
where things are not hardwired the act

47
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,179
of clicking doesn't do only one specific

48
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:02,750
thing

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,969
the act of clicking initiates a

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,280
potential series of actions and what the

51
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,868
user does subsequent to the click will

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,280
determine what actually happens with the

53
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:13,939
UI element with which they are

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,939
interacting

55
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:20,459
in games typically in an action game

56
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,969
those things play out over time as a

57
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,800
consequence of interacting objects I

58
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:27,830
punch the barrel and it explodes which

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,270
sends a thing flying or whatever right

60
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,370
that is a cut the consequence of a

61
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,500
series of physically sort of like of

62
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,289
game code triggering events and so on

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,259
that are outside of the users input in

64
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:42,060
that way whereas in UI coding it tends

65
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:43,889
to be inside the users input model

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,140
meaning they are controlling that series

67
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,659
of events and only by looking at what

68
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,939
the user did can the system understand

69
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,530
what was actually trying to happen so

70
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:53,759
what I wanted to do is again like just

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,050
take a little bit of time this is not

72
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,669
something that will ever cover in

73
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,680
handmade here or later on to cover that

74
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,089
now because I think it is an important

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,550
programming topic and I wanted to just

76
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,620
say a few words about it so let me go

77
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,490
ahead first and motivate this just by

78
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,830
pointing out where we are at so if I run

79
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,689
things here you can see that we kind of

80
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,910
had a situation where we started making

81
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,159
a little bit of a debug output sit you

82
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,709
know thing here and some of these things

83
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,509
these debug outs of things are like you

84
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,640
know stuff I can expand or collapse like

85
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:26,099
this right and we haven't done anything

86
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,139
particularly fancy certainly but that's

87
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,579
you know where we were at and some of

88
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,559
these things even we're like different

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,900
kinds so like there was a 50 of value

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,009
and we wanted to make something where we

91
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,080
could start interacting with that value

92
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,949
and where we left it if I click on this

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,450
right

94
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:41,280
it just goes to an assertion here

95
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,229
because we haven't implemented any way

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,909
to interact with those because we all we

97
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:46,289
had was stuff where you can interact

98
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,439
with my click either it could like

99
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:52,620
negate a boolean or it could you know

100
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,329
expand a treeview element of a group but

101
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,340
if it was any other kind of item that

102
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,350
might have like you know a value range

103
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,840
to it we didn't really have any way of

104
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:02,609
interacting with that thing and so if

105
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,530
the reason for that of course right is

106
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,000
because we haven't talked about at all

107
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,289
about how we might do user processing or

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,669
any of that sort of stuff so all we just

109
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,609
had was just a click and that's all we

110
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,319
we could do so what I'd like to do again

111
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,640
is like talk a little bit about the

112
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,290
structure here and then start to

113
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,659
implement some things so that we can

114
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,850
have a more coherent concept of how we

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,099
might deal with interaction in the debug

116
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,289
system and we won't go too far with it

117
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:26,189
because again it's really not going to

118
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:27,360
be saying that's going to be in the game

119
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,399
so we don't

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,870
it's probably not even something that I

121
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,158
might even spend any time on in reality

122
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,780
here but because this is an educational

123
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,860
stream I thought it was a good

124
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,418
opportunity to talk about this a little

125
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,669
bit and I think it's something people

126
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:42,709
should kind of have a reasonable

127
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:47,219
understanding of right so here we are

128
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:55,649
here's day 196 and this is sort of like

129
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:58,440
UI input processing all right so you've

130
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:01,318
seen me do some very rudimentary input

131
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,519
processing and it's the kind of input

132
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,650
processing that a lot of people

133
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,288
associated with the i''m GUI style stuff

134
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:13,589
right which I am constantly asked about

135
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:15,149
and in general what what I mean by the

136
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:18,239
type of thing people associate with it

137
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:21,598
is they often associate I am doing stop

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,079
processing with like single like single

139
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:27,718
execution model I guess I would say

140
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:30,628
right and what that means is if I have

141
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:33,930
something like a checkbox and I've got a

142
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,370
thing next to that checkbox and what I'm

143
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,930
going to do with this checkbox is I

144
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,120
click on the checkbox and it checks it

145
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,139
and I click on them again a bit like I'm

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,430
checks it or something like that

147
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,680
right that's the interaction model I

148
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,718
have then typically what ends up

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,139
happening is in I am GUI you will see

150
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:50,968
something where they'll do like you know

151
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,620
or they won't even do if checkbox like I

152
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:57,028
said it's a checkbox they'll just call

153
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,848
checkbox right and then inside this

154
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:01,589
check box routine it will do something

155
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:03,360
where it decides you know is the mouse

156
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:05,818
in here and has it clicked and if it has

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,580
or not it'll like toggle the check on or

158
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,379
off right then that's the most basic the

159
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,478
most straightforward way that you could

160
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:12,930
possibly implement this thing you know

161
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,139
what I mean

162
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,870
now there's a problem with this way of

163
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,120
thinking about things and that is that

164
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:27,000
it makes it rather difficult to decouple

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,860
the way in which things work with should

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,478
I say this it makes it very difficult to

167
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,538
to decouple the interactions from the

168
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:38,538
specific thing that is on the screen

169
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:38,538
right

170
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:48,060
so for example if what I wanted to do

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,490
instead was I was had some kind of a

172
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,829
selection paradigm so I wanted to like

173
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,439
select this thing and maybe I had like a

174
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:58,620
tool box over here that was like my

175
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,290
check box tool and I had my selection

176
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,879
arrow tool and if I was on the arrow

177
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,860
tool when I clicked on this it was

178
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,500
should select it and when I had my check

179
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,560
box tool right I wanted to like check it

180
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,319
or whatever you know then what that

181
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,730
means is every possible tool that I

182
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,469
might want to implement or every

183
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,350
possible behavior that I might want to

184
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:21,900
implement has to get stuffed inside this

185
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,400
check box routine which means that the

186
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,709
person who implements the checks box

187
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,179
routine has to be the person who knows

188
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:30,629
everything that might ever actually

189
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,629
occur here right because the the

190
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:36,420
interaction cannot be written outside of

191
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,920
the thing that it actually that in

192
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,370
outside of this actual call everything

193
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,610
kind of has to happen inside there right

194
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,889
and so I just want again wanted to point

195
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,350
that out that is sort of the thing that

196
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,360
you've seen me do so far and I don't

197
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,640
consider that I am gooey at all I just

198
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,319
consider that to be one very simple way

199
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,339
of implementing interaction processing

200
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,370
that really has nothing to do with

201
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,359
whether your immediate mode or not and

202
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,730
specifically the reason that I say that

203
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,069
is because I am GUI the immediate mode

204
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,110
part of I am GUI is only talking about

205
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,300
the fact that these things are announced

206
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,350
by the code and it does not talk about

207
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,030
the fact that the thing that has

208
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,260
announced had to be checkbox right

209
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:18,509
instead what could have been announced

210
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:23,189
here with some generic thing that's just

211
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:25,740
saying like I have a boolean right it

212
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:27,360
has this information about it and I'm

213
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,430
not going to say anything about how I

214
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,530
want you to process it as a UI element I

215
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,409
may just be putting these things into a

216
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,598
batch right as part of the I am pass

217
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,129
through that buffers up all the

218
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,500
information about what ended up on the

219
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:42,418
screen and then it could have a totally

220
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,340
separate set of code where people have

221
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:45,809
implemented different tools which will

222
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,300
then scan through this batch and do

223
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,669
things right because there's nothing

224
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,959
inherent about the immediate mode nature

225
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:55,409
of the UI

226
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,120
requires you to not do this right the

227
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,879
immediate mode nature is just about the

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,740
fact that the calling code it doesn't

229
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,350
have to save like a pointer it doesn't

230
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,960
have to call a create function to create

231
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,180
some kind of a widget it just announces

232
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,210
the things that it has and it just does

233
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,589
them in a passive it's done now what it

234
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,050
announces on the other hand is totally

235
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,460
up to it and again that's one of the big

236
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:19,019
reasons I say like most people don't

237
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,519
seem to conceptualize I am GUI the way

238
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:27,659
that I had intended not that I really

239
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,009
care but that's just part of it so what

240
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,139
I'm going to kind of show here as we

241
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:34,110
develop our debug you a little bit more

242
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,819
I'm going to current try to show you a

243
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,480
little bit of how you might structure

244
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,700
your code in such a way as to avoid this

245
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,500
kind of a thing just because I'm

246
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,870
assuming that everyone could find

247
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,789
reference to how you do this and I've

248
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,929
already shown how to do it a little bit

249
00:09:47,789 --> 00:10:01,319
in the code so for example if we go into

250
00:09:51,929 --> 00:10:03,059
here to handmade debug oops so you know

251
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,950
we've got a pretty obvious situation

252
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:10,589
here this is an example we've got these

253
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,330
debug profile things on the screen that

254
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,860
we had been printing out and if you

255
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,509
press the left mouse button it would

256
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,590
just take whichever one you were over

257
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:24,080
right and it would do an operation on

258
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:26,720
that right that makes sense and so if

259
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,580
you look at how this code is structured

260
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,410
it's very immediate mode meaning this

261
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,990
thing right here goes through all the

262
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:37,379
counters it does a bunch of operations

263
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:40,980
on those counters but all it does when

264
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:42,950
it does that processing is remember who

265
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,080
it would have been interacting with

266
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,379
right like who is the person that it's

267
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,370
interacting with then at the end at the

268
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:55,470
very end it goes okay now I'm going to

269
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,659
just do whatever I want to do UI wise

270
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,040
and I'm going to use whatever came out

271
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,789
of the immediate remote pass as the

272
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,649
information about who to do it to and

273
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:05,730
what you can see if like what I'm trying

274
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,519
to say like

275
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,560
said kind of here when I was talking

276
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,289
about this what you can see there is

277
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,759
this is totally decoupled from the part

278
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:17,159
where you're actually doing that

279
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,769
processing the thing that knows what to

280
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,539
do with the UI element is a completely

281
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:22,679
different part of the code than the part

282
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:25,250
that actually drew it on the screen and

283
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,750
recorded the fact that it was there and

284
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,269
that's the way I tend to like to

285
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:32,850
structure my you is because with that

286
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:35,578
structure it affords you a lot more

287
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:39,750
possibilities for writing things that

288
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:42,388
work across UI element or in a broader

289
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,820
sense with the UI elements then if it is

290
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,139
baked directly into the operation at the

291
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,399
time because we could have done that

292
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,750
remember I could have done what press

293
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,480
was pressed I could have done that right

294
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,039
here right instead of storing the hot

295
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,370
record I could have done that right here

296
00:11:53,039 --> 00:12:02,189
but I chose not to and by comparison I

297
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,419
think we did it the other way in one of

298
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,610
these other ones here I can't remember

299
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:08,159
though let's see here

300
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,750
no I guess looks like I did it looks

301
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,429
like I did it that way in both cases I

302
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,220
did the debug stayed hot variable thing

303
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:17,129
here as well all right so that's okay

304
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,680
so I think it was only when we had baked

305
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:21,448
in here which we had when we had it in

306
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,250
in here before I think we did at one

307
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:25,859
point I think that was the only time

308
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,659
that I was doing it kind of in the older

309
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:35,659
in the in the sort of like more direct

310
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:35,659
way which I don't super love right okay

311
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:39,338
so that's the way that I'm going to

312
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,028
continue pursuing to do things but I'm

313
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,040
going to take it

314
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:45,278
slight step further right now that we've

315
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:47,980
got this and what I'd like to do is I'd

316
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:51,370
like to have a notion of the place in

317
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:53,079
which these operations occur and I'd

318
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,688
like to have a notion of what operation

319
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:57,818
is occurring so that we can make these

320
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:59,349
things like I can make things like some

321
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,818
way to interact with those real very

322
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,379
with those with those like floating

323
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:09,068
point variables or whatever else right

324
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:12,759
so here's how I'm gonna approach that in

325
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:14,919
here when I do my draw G bug menu I'm

326
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:17,379
gonna assume like we've sort of ad hoc

327
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,750
done so far I'm gonna assume that what

328
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:22,959
that does is that produces a piece of

329
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,139
information for me which is what the

330
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:29,349
mouse is over at this particular time

331
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:31,720
right and that won't necessarily be

332
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,069
something that I will use but it's it's

333
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,370
a piece of information that I want to

334
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:38,549
have and so if I go in here and we see

335
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,409
what how this is kind of working already

336
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:44,049
I've got this hot variable thing right

337
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:46,899
and hot variable gets set by draw a

338
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:49,149
debug menu right now what I do is I just

339
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,799
take that hot variable I see whether or

340
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,958
not it was pressed whether the mouse is

341
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:56,109
pressed and if it was I do the operation

342
00:13:52,958 --> 00:14:00,549
to that hot variable I want to again

343
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:02,980
move like sort of one step past that and

344
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:05,919
say that I have two things I have the

345
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:10,060
hot variable and I have the interacting

346
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:13,088
variable right and I might just say this

347
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:15,818
like hot interacting with write

348
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:18,939
something like this and these are going

349
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:20,558
to form the basis of my UI system so the

350
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:23,948
hot variable is the one that comes out

351
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:29,139
of draw debug main menu in here it will

352
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:30,490
set the hot variable like so and in fact

353
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,990
I don't even know now that I think about

354
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,308
it I don't even know that I want to set

355
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,188
the hot variable I think what I'd rather

356
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:38,139
do is actually just have this returned

357
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:40,269
to me who is hot or something although

358
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:43,299
you know what I guess I don't really do

359
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:44,799
that let's do it this way

360
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,000
we'll have the hot for April how the

361
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,599
attract available and I'll put one more

362
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,580
in here which is like next top and then

363
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,550
these guys they just so we set next time

364
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,440
right and I'm gonna make this systemic

365
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:58,240
so I'm gonna say at the start of our

366
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,510
debug you know at the start of

367
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,360
everything I clear it like I was sort of

368
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,250
doing here with the hot record we then

369
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,159
do stuff whatever the stuff is that

370
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,889
we're gonna do and that can set the hot

371
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:14,860
record anyone in here can can do that

372
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:16,958
operation of setting the hot record or

373
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,419
hot variable I guess in this point in

374
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:24,009
this case and then at the end we will

375
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:31,958
use that information to decide what we

376
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:34,360
want to do with it right okay so here's

377
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:36,338
how we're gonna do that and I guess I

378
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,389
could also do something here where we

379
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:38,589
just kind of pull this out so it's a

380
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:39,639
little easier for you guys to keep track

381
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:45,550
of what I'm talking about

382
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:49,088
right so I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna

383
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:53,639
put it in here and this is just going to

384
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:55,620
call it be like interact debug interact

385
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:00,220
and that's gonna take the debug state

386
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,100
there it is right nothing particularly

387
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:10,839
odd going on there obviously it's all

388
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:14,259
good so now I clear the hot thing always

389
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,899
at the start I do my interactions

390
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:21,990
whatever they are right and then I come

391
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:21,990
back through contract

392
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:30,000
debug state and I'll put past the mouse

393
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,950
key in as well and I guess I'll also

394
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,100
well that's all I should really but I'll

395
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:39,420
put the input is as well

396
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,920
all right so inside debug interact at

397
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,209
the moment we're doing this thing with

398
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:44,519
the left mouse button so we'll just

399
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,530
leave it that way but what I want to do

400
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:50,789
here is I want to start by entertaining

401
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:52,620
a few more concepts right so the first

402
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:54,509
thing I want to know is what is the

403
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,990
actual thing that I'm doing at this

404
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:56,970
moment

405
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,220
am i interacting with something or am I

406
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,180
not and so at the moment we'll do

407
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,680
something a little more straightforward

408
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:03,449
in fact you know it let me I don't

409
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,919
really want to keep dealing with this

410
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:10,440
summer's gonna put that up there and do

411
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:12,600
this so what I would like to do Vmax

412
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,000
will let me do this that'll be there we

413
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,859
go what I would like to do is say okay

414
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,490
first I'm going to check to see if I'm

415
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:22,740
interacting with something if I'm

416
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,109
interacting with a variable then that

417
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,259
means my I have a very specific thing

418
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:29,849
that I'm doing at this time and I want

419
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,970
that interaction whatever that act

420
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:35,189
interaction is to have primacy if I'm

421
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,190
not interacting with the variable right

422
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,420
then it's not such a big deal that means

423
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,970
I'm just kind of moving the mouse around

424
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,560
and everything's fine so if I'm just

425
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,000
moving the mouse around and everything's

426
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,619
fine

427
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,130
that implies to me that whatever the hot

428
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:52,979
variable was whatever variable I'm over

429
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:59,790
should become officially hot if you will

430
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:02,759
right but if I'm interacting with

431
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:04,649
something it should not be what that

432
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,230
then means to is once I'm in that state

433
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:10,140
I would like to say that if I start

434
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,339
interacting with a variable the way that

435
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,990
that's gonna happen for now is I'm gonna

436
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:15,569
click down on I'm gonna push the mouse

437
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,180
down on it right and so what I want to

438
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:21,589
do here is I want to test to see if you

439
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:26,130
know I'm gonna use went down as a thing

440
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:29,429
I'm gonna say if the button went down on

441
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:32,280
this frame then I would like to start

442
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:34,350
interacting with this thing otherwise

443
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,160
and I guess what I could do to here is

444
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,779
say you know

445
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,000
kinda wanna test a couple different

446
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,470
things so I don't know maybe I should

447
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,990
actually do this a little bit more

448
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,240
explicitly because I'd like to know a

449
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:50,640
couple things so I could say something

450
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:52,079
like if if you know clicked you know I

451
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,180
could I could have a click thing where

452
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,289
if they clicked down and up inside one

453
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:00,779
frame by itself otherwise I'd say you

454
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:03,029
know if it went down right so I kind of

455
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:06,500
have two different different sort of

456
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:08,789
ways I could think about that

457
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,700
so if I click something or if it went

458
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:13,139
down then I've got different things I

459
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,640
might do I'll leave this one for now

460
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,800
because again like I said I want to kind

461
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
think about that one a little bit more

462
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,139
but assuming that it went down so I just

463
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,240
started track this thing then what I'm

464
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,780
gonna say is okay whatever I was

465
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,759
interacting with or whatever I was hot

466
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,309
you know whatever I was hovering over I

467
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,869
would like that to be what I started

468
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:33,269
interacting with right

469
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:37,559
and similarly I'd like to say for now

470
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:39,089
again if whatever the button is that I

471
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,389
was interacting with there if that went

472
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:43,559
up I would like to go ahead and say that

473
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,310
whatever I'm interacting with will

474
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:49,980
return to zero I'm gonna if the zero is

475
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,349
out for a while I'm just gonna talk a

476
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,420
little bit about how this this works and

477
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:56,429
we're gonna keep kind of we're gonna

478
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,930
keep flying on this a little bit more so

479
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,330
first I need those utility functions

480
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,970
that I have there oh and I forgot I pass

481
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:06,750
this guy bunch of things but I didn't

482
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:10,019
actually make them exist just try that

483
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:14,480
again let's go ahead and get our game

484
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:19,349
input in our mouth feed

485
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,360
and get rid of cencon all right and so

486
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:24,929
what I'd like to do here is I guess for

487
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:29,159
went up all I really need to know if if

488
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:30,779
it ended down right if it didn't end

489
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,259
down then then we're not attracting

490
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,359
anymore

491
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:35,970
went down I guess it's really simple -

492
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,419
that's just did it end down and so

493
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,549
clicked all that really all I really

494
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,130
need to know for clicked I suppose is if

495
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:50,119
the half transition count is it's

496
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:59,820
greater than one you know handle puts

497
00:20:50,119 --> 00:21:03,750
inside a frame all right so what must

498
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:05,720
have wait to slice there we go I don't

499
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:11,460
know why I left that in there but I did

500
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,870
so if this is the logic for a button I'm

501
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,710
gonna make a little bit way for we can

502
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:18,569
draw it so so we can see it and I could

503
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,970
actually I suppose just also print this

504
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,349
out I could just make this be a piece of

505
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,799
debug text that we use so I could do

506
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,799
something like this

507
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,880
yeah I don't know if this actually will

508
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:33,769
work I don't remember if we actually

509
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,600
finished this stuff we didn't really

510
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:38,808
integrate it into our current thing I

511
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,599
think it's debug text line yeah if I do

512
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:44,200
a debug text line can I actually see

513
00:21:41,599 --> 00:22:04,669
what's happening here

514
00:21:44,200 --> 00:22:08,120
interacting hoops like so and not all

515
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:10,519
right so let's see what happens there

516
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,659
yeah cuz I can see that right there so

517
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:15,619
there it is so if the mouse goes down

518
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,558
you can kind of see how it becomes

519
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:21,079
interacting right and as I move it

520
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:27,549
around there it goes and then when I let

521
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:29,839
go comes off right like so all right so

522
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:32,178
now that I've got that I want to go

523
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,159
ahead and make you know the most

524
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:36,710
straightforward change here I just want

525
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,269
when i compare like what the item color

526
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,390
could be you can see that i'm using is

527
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:43,308
in a rectangle for that now imagine just

528
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,620
from what you could see here if i was to

529
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:47,990
go in and and want to edit one of these

530
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:49,639
and i click and drag on it and now as

531
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:52,130
i'm dragging around it highlights all

532
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,840
the rest of this stuff right you see how

533
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,520
that's happening i wouldn't want that to

534
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,779
happen right I want this thing to stay

535
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,029
highlighted that I'm interacting with

536
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:00,649
and so that is a classic example of the

537
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:02,839
thing that I was saying that I don't

538
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,300
want in here which is that a decision

539
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:08,799
about what should be displayed or done

540
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:12,079
is being made in line with the actual

541
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,839
immediate pass and that's not what I

542
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,178
want right what I want to do instead is

543
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,119
all the only thing that the immediate

544
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:21,530
mode path should be doing is determining

545
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:26,239
the information that will be used later

546
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:29,450
so in order to draw something as being

547
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,700
hot I exclusively want the rendering

548
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,769
code to test things that were set by the

549
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,470
controlling code by that interact thing

550
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:39,259
so I want to look to see if the variable

551
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,529
that we're talking about here was said

552
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:43,769
to be the hot air

553
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:46,109
variable by the actual UI interaction

554
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:47,940
code right so basically what I've done

555
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:49,139
there is I've pulled that out into the

556
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,430
way that I said I want to do things

557
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,650
instead of the way that we talked about

558
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,930
before and so if you look at what's

559
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,490
happening here right now when I interact

560
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,700
with something you can see that it locks

561
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,319
that hot thing in so now the interaction

562
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,509
goes on as long as it goes and only when

563
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,079
I let go of the mouse does the heat does

564
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:08,279
the hot things stop right

565
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,659
so again just pulling that out and

566
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,549
putting that into the interaction code

567
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,470
so that it can be decoupled its separate

568
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:15,509
in a way that allows me to iterate on it

569
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,579
as sort of its own separate thing that

570
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,230
doesn't require specifically being

571
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:29,909
coupled to each individual drawable

572
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:34,220
thing right ok so if I continue down

573
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:37,920
this path what I would like to do now is

574
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,779
I would like to say ok if the half

575
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,759
transition count you know if someone

576
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,990
clicks on something inside a frame you

577
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,450
can kind of see what I've set up here

578
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,880
here's the beginning of the click here's

579
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,039
the end of the click so what I'd like to

580
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:55,230
do is be able to do those two things if

581
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:57,509
there is a click a whole click inside a

582
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,240
frame I'd like it to do both of those

583
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:02,339
things right and so there's two ways I

584
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,170
can do that one way I can do that is I

585
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:05,730
can just make functions right and maybe

586
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,250
that's a good way to do it so we'll try

587
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,650
that so you know we'll do something like

588
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:15,240
begin interact or something and then

589
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,950
debug and interact something like that

590
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:24,059
and what I can do there is say all right

591
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:26,750
this is debug begin interact and this up

592
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:33,000
here is going to be debug and interact

593
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:37,319
like so and then what I could say is

594
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,750
well you know if I get a click inside

595
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,549
one frame then what I would like to do

596
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:46,049
is I'd like to just go ahead and process

597
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:50,579
the mode right I just want to do

598
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:52,950
whatever would have happened now you

599
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:54,558
know again this was kind of because we

600
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,929
chose a simplified model for the

601
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,378
we the user-interface thing happened

602
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:02,570
here we could even go a little bit a

603
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:04,248
little bit more hog-wild right we could

604
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:07,519
do something where we actually count

605
00:26:04,249 --> 00:26:10,610
down that number we actually like to go

606
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,829
go further down that number so we know

607
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:16,069
you know if the thing ended down or

608
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:17,689
whatever we could sort of say all right

609
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:19,700
however many of the half transition

610
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,788
count however much the half transition

611
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:26,889
count was let's get it down to zero or

612
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:26,888
one so we could do something like this

613
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:39,829
right so we're gonna say this is how

614
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:43,189
many times the button went up or you

615
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:46,099
know up or down we're going to say that

616
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:49,820
until you know as long as it's gonna be

617
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:50,928
above one I want to process a click so

618
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:53,950
if the user was like wailing on the

619
00:26:50,929 --> 00:27:01,070
mouse button i gona process clicks right

620
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:04,009
and then would have gotten to the end of

621
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:06,109
that presumably I would then want to

622
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:08,329
also say okay now we're down to zero one

623
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:11,538
clicks if the if zero one transitions at

624
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:13,908
that one transition what I may want to

625
00:27:11,538 --> 00:27:16,490
do is if it ended down go into the

626
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:20,090
actual direction there right it makes

627
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:24,440
sense so that seems pretty

628
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:25,548
straightforward right I suppose so I

629
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,690
could do that the other thing that's

630
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:29,569
interesting is if I was already

631
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,700
interacting with something maybe I want

632
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:32,960
to to support that case as well right

633
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,639
maybe I want to support the case where

634
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,679
I've already interacted something and

635
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:38,209
the users wailing on the button for some

636
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,288
reason that we don't necessarily know

637
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,690
what it is right and so I can go in

638
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:47,210
there and also presumably do that right

639
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:50,600
I could say something like all right I

640
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,740
want to do this sort of a thing where I

641
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:55,759
just go through like how many

642
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:58,460
transitions were there you know and I'll

643
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,558
do you know you you could even imagine

644
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,190
do it doing it this way where I don't

645
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,778
even actually have any sort of logic to

646
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,140
it I could do something where I'm

647
00:28:05,778 --> 00:28:12,319
literally just

648
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:14,660
switching the order right that would

649
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,710
process all of the clicks that come

650
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,779
through by doing ends begins instead of

651
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,400
by doing begins ends and then at the end

652
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:25,460
it would still do the closed processing

653
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,310
so you could do that pretty

654
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,519
straightforward and really it just is

655
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:33,319
you know yeah it's really not that

656
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,109
complicated it's not particularly

657
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:39,950
interesting the other thing I suppose I

658
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:41,539
could do is I could make it so that I

659
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,090
actually I feel like you could even

660
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:46,039
collapse this a little bit more

661
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:49,000
straightforwardly right if I just said

662
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:52,460
inside the loop for every transition I

663
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,599
could just say well whatever the

664
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,890
transition was going to be now no and

665
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:00,139
yeah you know what you can't really do

666
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,250
that I'm gonna take that back so I could

667
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,509
do something like that I don't know if I

668
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,670
really want to I do it real life it's

669
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:06,559
really necessary if you have a standard

670
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,029
event system for passing things in you

671
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,309
could see that you just do a for loop

672
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:11,930
here and you do these inside of the for

673
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:14,149
loop but we went with a simplified

674
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:17,000
system that just passes a single known

675
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:21,769
state down and doesn't try to do

676
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,250
anything more fancy with it right so

677
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:28,430
it's hard to say but either way it

678
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,470
doesn't really matter I don't think very

679
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:32,269
much for our particular purposes because

680
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:39,410
if since it's only people code but it's

681
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:42,139
something to be aware of all right so

682
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:45,470
yeah if we have that now I've got the

683
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,210
ability to sort of know exactly what's

684
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,180
going on here in terms of debug begins

685
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,620
and ends interacts right and the other

686
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,630
thing that I would want to know is I

687
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:55,429
want to know every time the mouse moves

688
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,140
so after we've done all this stuff right

689
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,310
or maybe perhaps we even want to do it

690
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,470
before we want to assume that Mouse

691
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:01,909
moves happen before the click it's up to

692
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,680
us to decide again since we aren't

693
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,330
looking at them sort of in some kind of

694
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,759
event order that's been serialized for

695
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:10,009
us on the platform side we kind of go

696
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,319
scare like okay we can do it in either

697
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,759
order that we want so maybe what we do

698
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:19,519
here is we just say all right we also

699
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:21,200
have debug you know I guess you know we

700
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,319
could just say this is our debug move

701
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,240
interact right here and so if we are at

702
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,439
the point where we're interacting with

703
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,370
something if we're not interacting with

704
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,690
anything I don't think we really have to

705
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,459
do anything if we are interacting with

706
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:35,058
something we would process the mouse

707
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,380
motion in a way that would interact they

708
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:38,869
would do whatever that interaction is

709
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,440
right and so this is basically like

710
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:45,278
mousemove interaction right here and

711
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,860
this is like you know quick interaction

712
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,329
that makes sense so for the mousemove

713
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:52,579
interaction we really only need to know

714
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:55,220
whether or not this thing whatever the

715
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:56,148
thing is that we're mouse moving on is

716
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,490
something that we would actually

717
00:30:56,148 --> 00:31:01,129
interact with with the mouse that way

718
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:03,798
so whatever the interacting variable is

719
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:08,510
and I'll pull it out here into a into a

720
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:10,009
more simplified name so if we take a

721
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:11,898
look at whatever the VAR type is there's

722
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:14,839
only one thing that we actually interact

723
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:16,819
with at the moment in a way that we

724
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:20,898
would drag and that would presumably be

725
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:23,450
one of those variables that was you know

726
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:25,428
a real 32 or 32 or something like that

727
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,528
so I'm just gonna take a look at just

728
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:29,210
that one I'm gonna say okay if we were

729
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:30,980
moving the mouse I want to interact with

730
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,509
one of these and I want to interact with

731
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,849
it by changing whatever it's very

732
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:36,888
whatever its value is right so I want to

733
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:39,558
be able to say whatever the real 32 was

734
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:41,148
I'm going to take like some kind of

735
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:42,319
mouse Delta and multiply it by it and

736
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:44,629
I'm just gonna pick something random

737
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,250
here I'm gonna say zero point one for no

738
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,899
real reason whatsoever and then I'm

739
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,929
gonna take whatever the mouse Delta is

740
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:55,250
so I want to do like a demas be kind of

741
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:56,330
a thing like that and so the first

742
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,940
question would be well where do I get

743
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:00,138
the the DMS P again I'm gonna have to

744
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,240
difference it with the previous frame

745
00:32:00,138 --> 00:32:06,829
right so the D mass P would be something

746
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,298
like whatever the last mass P was and I

747
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:09,379
would take the current Mouse B and I

748
00:32:08,298 --> 00:32:10,720
just look at what's the Delta between

749
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,100
those and that's what I'm gonna use

750
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,980
again to drive those kinds of

751
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:17,898
interactions right at the end of

752
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,940
everything I would obviously need to

753
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:21,500
take whatever the debug state is I need

754
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,480
to remember what that last mouse key is

755
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,419
whatever the last must be I process was

756
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,579
I need to know you know so in order to

757
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:30,288
like figure out what I should do so in

758
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,398
somewhere in the debug state I'm gonna

759
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:33,119
have to have that piece of information

760
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:35,429
so again I'll put that here

761
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:41,519
with last mess P just so it's clear what

762
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:42,660
it is alright um okay so at this point

763
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,579
we're sort of getting a little further

764
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,410
but in order to get at that real value

765
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:48,449
right I have to be able to open these

766
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,160
guys up so I need to implement at least

767
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,840
one more thing which is I need to put

768
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,540
back in that boolean processing for

769
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,119
those guys you know and so what I need

770
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:59,730
to do is that would be an end

771
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,808
interaction I assume so

772
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,549
on end on interaction ends I want to do

773
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:08,549
the stuff we were doing before which is

774
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:11,308
this so when I end the interaction

775
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:14,849
I know that I've clicked already so what

776
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:16,250
I'm going to do is say okay whatever the

777
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:22,740
variable is that I was interacting with

778
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:25,049
which is of course this one and I guess

779
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:30,029
I should double check yeah this should

780
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:32,129
probably so there's one other thing we

781
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,960
should do here and it's the next thing I

782
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:36,600
was going to do something yeah like 50

783
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,740
minutes I got played a time okay go so

784
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm gonna do it this way first and then

785
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,429
show you and then switch it up a little

786
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,170
bit in a second okay so what I'm gonna

787
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:44,940
in in the interaction I'm just gonna

788
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:48,900
look to see if the if I had an

789
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,580
interacting variable right and assuming

790
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,610
that I did have interacted variable I'm

791
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:55,049
gonna get it out I'm gonna look at what

792
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:57,599
type it is and do whatever the thing is

793
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:58,950
that I want to do on that type then I'm

794
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,799
gonna clear it so we know we're not

795
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:06,600
interacting with it anymore

796
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:10,190
okay so off we go and I should now be

797
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:14,000
able to open things up which I can write

798
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,000
and see me doing it there

799
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:19,179
and now I'm gonna see about interacting

800
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,139
with one of these guys so I'd like to

801
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:25,989
sort of change that variable oh right

802
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:28,989
and I should probably allow our debug

803
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:30,279
end interact to allow things to pass

804
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:36,609
through that now don't need to be

805
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:40,269
interacted with oops yeah otherwise it's

806
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:41,860
gonna keep complaining so yeah if I open

807
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:45,969
up the camera here now we can kind of

808
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,500
see I can edit this value right like so

809
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,989
I probably shouldn't have tie it to the

810
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,340
Y probably should have tied it to the X

811
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:54,639
because it's kind of a little bit stupid

812
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,250
I suppose the way that I did it but hey

813
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,650
we got what we wanted anyway which is

814
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:02,230
that we can edit our debug camera and

815
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,880
you know zoom it in now and you can see

816
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,019
that we have the problem I was talking

817
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,410
about before which is why I saying I

818
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,969
think we probably want to make some

819
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:12,579
system that allows this to not have to

820
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:14,709
be not have to be compiled like it is

821
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:16,210
currently because that compile step by

822
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,039
the time Visual Studio is done compiling

823
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,690
we're waiting a long time it would be

824
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:22,090
nice for that value to just update in

825
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:24,099
real time right because there's no

826
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,329
reason why we couldn't do that so I

827
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:26,710
think at some point we probably should

828
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:28,509
do that but now we've got the ability to

829
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,670
modify these these debug variables and

830
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:33,010
it's pretty straightforward right so

831
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,930
that's all good so let's take this a

832
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,910
little bit further and look at this a

833
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:39,669
little bit more closely so right now

834
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:40,929
there is it a little bit of an odd thing

835
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,610
which is that if I were to click down

836
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:43,809
out here

837
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,570
right so I flicked the mouse down and

838
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:48,400
now I move up now you'll notice that

839
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:52,000
things get kind of a little bit strange

840
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:56,829
right it's kind of unusual what happens

841
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,530
and the reason right is because we are

842
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:02,650
not able to go into an interacting state

843
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,480
if we are interacting with nothing so

844
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,000
when I click down out here it's like

845
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,730
okay that the hot variable was 0 so the

846
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,530
interacting with is still 0 and so it

847
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,329
doesn't consider it having started

848
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,610
interaction but I really did if I click

849
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:17,440
down here and drag I should not then

850
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,910
start interacting with the very first

851
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,099
thing I hit which is what happens like

852
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:23,710
imagine if I do this right you see I

853
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:25,000
picked that up by just like rolling into

854
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,550
it with the direct so what I want to do

855
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,300
is I want to have some way

856
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:34,340
of having my interactions be a state

857
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,440
separate from the storing what is

858
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:43,640
actually being interacted with right and

859
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:48,170
so in order to do that I'm going to want

860
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:51,920
to introduce some kind of a notion of a

861
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:54,650
interaction state that's separate from

862
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,869
you know whatever else I might be doing

863
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,340
so in order to do that I'm going to use

864
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:00,559
an enum you could also use a callback

865
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,470
for this depending on how you want to do

866
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:08,199
it in other words I could do a type def

867
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:11,029
here for a function I'm going to do I

868
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:13,279
think I'm gonna stick with an enum for

869
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:15,650
now this really six of one half-dozen of

870
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,260
the other and I tend to prefer enums

871
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:21,430
over callback so most of the time so I'm

872
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:28,820
just gonna do like debug interaction

873
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:30,710
drag value and debug interaction let's

874
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,650
let's go a little hog-wild here you know

875
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,599
let's just let's go nuts let's say we

876
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,059
have debug interaction drag value and

877
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,969
let's also say we have debug interaction

878
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:47,269
well toggle value maybe I don't know

879
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:49,639
empty bug interaction ter something like

880
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:53,559
that so I'm just making some things up

881
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:57,319
here and we'll have debug interaction

882
00:37:53,559 --> 00:38:00,110
none and now I have some notion of

883
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,870
what's going on in terms of interaction

884
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,519
and so what I can do here is I can kind

885
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:07,099
of reverse the way that I've set this up

886
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:10,219
and I can say something like alright I

887
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:12,559
want to know what I'm doing right now so

888
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:15,649
I want to know what it is that the the

889
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,699
code is how the code is interacting so

890
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,079
I'm going to set up a thing here where I

891
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:22,960
just say I've got a debug interaction

892
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,909
and this is my interaction I'm going to

893
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,990
look at that interaction and say if I am

894
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:34,519
actually interacting at this time I'm

895
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:36,679
going to do one thing and if I'm not I'm

896
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,849
going to do another and so that keeps it

897
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,769
roughly the same way that we were doing

898
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,989
it before meaning the else Clause is the

899
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:42,550
clause or what I'm not into

900
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:45,099
knocking at the moment but I might go

901
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,720
into an interaction and you can see you

902
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:48,309
know that sort of doesn't change

903
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:49,359
anything here and I'll go ahead and

904
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:53,409
delete these who don't really care about

905
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,750
this the moment then up here if I am

906
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:59,019
interacting meaning I have an on it's

907
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:01,630
non none then I have various things that

908
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:04,360
I might be doing so what I want to do

909
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,980
now is I actually want to do these will

910
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,050
end up being sort of double switches

911
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,510
right these will basically be I've got

912
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,830
some set of things I might do where I

913
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,420
want to switch on whatever the

914
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:16,059
interaction is that I'm doing whatever

915
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:19,659
the interactor is right so I'm just

916
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:27,460
gonna use I'm going to switch on this

917
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:30,639
interaction and I suppose now that I

918
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,329
think about it really I don't need the

919
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,769
if anymore

920
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,630
I suppose that was premature to say that

921
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:36,369
I can keep that I don't really need to

922
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,530
keep that right I can switch on the

923
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:44,829
interaction I can have the case of debug

924
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:48,180
interaction none that's just what I've

925
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:50,650
got down here right that's what happens

926
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:55,409
and then I can also have the rest of my

927
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:55,410
values happening here

928
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:08,090
all right now if I'm dragging a value

929
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,139
then the only thing that I really know

930
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,210
how to do is just do this particular

931
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:15,349
type which is real - it's real for 2q at

932
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:17,659
the moment so that's fine but let's

933
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:20,719
continue on reporting the rest of the

934
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:22,279
stuff so assuming that I have an

935
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,439
interaction none I might want to change

936
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,880
my interaction and begin interact or and

937
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,159
interact we'll we'll deal with that

938
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,079
obviously assuming that I was trying to

939
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,079
toggle a value or something like that

940
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:37,940
again I kind of want I kind of want this

941
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,409
click interaction thing to be shared I

942
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,450
don't really want to have to keep doing

943
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:43,759
it that's sort of why I was saying I

944
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:49,519
would like them to kind of be common

945
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:54,560
yeah it's such a hard choice it's such a

946
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:56,449
hard choice really I'm gonna go back to

947
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,969
keeping it the way it was because I want

948
00:40:56,449 --> 00:41:00,289
these guys to be shared processing and I

949
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:03,289
don't want to have to duplicate them for

950
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:04,789
every time so like I say guys my first

951
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:06,739
thought when I said when I said future I

952
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:08,960
was premature to call it premature let's

953
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:11,059
be honest because I do actually want it

954
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,400
this way so I would like to be able to

955
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:14,840
say like okay I know that I'm doing an

956
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,670
interaction so now there's just some

957
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,289
code in the movement thing that says

958
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:23,659
what I'm going to do in that case right

959
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:26,960
and and that's you know that's how that

960
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:28,429
goes so then I've got one in here which

961
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,289
when we're doing the drag value does

962
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:33,199
that the rest of these guys don't

963
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:35,389
actually care in fact I could almost say

964
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,869
that they don't actually do anything at

965
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:37,730
the moment

966
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,170
and then I've got sort of the other

967
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,719
things that might happen at the end of

968
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:44,780
that interaction at the moment something

969
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:47,569
like this then what I'd like to do out

970
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:50,600
here is say like okay when I do might

971
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,280
begin interact what I'm going to do is

972
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,139
I'm going to actually take a look at

973
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,960
what the variable is I'm going to decide

974
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:58,549
what I would like to do interaction wise

975
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,440
so I will take whoever I'm doing the

976
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,750
interacting with and then I will also go

977
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,579
ahead and take a look at its type and

978
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,159
I'll see what kind of interaction I

979
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:09,279
think is that I should do and so looking

980
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:11,230
at these guys right

981
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,750
I know how to interact with only a very

982
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:15,880
limited number of these so I know how to

983
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,500
interact with a pool 32 I know how to

984
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,550
interact with a real 32 but at the

985
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,679
moment I don't really know how to

986
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,580
interact with oh and a group at the

987
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,779
moment I don't really know how to

988
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:24,699
interact with anybody else

989
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:33,580
right I have a guys I don't have any

990
00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:38,259
idea so if I do one of these guys then

991
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:40,389
what I would do is say okay and you know

992
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,160
what I could also say here I could also

993
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:44,409
say that interacting with only gets set

994
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,869
in the case where the interacting with

995
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:49,239
type is known so I could do something

996
00:42:46,869 --> 00:43:01,650
like this where I say okay if debug

997
00:42:49,239 --> 00:43:06,099
state interaction then I said it right

998
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:08,980
otherwise I don't something like that so

999
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:15,610
for the pool case I want to do a toggle

1000
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:18,300
value that's the interaction we want for

1001
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:21,789
the real case I want to do a drag value

1002
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,590
and I suppose in in the group case I

1003
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:25,000
would also want to be a toggle and I

1004
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,220
could call this a different interaction

1005
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,300
but at the moment we know they basically

1006
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:34,359
mean the same thing right so when we do

1007
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,490
the end interaction again same thing I

1008
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,740
would want to basically say well what

1009
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,329
kind of interaction am i doing so I

1010
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:42,159
would say you know and I would also

1011
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,840
assert that this is true because of I'm

1012
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,210
interacting I better have one of these

1013
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:51,100
now so I'm going to say whatever the

1014
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:53,440
interaction is and I could still do this

1015
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:57,369
part I guess whatever the interaction is

1016
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:01,599
I want to do a different thing depending

1017
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:03,900
on the circumstance so here is case use

1018
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,900
case

1019
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:09,799
and here's the case and so if I'm doing

1020
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,570
a drag there's nothing that I have to do

1021
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,320
at the moment since since we could get

1022
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:17,119
rid of that one if it's a toggle then I

1023
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:23,019
know I want to look at which type the

1024
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,019
variable is and toggle it and yeah

1025
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:26,868
basically that's about it

1026
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,890
terr value we haven't gotten to yet so

1027
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:32,230
we'll talk about that in a second right

1028
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:42,549
okay

1029
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:45,349
so off we go or not what did I do wrong

1030
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:49,190
did I set the debug interaction

1031
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:54,500
incorrectly debug interaction

1032
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:57,289
hot type debug and interact interacting

1033
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,449
with because it asserted and said I did

1034
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:03,559
not have it interacting with variable so

1035
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:07,519
somebody cleared my interacting with you

1036
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:12,130
no way that Oh duh I also have to set it

1037
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,130
back to none at the end of this right

1038
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,210
okay

1039
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:25,910
there we go all right so in theory we're

1040
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,340
sort of back to exactly where we were

1041
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:31,429
before and we can still do the same

1042
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:34,430
stuff that we were doing and off we go

1043
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:40,219
right but now when I interact with

1044
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:44,389
things in theory right in the middle of

1045
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:45,559
my sentence even obviously we still need

1046
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:48,319
to check to make sure we actually have a

1047
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:55,039
variable otherwise it's not going to go

1048
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:57,260
well okay there we go one more time so

1049
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,940
now what I was trying to say is now that

1050
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,740
we have the notion of what interaction

1051
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,420
we're actually doing then if we click

1052
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:04,669
outside and move in we should be able to

1053
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,110
avoid this sort of thing that right you

1054
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,829
can kind of see like it moves on here

1055
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,530
and off you go

1056
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:11,420
right so what I want to do is I want to

1057
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,760
make it so that we have the ability of

1058
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,230
spécialité interaction so what I'd like

1059
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,080
to do is specify some kind of

1060
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:19,670
interaction that's just not doing

1061
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,860
anything like the person click that side

1062
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,420
and and they're you know just they're

1063
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,519
just screwing around I guess or

1064
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,019
something like that and we could do that

1065
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,420
in company of ways we could make it

1066
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:33,500
legal for one of our values to be

1067
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,990
something that you do right like I could

1068
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:38,300
make it legal to drag as a null or

1069
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:41,149
something if I wanted to but I'll just

1070
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:43,580
make something that's like you know that

1071
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,950
there I'll just make an actual type for

1072
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:48,590
it I think is what I'll do so when you

1073
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:50,269
begin interacting here what I'm going to

1074
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,430
say is like if it wasn't a hot variable

1075
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:57,170
then what I'll say is like you know the

1076
00:46:52,429 --> 00:47:04,069
debug state interaction equals some kind

1077
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:06,800
of like you know no oblem right it's

1078
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:10,100
just like it doesn't do anything and

1079
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,860
then in here when we come through I'll

1080
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:14,389
just do something like okay that's some

1081
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,410
kind of special case thing when the

1082
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:17,409
interaction is a no op

1083
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:26,719
we'll just get rid of that it doesn't

1084
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:28,039
have to do any of this stuff it doesn't

1085
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,629
have to rewrite the config file doesn't

1086
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:34,340
have to do anything so now I can have

1087
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:36,320
that happen and when they do that it

1088
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,700
just doesn't do anything and then when

1089
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,500
they let go it starts going again right

1090
00:47:37,699 --> 00:47:41,480
so I'm moving it out and it doesn't

1091
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:45,980
happen like so and then I let go and

1092
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,909
then back and back it goes right okay so

1093
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,730
that's again pretty straightforward

1094
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:51,889
nothing particularly weird there

1095
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:53,599
everything works back it's the way we

1096
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:55,219
planned it and the highlighting works as

1097
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,400
well and all that other good stuff too

1098
00:47:55,219 --> 00:48:01,789
right but now I want to do a slightly

1099
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,740
different thing I would like to be able

1100
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:05,719
to have other ways of interacting with

1101
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:06,829
the same piece of information right and

1102
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:10,909
I think I had about 10 minutes on the

1103
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:12,699
clock so I'm gonna go do it to 1810 so

1104
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:15,259
what I'd like to do is make a way to

1105
00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:18,679
like clone a menu item or something like

1106
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,730
this right and so what I'm gonna do I'm

1107
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:23,480
gonna do something kind of a little bit

1108
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,619
weird right but you know I like doing

1109
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:29,360
things that are kind of a little bit

1110
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:30,859
weird so I want to make the concept of a

1111
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,800
group I'm going to expand that a little

1112
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:40,990
bit I'm just gonna say that you know the

1113
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:44,560
debug variable group can maybe be in a

1114
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:52,509
location right like I can have a place

1115
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:56,119
you know a place where that exists right

1116
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:59,030
so it's like it's uh it's it's it's you

1117
00:48:56,119 --> 00:49:01,519
IP right it's where it where it is in

1118
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:04,370
the world in on the screen if you will

1119
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,619
and so if we talk about where a variable

1120
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:10,159
group is on the screen then what I'm

1121
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:12,109
gonna say is okay you know these if this

1122
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,059
variable group and and I guess to be

1123
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:15,410
fair maybe I should make it so that that

1124
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:17,239
that's sort of more of a first class

1125
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:20,649
citizen you know maybe I want to do

1126
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:23,119
something more like a debug variable

1127
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,460
like it's because the groups kind of get

1128
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,909
nested inside each other I want to talk

1129
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:31,278
about like a debug variable sort of

1130
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:34,509
collection something that's like

1131
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:37,159
a hierarchy rate a whole hierarchy right

1132
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:41,059
and what that is is that's the route

1133
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:45,798
group you know what I mean for this

1134
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:48,259
thing and the location at which that is

1135
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:51,139
drawn and they'll probably be some other

1136
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:53,630
things eventually right that we would

1137
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:56,838
put in there and so what I'll do is I'll

1138
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:59,059
just change this so that we have some

1139
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:04,989
bigger notion of what's going on there

1140
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:06,890
oops like maybe now I also in here I

1141
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:10,239
would do something I'm like okay

1142
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:13,818
whatever the debug variable hierarchy is

1143
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:16,068
you know that thing in and of itself can

1144
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:19,489
maybe we can have as many of those as we

1145
00:50:16,068 --> 00:50:22,458
want or something I'm not sure exactly

1146
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:23,749
how we would want to do it but for the

1147
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:35,028
moment I'll just say we've got one of

1148
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:41,418
those right like that and we'll just say

1149
00:50:35,028 --> 00:50:44,778
like okay the state hierarchy route

1150
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:49,808
group equals the context route group but

1151
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:56,329
then we also give it a you IP hierarchy

1152
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:58,369
copy so and that's going to be wherever

1153
00:50:56,329 --> 00:51:02,959
was that we were drawing this so it's

1154
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:04,789
like it's this stuff right and I think

1155
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:08,318
we might want to do that outside of

1156
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:12,259
debug create variables let's see here

1157
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:14,268
and maybe bug and you know I could still

1158
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:16,400
to be honest with you I could still do

1159
00:51:14,268 --> 00:51:18,558
something where I did something more

1160
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,289
like this I could still leave the debug

1161
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,909
group in there which seems like okay

1162
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:24,079
like here's the route group and maybe

1163
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:25,939
the route group is just something that

1164
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,829
always has everything in it and then

1165
00:51:25,938 --> 00:51:30,859
everything else we kind of play with

1166
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:33,519
separately something like that

1167
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:35,090
I could see that so we'll do it this way

1168
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,869
all right

1169
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:43,160
so after we create these variables sit

1170
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:44,779
here create variables then I'm going to

1171
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:46,399
do some stuff where we sort of set this

1172
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,620
group up a little bit more I don't

1173
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,329
remember where we actually set left edge

1174
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:59,359
yeah we set it up we set it up in here

1175
00:51:52,329 --> 00:52:01,039
which to be honest I'm not sure why we

1176
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,200
always set it up in there that's kind of

1177
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,909
odd but doesn't matter anyway

1178
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,710
so that's where we set it up so I'm just

1179
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:12,710
going to go ahead and use it there so

1180
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:14,090
left edge and debug state at why are the

1181
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,409
two things I actually need to know to

1182
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:25,730
set up my hierarchy so the hierarchy

1183
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:33,019
this guy I know that the group is just

1184
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:40,869
going to be the root group and I know

1185
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:44,690
that the location is just going to be

1186
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:48,289
what we already computed right and then

1187
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:51,139
when I actually draw this thing I'm

1188
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:54,230
going to just draw it you know let's see

1189
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:57,769
where we got him a config menu there it

1190
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:59,690
is instead of passing this thing or

1191
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:02,739
instead of this thing using the route

1192
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:05,659
group instead this thing is going to use

1193
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:13,189
that hierarchy right so it'll do

1194
00:53:05,659 --> 00:53:19,629
hierarchy group first child like so and

1195
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:19,630
for the add X at Y it'll use the UI P

1196
00:53:22,269 --> 00:53:35,960
like so says and that's a good point

1197
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:41,570
doesn't it's not what should get the

1198
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:43,490
exact same thing or not did I not

1199
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:46,430
initialize that properly I'm just trying

1200
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:52,279
to exact like literally the exact same

1201
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:55,730
thing I was doing before and I set the

1202
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,310
group and the uip I set them to the @y

1203
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:01,550
in the left edge which should have been

1204
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:03,650
correct and the route group is should

1205
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:05,840
still be initialized unless I maybe did

1206
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:11,210
something stupid there which could be

1207
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:14,990
the case let's double check label there

1208
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:17,889
we go so yeah I still set that group so

1209
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:20,899
I'm not sure what was the problem there

1210
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:21,769
why am I not seeing anybody where did

1211
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:27,710
everybody go

1212
00:54:21,769 --> 00:54:29,829
I guess we're gonna find out by stepping

1213
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:36,949
in let's find out where everybody went

1214
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:39,608
debug draw in here am I never calling

1215
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:39,608
this function

1216
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:50,079
let's see here I am calling the function

1217
00:54:41,920 --> 00:55:02,280
set set break point where is code for a

1218
00:54:50,079 --> 00:55:08,949
break point no no no almost there

1219
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:11,320
okay that's what I want so let's see

1220
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:18,879
what these values are and why we're not

1221
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:25,059
seeing what I want to see at X at Y does

1222
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:31,360
seem reasonable bar is a group ground

1223
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:36,670
chunks is there something not reasonable

1224
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:38,590
but oh oh dear did I flip did I flip the

1225
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:42,809
tube can I do something relieved right

1226
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:42,809
there somehow

1227
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:50,409
yep gotta love it well that explains

1228
00:55:47,769 --> 00:55:56,889
that that was anticlimactic

1229
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:58,179
to say the least okay so I want to stop

1230
00:55:56,889 --> 00:56:00,159
now because I'll do the rest tomorrow

1231
00:55:58,179 --> 00:56:01,869
but I just wanted to make sure that we

1232
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,489
could draw two of those and so for

1233
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:05,409
example you know if we wanted to draw

1234
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:07,000
more than one of them now we can just

1235
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:08,739
have multiple characters and draw them

1236
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,300
so tomorrow I can implement another

1237
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:11,949
debug function which is just to be able

1238
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,480
to like tear off one of the menu items

1239
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:15,339
and put it somewhere else for example

1240
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,500
which is just kind of a handy thing to

1241
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,490
be able to do and just kind of will

1242
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,980
start to show a little bit more about

1243
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:22,179
how to manage the interaction stuff but

1244
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:27,369
we have a little bit more ways to go on

1245
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:29,259
that so yeah so at the moment we'll just

1246
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:32,969
have to hold off on that and leave it

1247
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:37,630
till tomorrow for now let's go to the QA

1248
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:43,589
anyone who has a Q please put aq cool in

1249
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:43,590
front of it and I will do a I will a it

1250
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:13,920
I just want food once you finish making

1251
00:57:08,289 --> 00:57:13,920
the game you you do a live playthrough

1252
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:18,849
yeah I mean I'm assuming that actually

1253
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,230
while we are making the game we will be

1254
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:25,150
doing a bunch of playing through it as

1255
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:27,309
well right because I mean we're getting

1256
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:29,680
towards the end of the code we can do

1257
00:57:27,309 --> 00:57:34,509
that doesn't involve playing the game

1258
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:35,889
right we've got a few lighting things to

1259
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,830
do and maybe a little collision

1260
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:40,059
detection stuff to do but after that

1261
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:41,769
pretty much everything we do is going to

1262
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:43,570
involve playing the game because you

1263
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:46,210
know right after that the we're into

1264
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,830
world Jen and at that point you know we

1265
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,780
got a walk around the world and start

1266
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:52,690
playing with things in the world and you

1267
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,730
know we can't really do anything without

1268
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:56,470
interacting with the game so we're gonna

1269
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:57,519
be at a point where we're pretty much

1270
00:57:56,469 --> 00:58:00,189
gonna have to be playing the game all

1271
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:02,050
the time and you know we'll try to keep

1272
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,800
it to a minimum on stream in the sense

1273
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:07,930
that I don't want me sitting around

1274
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:09,610
playing around all the time and to be

1275
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:11,049
honest I don't really know quite how to

1276
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,000
manage that that well I mean I'll try to

1277
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:14,320
do the best I can because it's been

1278
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,230
relatively easy for us since we've been

1279
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:19,289
working on code that's primarily

1280
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:22,179
structural and like architectural

1281
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:23,980
implementation wise it's been pretty

1282
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:28,199
easy to keep it so that we don't have to

1283
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:32,170
do a lot of of like running the game to

1284
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:34,239
to work with it and I don't know so I'm

1285
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:40,269
hoping that maybe using the loop live

1286
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:42,099
code editing that we implemented you

1287
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:43,090
know will well because you don't want

1288
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:44,860
the stream to just turn into me just

1289
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,390
basically have to play the game a ton to

1290
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,559
get to various places and say okay maybe

1291
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,819
we should try this one thing and then

1292
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:52,119
there's like five seconds of programming

1293
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:54,600
so I'm hoping that maybe you know I

1294
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:54,599
don't know

1295
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,560
besides that we're getting close to an

1296
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:03,618
episodes how long do you think until you

1297
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,719
start on the game proper I don't know

1298
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:08,450
like I said I thought 200 days was a

1299
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:09,559
pretty good estimate or I should say 200

1300
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:11,480
hours or whatever was a pretty good

1301
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:12,858
estimate and I don't think we'll be that

1302
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,619
far from that I think we're gonna go

1303
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:26,779
over by a bit because I want to do some

1304
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:34,760
lighting and see that list no where is

1305
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:37,040
my list where is the list so yeah I

1306
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,950
think you know I've got a little more

1307
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:42,259
stuff I want to do in here you know

1308
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:48,439
we're doing this part now we did this

1309
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:49,940
part we did this part but we've got GUI

1310
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,590
you know the GUI the diagramming and the

1311
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,539
gooey stuff we haven't finished it we

1312
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:54,769
got to do that this is just a single

1313
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:56,690
debugging thing so I don't think that

1314
00:59:54,769 --> 00:59:59,869
would take very long particle systems we

1315
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:01,039
actually did although we didn't do you

1316
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:04,300
know maybe everything we could have done

1317
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,300
with what we actually already did them

1318
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,750
so really would just be if we did

1319
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:12,070
something in the renderer so really this

1320
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:15,500
is mostly what we're looking at here and

1321
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:19,250
then I think after that I feel like

1322
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:21,909
we'll we'll have to do I feel like

1323
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:24,409
everything else is gaming

1324
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:27,399
there's nothing else really in here that

1325
01:00:24,409 --> 01:00:31,329
I can that I can do without being gamey

1326
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:33,380
like we can't write a save game system

1327
01:00:31,329 --> 01:00:35,690
well I guess we could do we could do

1328
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,579
this multiple sim regions well but even

1329
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:40,490
that I can't really do until I actually

1330
01:00:37,579 --> 01:00:41,900
have a bunch of entities interacting I

1331
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:44,539
wouldn't feel comfortable probably

1332
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:48,440
implementing this so I would say

1333
01:00:44,539 --> 01:00:51,529
probably what we would do is start in on

1334
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:54,980
on constructing - basically - do these

1335
01:00:51,530 --> 01:01:00,019
two right here we was starting and

1336
01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:02,449
constructing a few game play pieces to

1337
01:01:00,019 --> 01:01:06,070
nail down how we want the collision

1338
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:06,069
detector and the Z stuff to work

1339
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:10,239
yeah III don't really see anything else

1340
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:15,130
in here that we can do with that game

1341
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:16,779
without game stuff I mean even even

1342
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,400
something like pathfinding I wouldn't

1343
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,950
feel comfortable actually implementing

1344
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:27,460
pathfinding prior to having the game be

1345
01:01:20,949 --> 01:01:29,109
gay me so yeah so I would say I would

1346
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,940
say pretty much just the stuff up here

1347
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:37,480
this stuff is all gonna require game

1348
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:40,090
game to be gamey and you know we don't

1349
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,679
we won't go hog-wild so you know I feel

1350
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:43,300
like we will want to still nail down a

1351
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,159
bunch of these things to a greater

1352
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,860
extent before we start like cranking out

1353
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:49,420
entities like just doing like it before

1354
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,450
we're right here where we're like okay

1355
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:53,650
we're just we're not thinking ever about

1356
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:55,000
the collisions of section protection

1357
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,039
anymore for the most part or something

1358
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,110
like that but I don't even really know

1359
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,489
that because it may be that we're

1360
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:04,030
constantly kind of going back and forth

1361
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:05,949
a little bit but yeah I'm pretty sure

1362
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:07,420
I'm pretty sure that basically like the

1363
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:09,879
only things that we could finish before

1364
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:12,180
game applying things this is up above

1365
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,180
here

1366
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:41,639
does this mean any proper orangie is

1367
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:43,889
around the corner

1368
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:46,769
probably not around the corner because I

1369
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:49,828
don't think like I said I probably

1370
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:51,858
wouldn't try doing too much world gen

1371
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:54,510
which is where we care about the RNG

1372
01:02:51,858 --> 01:02:58,650
before we have like a few rooms of

1373
01:02:54,510 --> 01:03:00,869
gameplay working well right so I feel

1374
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:03,539
like we're still gonna do this part

1375
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:08,130
first when we come in here probably not

1376
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:10,920
this like this part is probably more

1377
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:13,230
like that right but we're probably gonna

1378
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,230
do this first which would be like you

1379
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:18,179
know guy and some enemies in a couple

1380
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:22,650
rooms fighting and things like this

1381
01:03:18,179 --> 01:03:26,068
right so this this part I feel like does

1382
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:28,440
not have any orange enos to it for the

1383
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:36,230
most part so would probably be like that

1384
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:36,230
and then maybe

1385
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:48,650
I would actually say this probably if

1386
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:51,420
we're being realistic looks like this

1387
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:54,900
because the entity system I don't really

1388
01:03:51,420 --> 01:04:00,690
know why yeah why some of the stuff was

1389
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:14,280
laid out the way it was I feel like it

1390
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:17,809
probably looks more like this maybe like

1391
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,810
that's probably a little more realistic

1392
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:22,019
that'd be my guess it's funny that we

1393
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:24,809
said animation would lead into rendering

1394
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:30,449
but we did the renderer first so that's

1395
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:37,320
not true but yeah I also don't know what

1396
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:39,210
stars are so yeah I would say that is

1397
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:43,039
maybe a little bit more realistic in

1398
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,039
terms of how things would probably go

1399
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:49,349
but I don't know like I said it could go

1400
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:52,590
either way it's possible that this could

1401
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:53,849
go up here games are very hard to

1402
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:55,590
predict schedule-wise best if you're the

1403
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:59,610
only programmer on them so I don't

1404
01:04:55,590 --> 01:05:01,769
really know ElkY 144 did I already

1405
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:08,070
covered the minkowski difference on the

1406
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:10,219
stream I don't remember when we talked

1407
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:13,110
about the collision detect detection I

1408
01:05:10,219 --> 01:05:16,199
definitely did talk about the Minkowski

1409
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:17,760
sum I mean there really is this thing

1410
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:19,589
isn't a bouncy difference there's a

1411
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,080
mikowski addition of the inverse or

1412
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:24,180
whatever and I don't remember how much I

1413
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,730
covered of that we covered enough to do

1414
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:29,190
growing things by other growing shape by

1415
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:36,059
other shapes which is a Mackowski sum

1416
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:37,110
and I don't really know if I don't

1417
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:40,679
really know if I talked about the

1418
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:42,329
difference I don't think I would have

1419
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:44,549
because the only reason you talk about

1420
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:46,409
the Minkowski difference in the sense of

1421
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:49,350
like subtracting a shape from another or

1422
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:53,379
summing the inverse

1423
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:55,239
something the- the only reason you

1424
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:59,050
probably talk about that is if you were

1425
01:05:55,239 --> 01:06:00,489
trying to find the origin for like a gjk

1426
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:07,720
kind of a thing and we didn't talk about

1427
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:09,429
that so could you explain the difference

1428
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:10,569
between how our I am GUI is often

1429
01:06:09,429 --> 01:06:15,960
implement and how you think it should

1430
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:21,519
work again it went a bit faster me um so

1431
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:26,490
this is just one of the what things one

1432
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:28,750
of the many things but like one way is

1433
01:06:26,489 --> 01:06:31,239
the way that I wrote it here in the

1434
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:34,119
debug one right which is to say that the

1435
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:36,549
interaction code is separate from the

1436
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:39,069
patent the pass that does the drawing so

1437
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:40,990
these are like out here there this is

1438
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:42,870
the drawing right DUI driver menu it

1439
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:45,069
doesn't do any interaction itself

1440
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:47,829
instead all of the interaction is

1441
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:49,470
deferred to later by using the hit

1442
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:51,880
testing that happened in the IM pass

1443
01:06:49,469 --> 01:06:55,329
later on somebody will actually do the

1444
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:57,340
interactions and basically it's it's

1445
01:06:55,329 --> 01:06:59,319
splitting those two things apart that i

1446
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:03,039
think is was the part that i was trying

1447
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,480
to talk about so we could have shoved

1448
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,289
these in there right we could have

1449
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:10,000
shoved these into directly into here

1450
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:11,800
when we do or is in rectangle who could

1451
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,150
have done it here and i just don't think

1452
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,670
that's a very good place to do it

1453
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:19,090
because i feel like it makes it harder

1454
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:22,090
to decouple and make it's harder to keep

1455
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:23,380
the code organized with the parts of the

1456
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:26,200
code that you want it to be organized

1457
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:30,610
with it's in some sense it's just a

1458
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:34,710
stupid artifact of the way that you know

1459
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:34,710
procedural stuff works but

1460
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:40,440
I just find that I'd like to pull those

1461
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:44,630
two things out but that was the only

1462
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,630
part I was trying to elaborate on

1463
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:59,530
let's see a bur 173 would you ever

1464
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:01,359
consider doing a 24-hour stream that was

1465
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:07,030
create X app or game from start to

1466
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:10,239
finish in one stream I mean I guess it's

1467
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:11,950
not that I wouldn't consider it it's

1468
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:16,869
more that I'm not really sure what would

1469
01:08:11,949 --> 01:08:18,338
be the point of it so I mean I would

1470
01:08:16,869 --> 01:08:19,599
probably consider it and then go that

1471
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:21,039
doesn't sound like a very good idea I

1472
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,910
don't know I mean like I just don't know

1473
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,079
what would be gained by doing this

1474
01:08:23,909 --> 01:08:27,488
unless it was like you know like a

1475
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,729
publicity stunt or something I suppose

1476
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:33,309
where you're just like 24 hours can you

1477
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:36,419
create this in that time or something

1478
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,420
you know

1479
01:08:51,338 --> 01:08:59,219
not really singing anymore questions so

1480
01:08:53,798 --> 01:08:59,219
I guess we are done I guess we are done

1481
01:09:10,548 --> 01:09:29,960
all right let's see let's go ahead and

1482
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:30,859
see close please okay thank you everyone

1483
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,059
for joining me for an episode of

1484
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:33,920
handmade hero it's been a pleasure

1485
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:35,179
coding with you as always if you want to

1486
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,739
follow along at home you can always

1487
01:09:35,179 --> 01:09:38,539
pre-order the game on hammer you're

1488
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:39,618
gonna come to the source code so that

1489
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:40,609
you can follow along with what we're

1490
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:42,229
doing and if you want to play around

1491
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,429
with it that's a good way to do it we

1492
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:45,259
also have patreon page from ask about

1493
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,158
the video series we have a forum site

1494
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:48,170
you can go to ask questions get

1495
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:50,179
annotated so a guy and a tweet box which

1496
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:51,679
tweets the schedule at you if a track

1497
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:54,349
gets stream live and if you are

1498
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,389
connected stream live you can do that

1499
01:09:54,349 --> 01:10:00,139
tomorrow again at 5:00 p.m. Pacific

1500
01:09:56,389 --> 01:10:01,578
Daylight Time I will be back here and

1501
01:10:00,139 --> 01:10:03,770
I'm gonna make a little thing so we can

1502
01:10:01,578 --> 01:10:04,789
tear off menu items again just to kind

1503
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,650
of show how to do like different

1504
01:10:04,789 --> 01:10:09,439
interactions in one place and that sort

1505
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:11,299
of thing and then after that I think we

1506
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,189
may be kind of done with that part of

1507
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,690
things so I'd like to do is go ahead and

1508
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:16,488
move on to a couple of our two do's here

1509
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:17,779
maybe get the things working updating in

1510
01:10:16,488 --> 01:10:21,859
real time

1511
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:23,630
and and then integrate in our little

1512
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:25,399
profile logging system so that we can

1513
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:27,020
you know get all the UI in one place and

1514
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:29,000
be able to kind of maybe start to use

1515
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,440
that to interact with and scrub through

1516
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,349
our debug events which I think would be

1517
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:34,519
nice so just kind of start to pull

1518
01:10:33,349 --> 01:10:36,110
things together and now that I've shown

1519
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,219
all the different parts of it try to

1520
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:38,719
start to pull those things together so

1521
01:10:37,219 --> 01:10:41,539
that we can kind of wrap up the debug

1522
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:44,828
system and be relatively happy with

1523
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:47,149
where it's at in terms of you know

1524
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:49,039
having something we can use during the

1525
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:50,960
stream to debug stuff when we have stuff

1526
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:53,599
we need to debug or tweak things that we

1527
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,800
need to tweak so that's about it thanks

1528
01:10:53,599 --> 01:10:56,719
for joining me I'll see you guys here

1529
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,340
tomorrow until next time have fun

1530
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:00,670
programming and I'll see you on the

1531
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,670
Internet
