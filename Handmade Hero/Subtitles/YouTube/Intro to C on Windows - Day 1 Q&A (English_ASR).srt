1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:08,669
okay this is the question set for the

2
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:11,399
first enter to see video I am going to

3
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:13,080
take a look at the the stream now and

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,800
see if there are any questions that we

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:26,810
should answer right off the bat let's

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:29,910
see there is a lot of stuff there

7
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:31,409
Abner colum Bray how many videos do you

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,409
think you'll do before you actually

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,909
start coding the game so the game will

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:41,628
start coding on Monday and I guess it

11
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:45,089
depends what you mean by coding the game

12
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:47,759
because I will on Monday I will show you

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,370
how to do some things which is basically

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:54,570
the minimal Windows wrapper necessary to

15
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:56,070
run a game and so that might that'll be

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,170
about a week probably of me showing you

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,909
all those things and then we will move

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,039
on to actually coding the game the week

19
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,509
after that but you may run long I don't

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,719
know I haven't done many of these I try

21
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:08,310
to go very slowly because I know it's

22
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,569
stupid and probably boring for a lot of

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,368
people but my goal was to make something

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,519
that honestly fairly beginner people

25
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,859
could watch and so I would like them to

26
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,719
have enough information to be able to

27
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,769
take the things that I've said go do

28
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,069
some studying on their own and

29
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:24,629
understand what happened and so it will

30
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,399
go much slower than it would go if it

31
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:28,739
was a lot it's not going to be me live

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,990
coding a game it's going to be me live

33
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:34,728
teaching how to code a game which is

34
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,728
very different and it will take longer

35
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:41,420
arr GT what libraries do you plan to use

36
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,569
in the game development none absolutely

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,118
zero there will be none it will be 100%

38
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:51,419
from scratch

39
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,759
Xavier wreck what about Emacs plus Bing

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,170
W Emacs will be the editor used during

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,790
game development I will not be using

42
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,170
Ming yet I will be using a Microsoft

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,210
Visual C compiler but the one that you

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:08,098
can download for free works the same so

45
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:10,530
you don't have to pay for it let's see

46
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,819
here oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to leave

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,229
the

48
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:19,329
leave that window up let's see what's

49
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:21,069
the a in output debug string that's a

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,770
good point I did not cover that I should

51
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:26,349
have covered that so the a and output

52
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,080
debug string refers to the fact that is

53
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,139
taking an ASCII string and I think I

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:37,240
will actually leave a note to myself

55
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:38,649
explain what the a is next time so that

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,520
we will explain we will talk about that

57
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,010
next time I yes basically at one point

58
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,950
during Windows history they decided to

59
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:50,439
change from asking to Unicode because

60
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:52,599
they wanted to start supporting foreign

61
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,900
languages that could not be represented

62
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,099
using an 8-bit character set and I'm not

63
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,480
going to go into much detail about what

64
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,939
these things are because I'd rather

65
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,509
explain that next time on the main on

66
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:06,909
the mainstream so when this happened

67
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:09,909
they decided to switch to a 16-bit

68
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:11,799
encoding for Unicode and basically what

69
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,259
that is is it goes from 8 bits per

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,510
character to 16 bits per character now

71
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,039
the problem with that is that it's

72
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:19,659
completely incompatible with anything

73
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:21,669
that uses ASCII and the reason for that

74
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:24,490
is because there might be zeroes in that

75
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:27,909
string and in ASCII Z which is the

76
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,219
format used for C 0 means you've come to

77
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:33,310
the end of the string so they couldn't

78
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:36,400
really use Unicode by just passing a

79
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,840
Unicode by just passing Unicode to

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,580
functions that were supposed to take

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,800
strings and have it work which is what

82
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,380
happens with utf-8 a more modern Unicode

83
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,430
encoding made by the plan 9 guys because

84
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,099
they knew what they were doing unlike

85
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,659
the people from Windows who didn't

86
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,519
basically it means that all of the

87
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,500
functions and windows had to now be

88
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,840
multiplied so that they could take both

89
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,150
ASCII versions and Unicode versions of

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,620
strings now of course they didn't want

91
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,879
to make everyone have to now call new

92
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,250
functions they wanted old windows

93
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,439
functions to still compile so what they

94
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,439
did is they made all functions actually

95
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,689
be macros that switch based on whether

96
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,389
or not you are compiling in Unicode or

97
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,699
in ascii mode now this happens to

98
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,659
default to compiling in unicode which i

99
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,099
don't have a problem with that's just

100
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,410
what the what that's what Visual Studio

101
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,570
did when I created the project but what

102
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,700
that means is if I try to pass an ASCII

103
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,099
string which is what I had wanted to

104
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,659
pass

105
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,160
because I want to go look at it in the

106
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,689
debugger later and show you how the

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,400
string works that was something I was do

108
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:36,230
I will do on the next string I didn't

109
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,019
want to have to actually make a Unicode

110
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,810
string there so instead of going and

111
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:44,599
changing the compile type to be unit to

112
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,939
be asking said a Unicode what I did is I

113
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,570
bypassed the macro because the macro is

114
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:52,509
just output debug string and in fact I

115
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:55,759
don't know if you can do this in here

116
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:58,599
here you go look at that which sometimes

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,209
windows sometimes the IDE actually works

118
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,050
you can actually see what happens here

119
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,000
do you see these two function

120
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,050
declarations if you're a beginner you

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,100
may be a little loss because there's a

122
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,180
little bit much in here but they're just

123
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,070
like the kind of things we talked before

124
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,389
remember the void this is a capital void

125
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:13,099
because windows defined their own but

126
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,409
long story anyway here's that output

127
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,180
debug string and here's that output

128
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,939
debug string again but with a W after it

129
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,009
a stands for ASCII W stands for wide it

130
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,360
means wide character and wide character

131
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,219
was the 16-bit characters because they

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,160
were bigger there was 16-bit instead of

133
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,350
8-bit so if you look here there's then

134
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,520
an if def Unicode if Deaf's we haven't

135
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,470
covered yet but what they basically are

136
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,209
something that says only do the next

137
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,330
part if you're compiling in a particular

138
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,199
you know if this particular thing

139
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:41,779
evaluates to true and so this case if

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,789
the Unicode simple happens to be defined

141
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:46,309
if it does we're going to make output

142
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,480
debug string mean output debug string W

143
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,339
and pound define is a thing that

144
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,680
basically does word substitution again

145
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,089
these are all things recover much later

146
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,340
but if it's not then it will define it

147
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,869
to output Devo string a so you can see

148
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:58,939
that the actual functions are actually

149
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,470
all here so when you look up output

150
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,629
debug string you'll see a function

151
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,370
prototype for it in MSDN in fact I can

152
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,769
do that right now if I want to go in

153
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,139
MSDN and say output debug string you'll

154
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:12,009
notice that I actually get a function a

155
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,360
function declaration for it a function

156
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:15,469
prototype for it that looks like there's

157
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,930
a function called a perturbation but

158
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,610
there isn't that's just the name that

159
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,050
actually is the macro that resolves to

160
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,990
whichever one you were building on and

161
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,460
so I said well I don't want deal with

162
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,879
that right now so I'm just going to call

163
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:30,379
a directly because I know that will take

164
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,629
the ASCII string which is what I wanted

165
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,620
so that I don't have to do a pound two

166
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:35,589
five of Unicode oh they didn't want to

167
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,149
talk about that at that

168
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:40,509
their time hopefully that answers the

169
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:41,769
question for you now I got a scroll back

170
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,629
I'm sorry

171
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,609
twitch makes it very hard to answer

172
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,110
questions in a good way

173
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,040
so I'm going to scroll back here and

174
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,040
take a look

175
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,750
what is damage okay recursive Casey we

176
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,970
solved that okay how often will you do

177
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,129
these videos these videos will be every

178
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,060
week night at 8 p.m. Pacific Standard

179
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:06,490
Time until the game is done and I will

180
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,139
take some nights off if I have specific

181
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,449
things I have to go to or something like

182
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,250
that but in general most weeknights 8

183
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,259
p.m. there will be a programming stream

184
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:20,319
and I will explain every last thing

185
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:21,159
there is to do in making a game ok there

186
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,399
are doing ok

187
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,410
OpenGL DirectX or what so that's

188
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,579
interesting someone I think is asking

189
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,370
whether I'm going to use OpenGL or

190
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:33,129
Direct X for the game the answer is

191
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,199
neither I will be showing you how to do

192
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,600
all of the rendering yourself it will

193
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,029
not be 3d it will be 2d so it will be a

194
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,830
sprite based game it will be a high-end

195
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,209
sprite based game and it will be a very

196
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,439
very intricate codebase because a lot of

197
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:48,879
things I want to cover so it will be a

198
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:51,069
pretty cool 2-d game I think but it will

199
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,600
not be 3d and I had a lot of reasons for

200
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,430
that one is because I think that really

201
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,960
wants a separate series and so what I

202
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,160
wanted to do was do a 2-d game first to

203
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,769
show you all the stuff involved in

204
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,710
parting again except for the 3d math and

205
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:03,939
then we'll do the 3d math you know in a

206
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:05,829
separate series if that turns out to be

207
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,300
I really want many years from now and

208
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:10,000
this one's done it's going to be a while

209
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,020
but anyway yes so no DirectX no OpenGL

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,370
it will all be things that are

211
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:15,339
completely what happens at Apple on

212
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,860
every platform you will be able to do it

213
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,449
booting fresh out the BIOS on a

214
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,330
Raspberry Pi if you wanted to with

215
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,709
absolutely no libraries no nothing so we

216
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:28,870
will be we will be coding as low level

217
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:30,009
as you can get let's see fgc hype is

218
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,509
this the same visual studio set appears

219
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:36,069
you've the witness yes although I don't

220
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:37,720
edit in Visual Studio yes is the same

221
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,710
setup I used for coating on the witness

222
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,120
I don't really program much on the

223
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,620
witness anymore I'm just doing basically

224
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,179
maintenance work now and optimization

225
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,799
work on occasion when when there are

226
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,059
things that I can do in the code that I

227
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,949
wrote but I'm not programming on the

228
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,629
witness at the at the moment other than

229
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,269
a few chunks of time

230
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:55,958
basically yeah just support code that I

231
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:57,250
wrote for them that this stuff is gold

232
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,809
even to see some programmers sanction

233
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,839
kind of stuff oh well thank you very

234
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:04,479
much for the kind words I yeah

235
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,019
I really hope some people find it useful

236
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,789
I you know yeah thank you very much

237
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,350
are you going to be using the windows

238
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,000
and what up and gel for the game okay so

239
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,980
for the actual game again

240
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,860
no OpenGL no DirectX it'll be completely

241
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,120
raw and it will be all platforms so I'll

242
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,959
show you how to do in a Windows first

243
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,220
because that's the thing most people

244
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:26,379
have but I will do a adjunct week at

245
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,660
some point for Linux Mac OS X and

246
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,269
Raspberry Pi at least I don't know if

247
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:33,309
I'll do Android I definitely won't do

248
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,169
iOS because I hate closed platforms and

249
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:36,309
I refuse to deal with code signing so

250
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:38,409
that's not going to happen but other

251
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,969
platforms any platform where I can

252
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:44,110
develop and deploy an application

253
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:46,569
without getting it code signed I will I

254
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:52,659
would probably show you how to do

255
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:55,028
platform code for okay and see not a ski

256
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:57,879
windows API I'm sorry to understand some

257
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:59,438
of those I would say goal meant if

258
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,789
you're running testing the console can

259
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:02,889
the aperture missionary capture used in

260
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:04,448
some way okay idiocracy asked if you're

261
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:06,100
you running test that's a P in the

262
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:07,688
console can the output of output debug

263
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,300
string a be captured or youth in some

264
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:11,919
way the answer is not really

265
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,758
output debug string I only used it

266
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,948
because it's the most straightforward

267
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,149
thing to use when I'm doing a little

268
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,758
demo like that where I'm just trying to

269
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,549
focus on showing you very very basic

270
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,639
things output debug string is basically

271
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,859
a special-purpose call in Windows that

272
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,600
is specifically for debug output so it

273
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,278
will not show up in the console however

274
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,949
there are programs which capture it

275
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:35,078
sysinternals for example if you know the

276
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:37,419
sysinternals suite and if you don't you

277
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:39,609
can just go in here and search for

278
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,969
sysinternals and you will see this guy

279
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,289
here this internal suite is basically a

280
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,180
thing with a bunch of stuff that you

281
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:48,519
probably would enjoy if you are a

282
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,679
low-level kind of fellow and one of them

283
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,629
in there is a thing that will capture

284
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,489
the debug stream from running

285
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:56,110
applications and so if you would like to

286
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,759
see the debug string from an application

287
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,620
that somebody has shipped or that you

288
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,879
have shipped and you are not running it

289
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,980
into bugger or can't run it in the

290
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,490
debugger for some reason that is how you

291
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,159
would do

292
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,808
now we will certainly cover a bunch of

293
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,428
things about how to do debug coded all

294
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:11,350
that stuff we will probably not use out

295
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:13,178
but debug string for very much but when

296
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,220
you are in Windows it is a great back

297
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:16,720
backdoor hack thing to just I really

298
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,519
need output something quickly without

299
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,240
doing much work so it's really good to

300
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:26,428
just know that's there I actually make

301
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,480
another note here also backslash n

302
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:31,360
because I didn't play with that one so I

303
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,379
want to talk about that as well okay how

304
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,230
much will you be relying on Windows

305
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:36,579
Pacific stuff for future parts none

306
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,069
absolutely none

307
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:40,419
only the week of Windows programming or

308
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:42,269
- however long it takes me to show you

309
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:45,458
the minimal window shim to run a game

310
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:47,528
will be Windows everything else will be

311
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,899
non Windows the game itself will run

312
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:52,568
assuming that it has a flat address

313
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:55,240
bitmap to do its rendering to an a-flat

314
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:57,759
address sound output stream as well as

315
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,850
an input that consists primarily just of

316
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,550
a joystick state and eight keyboard that

317
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,649
is it so every last little thing we do

318
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:07,990
besides the platform weeks which will be

319
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,879
very brief and mostly involve just me

320
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,740
showing you how to get the platform out

321
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,170
of your way what do you 100% applicable

322
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:19,318
to every single platform now and forever

323
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:19,318
as long as you can render to a bap

324
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:28,640
let's see here's a good talk on ANSI vs.

325
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,560
wide oh ok who's saying someone was

326
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,569
saying I sang ASCII ANSI I should be

327
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,829
saying ANSI not ASCII I don't know if

328
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,360
that's actually true I'm sorry I've

329
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,370
always thought of the a is ASCII but it

330
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,080
may be very true that it's actually ANSI

331
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,649
meaning an ansi standard for ascii or

332
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,650
something like that

333
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:45,529
the a in output D by stirring a instead

334
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:47,029
of the W so I don't know I may have

335
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,339
misspoke there and you should definitely

336
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:57,579
look it up if you care I I don't think I

337
00:12:49,340 --> 00:13:00,019
care at all but um let's see here um

338
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:04,280
ANSI C if you don't want to get tied to

339
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:06,919
Windows STL trying to think there's

340
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:10,189
anything I haven't covered in version OS

341
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,539
yeah these videos on of it okay

342
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,040
someone asked if we will post a list of

343
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:17,240
these videos on the website blog okay so

344
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:22,149
actually the answer is yes there is a

345
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:24,230
site it will be announced on Monday to

346
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:27,500
correspond with everything it's called

347
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,019
handmade hero org and you can go to

348
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,830
handmade hero org and it has absolutely

349
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,629
everything about the game it has a way

350
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,850
to email me if you have a question

351
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:39,080
outside of the twitch chats and things

352
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,700
like that because I won't only see them

353
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,810
in twitch chat so you know if it's

354
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,100
something important and you really want

355
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:45,169
me to cover it you know you can email it

356
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,060
there you can get to the Twitter stream

357
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:49,309
for it which will say when we are live

358
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:50,929
starting Monday's you can get to the

359
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:52,339
archive which is the YouTube channel

360
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,719
that will have them all and eventually I

361
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,639
watch a special page for that which

362
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,019
break them into lessons so you can view

363
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,449
them and learn there is a live button so

364
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,639
that you can get to the twitch stream

365
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,129
anytime if it you know if it's if you

366
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,889
think it's going on you can get there

367
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,820
and there is the game which if you want

368
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,659
to support this product you can

369
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,670
pre-order I

370
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:15,709
there's nothing yet obviously it won't

371
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:17,929
start till Monday so unless you're just

372
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,480
trying to give me $15 for free at this

373
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:22,489
point I would say wait to click that

374
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,350
button until you've seen if the series

375
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,909
if you like the series and want the game

376
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,590
but the nice part about the game is it

377
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:29,089
will come with all the source code and I

378
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,950
will be zipping the source code every

379
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,920
day so if you want to practice with me

380
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,690
at home or try experiments in the code

381
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,639
the reason that this pre-order is here

382
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,230
at all is just because instead of wait

383
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,610
until the game is out I thought that

384
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,560
people might want to code along with the

385
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,470
series and the game comes with the

386
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,939
source so so I figured that would be

387
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,500
something that would be good and so you

388
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,450
can you can pre-order it if you want to

389
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,490
you can also notice that there are the

390
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,920
platform icons here they will light up

391
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,659
as they are ready I don't know if it

392
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:57,769
will be a game that's allowed on Steam

393
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:59,600
or whatever I don't deal with any of

394
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:01,610
that stuff so I can't speak to that but

395
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,560
for the other ones I do plan on

396
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,460
eventually doing the the various

397
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:06,079
platforms that are here and they'll

398
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,080
light up once we do the platform layer

399
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,370
for that thing so this site if you

400
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,320
bookmark it should just have everything

401
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,120
you need and you don't have to buy the

402
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,200
game or anything to view the videos the

403
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,409
archive will be free for everyone

404
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,509
forever and anyone can take the whole

405
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:22,509
course and watch the whole thing so

406
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:34,490
let's see you're doing this so the

407
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:36,950
people saying thank you thank you for

408
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:41,600
watching this is a project I really

409
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,040
wanted to do and I I'm super I'm just

410
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,050
super old-school and I really love

411
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,519
old-school programming and one of the

412
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:48,109
things that's true about me is I was

413
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,029
kind of born a little too late to really

414
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,889
be an old-school programmer because by

415
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:53,600
the time I was old enough to be in the

416
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:55,850
game industry no one really does super

417
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,250
low level programming anymore but we

418
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,540
still do a fair bit of it and it's it's

419
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,919
the type of things that a lot of people

420
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:03,469
on engine teams and stuff do and I just

421
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,569
I really wanted to how to preserve that

422
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,060
tradition in some sense and show the

423
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,680
stuff that I know and and you know I'm

424
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:11,389
not even the expert on a lot of things

425
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,620
that are super low level and so I was

426
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,509
kind of hoping two other people would

427
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,070
see it maybe do live streams of the

428
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:17,689
stuff that they do and low-level coding

429
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,040
that they do and it kind of just I don't

430
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,150
know I really wanted to get some of this

431
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,969
stuff out in the out and it's just kind

432
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,639
of all sort of you know weird apprentice

433
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,170
e out stuff that you learn by going to a

434
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,909
game company in programming with people

435
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:31,370
who program for a long time or you know

436
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,899
just trying to piece tough together

437
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,250
yourself and I mean I I had to learn

438
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,569
entirely by myself because there was no

439
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,240
internet at that time and there was no

440
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,860
documentation or stuff really to use so

441
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,570
you kind of had to occasionally find

442
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,519
books where you could and you know just

443
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,870
just do it that way and so so this is

444
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,549
basically a kind of a goal to kind of go

445
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,289
back to the style of coding

446
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,819
was done in those days while still

447
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:51,139
modernizing it and going here's all the

448
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,379
things that I value as an old-school

449
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:56,208
programmer by managing the memory myself

450
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,610
writing my own renderer things like that

451
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:00,169
that I think are good for people to know

452
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,879
and to do is exercise to become better

453
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:03,019
programmers anyway like I think even if

454
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,730
you're going to go program something in

455
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:06,980
unity or you're going to go program

456
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,289
something using a premade engine or a

457
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,578
bunch of libraries knowing all of these

458
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:12,078
things makes you so much more powerful

459
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:13,220
because you can always go down there and

460
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,629
fix things if you need to or you can

461
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,370
always escape from them and do your own

462
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,420
stuff when you need to and it just

463
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,889
teaches you a lot of things that just

464
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,079
make you more aware and better

465
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,819
programmers so I'm really excited about

466
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,159
this project and so really I should be

467
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:27,078
thanking you for tuning in so thank you

468
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,759
so much for watching it the fact that

469
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,909
100 people on the stream is amazing and

470
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:33,619
I thank every single one of you for

471
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,679
showing up it's awesome thank you it

472
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:42,829
makes me feel really good so anyway keep

473
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:45,110
going on the thing it won't be just on

474
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:46,879
Mali rockets ok I think I answered those

475
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:49,329
questions this is pretty neat but you're

476
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,890
not just taking this so seriously

477
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:56,230
really oh it comes with a source awesome

478
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,230
goodness thank you okay this is just

479
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:06,019
podcast though okay so I think I've

480
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:08,120
answered all of the questions now will I

481
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,549
still be doing the podcasts do you mean

482
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,168
the Jeff and Casey show we do the Jeff

483
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,519
mk2 show on weekends that's Jeff and I

484
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:16,220
get together and do that for fun I mean

485
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,900
as you know it's our little fun hour the

486
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,509
Jeff encaged show is where we just say

487
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,910
anything and be stupid for an hour and

488
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,650
you know let off steam and stuff so of

489
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,450
course we will still be doing the Jeff

490
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,340
and Casey show that's that's

491
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,319
non-negotiable that thing will go

492
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:31,730
probably forever that thing will go way

493
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,769
past the point where anyone wants to

494
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:39,640
listen to it anymore because we largely

495
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:39,639
do it because we like it and so yeah

496
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,789
I may hear some earlier recommendations

497
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,670
were larger font

498
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:55,159
okay so larger font meaning for in here

499
00:18:52,670 --> 00:19:00,350
is that is that what we mean by larger

500
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:04,330
font because that seems like something

501
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,329
we can totally solve

502
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:14,980
where is that that is I don't know where

503
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:19,460
that is environment fonts and colors

504
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:23,870
fonts and colors so if I go into text

505
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:27,190
editor and I select a larger font let's

506
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:29,408
say a font that's that big you know what

507
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:35,210
let's address something else right now

508
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:41,950
this font is awful hook me up with some

509
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:45,279
liberation monitor people look me up

510
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,279
there we go

511
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:56,149
and I must see liberation mono that is

512
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,900
that too big though I feel like that's a

513
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:10,179
little big let's try it slightly smaller

514
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:14,419
ready 11 okay and the other windows all

515
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:18,409
text tool windows I don't know if this

516
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:25,210
will work but we can certainly try

517
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:29,150
liberation mono 10 I'll make it 12 okay

518
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,558
everything is bigger now and I'll wait

519
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,780
for the stream to catch up a little for

520
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:38,629
you guys to tell me if that is big

521
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:40,339
enough output window possible can you

522
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,510
just hold crit and use the mouse wheel

523
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,509
to change it

524
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:52,308
serene dig into lower southern commit

525
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:56,298
timing edge font kids something with

526
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:59,928
decent kerning readable alright so it

527
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:06,710
looks like everything is good now so I

528
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:08,450
will save this and I think that answers

529
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:13,069
all the questions in the stream so that

530
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:16,669
will be it for tonight and I will

531
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:20,210
hopefully see everyone again tomorrow

532
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:22,669
also at 8 p.m. for the next installment

533
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,659
where we will do some more fun window

534
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:31,210
stuff thanks for joining everyone yes I

535
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:31,210
should wave goodbye goodbye
