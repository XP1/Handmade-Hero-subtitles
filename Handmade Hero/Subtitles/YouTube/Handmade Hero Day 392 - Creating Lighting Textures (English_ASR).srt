00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,108
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,719
Hero show recode a complete game live on

3
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:13,500
stream yesterday we sort of did some

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:15,449
pondering regarding lighting and you

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,550
know where we ended yesterday's stream

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:20,969
was kind of at the point where we're

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,380
like well there really isn't any obvious

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,210
solution here I mean that's sort of

9
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,618
where we were at and that's not

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,699
surprising that's just how lighting is

11
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,649
lighting is one of those things that's

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,120
just still prohibitively expensive to

13
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:37,199
implement in some kind of like first

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,238
principles way where you're just really

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,239
simulating light the way light really

16
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,218
works or something like that and so the

17
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:47,000
approximations are always pretty drastic

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,980
and it's very hard to know what the most

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,609
economical approaches for any particular

20
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:55,919
situation especially since I'm not a

21
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,960
rendering person you're not spend all my

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,939
time working on rendering and there are

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,039
plenty of people who do exactly that in

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:04,170
the game industry there's people whose

25
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,060
entire job it has been for many years to

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,049
just think about rendering and when

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,670
you're talking about just thinking about

28
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,080
rendering usually you are just thinking

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,519
about light most of the time right

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,459
that's a lot of what rendering is its

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,009
light how it behaves off surfaces how it

32
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:19,829
behaves in camera lenses how it behaves

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,909
in participating media that sort of

34
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:26,400
stuff and so you know someone who was

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,790
more of a day-to-day render programmer

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,290
than I am probably has some stronger

37
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,420
opinions about these things doesn't mean

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,090
they're necessarily right in some

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,549
abstract sense but it does mean that

40
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,219
they usually have you know here's how I

41
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,079
like to solve these problems so they

42
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,048
would probably look at our game and they

43
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,029
would probably say here's how I want to

44
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,890
approach this because they've already

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,109
done lots of experimentation and lots of

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,629
circumstances and they know what they

47
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:56,368
like right other render people might

48
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:00,509
have a different take right but again

49
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:04,349
they would still know what they like so

50
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:07,399
I think that there is a pretty

51
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:09,508
reasonable chance that a more

52
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,400
experienced render programmer kind of

53
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,919
person would would have a direction they

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,860
really want

55
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,259
to go but I don't because I don't spend

56
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,209
my time doing rendering programming very

57
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:21,159
often it's one of the smaller parts of

58
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,729
what I tend to do on a day to day basis

59
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:28,329
and so I don't have a like

60
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:30,459
overwhelmingly strong bias towards

61
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,330
implementing the lighting in one way or

62
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,849
another as a result like sort of where I

63
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,160
ended yesterday stream was saying well I

64
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,900
don't know I mean you know here's some

65
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,919
ways we could do it I'm like I don't

66
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,480
have any particular opinion about it I

67
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:52,629
and where I sort of ended up was like

68
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:56,560
well let's try something that light

69
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:59,829
probe asked right that's sort of where I

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,289
ended up so the thing with doing light

71
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,630
probes is basically how that you know

72
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:07,060
how light probing works is you have

73
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,909
points in your scene that are find as

74
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,650
light probe points those light probe

75
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,229
points are kids to the render about

76
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,959
where it should spend this time trying

77
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:19,469
to find lighting solutions and then

78
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,019
anything that wants to get lit typically

79
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:31,509
uses the light probes to interpolate the

80
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:35,790
lighting between them right so that's

81
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:39,669
basically what we're looking at now I

82
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:42,370
wanted to to sort of point something out

83
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,250
here that's a little confusing but I'll

84
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,730
just start by doing it out let me also

85
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:51,039
mention today is for 92 so if you want

86
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:55,358
to follow along at home you want to used

87
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:58,539
a 3/4 90s good 392 you want to use days

88
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:01,780
day 3 91 source code because that's what

89
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:04,509
I've got here that I'm starting with so

90
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,299
I if we take a look here ooh that Visual

91
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:09,599
Studio started up much quicker maybe

92
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,599
uninstalling the throw

93
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:28,370
I don't even know so it's amusing

94
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:32,949
literally I folks who are watching this

95
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:36,649
in the youtubes won't have no myth but

96
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:39,259
literally moments ago in the pre stream

97
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:41,378
I was talking about how commercial

98
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,658
suffer is like unusable these days

99
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:47,120
because licensing makes it impossible to

100
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:48,500
maintain a same development environment

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,788
because things are always breaking and

102
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:55,089
they usually break as the licensing

103
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:58,250
doesn't work well as if on cue

104
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:02,179
here we are with our Visual Studio

105
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,009
community 2013 edition right which I'm

106
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,629
only using normally I use Visual Studio

107
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,629
2012 because that's what I have a

108
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:11,029
commercial license for but I was using

109
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:12,319
Visual Studio for me 2013 edition

110
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:13,519
because when we started this project I

111
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,620
wanted to use something that people

112
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,680
could access who don't have a lot of

113
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,810
money so we picked the version back but

114
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,459
even though it's a freely available

115
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:29,019
product Microsoft of course has decided

116
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:31,698
that it will break every once in a while

117
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:33,500
right now who knows why they decided

118
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,629
break maybe they thought it was just a

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,110
good idea to make people renew their

120
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:40,788
licenses because you got to check in

121
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,740
with Uncle Bill to make sure that you

122
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:47,810
know he's ok with you using the software

123
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,210
or maybe this is just a bug because hey

124
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,978
everything else individuals to do has

125
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:54,468
bugs in it so of course the licensing

126
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:57,620
problem probably the licensing software

127
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:59,870
probably would - right

128
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,218
but either way this is exactly the sort

129
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,778
of thing that now happens with pretty

130
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:04,189
much all commercial software cuz it's

131
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:07,550
happened to me with my commercial

132
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:12,728
license of Visual Studio 2012 that I

133
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:15,800
actually use for work at work right and

134
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:18,818
this is what acceptable I don't know why

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,949
we think this is acceptable right I I

136
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:25,180
don't think anyone would be ok with this

137
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:29,240
in other realms but software is like

138
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,709
grooming people to be ok with it if you

139
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,090
went down to try and start your car

140
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,849
in the morning and it says that you

141
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:36,560
couldn't drive to work because you

142
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,320
hadn't checked with Ford to see if you

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,689
still own the car I'm pretty sure people

144
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,430
would be furious about that right if you

145
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:44,870
went to your refrigerator and opened it

146
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,629
up and you found that all of your food

147
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:52,009
had rotted because the refrigerator said

148
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:54,259
that it could not verify with Frigidaire

149
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,709
that you still owned the refrigerator

150
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:59,839
these would be ridiculous things right I

151
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,849
don't feel like anyone would be okay

152
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,169
with that I feel like that company would

153
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,500
probably go out of business

154
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:09,620
yet somehow and I don't know how people

155
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,389
think this is an acceptable way to ship

156
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,740
software and again not just free

157
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,949
software like Visual Studio community

158
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,509
2013 but actual community but actual

159
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,920
commercial software because the

160
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,839
commercial version of Visual Studio does

161
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,290
exactly the same thing trust me I have

162
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:26,089
it and it does so basically what it is

163
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,819
is you're paying people to create

164
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:33,049
problems for you which is absolutely

165
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:36,829
ridiculous right it should not be

166
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:41,629
something that that people put up with

167
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:43,839
and I don't know why they do so I don't

168
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:49,790
know there's two things we can do here

169
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:52,489
one thing we can do is we can you know

170
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,180
we can take this machine and say all

171
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,790
right let's let's check for an updated

172
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:02,090
license and try to get Microsoft to

173
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,490
agree to license this thing to us that

174
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:06,619
you know ostensibly has but you know you

175
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,410
can go on my stream and watch me having

176
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,530
use it for two years and apparently

177
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,060
that's not sufficient to verify that it

178
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,719
actually was something that I should be

179
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,120
using but oh well

180
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,860
or we can decide just never to use this

181
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,310
piece of software again which honestly

182
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:28,460
at this point I'm a little bit more

183
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,319
inclined to do so you know the other

184
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:31,819
option we have is install Linux on this

185
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,350
machine and just get rid of the

186
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:34,759
Microsoft software entirely which

187
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,580
honestly if this point seems like a

188
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,769
pretty good idea the other thing we

189
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,080
could do is try to switch to something

190
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:48,840
like clang and get rid of

191
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,290
Visual Studio on the on the sort of

192
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,910
window side of things while still using

193
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:55,769
windows I don't know which of those is a

194
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,480
particular good idea obviously we have

195
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,269
some issues the same issues that

196
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,830
everyone else has and the only reason

197
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,949
that I assume people ever are still on

198
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:09,420
Windows anyway which is that you sort of

199
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:11,129
have a vested platform buy-in where

200
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,969
various pieces of software that you use

201
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:17,879
are only available on particular

202
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,250
platforms so for example we need to be

203
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,090
able to use for coder for our editing

204
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,100
and we need to be able to use OBS for

205
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:30,480
our video streaming and we need to be

206
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:33,269
able to use Milton for our blackboard

207
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,220
right that's what we tend to use now of

208
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,129
those pieces of software I'm pretty sure

209
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,320
that poor coder has a Linux version I

210
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:42,590
don't know if Milton though so let's

211
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,590
check

212
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,019
[Applause]

213
00:09:54,809 --> 00:10:02,309
so some are on here there's a downloads

214
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:08,419
right download and so let's see what

215
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:08,419
it's got where's the github there it is

216
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:26,430
yes so I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure

217
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:28,979
this is Windows only now I don't think

218
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:44,278
it would take a lot to port it right

219
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:45,568
here's the source code here's the source

220
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:49,078
code and you can kind of see that

221
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:51,990
there's even some a little bit of Linux

222
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:59,519
suggestion here right like the platform

223
00:10:51,990 --> 00:11:03,948
Windows UNIX Mac svl right so I don't

224
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,179
know to what extent this is supported or

225
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:07,948
going to be supported on other platforms

226
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:13,109
it's a good question we should ask

227
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:14,578
surgery about that yeah you can see here

228
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,899
this Linux and OS X port is tended for

229
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:22,649
the future so but here's how you do the

230
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,480
build for example and so you know it's

231
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,948
not out of the question that we could

232
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,159
get to a point where we could use this

233
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:35,099
for drawing on Linux right so that's

234
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,919
good right we and we have a source so if

235
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,209
we had to court it ourselves hey Sergio

236
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,099
if we had to port it ourselves we could

237
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:44,308
probably do something like that as well

238
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,600
right so those are really the only two

239
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:53,009
things we need because I'm pretty sure

240
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:55,110
OBS I already works on Linux right OBS

241
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:59,100
studio which is the latest version is

242
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:02,480
Linux compliant so I think that would

243
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,480
not be a particular problem either

244
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:09,789
so I guess what I would say there is

245
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:19,820
what do we want to do it's a really

246
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:23,299
tough question right it's a really tough

247
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,560
question I feel like we should take a

248
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:30,789
poll about what we should do here do we

249
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:33,889
want to try to get Visual Studio working

250
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:35,179
or do we want to switch to Linux I feel

251
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,009
like there's a lot of cost of switching

252
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:41,539
to Linux right we won't have a

253
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:43,250
particularly good debugger anymore

254
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:48,889
because there really aren't any dividers

255
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:51,230
for Linux that that are any good so it'd

256
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:53,240
be pretty rough we did that we could try

257
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,159
to use Klingon here but then of course

258
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,200
we have the same problem we wouldn't

259
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:04,759
have a really useful debugger right so

260
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:09,200
it would be pretty tough if that makes

261
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:14,899
sense so yeah I don't know I guess what

262
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:17,570
we can do is we can try to see I don't

263
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:21,980
know what this is really asking me for

264
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:23,780
here I don't the only reason I would

265
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,920
have one of these is for when we

266
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:30,769
authorize this initially so I can look

267
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:35,029
up the password for it I guess because I

268
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:39,379
would have saved it and then try to get

269
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,699
it to work so maybe we'll do this this

270
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:49,220
seems fair

271
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:55,250
I will try putting in my account

272
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:58,840
credentials here and if it works we will

273
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,379
keep using Windows if it doesn't work

274
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:06,110
then we switch to Linux that's I think

275
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:09,110
the fair the fair option right I don't

276
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,669
think I mean if they don't want me to

277
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,649
use their software they don't want me to

278
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:14,539
use their software right Microsoft makes

279
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:15,319
it abundantly clear almost everyday that

280
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:20,509
they don't want me to

281
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:25,730
their software and this is a pretty

282
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:28,340
blatant example of that so we'll give

283
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:32,710
them one more chance and if the doesn't

284
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,710
work then we move on hold on

285
00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:09,500
all right I have gotten my personal

286
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:09,500
laptop out and I am looking up see what

287
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,190
what we've got

288
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:51,350
all right so I don't really know if this

289
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:53,938
is accurate here whoa okay I did that I

290
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,278
think that worked all right here we go

291
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:59,088
we're going to enter our our password

292
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:02,639
here and everyone will now know how many

293
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:07,670
letters there are in my password or

294
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:10,980
numbers I guess but that's fine because

295
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:13,438
honestly if somehow you decided to

296
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,749
brute-force my Microsoft password this

297
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:18,719
is the only thing on my Microsoft

298
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:25,670
password so all you would really have is

299
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,670
a nonworking version of Visual Studio No

300
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:46,350
I is this a joke I mean really is that

301
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:52,740
are you actually showing that who writes

302
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:57,720
this stuff did that work

303
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,278
I have no idea if it worked it looks

304
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:06,949
like we're able to launch fizzle to do

305
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:08,909
now all right

306
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:14,159
thankfully I happen to save that

307
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:22,829
password Microsoft is saved for the time

308
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:25,699
being I have no idea what that dialog

309
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:25,698
box was asking me

310
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:47,980
all right well that was fantastic so

311
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:50,769
productive so all right I was trying to

312
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,239
if I can even remember what was going on

313
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,548
here oh good and it forgot which

314
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,778
projects we normally have loaded

315
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:57,940
apparently because it was like I got a

316
00:17:55,778 --> 00:18:01,690
load my license file that's the

317
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,570
important part not what you were working

318
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:08,350
on Casey you're working on stuff that is

319
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:10,928
irrelevant to me so what I wanted to

320
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:15,819
talk about was the fact that if you

321
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:17,499
recall we are a fake 3d render in a lot

322
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:19,689
of ways because we have to work with

323
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:22,058
sprites which aren't actually 3d so we

324
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,889
have to kind of do some shenanigans to

325
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:27,548
make that work properly and what you can

326
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:30,219
see here is that when you are working in

327
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:32,168
the normal view that we expect that

328
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,450
spine to say that's the angle the

329
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:37,659
sprites are drawn to look like so

330
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,879
everything's good but if we look at

331
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:44,200
other camera angles like you can see

332
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:47,849
here we end up in a situation where the

333
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,319
you know the individual sort of sprites

334
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:52,808
wouldn't really be looking like they

335
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,178
look if you were looking from this angle

336
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:56,858
right and you know that's fine because

337
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,809
we never look from down here but

338
00:18:56,858 --> 00:19:01,509
obviously when we're talking about doing

339
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:04,118
stuff like rendering light probes or

340
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:05,798
something if there were if these things

341
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:08,349
are going to occlude light they need to

342
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:12,128
be standing up straighter right they

343
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:15,308
need to be standing like upright so we

344
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:18,398
have a fundamental disconnect again with

345
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:21,970
our two and a half d miss or whatever

346
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:26,048
you want to call this 3d with sprites I

347
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:28,089
don't know what but the fact that we do

348
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:30,339
our rendering in sort of this way to

349
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:33,970
support sprites which we need to because

350
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:35,678
that's how the art goes we have a

351
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:40,868
problem of trying to figure out exactly

352
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,820
what we're going to do as far as doing

353
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:46,199
like light occlusion and stuff like that

354
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:47,379
because we probably can't render things

355
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,080
in

356
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,090
this way because if you were looking

357
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,649
like this you'd see nothing along the

358
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,809
rest but you should see a big wall of

359
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:59,470
trees blocking it right as far as

360
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:02,109
lighting is concerned so it sort of

361
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:08,410
strikes me as being the case where when

362
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:11,349
we render when we render the world for

363
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:14,860
lighting we almost need to do it in a

364
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:21,819
sort of different way than when we

365
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:26,859
render the world for visuals right so

366
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:29,230
this kind of got me thinking you know or

367
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:32,529
I should say gets me thinking I haven't

368
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,930
really thought it through yet but this

369
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:38,889
makes me kind of think a little bit

370
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:41,070
harder about how we might want to treat

371
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:44,740
the lighting versus how we treat

372
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:47,980
everything else and so what I wonder is

373
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:50,890
I do wonder if maybe what we need to do

374
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:54,579
is something more like a voxel ization

375
00:20:50,890 --> 00:21:01,780
path or something like this on the game

376
00:20:54,579 --> 00:21:06,099
that's really more about splatting sort

377
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:09,039
of vague colors in rather than trying to

378
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:10,829
render actual stuff and the reason that

379
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:16,589
I'm thinking about that is just because

380
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:20,169
since our game is not at all

381
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:22,750
geometrically accurate in 3d I'm not

382
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,990
sure we can really do something like

383
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:28,349
rendering light probes in a traditional

384
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,870
sense in the way you normally would

385
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:36,459
because I'm afraid that they won't

386
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:41,349
really capture anything that we need

387
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,029
them to capture right so what I'm

388
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:46,269
wondering is if we need to do something

389
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:48,369
more like splatting colors into a

390
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,549
texture that we then kind of just blur

391
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:54,819
out and use for the lighting or you know

392
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:59,079
something like this and I'm not really

393
00:21:54,819 --> 00:22:01,019
sure I don't know I don't know what we

394
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,139
want to do in

395
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:08,910
regarde so I still think we don't quite

396
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:17,960
have what we need to know in order to

397
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:20,430
really produce reasonable lighting but

398
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,130
given all that I guess what I would say

399
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:26,610
is I think we might want to skew more

400
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:30,600
towards the taking a sort of pseudo 3d

401
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:33,119
texture approach screen space 3d texture

402
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:36,240
sort of a thing and then sampling that

403
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:40,289
and that seems like maybe a little bit

404
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,980
more of a of an approach we could take

405
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:45,629
right so let's talk a little bit about

406
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,099
that and then let's me me what I

407
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:53,570
thinking I might do is try using a 3d

408
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:55,980
texture to do non directional lighting

409
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:58,710
so that we could get that working and

410
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,720
then figure out how to sort of bootstrap

411
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,569
that into something that worked for

412
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:13,319
directional lighting right so what do I

413
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:15,029
mean here so let's imagine that we just

414
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,470
wanted to do the exact same lighting

415
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:19,230
that we're doing now but we wanted to

416
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,970
look it up in a texture right so what

417
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,120
are we doing right now well right now

418
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:26,549
what we do is we say all right here's

419
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,009
the world we know that there is a point

420
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:32,250
light source in it we gave it a

421
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:35,670
particular fall-off right that it has in

422
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:38,549
the world and so from there we just know

423
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:41,670
okay if there's a thing here we compute

424
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:43,619
the lighting based on its distance from

425
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,539
this thing and off we go

426
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:47,429
right but where it's always a point

427
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:51,000
right it's a vector that's like a

428
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:52,560
position of the light and a strength of

429
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,339
the light I think of the two things we

430
00:23:52,559 --> 00:24:01,349
did so how bright it is and where it is

431
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:04,829
so if we wanted to do this instead in a

432
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:08,279
texture you can imagine doing sort of a

433
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:10,679
reverse process right if we wanted to

434
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,779
make a texture for this what we could do

435
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,549
is say well all right let's suppose that

436
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:17,579
something was here what

437
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:19,470
do is just sample from the texture what

438
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:21,929
if lighting is and then what we would do

439
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,630
is we'd say go the opposite direction if

440
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:27,240
I've got a light that's in here I render

441
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:30,420
the light into the texture as a big blob

442
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,069
and then I'm done right and then when I

443
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:36,529
come in and I look it up I get what the

444
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:39,179
lighting should be at those points right

445
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:57,599
pretty straightforward

446
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:59,340
uh so so allergy there's lots of

447
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,009
construction in Seattle and I feel like

448
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,539
it kicks up this is my like crackpot

449
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:06,150
theory I feel like there's so much

450
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,309
debris in the air that I'm always sneezy

451
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:14,220
about it it's probably not true

452
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:15,960
so shall we just plants anyway so doing

453
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,079
this is not particularly difficult to

454
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,299
conceptualize right it's just that it's

455
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:23,669
the these two processes sort of like

456
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:26,369
Reverse from each other in one you just

457
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,200
take the light source and you store just

458
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:30,689
the like two pieces of information

459
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,850
necessary to reconstruct it and then

460
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,769
every time you want to shade a pixel you

461
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:36,119
just use these two and the lighting

462
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:37,859
equations to reconstruct with the

463
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,709
lightest at this point the same thing

464
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:43,079
happens here in Reverse we take those

465
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,329
two things and we rasterize them out

466
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:49,019
into the whole texture then we sample

467
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:51,689
from it right and you can see why this

468
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:54,180
is something that I'm interested in

469
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:57,480
doing it's because this allows me to

470
00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:00,660
start getting a lot more information

471
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,970
into the lighting if I wanted thousands

472
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,890
of licen here I would have to every

473
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,140
pixel compute the lighting equation for

474
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,780
thousands of lights and that's not going

475
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,750
to fly on the other hand if I do this

476
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:15,750
rap forward rasterizing a thousand

477
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:18,420
lights into this texture is relatively

478
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:21,299
cheap and when I then go to look up a

479
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,070
pixel it's just a constant lookup time

480
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:28,789
to just fetch out what the lighting

481
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:28,789
ended up being there right

482
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,819
now it has some downsides which is that

483
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,950
the the bat texture obviously only has a

484
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:39,419
certain limited resolution and the

485
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,440
higher resolution it is the more

486
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,370
expensive it will be in

487
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,350
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah

488
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:47,879
right so there's definitely costs to it

489
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:49,859
it's not free and there's all sorts of

490
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,000
ways we might encode it and things like

491
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:56,129
that but it's you know reasonable so you

492
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,349
might imagine taking this and extending

493
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:02,070
this to three dimensions as well if we

494
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:04,859
took the view frustum for example and we

495
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:06,990
said alright let's take the area we're

496
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:08,579
viewing here is the far clip plane here

497
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,920
is the near clip plane which are

498
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:15,149
whatever we want them to be and let's

499
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:17,940
divide this up into cells

500
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:21,650
now that's a 3d texture right because

501
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:29,269
again this is a frustum so it's actually

502
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:29,269
this sort of thing right

503
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,000
so you can imagine us taking a

504
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:44,819
essentially voxel lives version of the

505
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:49,500
view and just creating out of that our

506
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:52,409
lighting right and so that seems pretty

507
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:55,500
reasonable to me right the only thing

508
00:27:52,410 --> 00:28:00,529
that's kind of tricky about it is again

509
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:04,650
figuring out then I guess what I say is

510
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:07,109
the resolution might be an issue hard to

511
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,390
say the cost of rasterization costs will

512
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:11,129
look up those sorts of things but the

513
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,020
biggest problem that we will have here

514
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:16,170
is when we want to simulate the

515
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:18,660
directionality of the lighting right so

516
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:22,110
the problem that we get is lighting

517
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,808
intensity and color can sum together so

518
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:26,819
I can splat as many lights as I want in

519
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:30,750
here and in the places where they

520
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:36,269
overlap like in here I can just sum up

521
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:39,720
the RG and B intensities and get a

522
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:42,808
perfect representation of the brightness

523
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,980
of those lights at that point right no

524
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:49,759
problem what I can't record is what

525
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,289
direction the light is coming from right

526
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,900
because each one of those lights was

527
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:57,000
coming from a different direction so

528
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,340
when I sum up the intensities that's

529
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,069
accurate if I were to sum up the

530
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:03,750
direction I get the average direction

531
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:05,609
the light was coming from but the

532
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:10,069
average direction the light was coming

533
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:10,069
from doesn't really mean anything right

534
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:16,679
so the surface response is going to be

535
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,949
completely wrong if I've got three

536
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,160
lights let's say and I only keep one

537
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:27,179
direction which of course as we all know

538
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,380
is the best band one direction and so

539
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,330
what we're really talking about is

540
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,970
keeping the band one direction at every

541
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:34,500
Texel here but in addition to keeping

542
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,450
the band one direction we also have to

543
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,950
compute the lighting equation and

544
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,000
unfortunately one of the things that a

545
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,769
lot of people don't know about the band

546
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,509
One Direction is they don't actually

547
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:44,670
know very much about physics so

548
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:46,559
unfortunately when we go to use

549
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,690
one direction to figure out what the

550
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,679
lighting is we will not get a very good

551
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:55,820
result right and to make this more

552
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:59,640
explicit you can imagine this yourself

553
00:29:55,819 --> 00:30:01,919
here is a cube looking top-down these

554
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,910
two faces obviously point in opposite

555
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:08,460
directions here is a set of lights that

556
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,830
are overlapping the cube here is a red

557
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,140
light here is a green light I would

558
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:15,659
expect when I compute the lighting for

559
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,490
this face to be almost entirely green I

560
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:21,150
would expect that this face should be

561
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,460
almost entirely red right but if all I

562
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:28,250
store is the intensities here they will

563
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:31,289
both be sort of greenish red right

564
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,750
because what will end up happening is I

565
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:37,670
don't have any way of storing which

566
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:40,829
direction each of those colors came from

567
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:48,480
so that's the problem right that's the

568
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:52,829
problem you end up getting so what do we

569
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,710
do about this well probably what we want

570
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:58,889
to do about this is take some sort of a

571
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:02,220
hybrid approach right what we want to be

572
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:04,710
able to do here is store something into

573
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,450
our texture that allows us to

574
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:09,809
reconstruct the directionality of the

575
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:13,170
lighting a little right that gives us

576
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:16,019
some ability to do something with the

577
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:20,190
directionality of the light if possible

578
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:21,690
right and so what a lot of people tend

579
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:28,590
to do with stuff like this is they'll

580
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:30,980
use for example in coatings so you may

581
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:33,959
have heard of like spherical harmonics

582
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:38,849
spherical harmonics is one way of

583
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:45,779
encoding a mush of lighting in a way

584
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:47,399
that keeps the the light values in a way

585
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:49,289
you can reconstruct some directionality

586
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,940
from them

587
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,190
and you can think of this as being very

588
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:57,170
analogous to like the Fourier transform

589
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,170
for audio for example

590
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,159
where you're taking this complicated

591
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:04,439
signal right this sort of like you know

592
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,440
here's my audio signal and turning it

593
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,380
into a series of like a graphic

594
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,259
equalizer version of like various sine

595
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,419
wave frequencies right so spherical

596
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:18,599
harmonics is exactly the same sort of

597
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:23,549
thing circle harmonic says let's go

598
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:27,119
ahead and store some directionality to

599
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:30,359
the sphere right the incoming sphere of

600
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:33,778
information let's store like the primary

601
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:37,469
lobes of that incoming infinite light

602
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:39,419
right and it's again in order to really

603
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,519
reconstruct the lighting in its entirety

604
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,220
you need to store lots of coefficients

605
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,899
on the sphere and I can try to show you

606
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:53,808
those that there's a good diagram here

607
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:53,808
on the spherical harmonic coefficients

608
00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:01,940
oops I didn't month here you go

609
00:33:03,588 --> 00:33:13,918
so this is a tree of lobes and these are

610
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:20,308
sort of intensity lobes you can imagine

611
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:23,729
of the the intensity of this function in

612
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:25,528
the direction that it goes right and so

613
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:27,959
you can see as they start getting more

614
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:30,450
detailed it gets more and more lobes

615
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:33,119
this is because like I said spherical

616
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:35,459
harmonics are very analogous to

617
00:33:33,118 --> 00:33:36,988
something like a Fourier transform and

618
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:38,788
for those of you don't know what a

619
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:42,269
Fourier transform is Fourier transform

620
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:44,069
it's something that converts a amplitude

621
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:46,259
based signal so like I said something

622
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:49,528
that's like audio like an amplitude just

623
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,139
kind of like fluctuates into something

624
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:54,298
that's the sum of a series of of

625
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:59,098
transcendental functions so some of the

626
00:33:54,298 --> 00:34:01,679
series of sine waves so for example and

627
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:04,408
what this is a pretty interesting aspect

628
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,749
just a signal processing theory is that

629
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:10,230
any signal can be approximated and

630
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:14,000
eventually masked exactly by a series of

631
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:17,000
sine waves to a certain degree right so

632
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,079
what you end up with is you end up with

633
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,079
sort of a series of sine waves at

634
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:30,149
doubled frequencies right it's a really

635
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:33,470
bad drawing you know what this is not

636
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:33,469
going to work let's try it this way

637
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,878
so what you get with something like a

638
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:43,429
Fourier transform is you essentially get

639
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:49,159
these various coefficients of which

640
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:57,980
kinds of frequencies are present in the

641
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:59,088
signal and at what strength right and so

642
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,329
what you get is like you know

643
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:06,679
coefficients going down in terms of

644
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:08,660
their effect you get these sorts of a

645
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,659
sine wave decompositions of the signal

646
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:13,940
so you know if I had a signal that kind

647
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:15,679
of looks like this right you would say

648
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,480
well obviously it's got a very strong

649
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,879
first coefficient here that sort of

650
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,740
matches that and then it's got a little

651
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,990
bit of this signal in it here for that

652
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:27,078
wobble right and you keep summing these

653
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:31,098
together to get eventually back to the

654
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,680
actual signal that you had right now the

655
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:34,910
idea behind this and why people tend to

656
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,129
want to use things like Fourier

657
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:38,989
transforms or like the discrete cosine

658
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:42,140
transform which is a similar version of

659
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:44,239
it of the same process for graphics is

660
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:46,400
that you want to be able to throw out

661
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,288
the higher frequency stuff because it's

662
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,298
usually humans are less sensitive to it

663
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:52,069
so for example if I want to approximate

664
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:53,960
this if I want to approximate with

665
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:55,099
something like that the Fourier

666
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,048
transform becomes very useful because

667
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:59,990
you can just keep the bottom part and

668
00:35:57,048 --> 00:36:01,699
throw away these top parts when you're

669
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:05,508
trying to kind of compress that signal

670
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:07,518
down to smaller space right so spherical

671
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:09,139
harmonics are the same way and much like

672
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:11,629
sine waves they have like a positive and

673
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:12,588
a negative weighted lobes right and I

674
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,420
don't know which one they're trying to

675
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:15,828
show here like probably blue is positive

676
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,650
and green is negative I don't know it

677
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:20,690
doesn't matter the point being they add

678
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,230
in one place while they subtract in

679
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:27,500
another right so at the top you just

680
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,179
have an overall color of the function an

681
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,000
overall bright strength of the function

682
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:36,889
and then the next down you get the three

683
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,989
primary axes right XYZ have lobes on

684
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:41,358
them that say how strong the function is

685
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:42,768
in those directions and it subtracts

686
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:44,210
from the other direction so it adds from

687
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:46,459
two one direction it subtracts or the

688
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,170
other then you get other shapes that you

689
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,010
get down to the lower coefficients and

690
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,360
so on and so forth

691
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:56,000
right and again the idea behind these

692
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,280
functions is hey let's suppose for a

693
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,039
given channel like the red channel I'm

694
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,990
willing to store four numbers well I

695
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:05,360
could store the four coefficients of

696
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:07,729
these things and sort of have some

697
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:13,550
directionality understanding to my

698
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:15,469
lighting right anyway the point of this

699
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,990
stream is not to teach you circle

700
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:19,399
harmonics because hey I don't even

701
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:20,839
really work with circle or mark so I'm

702
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,910
the wrong one to teach you anything else

703
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:27,350
real Carmack's it's more to just kind of

704
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:30,259
mention as we go here that what we need

705
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:32,750
in this case what we would need to do if

706
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,660
we want to recover directionality from

707
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:38,269
the lighting is we need to store

708
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:42,769
something in our texture map that helps

709
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:51,530
us reconstruct something we can use for

710
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:53,300
the direction of the light right okay

711
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,460
so let's talk a little bit about what

712
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,780
that might look like and we can play

713
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,699
around the bit right it'll be an

714
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,200
experimental process of once we have

715
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:01,879
things working we can kind of play

716
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:04,359
around with what we store there and see

717
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,360
how it does

718
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:13,820
but anyway so remember if you recall

719
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:18,230
what we want to do right is we want to

720
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:20,660
produce a lighting equation for our

721
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:23,329
surfaces and remember we started to talk

722
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:26,059
about this lighting equations are things

723
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:29,690
which want to be able to compute for a

724
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:32,150
specific eye direction here's my I write

725
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,849
for a specific way that we're looking at

726
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,710
the surface we want to take the inbound

727
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:39,739
light that we know is hitting the

728
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:42,320
surface and produce some kind of RG and

729
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:45,439
B intensity that goes out along this ray

730
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:49,010
so if the eye can know what it is that's

731
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,200
what we want right and in order to

732
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,770
produce that we actually have sort of

733
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:57,469
two distinct categories of lighting that

734
00:38:54,769 --> 00:39:00,769
are going to happen here right we have

735
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,969
highly reflective elements of our

736
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:03,889
lighting and highly

737
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:05,179
use elements of our lighting right we

738
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:07,429
can kind of separate those into those

739
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:09,230
two broad categories remember a mirror

740
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:12,079
is something that reflects something

741
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,909
directly and that behaves kind of like

742
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,319
the sort of flows specular thing that

743
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,750
I've got in here right now right

744
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,900
remember we play with this that's a very

745
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:24,760
reflective surface it's it's the surface

746
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:28,430
that narrowly re reflects the light

747
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:32,000
incoming on it right and you remember we

748
00:39:28,429 --> 00:39:36,108
kind of played around with this in in

749
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,909
the limited sense but we can change it

750
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:39,949
over even with the limited thing we have

751
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,629
right now we can change it over by

752
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:44,239
playing with these coefficients we have

753
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,369
a 2.0 specular coefficient put a 1.0

754
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,589
gpus coefficient we could instead turn

755
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:50,900
off that specular and just use the

756
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,730
diffuse and what we would get is

757
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,070
something that again is more like a

758
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,449
highly diffused surface right a surface

759
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,970
of just scatters light in all directions

760
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:00,919
and then when we have a light on here

761
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:03,348
right we get something just more kind of

762
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,369
flows out around doesn't really reflect

763
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:10,820
and when I move my camera around right I

764
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:13,010
don't get a lot of change in how the

765
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,380
light responds because again it's

766
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,720
diffused it's radiating in all

767
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,329
directions so it doesn't respond that

768
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:24,500
much to how I'm looking at it what angle

769
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:26,779
I'm looking at it okay so again we have

770
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,500
two broad categories of light there and

771
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,330
what that means is that when we're sort

772
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,400
of developing our approximately equation

773
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:37,130
even though real lighting requires us to

774
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,230
take every four-dimensional pair into

775
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:41,570
account every light direction has to

776
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:44,809
then take into town every possible

777
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:46,460
two-dimensional angle set and sum all of

778
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:48,889
those lights with different weights all

779
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,150
of those incident lights you know that's

780
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:51,980
not we're doing right that's a ray

781
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:54,470
tracer job we're doing approximate

782
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:57,820
lighting so we really have two things

783
00:40:54,469 --> 00:41:01,789
you want to consider we want to consider

784
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:05,750
those two categories the specular in the

785
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:07,699
diffuse right and so what we want to do

786
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,550
is we want to come up with some kind of

787
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:13,399
a lighting lookup that allows us to

788
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:15,410
approximate both of these if we can and

789
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,910
obviously again this is a highly

790
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:18,379
proximate process so we're not really

791
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:20,058
going to get great results out of either

792
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,010
but we just want something that looks

793
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:23,780
pleasant right this is a game with

794
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:25,700
cartoon art style we're not trying to be

795
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,059
photorealistic here so we don't have to

796
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:32,838
sweat it too bad so how would we do this

797
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:35,720
well if you think about what we've got

798
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:38,469
here what we want to do is have

799
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:44,480
something that can produce a a

800
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:49,969
directional light for specular and a non

801
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:52,068
directional light for diffuse right but

802
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:54,469
non directional is kind of in quotes

803
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:56,509
here because even though it's sort of

804
00:41:54,469 --> 00:42:00,558
non directional it still has a

805
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:04,339
directional mask on it so remember we've

806
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:07,130
got the cosine theta law here which

807
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:09,980
tells us that as the angle gets steeper

808
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,500
as the light comes in it reflects less

809
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,599
of the light out proportional the cosine

810
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,440
of the angle so we will still want

811
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,430
things coming from this direction to

812
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,470
contribute more heavily press

813
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:23,719
potentially to the result then things

814
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:25,250
coming from this direction so it's non

815
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:26,989
directional in the sense that we would

816
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,849
like to know all of the incident light

817
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:30,288
that's coming in but it is still

818
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:32,359
somewhat directional in the sense that

819
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:37,549
the direction at which the light is

820
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:38,989
coming in might get attenuated on the

821
00:42:37,548 --> 00:42:40,969
other hand the specular doesn't want to

822
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:43,098
know all that the specular just wants to

823
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:46,068
know for the reflection angle of this

824
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:47,680
surface whichever it is I just want to

825
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:50,630
know the color in that direction right

826
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,219
and I don't want to know the colors and

827
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:56,930
I don't want these other colors to

828
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:59,649
contribute right so what we want here is

829
00:42:56,929 --> 00:43:03,379
something that can reproduce those

830
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:08,298
angular queries basically now we want

831
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:11,329
something that given a normal well I

832
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:14,239
should say normal given a reflection

833
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:18,109
vector so the eye comes in and we give

834
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:20,598
it this vector here right and then given

835
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:24,170
a normal which is this vector here so

836
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:28,079
given a normal we want something that

837
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:36,389
will reproduce the diffuse lighting

838
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:39,989
and given a reflector this year like our

839
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:41,639
and giving a reflector we want something

840
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:56,849
that will give us an approximation to

841
00:43:41,639 --> 00:44:01,409
the specular so that's really what we're

842
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:02,880
looking for in terms of our lighting now

843
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:05,399
if we get an incredibly amazing

844
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,028
wonderful superb job at doing this

845
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,380
somehow the specular would be able to be

846
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:13,259
cranked all the way to a perfect

847
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,358
reflector that has no glossiness

848
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:17,728
whatsoever and if you do like mirrored

849
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:21,989
surfaces right like mirrors and stuff

850
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:25,678
like this we're not even going to

851
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:26,670
attempt that for this project and the

852
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,588
reason that we're not going to attempt

853
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,909
that in addition to requiring like a lot

854
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:32,639
of work on the rendering side of things

855
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:35,578
is because we can't actually do that

856
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,708
since we don't even have the ability to

857
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:40,829
render what our art looks like from

858
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:43,708
other directions and once you start

859
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:45,089
talking about reflectors you have to

860
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:47,608
know that right

861
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:50,188
so we actually don't want mirrors in

862
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:51,900
this game because we don't have the

863
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:54,748
ability to really render stuff in

864
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:59,189
mirrors so for example let's suppose

865
00:44:54,748 --> 00:45:01,649
that the hero is standing on a mirror

866
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:05,159
when I look down here I should look up

867
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:08,969
and see what's under his chin right that

868
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:11,969
art doesn't even exist so the only thing

869
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:14,458
we could really even attempt with things

870
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:18,358
like real true specular reflectors are

871
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:21,348
fake reflections ones that are the kind

872
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:21,348
that people complain about

873
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,440
[Applause]

874
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:42,070
see if we can get a good one here there

875
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,110
you go so that's kind of a good example

876
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,880
of the kind of thing we would have to do

877
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:48,340
right if you take a look at that image

878
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:50,289
you can see that all they really did was

879
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:53,710
mirror the thing that they were looking

880
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:56,050
at and the it you know literally mirror

881
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:58,449
it in Photoshop and then draw that

882
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,700
reflection but that is not at all what a

883
00:45:58,449 --> 00:46:03,419
reflection actually does right a

884
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:06,309
reflection does not work that way at all

885
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:12,490
right it is it is not that kind of an

886
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:14,559
image I trying to see that that looks a

887
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:20,049
little bit better let's see if we can

888
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:22,409
get a good see if we can get a good one

889
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,410
here

890
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:36,129
well that's that's an obviously very bad

891
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:46,019
reflection it illustrates the problem

892
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:46,019
very well here we go

893
00:46:48,510 --> 00:47:12,810
I think that's probably that's a really

894
00:46:52,170 --> 00:47:20,030
good one okay but anyway yeah I apropos

895
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:24,360
of nothing I just there's a there's a

896
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:29,190
limit to what we can do with specular

897
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:32,400
reflections because reflections aren't

898
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:36,300
mirrored versions of the same thing you

899
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,950
see when you look at the mirror the only

900
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,950
time that would be true is if you

901
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:43,799
couldn't see the mirror so if I was

902
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:46,679
looking at a mirror directly head-on and

903
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:50,400
I had a sphere above it that sphere

904
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:52,500
would be reflected exactly perhaps

905
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,910
through the mirror in a sense shape wise

906
00:47:52,500 --> 00:48:00,300
sure right but I can't see the mirror

907
00:47:56,909 --> 00:48:02,219
once I can see the mirror then whatever

908
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,760
is on it I'm actually seeing the

909
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:07,469
underside of that thing right I'm seeing

910
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,940
the top when I look down here but I'm

911
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:11,009
seeing the underside when I look through

912
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:15,150
the mirror because the mirror bounces

913
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:17,070
the light it doesn't reflect what I the

914
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:21,240
light that I'm looking at it reflects

915
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:23,370
the light that hit it right and so it's

916
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:26,129
a very different thing so I'm not really

917
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:30,109
even going to try for those in handmade

918
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:33,900
here oh I we could try to go through

919
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:35,970
jump through a bunch of Hoops to get

920
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,980
them to work in a fake way like I said I

921
00:48:35,969 --> 00:48:40,019
don't really want to do that I think

922
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,760
it's just better to say we're not going

923
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:44,489
for reflection reflection yes they're

924
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,160
cool by all means if you like them try

925
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:49,709
to do them and you can come up with fake

926
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:51,210
ways to try and do them with rights but

927
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:53,340
I don't really want to go down that road

928
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:56,579
so really more what I'm looking for is a

929
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,620
general glossiness right something more

930
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:01,340
like a surface that kind of reflects

931
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:01,339
color a little bit

932
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:08,150
in a directional sense more like maybe a

933
00:49:04,728 --> 00:49:11,358
varnished floor does but does not try to

934
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:12,920
really reproduce the the image so if

935
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:16,788
you're going to you can't really see a

936
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:19,249
clear image in it that that is 100%

937
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:23,119
pixel identifiable right we want

938
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:25,009
something blurry but I would like that

939
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,318
right if we can get a nice blurry

940
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:29,568
reflection a nice glossy reflection in

941
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:32,088
there it has a lot of character to the

942
00:49:29,568 --> 00:49:35,449
scene because as things move through the

943
00:49:32,088 --> 00:49:37,699
scene and you kind of get this nice sort

944
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:39,710
of glassy quality to them maybe that's

945
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:42,788
it adds some variety of the material

946
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:45,650
instead of being kind of dull and chalky

947
00:49:42,789 --> 00:49:49,460
so we would like to get some of that as

948
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:52,670
we can so what we want to produce is

949
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:55,338
some kind of function where we can pass

950
00:49:52,670 --> 00:50:01,400
a normal and get a diffuse and pass a

951
00:49:55,338 --> 00:50:02,659
reflector and get a specular right and

952
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,190
honestly like I said I don't have a

953
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:05,629
preconceived notion about how to do this

954
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,869
but if we were talking about storing

955
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:10,759
this in a texture right then what I

956
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:14,989
would imagine is let's suppose we store

957
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:17,719
three textures an R a G and a B texture

958
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:22,548
and each one of these can be like four

959
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:24,829
channels right so we can have let's say

960
00:50:22,548 --> 00:50:26,389
for 8-bit channels or something or maybe

961
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:27,798
if we're feeling really gung-ho for

962
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:28,909
floating-point channels I don't know if

963
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:33,498
you've got that kind of bandwidth to

964
00:50:28,909 --> 00:50:35,989
spare but that's what we've got right

965
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:39,228
we've got the ability to store these

966
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:41,449
things in two channels here and we can

967
00:50:39,228 --> 00:50:44,358
store one for red green and blue right

968
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:46,218
so rather than just the intensity of the

969
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:47,929
colors which we know we can store so we

970
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:50,358
know we can use one channel to store the

971
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:52,940
intensity and that will be exact if we

972
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:55,009
wanted to let's say what if we give

973
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:58,659
ourselves four channels could restore

974
00:50:55,009 --> 00:51:06,949
something more than just the intensity

975
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:09,889
yeah and it's hard to say but for

976
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:12,558
example one thing we could do is in code

977
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:15,400
let's say the cube without the bottom

978
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:19,010
face or something

979
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,139
right so instead of something like

980
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:27,109
spherical harmonics maybe you know we

981
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:31,250
could do something like encode these

982
00:51:27,108 --> 00:51:32,929
faces of the cube like or you know what

983
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:37,250
we could even just encode encode

984
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:40,338
something like this since we're looking

985
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:45,050
top-down we could encode how much light

986
00:51:40,338 --> 00:51:49,460
was outgoing in each in each of the four

987
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:53,109
directions right what's the red outgoing

988
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,108
intensity in each of the four directions

989
00:51:53,380 --> 00:52:00,349
I know it sounds ridiculous it's

990
00:51:56,599 --> 00:52:05,030
incredibly lossy but we could do it

991
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:08,240
right and furthermore if we wanted to

992
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:10,910
make if we wanted to spend even more

993
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,549
resources on it we could get even more

994
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:16,819
accurate right another thing we could do

995
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:21,079
is say we have six textures one for each

996
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:26,930
face of the cube and we've got three

997
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:29,300
channels for texture RG and B leading to

998
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:31,608
a six times three storage requirement

999
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,980
right and I don't know again that could

1000
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:36,348
be in 16-bit or it could be you know so

1001
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:42,818
maybe it's by two so we end up with

1002
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:50,030
something that is 6 times 3 times 2

1003
00:52:42,818 --> 00:52:56,719
that's 36 bytes and who knows maybe it's

1004
00:52:50,030 --> 00:53:01,790
maybe it's 512 by 256 so it's about 4

1005
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:03,919
Meg's of slice so if we did 256 level 4

1006
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:06,318
so we could have 64 depth slices of that

1007
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,670
which would be massive I don't even know

1008
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:11,539
if we can spare that kind of bandwidth

1009
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:13,880
right so we can certainly slice it up in

1010
00:53:11,539 --> 00:53:16,309
a number of different ways and then

1011
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,980
store a bunch of lighting information

1012
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:20,659
into those textures once we store the

1013
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:25,490
lighting information into the textures

1014
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:28,239
we can then down sample it to get

1015
00:53:25,489 --> 00:53:31,239
various resolutions of that

1016
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,769
right and again I don't know if this is

1017
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:35,169
a particularly good idea I'm not trying

1018
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:37,449
to say one way or another whether it is

1019
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:40,150
or not but it's certainly something we

1020
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:43,750
could try the other thing we could try

1021
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:46,960
to say well what if we just stored an

1022
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:50,889
average direction and intensity so we

1023
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,619
had only four you know we had three

1024
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:57,309
textures one for r g and b and we had

1025
00:53:53,619 --> 00:54:09,460
four elements per texture we had

1026
00:53:57,309 --> 00:54:11,079
intensity and direction right I don't

1027
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,030
know which of these would be good but

1028
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:16,989
you can see that there is like room to

1029
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:21,190
play around here and so what I would

1030
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:22,779
propose we start with just to get things

1031
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:26,050
rolling and we'll tackle a little bit

1032
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:28,720
more next week is let's just try making

1033
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:30,640
one of these things with some

1034
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,219
flexibility so we'll try to parameterize

1035
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:34,869
it on how many textures we want and how

1036
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:36,639
many elements per texture there are so

1037
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:38,489
we can try either of these schemes or

1038
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:42,219
any other scheme you come up with right

1039
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:47,309
try making a 3d texture then rendering

1040
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:47,309
something into the 3d texture

1041
00:54:54,750 --> 00:55:02,679
yeah render something in the 3d texture

1042
00:54:57,608 --> 00:55:04,630
and then sample from it right now one of

1043
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:08,588
the tricky things about 3d textures is

1044
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:10,450
I'm not really sure to what extent we

1045
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:13,269
have control in this version of shading

1046
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:15,909
language over drawing into 3d textures

1047
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:18,039
in a deep sense like I don't know if we

1048
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:21,159
have to render lots of slices for our

1049
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:23,739
light in order to properly fill the 3d

1050
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:26,409
texture I could be that we do could be

1051
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:28,659
that we don't it could be that we can

1052
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:30,098
fill it in a more creative way but we

1053
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,809
might want to do that anyway just to

1054
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:33,190
avoid over filling so we might need to

1055
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:36,219
slice our lights up into several

1056
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:39,159
primitives or something like that that's

1057
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:41,078
why I'm not sure but yet what we would

1058
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:44,199
want to do here again is just figure out

1059
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,430
some way to get this process started by

1060
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:47,710
just creating those textures and drawing

1061
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:50,319
into them one thing we could do is do

1062
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:52,809
this in screen space what we're going to

1063
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:56,109
do is screw this with only one texture

1064
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:58,659
at first that I only want texture only

1065
00:55:56,108 --> 00:56:00,420
one depth level at first so instead of

1066
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:02,828
making a 3d texture we make a 2d texture

1067
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:06,690
and we just do the lighting in a plane

1068
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:14,769
first and then we try to extend it out

1069
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:18,059
after that to a 3d right so there's a

1070
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:18,059
thought I don't know

1071
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:30,559
what I do know is that going to produce

1072
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:33,809
copious amounts of mucus to Annoying

1073
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:37,289
anyway so if we wanted to do something

1074
00:56:33,809 --> 00:56:39,299
like that then really what we're talking

1075
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:42,570
about is at startup here we want to

1076
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:45,810
create some lighting information so

1077
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:47,280
inside our OpenGL startup code we're

1078
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:49,079
going to want to put something in here

1079
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,519
where you know normally we don't

1080
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:52,409
allocate much in the way of texture to

1081
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:54,420
startup but here we actually would be

1082
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:58,309
doing exactly that

1083
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:04,920
so we'd have in here a texture handle

1084
00:56:58,309 --> 00:57:06,360
that's like our light textures and like

1085
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,269
I said we don't know how many of those

1086
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:10,769
light textures there going to be but

1087
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:12,539
probably we're going to have to keep

1088
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:13,739
that to a relatively low number so I'm

1089
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:16,409
just going to throw in an eight right

1090
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:18,119
now and so that we you know have the

1091
00:57:16,409 --> 00:57:21,509
ability to do some of them but where

1092
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:26,039
they're going to be relatively modest

1093
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:29,310
and here we'll also say a light texture

1094
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:31,949
channel count and that'll give us the

1095
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:33,869
parameterization we want I could also do

1096
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:38,000
light texture count so we know how many

1097
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:41,789
textures there are we know how many

1098
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,010
channels there are per and so in here

1099
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:46,949
that we could also probably in here now

1100
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:58,890
think about there's the light texture

1101
00:57:46,949 --> 00:58:03,779
width height and depth right so what I

1102
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:07,440
would venture to guess is that these

1103
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:09,120
might want to be settings so the texture

1104
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,010
count in the channel count are going to

1105
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,019
be things that probably get fixed to the

1106
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:15,660
algorithm that we choose

1107
00:58:13,019 --> 00:58:19,440
but the settings are probably going to

1108
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:22,099
control the width and height because on

1109
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:26,820
lower end machines we would probably use

1110
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:28,679
worse sampling on the lighting right so

1111
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:31,280
much the same way that we can reduce the

1112
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:35,039
resolution of the game on worse machines

1113
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,530
or increase it on higher end machines to

1114
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:38,279
give better or worse results we could do

1115
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:41,760
the same

1116
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,019
sort of thing with no lighting so at the

1117
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:54,690
moment we'll just set it to something

1118
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:57,449
like this but in the future we might

1119
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:59,940
play with it more so the other thing we

1120
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:03,599
can do here is say what's the mid-level

1121
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:12,869
count all that it might actually be

1122
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:14,909
implied something like this right so

1123
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:19,259
let's go ahead and and see what we would

1124
00:59:14,909 --> 00:59:20,519
have to do to make this happen so now

1125
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,860
that I think about it this is probably

1126
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,780
not a gluant this is probably a frame

1127
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,309
buffer and the reason for that is we're

1128
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,260
going to render into these things in

1129
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:29,759
addition to reading from them so they're

1130
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,810
not really just going to be a text or

1131
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,970
handle they're going to be a text or

1132
00:59:30,809 --> 00:59:38,579
handle plus a frame rubber handle so in

1133
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:39,809
the process of starting if OpenGL we

1134
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:43,529
need to do some work here if you make

1135
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:45,119
these things happen and probably since

1136
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,890
they're going to be settings based what

1137
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,079
we want to do is actually do it up in

1138
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:59,339
the part where we have the settings

1139
00:59:49,079 --> 01:00:07,829
change right where is that I'm having a

1140
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:09,960
spelling there it is have a spelling

1141
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:13,199
problem today having typing typing

1142
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,480
problems so in here what we want to do

1143
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,219
is when we create all of our other

1144
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,530
resources like our depth field buffers

1145
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:21,899
we want to create in here our light

1146
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:23,160
texture buffers as well and what we want

1147
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,470
to do is we want to make sure that we

1148
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:27,299
free these two just Alessa graphics card

1149
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:31,679
know that when we change settings it can

1150
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:32,940
free up space to get rid of everything

1151
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:38,279
basically so it can free up space to

1152
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:39,490
create the new things so we'll go

1153
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,850
through here

1154
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:48,449
[Applause]

1155
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:51,980
and just three these frame buffers so

1156
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:54,929
[Applause]

1157
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:59,579
they will go away and then down here

1158
01:00:54,929 --> 01:01:12,869
when we actually need to compute the

1159
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:36,480
rest of our stuff we're going to do the

1160
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:43,289
opposite process so when we create our

1161
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:45,389
frame buffer here and you may have to

1162
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:50,550
add some parameters to our create frame

1163
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:52,980
of a call but for now we won't so you

1164
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:53,940
can kind of see here we are we know some

1165
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,050
of the stuff we're going to pass we're

1166
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:59,309
going to need a render depth there

1167
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:05,910
eventually probably so we're going to

1168
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:07,779
have to pass the current settings where

1169
01:02:05,909 --> 01:02:21,730
is that

1170
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:32,290
at we want from the settings the light

1171
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:34,719
texture with white texture height and at

1172
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:38,230
the moment we don't have a place to pass

1173
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:39,609
the depth so we're not going to but that

1174
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:42,730
will create a frame buffer for our youth

1175
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:45,309
there is a problem with this and the

1176
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:53,559
problem with this is that we don't want

1177
01:02:45,309 --> 01:02:55,360
to for creating the frame buffer here

1178
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:58,719
we're going to want to specify a

1179
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:00,940
specific type of storage that may not be

1180
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:02,109
the same storage as we use for like Def

1181
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:08,349
peels and stuff like that

1182
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:11,880
so when it creates a frame buffer you

1183
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:11,880
can see in here we've kind of got this

1184
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:16,050
you know filter type and slot and those

1185
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:18,760
sorts of things

1186
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:20,860
obviously we can we won't be wanting it

1187
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,140
multisample so that's fine

1188
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,550
filtered we will want it filtered so

1189
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:27,129
that's fine

1190
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:29,460
we don't want depth so that's fine but

1191
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:32,440
we do want color so that all works but

1192
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,599
the OpenGL default frame buffer texture

1193
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,210
format part of this that part kind of

1194
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:45,269
has to get fixed because that actually

1195
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:47,590
will not work right so that has to get

1196
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:51,429
replaced with some ability because we

1197
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:54,700
what we don't want srgb probably I mean

1198
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:56,349
maybe we do maybe we don't but we might

1199
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:58,239
want to store at the floating point we

1200
01:03:56,349 --> 01:03:59,799
don't know we really don't know what

1201
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:04,779
we're going to do here so that's a that

1202
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:07,510
one's a little bit trickier I think all

1203
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:10,840
right so just looking at that the other

1204
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:12,790
thing we would need to do is for a frame

1205
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:16,960
buffer text image here we would also

1206
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:18,519
need this guy to do 3d textures so width

1207
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,639
width and height it would also need a

1208
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:23,518
depth in here

1209
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:25,889
and so we would need to be able to do 3d

1210
01:04:23,518 --> 01:04:29,098
multi sample or 2d right which is one of

1211
01:04:25,889 --> 01:04:32,338
the really annoying things about OpenGL

1212
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:33,539
is you have to call a different function

1213
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:35,818
if you want a different dimension

1214
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:37,709
texture so it makes it harder to

1215
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:42,958
parameterize but that's just the way it

1216
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:47,368
goes okay but that's really all we're

1217
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:54,899
talking about for first steps here did I

1218
01:04:47,369 --> 01:05:15,690
not actually add these into the render

1219
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:17,729
settings there we go so we now compute

1220
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:19,318
sort of these values from it now these

1221
01:05:17,728 --> 01:05:21,179
two are going to be fixed based on the

1222
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:23,909
algorithm so the light texture can't for

1223
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:29,879
example let's say we were going to do

1224
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:31,708
one where we tracked for example the

1225
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,778
average direction and the average is

1226
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:36,478
envy and the summed intensity or

1227
01:05:33,778 --> 01:05:41,369
something like this right so all we're

1228
01:05:36,478 --> 01:05:46,068
going to do is is do three textures one

1229
01:05:41,369 --> 01:05:51,660
for r g and b and four channels right

1230
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:52,380
for XYZ direction and intensity the

1231
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:54,719
miscount

1232
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,190
is something that we want to know for

1233
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,838
other purposes right because we're going

1234
01:05:56,190 --> 01:06:02,130
to want to miss map these textures down

1235
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,599
for various reasons that we'll see later

1236
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:05,579
we're probably cubes we want to be able

1237
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,588
to sample from lower for more blurred

1238
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:11,880
versions of them for a number of reasons

1239
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:13,458
I suspect and so that at the moment is

1240
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,989
something that we're going to have to

1241
01:06:13,458 --> 01:06:19,198
compute from the information we're given

1242
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:22,228
in terms of the width and the height so

1243
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:25,079
in order to figure out the the MIT count

1244
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:27,448
I guess one thing we could do here to

1245
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:32,039
make this a little more precise since we

1246
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:33,550
need these to be power of two is we can

1247
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:35,740
also make it so

1248
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:37,570
that when we are talking about them we

1249
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:41,829
could talk about them in terms of their

1250
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:43,780
power to write so rather than calling

1251
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:46,420
them you know with the height or

1252
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:49,180
whatever will actually just specify the

1253
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:56,230
power of two here so in this case we

1254
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:59,919
would say that this is you know 981 so

1255
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:02,320
then if we want to know what the actual

1256
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,869
values of these are we would then say

1257
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:11,230
the light texture with you know the

1258
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:13,839
light texture high light texture depth

1259
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:16,809
are all going to be equal to whatever

1260
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:19,269
the power of twos are raised and that's

1261
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:21,989
just a way of enforcing the fact that we

1262
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:24,969
are not going to let you specify

1263
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:28,959
arbitrary settings for these you have to

1264
01:07:24,969 --> 01:07:33,089
specify a power of two in all cases so

1265
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:37,240
this is with power to hight power to and

1266
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:40,059
depth power to so then the miscount is

1267
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:46,569
easier to determine the miscount is just

1268
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:51,549
going to be whatever the actual texture

1269
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,940
with is don't miss our power to for the

1270
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:54,460
width

1271
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:58,150
if the width is the highest thing if

1272
01:07:54,460 --> 01:08:03,750
it's not then it's just whatever you

1273
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:03,750
know we can we can just keep going here

1274
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:11,650
[Applause]

1275
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:17,170
whichever one of these is the highest is

1276
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:19,380
the number of MIPS we would have if we

1277
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:28,810
went all the way down to a single pixel

1278
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:30,489
our single textual I should say so you

1279
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:32,798
know that's the myth count right that's

1280
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:36,189
how many lower resolution versions there

1281
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:39,189
would be of this thing so then when we

1282
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:41,529
create one it would look like this and

1283
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:43,059
again we're going to want to adjust how

1284
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:44,298
we're doing this but for now we'll just

1285
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:48,529
say like okay so we

1286
01:08:44,298 --> 01:08:50,359
got one it's fine

1287
01:08:48,529 --> 01:08:53,059
so that's how we would create our light

1288
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,670
textures and we would create one for our

1289
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:57,338
for g4b

1290
01:08:54,670 --> 01:09:00,158
so there's going to be three of them and

1291
01:08:57,338 --> 01:09:03,048
again their channels would be X Y Z

1292
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:11,318
intensity so like Direction X Direction

1293
01:09:03,048 --> 01:09:11,319
Y directions the intensity I guess I

1294
01:09:15,309 --> 01:09:21,859
mean if you think about it I guess

1295
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:26,630
really we don't need to specify three

1296
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:29,900
there because if we just sum up the RG

1297
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:32,900
and B values in their entirety

1298
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:34,908
you could you could just go with three

1299
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:39,078
channels so you could use like three

1300
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:41,598
16-bit channels rather than for 8-bit

1301
01:09:39,078 --> 01:09:45,939
channels but I think we probably want

1302
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:45,940
for 8-bit channels would be my guess

1303
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:49,719
it's hard to say

1304
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:59,689
so what I'm thinking about here just to

1305
01:09:56,429 --> 01:10:02,158
be a little bit more explicit about it

1306
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:06,210
so one thing you could do is let's say

1307
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:08,759
you have three floats you could just

1308
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:10,770
take the direction to the light and its

1309
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:13,020
intensity and scale it so we have

1310
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:14,790
direction and we have intensity we would

1311
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:17,250
just do the direction times the

1312
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:20,069
intensity is a vector that's as long as

1313
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:21,869
the intensity is we would just sum those

1314
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:24,539
together so it would just be the sum of

1315
01:10:21,869 --> 01:10:26,609
all the directional the intensities

1316
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:28,649
multiplied by their directions and that

1317
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:31,408
would just give us one value that's like

1318
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:37,649
here's the direction of the red light

1319
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:39,059
and its intensity roughly right now the

1320
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:41,488
problem with doing something like that

1321
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:44,880
is it means that opposite direction

1322
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:47,309
ality is canceled and maybe we want that

1323
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,779
or maybe we don't I have no idea but for

1324
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,550
example let's say we have a strong red

1325
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:51,658
light coming in this direction and a

1326
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:53,369
strong red light coming in this

1327
01:10:51,658 --> 01:10:57,359
direction they would cancel each other

1328
01:10:53,369 --> 01:11:04,710
out that doesn't seem like a very good

1329
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:07,679
thing to me right so what I assumed we

1330
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:11,489
would want to do instead is while we

1331
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:14,399
might want to do this in terms of making

1332
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:18,809
it so that brighter lights dominate the

1333
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:21,238
directional components we probably want

1334
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:23,760
to sum the intensity because otherwise

1335
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:25,408
we'll get all these weird anomalies so

1336
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,050
that's why I'm thinking what we want is

1337
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:29,908
three directional ones and one intensity

1338
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:34,020
one and the intensity one just gets

1339
01:11:29,908 --> 01:11:35,939
summed whereas the directional ones have

1340
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:37,920
that ability to cross cancel because

1341
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:39,658
there's negatives in there right there's

1342
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,210
no negatives in here these are all

1343
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:52,259
positives but this one has positives and

1344
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:52,770
negatives I so yeah that seems

1345
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,350
reasonable

1346
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:59,340
the only issue there is this is going to

1347
01:11:55,350 --> 01:12:04,230
require more than 8bits probably if

1348
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:06,779
we're honest at least

1349
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:09,198
if we do want there to be a strengthened

1350
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:09,198
astute

1351
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:18,229
[Applause]

1352
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:26,039
so that's hard to say fortunately it's

1353
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:28,559
an easy thing to determine what we can

1354
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:30,539
do is use floating point textures to

1355
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,750
start with so that we know that we have

1356
01:12:30,539 --> 01:12:36,090
pretty much infinite flexible you know

1357
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:38,760
flex room and then what we can do is

1358
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:40,409
scale it down to 16 see if we can make

1359
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,820
it work scale it down to 8 see if we can

1360
01:12:40,409 --> 01:12:45,809
make it work right so we can basically

1361
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:47,880
start with a very bloated representation

1362
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:50,240
that we know won't have problems with

1363
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,239
range

1364
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:58,109
we just you know successively get

1365
01:12:53,489 --> 01:13:03,289
simpler as we move down the line that

1366
01:12:58,109 --> 01:13:08,880
seems like a pretty good strategy to me

1367
01:13:03,289 --> 01:13:11,519
so yeah all right so here we create the

1368
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:17,039
frame buffer what I want to do in this

1369
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:21,870
case is make that create frame buffer

1370
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:24,630
called I would like that to have a flag

1371
01:13:21,869 --> 01:13:28,050
in it and see if what we've got here

1372
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:31,380
flipped up format yeah so what I would

1373
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:36,270
like to do here is I'd like to make a be

1374
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:37,109
32 X that says you know give float or

1375
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:43,620
something

1376
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:43,619
[Applause]

1377
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:49,759
[Applause]

1378
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:58,899
and if we use is float then when we

1379
01:13:55,619 --> 01:14:02,559
determine what the type is of the

1380
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:06,819
texture we're going to force it to be a

1381
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:09,640
floating-point version right so what I

1382
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:11,619
want to do there is this default frame

1383
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:14,140
buffer texture format thing probably has

1384
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:17,439
to go but what we probably want is our

1385
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:21,369
frame buffer textures sRGB or not if

1386
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:22,899
that makes sense and you know we

1387
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:29,670
probably have to expand this a little

1388
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:31,989
bit and then OpenGL depth component type

1389
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:35,770
you can see why this is a little bit

1390
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:40,359
nasty right because this again also kind

1391
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:42,970
of wants to know this information we did

1392
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:45,929
we test to see whether we can use a non

1393
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:49,510
floating-point depth buffer by the way I

1394
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:51,990
don't remember if we did that let's take

1395
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:51,989
a look at that

1396
01:14:57,448 --> 01:15:04,658
so there's with our floating-point depth

1397
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:05,529
buffer I could also turn off the

1398
01:15:04,658 --> 01:15:08,679
lighting for that

1399
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:08,679
[Applause]

1400
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:54,569
so look at this probably want to keep

1401
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:57,900
some of that there okay so looking at

1402
01:15:54,569 --> 01:15:59,069
this here you can see where we're at in

1403
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:01,649
terms of render quality with the

1404
01:15:59,069 --> 01:16:06,239
floating-point depth buffer and I had

1405
01:16:01,649 --> 01:16:11,849
not really tried playing to see whether

1406
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:20,539
we need the 32 F or not so we could try

1407
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:20,539
the depth component 24 and see how it is

1408
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:27,809
unfortunately with the lighting on

1409
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:30,260
directional like that it's pretty tough

1410
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:30,260
to tell

1411
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:47,139
but you don't see obvious artifacts in

1412
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:50,460
normal play so it does seem like we

1413
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:54,150
could probably get away without

1414
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,149
floating-point depth buffer

1415
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:33,860
so that doesn't necessarily mean we want

1416
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:35,750
to so yeah like we have some options

1417
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:37,099
there and yeah it looks like that's

1418
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,079
probably something we could parameterize

1419
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:40,310
in the future I don't know that there's

1420
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:41,840
much reason not to use the

1421
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:43,430
floating-point version but we might save

1422
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,250
some bandwidth or get a little bit of a

1423
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:49,390
performance win on some situations by

1424
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:57,890
not requiring such a heavyweight

1425
01:17:49,390 --> 01:18:00,739
z-buffer right so anyway I we're pretty

1426
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:02,750
good here and we're actually creating

1427
01:18:00,738 --> 01:18:05,448
those light textures now actually even

1428
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:07,189
though we don't use them for anything so

1429
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:09,229
now what we really want to do is we want

1430
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:12,469
to be able to sample from these lighting

1431
01:18:09,229 --> 01:18:15,738
textures when we're actually doing our

1432
01:18:12,469 --> 01:18:19,010
drawing right so what we want to do here

1433
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:22,849
is inside of our lighting we've got a

1434
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:24,289
but you know ton of code here that we

1435
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:27,199
were using for our lighting so here's

1436
01:18:24,289 --> 01:18:31,069
all of our lighting code right that

1437
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:34,009
we're doing and we don't really want to

1438
01:18:31,069 --> 01:18:38,349
be doing that stuff anymore the end is

1439
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:43,400
correct right we do want the total light

1440
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:45,530
value to come out but we're going to

1441
01:18:43,399 --> 01:18:49,309
want that to be an actual vector for you

1442
01:18:45,529 --> 01:18:53,300
know so we have an RGB an RG and B light

1443
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:55,820
there so we actually do kind of want to

1444
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:57,650
play with this last part a little bit

1445
01:18:55,819 --> 01:19:00,229
but we don't want the rest of this

1446
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:01,759
involved at the moment probably although

1447
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:04,789
I guess now think about it I guess we

1448
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:08,239
just can't kind of use it because we

1449
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:11,060
will well we won't necessarily have this

1450
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:13,479
part here right so this part kind of

1451
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,480
goes away

1452
01:19:17,029 --> 01:19:20,130
[Applause]

1453
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:26,750
well that part kind of goes away so we

1454
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:31,310
just we just have cosine angle equals

1455
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:39,800
dot like to light world end there the to

1456
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:41,030
light part is going to be is going to be

1457
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,890
the thing that we read out of the

1458
01:19:41,029 --> 01:19:45,289
texture right so we're going to read

1459
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:49,789
that to light direction out of the

1460
01:19:45,289 --> 01:19:54,769
texture directly and use that

1461
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:56,960
similarly the lighting distance part is

1462
01:19:54,770 --> 01:20:00,110
exactly the same that part's going to

1463
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,989
get read out as well so let me just kind

1464
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:04,779
of organize this up here so what we end

1465
01:20:02,988 --> 01:20:06,679
up with right is we've got a diffuse

1466
01:20:04,779 --> 01:20:09,769
coefficient for the surface which is

1467
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:12,560
something we may actually put into the

1468
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:17,680
vertex U at some point we compute the

1469
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,680
diffuse light by just sort of

1470
01:20:18,219 --> 01:20:22,189
multiplying in by that lighting value

1471
01:20:20,329 --> 01:20:24,920
and what we really want to do here I

1472
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:26,839
think is we just kind of we want to

1473
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,850
start treating these as vector equations

1474
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,969
so that we can do an R a G and a B

1475
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:34,760
together so I think what we want here is

1476
01:20:31,969 --> 01:20:38,659
we want this to be a v3 where we have a

1477
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:40,760
diffused coefficient times the cosine

1478
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:45,340
angle which will be different per

1479
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:49,270
channel so that'll be a vector3 right

1480
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:49,270
this will actually be a vector3

1481
01:20:49,569 --> 01:20:55,159
and then we've got that light strength

1482
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:57,160
which will also be a vector3

1483
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:59,750
[Applause]

1484
01:20:57,159 --> 01:21:03,469
same would be true here we'd have the

1485
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:05,119
specular specular coefficient which is

1486
01:21:03,469 --> 01:21:07,039
still a floating-point value that's just

1487
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:10,010
a property of the surface we have the

1488
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:11,810
cosine reflected angle and again that's

1489
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:15,560
going to be exactly the same thing here

1490
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:19,610
it's just going to turn into a vector3

1491
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:23,050
and then we would have the light

1492
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:25,759
strength again is also a vector3 right

1493
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:26,989
then when we compute the total light

1494
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,400
that will produce an

1495
01:21:26,988 --> 01:21:36,828
vector3 again turning this into an RGB

1496
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:39,078
separated equation so I'll make that

1497
01:21:36,828 --> 01:21:40,908
work with the current way we do lighting

1498
01:21:39,078 --> 01:21:43,158
just because that way we can sort of

1499
01:21:40,908 --> 01:21:46,460
just test to make sure it's working at

1500
01:21:43,158 --> 01:21:48,979
all so the way that this would work is

1501
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:51,710
the light distance computation now is

1502
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:53,928
something that is going to happen per

1503
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:56,538
channel so we kind of have to take this

1504
01:21:53,929 --> 01:21:58,609
and and blow it out the same is true for

1505
01:21:56,538 --> 01:22:04,998
the dot product there's really three dot

1506
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:08,719
products now that makes sense so it

1507
01:22:04,998 --> 01:22:20,300
looks more like this and again same here

1508
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:24,038
where we get three of these all right

1509
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,038
for critter will look like me on that

1510
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:43,729
[Applause]

1511
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:45,349
okay oh yeah so there's so really what

1512
01:22:43,729 --> 01:22:48,198
we're looking at now right is we're just

1513
01:22:45,349 --> 01:22:50,630
trying to expand this out to handle the

1514
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:54,098
fact that soon we will have different

1515
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:57,859
light strengths and different light

1516
01:22:54,099 --> 01:23:00,170
directions per color channel so the two

1517
01:22:57,859 --> 01:23:03,259
light vector will be to light our to

1518
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:05,359
light G to light B and the light

1519
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:06,800
strength will be like light strength our

1520
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,658
light strength do you like strength B

1521
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,150
then the rest of these equations are

1522
01:23:08,658 --> 01:23:13,670
still fine right there's nothing else

1523
01:23:11,149 --> 01:23:15,198
that we need to do in particular oops

1524
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:20,599
get it this one's got to do the same

1525
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:22,638
thing the rest of the equations just

1526
01:23:20,599 --> 01:23:26,779
flow properly they're just done per

1527
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:31,460
channel now instead of per for once for

1528
01:23:26,779 --> 01:23:33,559
the entire light probably since I can't

1529
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:36,529
quite see the parsing of these things

1530
01:23:33,559 --> 01:23:38,320
I just am missing parentheses or

1531
01:23:36,529 --> 01:23:46,729
something in here

1532
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:49,158
yep and so this is the exact same thing

1533
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:50,899
we were doing before right and we don't

1534
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:54,109
see any change because we're not doing a

1535
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:56,179
different R a G or a B right but what we

1536
01:23:54,109 --> 01:23:59,059
could do if we wanted to is since the

1537
01:23:56,179 --> 01:24:01,760
light strength is specified here what we

1538
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:13,219
could do is actually do a light strength

1539
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:15,670
bar for this now think about not going

1540
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:15,670
to do it here

1541
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:32,698
so in this case right we've got a light

1542
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:32,699
strength r g and b light strengths are

1543
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:42,909
see my 6d so I could make my light be a

1544
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:47,319
color it could be sort of you know

1545
01:24:42,909 --> 01:24:49,510
orangish or whatever and then when you

1546
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:52,659
know it lights the surface it's kind of

1547
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:54,640
tinting it right and similarly I could

1548
01:24:52,659 --> 01:24:55,988
knock out the blue entirely and then I'd

1549
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,780
been in the you know there's no more

1550
01:24:55,988 --> 01:25:00,968
blue light so now everything is like a

1551
01:24:58,779 --> 01:25:04,769
greenish yellow yellow yellow is tinge

1552
01:25:00,969 --> 01:25:04,770
to it right we can make it read only

1553
01:25:07,229 --> 01:25:18,879
oops and now it's kind of like like

1554
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:23,229
handmade hero photographer darkroom

1555
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:25,420
edition and so you know that's just

1556
01:25:23,229 --> 01:25:28,299
prepping for flowing these things in

1557
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:30,090
from a texture so then if we wanted to

1558
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:32,980
start flowing them in from a texture

1559
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:36,719
then what we would do right is instead

1560
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:39,669
of passing down a light P here where

1561
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,819
there's a specific value that's set as a

1562
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:44,319
uniform we would actually okay I'm out

1563
01:25:42,819 --> 01:25:51,369
of time so we'll do that next week we

1564
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:54,819
would just pass in here textures to

1565
01:25:51,369 --> 01:25:57,880
sample from and sample out the light

1566
01:25:54,819 --> 01:26:00,130
direction and light intensity for each

1567
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,900
channel from the corresponding three

1568
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:06,520
textures and that that's all we'd be

1569
01:26:01,899 --> 01:26:09,309
doing so pretty straightforward that

1570
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:12,010
make sense okay we can go ahead and and

1571
01:26:09,310 --> 01:26:13,120
go to the QA I don't want to start doing

1572
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:14,110
that because we won't have a chance

1573
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:17,670
finish doing that

1574
01:26:14,109 --> 01:26:17,670
oops that didn't work

1575
01:26:43,529 --> 01:26:52,439
well inside out 12 minutes into the

1576
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:52,440
mainstream

1577
01:26:56,289 --> 01:27:06,329
why does in sebat think that is the time

1578
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:06,329
set wrong on the schedule

1579
01:27:15,859 --> 01:27:22,809
no set right what happened in sir bot

1580
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:42,658
blow on a scale of 0 to 15 how

1581
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:46,099
disappointed are you that Visual Studio

1582
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:48,988
continued working as normal today

1583
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:51,270
I'm not disappointing to continue to I'm

1584
01:27:48,988 --> 01:27:55,289
actually relatively happy continued

1585
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:58,560
working as normal today just because I

1586
01:27:55,289 --> 01:28:00,769
don't like having to change development

1587
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:06,270
environments in the middle of a project

1588
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:08,489
right I like being able to just stick

1589
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:10,860
with one reliable that's that's why we

1590
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:13,649
also don't update Visual Studio like we

1591
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:14,969
could go switch to vigils - or 2017 but

1592
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:16,859
I don't want to do that because it just

1593
01:28:14,969 --> 01:28:18,000
brings a bunch of hassle like there's

1594
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:20,839
different things that has different

1595
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,510
errors there'll be different bugs right

1596
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:25,710
so mostly I wanted to start it on

1597
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:29,610
Windows I want to finish the development

1598
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:34,770
Hammad here on Windows and then never

1599
01:28:29,609 --> 01:28:41,729
use Windows again free but I don't

1600
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:42,449
really like switching purse you know

1601
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:44,039
infinity

1602
01:28:42,448 --> 01:28:51,569
I don't like changing horses midstream

1603
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:53,399
to quote wag the dog disused don't you

1604
01:28:51,569 --> 01:28:58,079
find this lighting way too advanced for

1605
01:28:53,399 --> 01:29:00,420
a 2.5 da m-- I don't really think

1606
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,569
there's any such thing as too advanced

1607
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:04,819
lighting for lack of a better statement

1608
01:29:02,569 --> 01:29:08,729
if that makes sense

1609
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:11,399
lighting makes games look awesome you

1610
01:29:08,729 --> 01:29:13,709
really can't have too much lighting in a

1611
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:16,079
game you can have bad lighting in a game

1612
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:20,489
or lighting that doesn't isn't

1613
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:23,698
appropriate sure but having a good

1614
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:27,539
lighting scheme makes games look really

1615
01:29:23,698 --> 01:29:29,638
good and I think when you see two and a

1616
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:35,340
half T games that have good lighting you

1617
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:42,920
notice - like they look really nice - no

1618
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:42,920
I don't really think so I so yeah

1619
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,920
uplink coder can i stream C to D

infringing on the copyright yeah just

1622
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:15,670
email me and I will give you permission

1623
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:20,559
to do what you need to do I basically

1624
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:23,199
like I just try to keep the source code

1625
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:27,760
is private to people who haven't

1626
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:32,289
licensed so as long as you keep the D

1627
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,880
source code private you know you could

1628
01:30:32,289 --> 01:30:36,430
put it on the handma hero github for

1629
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:41,409
example if you wanted to which is

1630
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:45,190
private until the codes release from the

1631
01:30:41,409 --> 01:30:47,920
public domain then then that's fine but

1632
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:51,389
yeah since obviously the streams are

1633
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:53,949
free anyone who wants to can can watch

1634
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:57,340
the handmade hero streams for free so

1635
01:30:53,949 --> 01:31:00,090
watching D streams of the same thing

1636
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,090
seems fine to me

1637
01:31:06,989 --> 01:31:13,050
how excited are you for pears project I

1638
01:31:10,289 --> 01:31:15,500
have a theme pears project is it on hand

1639
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:15,500
a network

1640
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:20,630
what's pears project

1641
01:31:29,539 --> 01:31:32,630
[Applause]

1642
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:41,319
I'm assuming you're talking about pair

1643
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:41,319
this pair

1644
01:31:58,789 --> 01:32:03,039
what is Paris project is there a link

1645
01:32:08,619 --> 01:32:14,019
shucks 93 note he is making an entire

1646
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:16,390
computer from scratch using fbas and

1647
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:19,360
hardware FPGAs and hardware that sounds

1648
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:21,600
cool I wonder if it could run handmade

1649
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:21,599
hero

1650
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:35,180
there is another person who's doing that

1651
01:32:32,729 --> 01:32:40,159
as well

1652
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:40,159
risky five is doing that I think

1653
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,970
Uncle John never do handmade compiler I

1654
01:32:48,189 --> 01:33:01,238
don't know he threatened to do it but he

1655
01:32:51,970 --> 01:33:04,650
hasn't done it yet maybe he will want to

1656
01:33:01,238 --> 01:33:04,649
do that sometime soon I don't know

1657
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:46,680
know so mid blue I'm not talking about

1658
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:47,399
me a Tatsu I'm talking about risky fives

1659
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:57,539
project

1660
01:33:47,399 --> 01:34:00,269
he did a FPGA I don't know how to search

1661
01:33:57,539 --> 01:34:03,750
for this but he did an FPGA that plays

1662
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:06,680
games and he asked about making one that

1663
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:06,680
would run handmade Hiro

1664
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:29,430
if not risk five the persons handle is

1665
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:34,110
risky size but it's not about the risk 5

1666
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:39,430
whereas yes Mia Tatsu is doing a risk 5

1667
01:34:34,109 --> 01:34:42,429
handmade tool chain thing but that's

1668
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:45,940
different I know this gets confusing I

1669
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:48,760
get confused I can't remember who is

1670
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:50,259
doing which sometimes for the handle

1671
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,730
especially because people I may know

1672
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:54,180
someone's actual name I don't know their

1673
01:34:51,729 --> 01:34:54,179
handle

1674
01:35:33,078 --> 01:35:38,649
alright looks like we don't have any cue

1675
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,760
columns here so I can wrap it up Oh

1676
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:42,170
jeepers Caleb short of the fact that

1677
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,579
most gamers use Windows is there any

1678
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:46,130
reason to do most of the development on

1679
01:35:43,578 --> 01:35:51,558
Windows yeah it's more stable for

1680
01:35:46,130 --> 01:35:53,659
debugging by far my experience with

1681
01:35:51,559 --> 01:35:56,840
trying to debug GPU stuff on Linux has

1682
01:35:53,658 --> 01:35:59,179
not been good and the debuggers on Linux

1683
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:03,050
I also find to be not good

1684
01:35:59,179 --> 01:36:08,149
so editing on the next is fine compiling

1685
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:10,250
on Linux is fine like clang is good it's

1686
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:11,658
you know if anything at this point

1687
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:18,789
probably better than visual studios

1688
01:36:11,658 --> 01:36:25,488
compiler like right but trying to like

1689
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:30,948
run debug and analyze graphics intensive

1690
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:34,669
applications on Linux is not good in my

1691
01:36:30,948 --> 01:36:38,359
experience so part of that is probably

1692
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:40,460
because I'm probably a little more

1693
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:42,368
biased against it than I should be like

1694
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:45,230
I can say definitively the debugger suck

1695
01:36:42,368 --> 01:36:47,689
like Linux does not have any debuggers

1696
01:36:45,229 --> 01:36:54,738
that are have good human factors in my

1697
01:36:47,689 --> 01:36:56,988
opinions graphics debugging is probably

1698
01:36:54,738 --> 01:37:00,289
I'm being a little unfair and the reason

1699
01:36:56,988 --> 01:37:03,618
for that is that when I've done when I

1700
01:37:00,289 --> 01:37:08,719
did graphics work on Linux I was using a

1701
01:37:03,618 --> 01:37:11,380
laptop and the difference between

1702
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:15,260
Windows and Linux in terms of handling

1703
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:18,859
laptop graphics is like you know an

1704
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:22,670
unfathomable huge Gulf that's not true

1705
01:37:18,859 --> 01:37:23,630
for desktops desktops Linux is much more

1706
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:26,449
comfortable when it just has one

1707
01:37:23,630 --> 01:37:29,630
graphics card to deal with so it's

1708
01:37:26,448 --> 01:37:31,939
probably much better in that regard so

1709
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:34,760
that part probably gets better just you

1710
01:37:31,939 --> 01:37:37,448
know get a graphics card that's a

1711
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:41,030
well-tested Linux graphics card

1712
01:37:37,448 --> 01:37:42,710
whichever one that should be and you

1713
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:43,479
know whether it's Nvidia AMD these days

1714
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:47,649
I don't know who

1715
01:37:43,479 --> 01:37:51,309
better support and that part probably

1716
01:37:47,649 --> 01:37:53,589
takes care itself a lot more on what I

1717
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:56,320
found was that for trying to use a

1718
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:58,659
laptop with its support for you know

1719
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:04,139
optimists you know discreet switchable

1720
01:37:58,659 --> 01:38:04,139
graphics is just really bad so

1721
01:38:15,908 --> 01:38:19,939
ray Kassar do you have any anecdotes of

1722
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:22,929
horrible debugging experiences using

1723
01:38:19,939 --> 01:38:25,368
Linux of errors oh sure

1724
01:38:22,929 --> 01:38:27,819
so my experience using Linux the buggers

1725
01:38:25,368 --> 01:38:31,279
you don't even have to get complicated I

1726
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:36,219
found that when in a full debug build so

1727
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:39,948
no optimizations enabled I found that

1728
01:38:36,219 --> 01:38:46,599
most Linux the buggers if not all except

1729
01:38:39,948 --> 01:38:46,598
for direct use of gdb command-line gdb

1730
01:38:46,899 --> 01:38:54,529
none of them could even display the

1731
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:55,908
elements of a lot of my structures a lot

1732
01:38:54,529 --> 01:38:59,238
of them couldn't display local variables

1733
01:38:55,908 --> 01:39:01,488
and this would tend to be fairly random

1734
01:38:59,238 --> 01:39:03,018
so it'd just be like yep that function

1735
01:39:01,488 --> 01:39:06,169
we just we don't know where the local

1736
01:39:03,019 --> 01:39:09,079
variables are sorry or that structure we

1737
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:13,460
can't we can't I don't know I'm sorry

1738
01:39:09,078 --> 01:39:14,840
and this happens all the time so I would

1739
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:17,090
just generally be in cases where you

1740
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:19,690
know just does work when it does work

1741
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:23,029
it's incredibly slow single stepping

1742
01:39:19,689 --> 01:39:26,238
took an eternity on a very fast laptop

1743
01:39:23,029 --> 01:39:29,559
right I could watch the time it took to

1744
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:35,178
let get from line to line you know and

1745
01:39:29,559 --> 01:39:36,469
it's just nuts right so I found the

1746
01:39:35,179 --> 01:39:39,380
debugging experience on Linux is just

1747
01:39:36,469 --> 01:39:41,179
horrible there's no reason that I know

1748
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:42,920
of that it has to be horrible like I

1749
01:39:41,179 --> 01:39:46,908
don't think linux as an operating system

1750
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:50,029
has some core problem you know at its

1751
01:39:46,908 --> 01:39:52,279
root that means debugging can't work but

1752
01:39:50,029 --> 01:39:53,868
whatever the reason is whether it's the

1753
01:39:52,279 --> 01:39:57,529
fact that everything is like a tower of

1754
01:39:53,868 --> 01:39:59,839
cards built on Jesus gdb or something or

1755
01:39:57,529 --> 01:40:03,139
whether it's the dwarf model is bad or

1756
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,019
something and I'm studied it I don't

1757
01:40:03,139 --> 01:40:08,710
know what the problem is

1758
01:40:05,019 --> 01:40:08,710
there are problems

1759
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:16,259
[Music]

1760
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:21,170
have you considered Visual Studio code

1761
01:40:19,369 --> 01:40:22,609
over visual studio still Microsoft but

1762
01:40:21,170 --> 01:40:25,399
much more lightweight and you get the

1763
01:40:22,609 --> 01:40:34,159
visual studio debugger are you talking

1764
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:35,719
about on Windows or on Linux ray caster

1765
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:37,519
asked have you tried visions bugging

1766
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,869
using QT creator does not seem to have

1767
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,870
the issue who described these nephrons

1768
01:40:38,869 --> 01:40:44,960
parts that actually was specifically the

1769
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:50,869
debugger I would say had all of those

1770
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:53,180
problems because I did use that one it

1771
01:40:50,869 --> 01:40:56,649
was the least bad and it has all of

1772
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:56,650
those problems that I just described

1773
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:09,560
demon Sookie on Windows on Linux you

1774
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:12,460
don't get the VC plus listed burger on

1775
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:16,270
Windows no I haven't

1776
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:16,270
[Applause]

1777
01:41:25,429 --> 01:41:31,880
I'm happy to try it though is there a

1778
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:35,469
64-bit version probably not there isn't

1779
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:35,469
a 64-bit version of Visual Studio so

1780
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:46,170
if you want to know what that agreement

1781
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:46,170
said

1782
01:42:26,988 --> 01:42:32,959
I like it how like just a thing that's

1783
01:42:29,449 --> 01:42:35,750
just an an editor debugger has to

1784
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:38,420
install like 8 billion files it's like

1785
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:46,100
why isn't just an executable or like to

1786
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:47,480
dll's or something I have no idea got to

1787
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:52,510
have more JSON

1788
01:42:47,479 --> 01:42:57,259
I guess so let's see here's here it is

1789
01:42:52,510 --> 01:43:09,409
no what happened there so here it is

1790
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:15,400
I want to bug something can i D bug an

1791
01:43:09,409 --> 01:43:21,529
executable somehow debug ad

1792
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:32,889
configuration open a folder ok let's

1793
01:43:21,529 --> 01:43:32,889
open a folder w hand-made misc

1794
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:37,350
build

1795
01:43:42,979 --> 01:43:55,599
can I be bug now debug debug open

1796
01:43:52,908 --> 01:43:55,598
configurations

1797
01:43:56,810 --> 01:43:59,899
[Music]

1798
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:18,519
I really don't want you to use git for

1799
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:18,520
anything

1800
01:44:34,979 --> 01:44:37,819
all right

1801
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:51,430
install is it installed

1802
01:44:54,238 --> 01:45:13,259
all right how do i do bug to bug bug the

1803
01:44:58,949 --> 01:45:18,929
program as configuration c++ i want okay

1804
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:25,760
I want that's this is what I want to bug

1805
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:32,869
the program please start debugging I

1806
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:32,869
want C++ that's the environment okay

1807
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:02,010
I would like to debug now please to bug

1808
01:45:57,090 --> 01:46:09,020
my programs please debug it will you and

1809
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:09,020
debug the program now debug the program

1810
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:21,200
so how do you devote the program

1811
01:46:54,038 --> 01:46:59,529
reload okay

1812
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:17,659
I will reload I have oh god okay

1813
01:47:10,039 --> 01:47:24,949
I have reloaded and now I need to reload

1814
01:47:17,659 --> 01:47:29,710
again okay here we are

1815
01:47:24,949 --> 01:47:41,210
I want to start debugging with Windows

1816
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:44,810
C++ I want to do some thing here into a

1817
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:59,119
program name here is the program name

1818
01:47:44,810 --> 01:48:02,210
it's W build win32 handmade exe right is

1819
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:10,399
this the working directory so the

1820
01:48:02,210 --> 01:48:14,590
working directory is W build no it's not

1821
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:15,829
the working directory is W handmade data

1822
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:19,100
right

1823
01:48:15,829 --> 01:48:20,659
add some cigarettes oh okay I'll wait a

1824
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:29,539
mess with the square on the screen all

1825
01:48:20,659 --> 01:48:35,470
right I don't have know what to do now

1826
01:48:29,539 --> 01:48:40,090
so okay I have put that in there

1827
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:41,409
there is the configuration and

1828
01:48:40,090 --> 01:48:45,130
[Music]

1829
01:48:41,409 --> 01:48:45,130
everyone's happy right

1830
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:54,289
there we go all right so we got it

1831
01:48:52,159 --> 01:49:01,369
launching so I'm assuming can I step

1832
01:48:54,289 --> 01:49:04,600
into it now step in step into the tip

1833
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:08,000
okay that just changes it to full screen

1834
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:17,630
how do we step into the first line of

1835
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:22,789
the program right well let's set a

1836
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:28,039
breakpoint then I guess can I set a

1837
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:32,300
breakpoint new breakpoint just a

1838
01:49:28,039 --> 01:49:37,760
function breakpoint set breakpoint how

1839
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:42,350
do you set a breakpoint debug new break

1840
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:44,360
point function breakpoint okay so that

1841
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:47,239
didn't work at all

1842
01:49:44,359 --> 01:49:49,880
debug new breakpoint conditions a

1843
01:49:47,238 --> 01:49:52,009
breakpoint that didn't work either

1844
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:56,079
all right we're on a roll here we're

1845
01:49:52,010 --> 01:49:56,079
really getting some debugging going

1846
01:49:56,770 --> 01:50:02,960
can't seem to set any breakpoints so

1847
01:49:59,869 --> 01:50:07,369
that's fine I guess I'll just hit start

1848
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:10,730
to bugging and then I'll hit break so

1849
01:50:07,369 --> 01:50:14,079
break nope that wasn't break that would

1850
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:14,079
stop start debugging

1851
01:50:17,149 --> 01:50:27,149
that break okay so we broke there we go

1852
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:33,469
here's our main thread and it has no

1853
01:50:27,149 --> 01:50:35,429
idea where the source code is all right

1854
01:50:33,469 --> 01:50:45,349
how would I tell it where the source

1855
01:50:35,429 --> 01:50:45,349
code is debug load symbols anyone so

1856
01:50:46,069 --> 01:51:04,288
open folder select source folder okay so

1857
01:50:53,849 --> 01:51:06,859
this handmade code select folder what

1858
01:51:04,288 --> 01:51:06,858
just happened

1859
01:51:12,079 --> 01:51:19,800
okay so that no so I guess my short

1860
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,520
answer is unless I'm really missing

1861
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:26,730
something no that's awful so far did

1862
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:31,320
that leave crap in my directory in my

1863
01:51:26,729 --> 01:51:34,919
build directory as well or did it thanks

1864
01:51:31,319 --> 01:51:40,729
it was it mercifully yes awesome

1865
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:40,730
so it also crapped out whatever this is

1866
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:54,870
which is that launch program we did um I

1867
01:51:52,909 --> 01:51:58,469
would have to play with it

1868
01:51:54,869 --> 01:52:01,829
a more more to see whether I cared but

1869
01:51:58,469 --> 01:52:03,180
chances are no that I have a lot of

1870
01:52:01,829 --> 01:52:07,279
doubts that that is going to be a

1871
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:07,280
particularly good way to debug stuff

1872
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:23,259
[Music]

1873
01:52:44,949 --> 01:52:48,889
but yeah I mean I also don't know that

1874
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:52,029
this is necessarily designed for

1875
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:52,030
something that I'm going to want to do

1876
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:57,980
either right I mean it's designed as an

1877
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,310
IDE and I just want it to run the

1878
01:52:57,979 --> 01:53:02,539
debugger so it's by definition probably

1879
01:53:01,310 --> 01:53:04,850
going to be something that doesn't

1880
01:53:02,539 --> 01:53:07,609
particularly work but okay just to use

1881
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:10,250
if you think I'm being dumb walk me

1882
01:53:07,609 --> 01:53:12,349
through it allow me to debug my program

1883
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:19,600
at source level with this tool hit me

1884
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:21,680
I'll follow the steps that you type in I

1885
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:29,600
mean obviously I'll launch the program

1886
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:31,960
for you well I don't know where it went

1887
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:38,320
but hold on a second we'll get it back

1888
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:41,000
there it is all right so we're launched

1889
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:46,630
we don't need get for anything at the

1890
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,630
moment so hit me what's step one

1891
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:54,748
[Applause]

1892
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:05,729
okay open folder code that is wait so

1893
01:54:03,809 --> 01:54:09,840
you're saying the best what we have open

1894
01:54:05,729 --> 01:54:16,919
right now right add configuration for

1895
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:21,900
C++ so that was this right windows I'm

1896
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:33,319
assuming and we got to do this again so

1897
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:43,679
this w build winter cue handmade egg Z W

1898
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:46,259
handmade data right and I'm assuming I

1899
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:47,460
have to save this but it might save it

1900
01:54:46,260 --> 01:54:52,139
automatically but I'll save it myself

1901
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:53,939
just in case all right so now add break

1902
01:54:52,139 --> 01:54:58,859
point wherever you want start debugging

1903
01:54:53,939 --> 01:55:01,908
okay so I just wanted to step in to the

1904
01:54:58,859 --> 01:55:01,908
first line to program

1905
01:55:08,189 --> 01:55:12,929
so here's the first line of program

1906
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:23,170
debug toggle breakpoint run there we go

1907
01:55:19,869 --> 01:55:26,170
so I guess the answer is it can't load

1908
01:55:23,170 --> 01:55:29,409
source out of a PDB so what do you do if

1909
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:34,149
you have multiple source folders do you

1910
01:55:29,409 --> 01:55:36,130
add source folders somehow like let's

1911
01:55:34,149 --> 01:55:38,559
say there was another source folder in a

1912
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:44,460
different directory how would I specify

1913
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:44,460
this can I not do that

1914
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:56,350
you can add more include directories so

1915
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:57,490
how do do you have to do that manually

1916
01:55:56,350 --> 01:56:10,810
like would I do that

1917
01:55:57,489 --> 01:56:13,899
in a project file somewhere all right

1918
01:56:10,810 --> 01:56:20,470
well anyway so let's see now that we

1919
01:56:13,899 --> 01:56:25,210
actually can look at something let's see

1920
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:28,119
how the single stepping speed is okay

1921
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:29,350
dude seriously though I really don't

1922
01:56:28,119 --> 01:56:31,720
think I'm being dumb here are you

1923
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:33,520
looking at this did you see how long it

1924
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:37,329
took to step over this is what this

1925
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:39,010
isn't and this is that that was nuts how

1926
01:56:37,329 --> 01:56:42,939
long it took the step-over desired

1927
01:56:39,010 --> 01:56:44,800
schedule MF equals one look at how long

1928
01:56:42,939 --> 01:56:51,969
it took the step over window klass

1929
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:58,409
equals nothing those were a little

1930
01:56:51,970 --> 01:57:00,760
better but man that that speed is awful

1931
01:56:58,409 --> 01:57:02,349
that was fine because that's an it open

1932
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:04,150
jail that that might actually take some

1933
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:06,700
time but that should be instantaneous

1934
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:10,210
and it like those two should have been

1935
01:57:06,699 --> 01:57:16,329
roughly instantaneous and one was way

1936
01:57:10,210 --> 01:57:19,840
longer than the other look at how long

1937
01:57:16,329 --> 01:57:21,789
it took a step over that I mean that

1938
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:23,319
feels exactly like the Linux the bugger

1939
01:57:21,789 --> 01:57:24,670
to me all the latest burgers actually

1940
01:57:23,319 --> 01:57:26,979
weren't that slow they were they were

1941
01:57:24,670 --> 01:57:29,710
faster than that that was setting

1942
01:57:26,979 --> 01:57:32,379
monitor refresh Hertz to 60 that's how

1943
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:34,119
long it took to step over I'm assuming

1944
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:42,010
this is because this window is really

1945
01:57:34,119 --> 01:57:44,319
non performant like if I closed that all

1946
01:57:42,010 --> 01:57:48,010
the sudden is totally fat right so it's

1947
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:50,369
it's this is this is really bad for some

1948
01:57:48,010 --> 01:57:53,610
reason they must have a really slow

1949
01:57:50,369 --> 01:57:53,609
version of that

1950
01:58:00,279 --> 01:58:09,130
so if maybe maybe just leave the watch

1951
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:13,430
window is the only thing open right now

1952
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:18,980
now the feed is actually usable oops now

1953
01:58:13,430 --> 01:58:23,329
the speed is actually usable so maybe if

1954
01:58:18,979 --> 01:58:35,179
you just use a watch let's see how this

1955
01:58:23,329 --> 01:58:40,220
is so there mm have one watch open that

1956
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:42,800
seems that seems fine right so it seems

1957
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:45,250
like maybe if you just you just can't

1958
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:49,000
like don't look at locals or whatever I

1959
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:49,000
could I could live with that

1960
01:58:53,069 --> 01:59:00,858
[Applause]

1961
01:59:01,029 --> 01:59:06,079
I see they inherited some of the

1962
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:07,760
badnesses of visual studios to bugger as

1963
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:11,059
well like for example not being able to

1964
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:13,880
look at a variable after the instruction

1965
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:16,400
of a loop when you hit the closing brace

1966
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:19,039
I hate that but visual studio debugger

1967
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:22,819
does it too now didn't used to that does

1968
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:25,159
now so that you know I could I could

1969
01:59:22,819 --> 01:59:27,170
deal with that assuming that it doesn't

1970
01:59:25,159 --> 01:59:29,989
get a preacher bleah what okay I don't

1971
01:59:27,170 --> 01:59:33,880
know it's now it's extremely slow for

1972
01:59:29,989 --> 01:59:33,880
some reason but I have no idea why

1973
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:50,039
all right where is the cursor does

1974
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:50,039
anyone know even where the cursor is

1975
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,420
what

1976
02:00:00,859 --> 02:00:13,250
wait what we're down here now oh because

1977
02:00:09,590 --> 02:00:19,340
I'm us ahsoka all right well let's see

1978
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:22,600
can we step through the assembly how do

1979
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:22,600
I see the assembly code

1980
02:00:31,748 --> 02:00:37,109
des Utes how do I step through the

1981
02:00:34,389 --> 02:00:37,109
assembly code

1982
02:00:47,059 --> 02:01:02,309
helped our developer tools alright

1983
02:00:55,859 --> 02:01:04,759
that's not useful can I step through the

1984
02:01:02,309 --> 02:01:04,760
assembly

1985
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:24,740
it can't do oh okay so you can't even

1986
02:01:22,729 --> 02:01:26,599
see a disassembly even a stuff it can

1987
02:01:24,739 --> 02:01:31,250
step through so what why are we even

1988
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:35,710
talking about this then I mean we need

1989
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:45,649
to be able to step into assembly right I

1990
02:01:35,710 --> 02:01:49,069
mean that's it yeah so all right I mean

1991
02:01:45,649 --> 02:01:50,539
that that if someone had told me that at

1992
02:01:49,069 --> 02:01:52,460
the beginning we wouldn't bother trying

1993
02:01:50,539 --> 02:01:56,210
it I assume that since it used the

1994
02:01:52,460 --> 02:02:01,039
visual of a team matsuki says you can

1995
02:01:56,210 --> 02:02:06,170
step through the assembly how do you how

1996
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:10,449
do you step into this assembly gives you

1997
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:10,449
bug with - exact disassembly

1998
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:24,720
hmm what is - exact disassembly is where

1999
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:30,539
do you set those parameters are they in

2000
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:41,930
the launch JSON file or they are they a

2001
02:02:30,539 --> 02:02:41,930
parameter to the actual program

2002
02:03:03,168 --> 02:03:17,208
it's in args so it's in here can I just

2003
02:03:14,418 --> 02:03:18,769
put it in like literally in here or is

2004
02:03:17,208 --> 02:03:26,389
that what's this I don't know what the

2005
02:03:18,769 --> 02:03:28,880
format is for bees obviously but that's

2006
02:03:26,389 --> 02:03:33,519
the arms to my program so I mean I

2007
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,519
wouldn't pass that to my program right

2008
02:03:34,538 --> 02:03:38,319
doesn't really make sense

2009
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:57,739
okay in the debug console alright so so

2010
02:03:56,329 --> 02:04:02,939
let's say I want to view this assembly

2011
02:03:57,738 --> 02:04:04,869
here so you're saying I could do it here

2012
02:04:02,939 --> 02:04:15,559
[Applause]

2013
02:04:04,869 --> 02:04:21,890
oops where do I wear what I suppose this

2014
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:24,250
wants an actual command right put it in

2015
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:24,250
here

2016
02:04:45,479 --> 02:04:48,989
yeah I know

2017
02:04:55,729 --> 02:05:01,859
it doesn't know that as an actual thing

2018
02:04:59,579 --> 02:05:06,930
to type in here maybe you type debug

2019
02:05:01,859 --> 02:05:10,469
exact buggers and we would need we need

2020
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:13,380
some kind of a tutorial here to say just

2021
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:16,280
disassembly is the command ok this

2022
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:16,279
assembly

2023
02:05:38,238 --> 02:05:49,198
hmm I mean I can't say it's looking

2024
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:50,908
encouraging at the moment I mean there

2025
02:05:49,198 --> 02:05:53,729
should just be a thing like show me the

2026
02:05:50,908 --> 02:05:56,158
disassembly like I don't understand why

2027
02:05:53,729 --> 02:05:58,669
would have to have some kind of fancy

2028
02:05:56,158 --> 02:05:58,670
mumbo-jumbo

2029
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:29,530
control shift key this assembly yeah

2030
02:06:35,659 --> 02:06:43,108
[Applause]

2031
02:06:51,819 --> 02:06:55,108
[Music]

2032
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,600
so I guess I should ask the other

2033
02:07:19,739 --> 02:07:25,460
question is was that to imply that

2034
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:25,460
there's also no memory window

2035
02:07:39,420 --> 02:07:44,220
yes seriously man I don't know about

2036
02:07:41,310 --> 02:07:50,690
this like this seems like it really does

2037
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:53,310
not have what I would want but I mean

2038
02:07:50,689 --> 02:07:59,819
you know maybe if you know if you're

2039
02:07:53,310 --> 02:08:05,910
very familiar with it maybe you know the

2040
02:07:59,819 --> 02:08:07,769
secret way to get some of this stuff but

2041
02:08:05,909 --> 02:08:09,539
you know I obviously want the ability to

2042
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:11,790
just like see the disassembly at any

2043
02:08:09,539 --> 02:08:17,659
time and I need to be able to see the

2044
02:08:11,789 --> 02:08:17,659
memory like view memory at any time

2045
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:23,699
[Applause]

2046
02:08:35,079 --> 02:08:39,109
what's the reason behind checking out

2047
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:43,369
this atrocity or program someone asked

2048
02:08:39,109 --> 02:08:46,759
on the frame so I checked it out I would

2049
02:08:43,369 --> 02:08:49,010
say like it looks like I said originally

2050
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:51,230
it really looks on promising I would not

2051
02:08:49,010 --> 02:08:54,500
suspect it would work very well based on

2052
02:08:51,229 --> 02:08:57,259
what I saw there but you know maybe if

2053
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:58,579
you learn all that I mean to be fair you

2054
02:08:57,260 --> 02:09:01,340
have to learn how to use Visual Studio

2055
02:08:58,579 --> 02:09:03,800
as well right and I just happen to know

2056
02:09:01,340 --> 02:09:09,890
how to use it so it might be that

2057
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:13,100
there's some kind of specialness there

2058
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:19,100
but I don't know so I wouldn't say that

2059
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:22,210
looks very promising now as for Liza I

2060
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:26,210
would love it if that was working now or

2061
02:09:22,210 --> 02:09:28,579
also there's that there's two handmade

2062
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:36,489
debugger projects now there's ly si and

2063
02:09:28,579 --> 02:09:36,489
also the what was it recent thing dB

2064
02:09:38,359 --> 02:09:44,988
[Applause]

2065
02:09:46,698 --> 02:10:02,089
remedy BG so there's this one too

2066
02:09:54,319 --> 02:10:05,630
there's actually two projects debugger

2067
02:10:02,090 --> 02:10:09,050
projects going here's one here's the

2068
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:14,359
other and they both just just made

2069
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:18,400
patrons recently unfortunately as far as

2070
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:24,799
I know neither of them are actually

2071
02:10:18,399 --> 02:10:27,698
available yet hopefully one of them will

2072
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:27,699
work I don't know

2073
02:10:56,248 --> 02:11:00,809
uhh frosting ninja how do you feel after

2074
02:10:59,219 --> 02:11:02,130
today's stream we nearly switch to Linux

2075
02:11:00,809 --> 02:11:03,719
and now you're looking at four answers

2076
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:06,359
regarding to web editor on stack

2077
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:08,670
overflow yeah it's not great this is why

2078
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:10,529
development is just not very fun anymore

2079
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:12,779
and I try to isolate myself from the

2080
02:11:10,529 --> 02:11:16,800
world of development at large it's just

2081
02:11:12,779 --> 02:11:18,538
not a pleasant place ray caster are you

2082
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:22,050
still tempted at moving the product to

2083
02:11:18,538 --> 02:11:26,488
Linux I would not like to move till

2084
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:28,529
we're done i but like I said you know I

2085
02:11:26,488 --> 02:11:33,328
will probably move Molly Rocket over to

2086
02:11:28,529 --> 02:11:35,189
Linux next project because you know

2087
02:11:33,328 --> 02:11:37,170
Windows is not really viable anymore in

2088
02:11:35,189 --> 02:11:39,689
my opinion as a thing to like base your

2089
02:11:37,170 --> 02:11:41,550
company on it's way too unpredictable

2090
02:11:39,689 --> 02:11:44,308
and it has to be connected to the

2091
02:11:41,550 --> 02:11:45,929
Internet and it's just if bad right so

2092
02:11:44,309 --> 02:11:47,579
it's it's not really something I would

2093
02:11:45,929 --> 02:11:50,340
consider for the next rena so I'll be

2094
02:11:47,578 --> 02:11:52,349
moving to Linux in the near future for

2095
02:11:50,340 --> 02:11:54,029
my own stuff handmade hero I'd like to

2096
02:11:52,349 --> 02:11:55,498
just finish on what we started the same

2097
02:11:54,029 --> 02:11:57,328
reason I don't move to Linux in the

2098
02:11:55,498 --> 02:12:01,469
middle of our current project at Molly

2099
02:11:57,328 --> 02:12:03,538
rocket right because it just figure it

2100
02:12:01,469 --> 02:12:07,309
throws a lot it just is a big disruption

2101
02:12:03,538 --> 02:12:09,988
so I'd like to be able to finish and

2102
02:12:07,309 --> 02:12:14,900
then you know do a switch in between

2103
02:12:09,988 --> 02:12:21,208
projects that's kind of better I think

2104
02:12:14,899 --> 02:12:24,888
so yeah oh yes don't forget to delete

2105
02:12:21,208 --> 02:12:24,889
the vs code folder thank you

2106
02:12:28,189 --> 02:12:33,849
I love those just drops you don't even

2107
02:12:30,649 --> 02:12:43,670
ask it to do that but it like creates

2108
02:12:33,850 --> 02:12:50,050
its own like yeah it creates its own

2109
02:12:43,670 --> 02:12:51,319
stuff everywhere tercer flashes or feeis

2110
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:56,270
okay

2111
02:12:51,319 --> 02:13:01,779
I think we've got it thank you for that

2112
02:12:56,270 --> 02:13:01,780
reminder that's off

2113
02:13:07,979 --> 02:13:16,799
all right I'm going to wrap it up thank

2114
02:13:15,810 --> 02:13:17,940
you everyone for joining me for episode

2115
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:20,579
of hand made here at some pleasure

2116
02:13:17,939 --> 02:13:22,679
coding with you as always if you would

2117
02:13:20,579 --> 02:13:24,029
like to follow along with the series at

2118
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:25,470
home because period of the game and it

2119
02:13:24,029 --> 02:13:27,750
comes with a source code

2120
02:13:25,470 --> 02:13:30,720
maybe you should go running on Linux in

2121
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:36,119
fact as you saw today you can't really

2122
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:38,070
trust Microsoft tools to run day-to-day

2123
02:13:36,119 --> 02:13:44,880
they may just decide that suddenly they

2124
02:13:38,069 --> 02:13:46,139
need to talk about a license yeah so if

2125
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:48,210
you would like to ask questions we have

2126
02:13:46,140 --> 02:13:49,530
forum you can go to the patreon page

2127
02:13:48,210 --> 02:13:52,079
where the view is serious you have a

2128
02:13:49,529 --> 02:13:53,399
schedule bot you can go to if you wonder

2129
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:56,069
when we're going to be live and an

2130
02:13:53,399 --> 02:13:57,329
episode guide with past episodes on them

2131
02:13:56,069 --> 02:13:59,639
if you want to catch up on the series

2132
02:13:57,329 --> 02:14:02,640
we'll be back next week to work on the

2133
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:04,260
lighting which we now created some

2134
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:07,170
textures for and we will have to fill

2135
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:08,850
those textures up with something that's

2136
02:14:07,170 --> 02:14:10,350
about it for this week until next week

2137
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:13,430
have fun programming and I'll see you on

2138
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:13,430
the Internet take it easy everybody
