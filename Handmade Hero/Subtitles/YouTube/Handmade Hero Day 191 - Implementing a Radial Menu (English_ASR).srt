00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:05,490
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:12,089
Hero the show we coat a complete game

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:16,289
live on Twitch this is well really this

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,820
is kind of like a little bit of a detour

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,920
you might say that we're on where we're

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,320
I'm kind of like III wanted us to have

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,689
some debug code and I kind of got into

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,579
it a little bit and so for the past few

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,559
days we've been sort of like working on

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,479
cleaning up the debug presentation so

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,429
that we could do some fancier things

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,200
with it and we sort of did a little bit

13
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,000
of that yesterday we kind of cleared out

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,030
a bunch of like global stuff and like

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,649
consolidated the state and so today what

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,539
I'd like to do on image area so I'd like

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,109
to go through and add a little bit more

18
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,429
of a UI story so we kind of set the

19
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,960
stage for that yesterday a little bit

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,460
and what I'd like to do today is kind of

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,649
push through that and maybe get us some

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,170
things like some buttons we can interact

23
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,030
with or something like that again so we

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,219
can do stuff like quickly have access to

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,300
turning off or on the profile or other

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,140
things like that and I'm not sure

27
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:06,269
exactly how we want to do it so we're

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,840
kinda just gonna push on it a little bit

29
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,340
and see what happens now I have some

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,950
ideas I was kind of thinking about

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,930
something that I kind of wanted to try

32
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,118
potentially that's that's sort of a

33
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,570
little ridiculous but sometimes

34
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:25,009
ridiculous things are the best things

35
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:29,209
right it's hard to know sometimes what

36
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:31,709
it sergeant it is hard to know sometimes

37
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:33,780
how these things should go so I might

38
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,149
try something like epically ridiculous

39
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,299
like something so ridiculous that it

40
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,939
just has no right working and then if it

41
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,540
does work we'll just be like I do not

42
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:47,879
know how that happened but you know

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,600
we're happy that it did or something

44
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,908
like that I I'm not sure so yeah so

45
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,289
we'll see again and I don't really know

46
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,600
there's there's some things about the

47
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,590
C++ preprocessor that I suspect that one

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,280
of the things I would like to do

49
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,439
probably is it's just not possible to do

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,520
but I don't know so you know we'll we'll

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:11,848
see all right so let's go ahead and get

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,469
started here today I think we probably

53
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:13,840
won't get into some of the crazier stuff

54
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:15,759
that I was

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,900
talking about that'll probably come

56
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,030
maybe tomorrow the next day for any

57
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,080
right now it's day 191 we're gonna be

58
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,610
doing some coding we're gonna be

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,769
probably doing a little bit of UI coding

60
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,390
so if you want to follow along with that

61
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,739
unpacked day 190 source code into a

62
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,429
directory somewhere that's what I'm

63
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,750
starting with

64
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,340
again that's if you pre-ordered the game

65
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,348
on handmade here org you should have

66
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,489
access to all that sort of stuff that's

67
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,988
what you want to start with if you're

68
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,349
trying to follow along at home let's go

69
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,450
ahead over to the code itself and see

70
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:42,189
where we left off we had just done some

71
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:43,598
stuff for the profile window and we

72
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,459
basically made it so that we could make

73
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,318
a little we could just kind of control

74
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:48,340
the size of the profile window there

75
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,169
right and that was just sort of a

76
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,250
beginning of sort of getting rectangles

77
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:54,969
in and a little bit of that

78
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,459
conceptualization there and that's all

79
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:59,680
good and it's kind of running in there

80
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,449
so what I'd like to do now is I'd like

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,159
to sort of continue pushing down that

82
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:05,109
direction and say let's try to get

83
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,810
something where now we have some concept

84
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,950
of like you know various sort of I don't

85
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,229
know if you might call them a widgets or

86
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,359
whatever they are some sort of concept

87
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,878
of like pieces of stuff that we want to

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,579
display like these things so that they

89
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:21,489
can be turned on and off and you know

90
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,170
using some some kind of a control some

91
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,829
kind of a thing we could click on or a

92
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:28,899
you know a menu or something like that

93
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:32,409
so some sort of a thing like that that

94
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,289
we can use to to sort of get pieces of

95
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:37,030
the debug codes like this you know in a

96
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:39,489
state where they're not bothering us

97
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,919
right they're not they're not kind of

98
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,389
getting in our way when we don't need

99
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,548
them so we can turn them on we can turn

100
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,900
them off and that sort of thing right so

101
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,340
that's what I'd like to start doing

102
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,560
again very very simple and nothing

103
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,810
particularly crazy going on here but

104
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,239
that's what I would like to have happen

105
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,069
I like to get us into that position

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,299
going forwards and again yesterday we

107
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:59,768
also made sure our loop live code

108
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,139
editing work with the with the debug

109
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,760
stuff so I believe all that stuff should

110
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,760
work fine I should also check to see

111
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,469
whether our elke stuff works with the

112
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,328
debug and it does look like it works

113
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:11,709
pretty fine so that's actually kind of

114
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,109
nice too because it means that we will

115
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:15,519
have the ability to go in there and if

116
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,978
we have kind of bugs that are difficult

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,470
to repro if we can get them into a loop

118
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:22,918
we can look at the perf stuff in there

119
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,000
as well perhaps even freeze that stuff

120
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,969
for all I know I'm not sure if that will

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,129
actually work or not though

122
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,050
yeah I guess we can't well yeah that's

123
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:32,728
right we can't we have to sort of think

124
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,310
about how we wanted to have that happen

125
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:37,019
because if we if we bring that sort of

126
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,180
loop live coding stuff in a little more

127
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:43,079
properly we're gonna have an interesting

128
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:46,530
dichotomy there which is that the the

129
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:49,050
recording is recording all of our input

130
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:50,818
and so we wouldn't be able to interact

131
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,910
with the debug code at all at that point

132
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,590
right you know what I mean so it's kind

133
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,910
of interesting in that state sense and

134
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:58,109
so that's also something that we might

135
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,669
want to look at but all I wanted to make

136
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,740
sure at least at this stage was that our

137
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:03,029
loop plug code everything also work just

138
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,918
fine with that

139
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:07,649
but it looks like everything's fine in

140
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,529
that regard so we should be good to go

141
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:13,138
so let's go back over here now and see

142
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:15,388
what we can do in terms of getting some

143
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,389
stuff in terms of getting some stuff

144
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,759
happening so what I think I'd like to do

145
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,949
is I think I'd like to maybe make the

146
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:27,629
right mouse button a bit of a sort of

147
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:29,158
what I would call in UI terms a clutch I

148
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,990
usually use that term to refer to

149
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:33,269
something where it's kind of like I push

150
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,490
this thing down and I go into some kind

151
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:40,439
of mode where I'm like able to get at a

152
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:43,348
lot of menus and things so like what I

153
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,779
kind of envisioned what I want is I just

154
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:48,029
want the game and the games just running

155
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,218
and doing its thing and then if I hit

156
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,589
the right mouse button suddenly like a

157
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:53,968
whole bunch of UI pops up that I can

158
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:56,218
pick from really quickly

159
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:58,918
right so like some kind of like a radial

160
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:00,329
arrayed menu sort of a thing with like

161
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:01,978
maybe some sections where I can pick

162
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:05,218
things turn things on and off that sort

163
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:08,158
of thing and then you know it's it's if

164
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:09,658
you right-click it just comes up and

165
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:11,459
then you can picks that from it if you

166
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:13,889
hold down the right mouse button maybe

167
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:16,649
it lets you sort of just move in and

168
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,870
release for like a quick sort of turn on

169
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:20,728
turn off sort of a situation I'm looking

170
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,590
for something I'm looking for something

171
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:24,269
a little bit like that

172
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:28,948
so what I'm gonna do here is I'm just

173
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:30,930
gonna come on in to our debug stuff here

174
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,210
and I'm just gonna start coding that in

175
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,740
there right and obviously we have

176
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,079
something that we can start with

177
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,000
something very simple I said I wanted to

178
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,959
turn on the profile stuff so again that

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,089
good think too hard about

180
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,310
I'm just gonna add a boolean here for us

181
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,689
that says whether the profiles on or off

182
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,750
in terms of whether or not it's

183
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:50,939
displayed right and so when I come into

184
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,370
the thing that does the overlays and we

185
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,228
look in here it's pretty easy for me to

186
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,180
kind of look at this stuff and say okay

187
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:59,579
this is all stuff that has to do with

188
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,870
that profile and so what I'm gonna do is

189
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,079
I'm just gonna bracket it in the if

190
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,629
nothing weird again really basic stuff

191
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,399
here I'm gonna bracket in in the if go

192
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,978
ahead and make that predicated on

193
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,929
profile on right and so now it should

194
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:14,550
actually if I run the game it shouldn't

195
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,590
even be there right cuz that on that's

196
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,030
gonna dis going to fall up to false so

197
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:19,258
until that gets turned on it's not going

198
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:21,239
to be there and so now our goal is to

199
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,389
get some UI in here that allow us to

200
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,519
flip that boolean into the on state okay

201
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:33,478
so again really basic really really

202
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:35,490
basic thing we want to do so I'm going

203
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:38,879
to need some information here I need to

204
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,439
have some information about what the

205
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,509
interaction is like for example I need

206
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,848
to be able to figure out whether it

207
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,259
attacked me that sort of stuff again one

208
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:47,728
of the important things when you're

209
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,819
coding anything and I try to say this

210
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:52,348
often times is it's kind of evolved a

211
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,439
little bit of handmade hero I think

212
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:56,728
before handmade hero I hadn't really

213
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,408
crystallized so much exactly what it is

214
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:59,699
I do when I code which again was one of

215
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:01,319
the big reasons for handmade hero is

216
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,060
just want to kind of show how do I

217
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,620
actually get things done so that other

218
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,569
people who are like I would like to see

219
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,918
how someone gets thing X done they can

220
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,209
at least see how I get it done which may

221
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,799
not be how other people get it done or

222
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,959
may not even be a great way to get it

223
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,840
done but it is how I get it done

224
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,418
and in that that is in this particular

225
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,788
case and in pretty much all throughout

226
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:22,889
him a hero I always start at the place

227
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:24,899
where I know what to do and I work

228
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,310
towards the place I don't know right and

229
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:27,779
a lot of times I would say like right

230
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,339
the usage code first or things like that

231
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,610
but it is true that if I don't know the

232
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,559
usage code then I actually but I do know

233
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,089
the implementation code I started the

234
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,299
employee code like what I actually do is

235
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:40,649
I start at the place that is certain and

236
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,828
I move towards the place that is

237
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,990
uncertain it seems like that's a much

238
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:48,208
truer way to state how I actually

239
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,610
program then trying to boil it down to a

240
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:52,919
specific rule which won't necessarily be

241
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,850
true in all cases so it seems like I do

242
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,009
tend to stop

243
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,820
with like what do I know has to happen

244
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:01,710
and let's make that because that's the

245
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,110
thing I'm most likely to get right and

246
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,900
then let me move towards the thing where

247
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,450
I'm not really sure what it does because

248
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,909
by getting by going from something I do

249
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,040
know to something I don't know I advance

250
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:15,750
sort of like I get closer to what I

251
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,089
don't know with things I do know and

252
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,149
make that jump easier to make

253
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,490
conceptually and so that's exactly I'm

254
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,990
gonna do here if I want to make a radial

255
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,580
menu and all this stuff and I've got I

256
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,930
don't know you I and you pick things and

257
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,190
it turns things on and off that's a lot

258
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:30,929
of stuff to think about right that's a

259
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,640
lot of stuff to consider and a lot of

260
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:34,019
times people will Ravel they'll kind of

261
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,240
go down and think about it and draw

262
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,600
pictures and diagrams and and make a UML

263
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,009
thing or C++ classes but they don't

264
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,540
really know and it's it's kind of and

265
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,450
that doesn't help it just complicates

266
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,559
matters right instead what I like to do

267
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,259
like I said start with something you

268
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,179
know we know how to draw stuff let's

269
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,610
draw the radial menu let's just figure

270
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,319
out how to draw the darn thing right I'm

271
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,279
just gonna say we've got a function I'm

272
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,450
gonna put it in here I don't even

273
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,100
necessarily care what it's called I'm

274
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,180
just gonna say draw radial menu I don't

275
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,430
even know if this should be a function

276
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:05,699
or not I just want some a scratch pad I

277
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:07,349
just want something to to call in to

278
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:13,500
where I'm gonna get this render group

279
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:15,990
right in here and I want to also have I

280
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,039
guess my debug state probably and I'm

281
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:22,620
just gonna say in there I would like to

282
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,789
draw myself some kind of a menu and and

283
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,409
you know what let's not even say radio

284
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:28,409
minute because what I really want it's

285
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:30,389
just the debug the sort of the debug

286
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:32,309
main menu it's just that it's the thing

287
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:33,809
that comes up when you hit that right

288
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,369
mouse button and then I'm just gonna

289
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,659
call it and I'm gonna call it all the

290
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,909
time so I'm not even gonna think about

291
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:40,500
the UI the UI is not even on the table

292
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:43,919
at this point we're just gonna

293
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,360
straight-up do whatever comes to mind

294
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,919
for drawing the menu assuming it's

295
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,320
always on the screen and we'll work

296
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:53,089
backwards from there so the first thing

297
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,090
I need to do is I need some items right

298
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,080
so again not get thinking about it at

299
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,700
all I'm just gonna say I have some menu

300
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,889
items I'm gonna pretend I just have them

301
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,210
right here I don't know how many menu

302
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:07,620
items I have I've got some okay so I've

303
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,150
got menu items

304
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,679
and the menu items are just gonna be

305
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,370
some things that I ups that I could

306
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:18,299
select right what are the menu items

307
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:21,000
toggle profile or output I don't know

308
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:23,419
graph toggle profile grass sounds like a

309
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,820
good menu item to me certainly right

310
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:28,529
what else might I want to do we had that

311
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,720
frame rate counter toggle frame rate

312
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:33,319
counter right that was the thing that

313
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,320
was up there

314
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:40,529
let's see loop you know mark loop point

315
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,879
right of the you know if I want to do

316
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:42,569
loop live coded think or something like

317
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:48,600
that

318
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:49,940
draw entity bounds right something like

319
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,540
that

320
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:58,740
draw world chunk bounds or toggle world

321
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:00,149
Chuck bounds something like that so I

322
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,039
have no idea if those are things we

323
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,809
actually want to do all I know is I need

324
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:07,169
some menu items so I'm making some menu

325
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:11,039
items now we have them and we are good

326
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:12,389
to go all right so if I need to draw

327
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,769
menu items well I'm gonna have to loop

328
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:18,409
over the menu items that seems like a

329
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:27,449
no-brainer so here's my menu item index

330
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:32,250
right and then I can get that menu item

331
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:36,240
menu item name or maybe just text write

332
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:40,200
text of the menu item I might say and

333
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:45,240
then we've got menu items plus menu item

334
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,100
index yeah so if that's what if that's

335
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,259
what I've got for the text I just need

336
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,360
to know where I would display that text

337
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:54,059
right because I have ways of displaying

338
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,250
text I've got a thing here which is just

339
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:03,059
debug text out at right so that's all

340
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,779
good so if I go in here and I do debug

341
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:05,779
text out at

342
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:16,040
oops I know that I've got a point and a

343
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,480
string I just need to know like I'm

344
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:20,539
gonna put the string at this particular

345
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:24,320
point so all I have to do there is say

346
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:26,179
okay I know the text that's the text I

347
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,370
want to show for my button so all I

348
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,019
really need to know now is where is the

349
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,190
actual button like what's the location

350
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,440
of it

351
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,730
and so if you think about if I wanted to

352
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,050
do something where it's like a radial

353
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,329
menu where they're kind of like I said

354
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,109
around a circle around the point or

355
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:45,169
something like that

356
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:46,970
right here we go day 191 if we wanted to

357
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:49,729
do some kind of a radial menu so that

358
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,009
I'm like the mouse is here and you'd go

359
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,899
down and you get something like this and

360
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,539
it's got like the menu options you know

361
00:13:53,899 --> 00:14:00,769
but kind of come up in this sort of

362
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:03,319
fashion you know like that if that's the

363
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:06,320
sort of thing I'm doing well you know we

364
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,000
know what the points are the points are

365
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
just going to be going around the circle

366
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,320
going around like basically the circle

367
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,750
so whatever the radius of this sort of

368
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,770
like radial menu is whatever however far

369
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,929
the distance should be

370
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:19,939
that's certainly pram parametrize well

371
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:21,889
that'd be like an r-value and then we

372
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,660
would know that however many of these

373
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,429
guys we have you know we've got some

374
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:28,610
kind of an end here which is emit a

375
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:30,259
number of menu items I want to make it

376
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,589
so that I'm going to divide the circle

377
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:35,569
into that many things right so if I have

378
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:39,620
you know let's say I've got here one two

379
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:42,320
three four five six seven eight right of

380
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,899
these that I want to layout well that

381
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,760
means I need to make you know one two

382
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,350
three four five six seven eight segments

383
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,139
of the circle so I should be able to

384
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:58,100
divide the entire you know I should be

385
00:14:54,139 --> 00:15:00,439
able to divide the entire tau right by

386
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,649
eight and that's how much to advance the

387
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,480
angle by as I go and then of course I

388
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:07,159
can always get the arm of the circle as

389
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,129
we talked about before by just using the

390
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:11,929
cosine of the angle and the sine of the

391
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,458
angle the cosine of course gives us the

392
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:15,409
x-coordinate the sine gives us the

393
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,419
y-coordinate as we go around the circle

394
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:20,039
and multiplying these guys by the radius

395
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:21,838
will move us out from the unit circle

396
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,759
out to the outer circle where we want to

397
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,529
be so I should be able to get the point

398
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,089
to start the text out there now we have

399
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:29,820
an additional concern if we want to make

400
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,040
this menu look nice and that is that we

401
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,360
want to probably Center the text around

402
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,919
that point

403
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,539
whereas what we've got right now is

404
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,419
saying that starts at that point like as

405
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:41,578
a baseline and does that so our circles

406
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,778
gonna be wonky and it's gonna look kind

407
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:44,250
of like that at first

408
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:46,078
but that's not the end of the world

409
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,179
that's totally fine to get it going and

410
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,159
then we'll look at how we might fix the

411
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:53,429
sort of centering issue as a separate

412
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,679
thing all right so I'm gonna do exactly

413
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:59,219
what I just said again really really

414
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:02,159
straightforward here is the the text P

415
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,199
that I want to create we've got in our

416
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,730
handmade map we already sort of set up

417
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,349
how we're gonna call these sorts of

418
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,199
things I don't know if I ever made an

419
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,778
arm function looks like I didn't make an

420
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:16,649
arm to arm to is a very common thing

421
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:17,250
that I do might be in here I suppose but

422
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,120
I doubt it

423
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:23,179
yes not so what I will often do I just

424
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,720
find this is a really handy function

425
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:30,138
because I will often make a v2 function

426
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,240
here for the for a 2-dimensional vector

427
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:37,139
like this and it's just called arm two

428
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,870
and you pass in the angle and all it

429
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:45,269
does is it returns you the vector that

430
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:49,799
is the cosine of that angle you know and

431
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:54,720
the sine of that angle that's all it

432
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:59,099
does and so what that does is it makes

433
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,500
the sort of the unit arm oh you know

434
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,199
with this is the angle it makes a unit

435
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,019
arm in that direction starting you know

436
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,689
again at x equals one and kind of going

437
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:13,439
around the unit circle and so if I know

438
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:16,250
that I've got you know an angle step of

439
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,199
however many of these menu items I have

440
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:22,919
if I know that however many menu items I

441
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,589
have times the total distance around the

442
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,569
circle what I should be able to do is I

443
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:29,668
can find that angle whatever the angle

444
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:32,369
I'm at by just saying however many menu

445
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:33,470
items I've gone through so far I would

446
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:36,569
like to

447
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:39,569
to be that far around the circle right

448
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:41,308
again very very straightforward so then

449
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:43,619
I can just turn that into an arm with

450
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:46,408
arm to and then take whatever the radius

451
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:48,089
of my menu is which again is something

452
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:50,789
that we can just parameterize I don't

453
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:53,038
know what it should be but maybe it's

454
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:55,349
five price.you more than that but you

455
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:59,220
know however made 200 pixels something

456
00:17:55,349 --> 00:18:00,509
like this we take that menu radius and

457
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,399
we multiply it by the arm and that's

458
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:04,079
where the text should be and so once we

459
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:06,298
have that again it's really simple to

460
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,009
kind of just place it there and then

461
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:09,960
we're pretty much done

462
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:11,609
for all intents and purposes oops don't

463
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,440
know why did that don't want a pointer

464
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:18,658
to the pointer I just want the actual

465
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:21,090
pointer so if I do that you can see that

466
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:23,070
I've now got my radial menu again like I

467
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:26,730
said it's not really centered properly

468
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:28,619
I don't believe although actually it

469
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,399
kind of looks like it is did we actually

470
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:35,069
do but that that's weird that doesn't

471
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:36,719
seem like I gotta say I'm a little

472
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:39,240
surprised at how that looks I'm gonna

473
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,069
draw my circle I feel like it's good to

474
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,240
draw my circle I'm gonna do a push rect

475
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:47,129
just so I can see the circle a little

476
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,720
bit better just so I can understand

477
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,309
what's going on there cuz that doesn't

478
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,899
look like what I was necessarily quite

479
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:54,298
expecting I want to make sure I don't

480
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:58,699
have a bug right so I'm just gonna take

481
00:18:54,298 --> 00:19:02,940
a quick look at what happens if I do I

482
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,950
push rect here okay so I'm gonna go

483
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,528
ahead and grab a push rect I'm gonna

484
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,470
stick it in so I can just see what my

485
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:15,960
circle actually looks like so I'm gonna

486
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:22,970
do a rectangle Center remember what we

487
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:27,090
called these min max

488
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,160
rectum in dim centre-half Tim so

489
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:31,470
centre-half dim is just gonna be at the

490
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,090
text be and then the you know I'll just

491
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,259
do something that's you know I don't

492
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,069
know two pixels or three pixels so it's

493
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,470
actually I guess we'll just do one

494
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:44,099
that's that's two pixels on either side

495
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,350
something like that I don't know maybe

496
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,808
maybe you'd do a little bit more

497
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:51,029
something like that so there's my region

498
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:54,180
wrecked again and then I can just drop

499
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:58,170
this right in place of that so there we

500
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,820
go that'll draw what we want I think and

501
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:05,490
the color of this I'll just draw it in

502
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:07,919
white White's fine all right so there's

503
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:11,808
my circle and yeah I guess it I guess it

504
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,039
is really it's a circle there it goes

505
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:15,359
it's just kind of not intuitive like

506
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,069
when it's on the baseline it's really

507
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,619
hard to see how that circle works but

508
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:21,509
you know you can actually see that that

509
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:23,599
is that is a nice and scribe circle

510
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:24,750
there so I think that's just about right

511
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,689
okay

512
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:33,210
so again I don't know what the first

513
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:36,090
thing is we should tackle there but I

514
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,860
think what I'd like to do is I'd like to

515
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:40,289
maybe start to think about texts as

516
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,329
having a particular rectangle that we

517
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,159
can access and the reason that I'd like

518
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:46,319
to do that is because I want to sort of

519
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,640
take text and be able to like I said I

520
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,308
want to Center the text around that

521
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,980
point potentially that's what I'd like

522
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:54,509
to do and so what I'd like to have is a

523
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,029
way of getting the dimensions of the

524
00:20:54,509 --> 00:21:01,440
text now we already have a debug text

525
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:04,789
out function right and so I could make

526
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,799
this so it kind of just has an ability I

527
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:12,299
also think I probably want one of these

528
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:16,159
it takes the font and takes maybe the

529
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:22,649
render group right something like this

530
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:24,630
you know nah

531
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,420
I'm not entirely sure I want to do that

532
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,400
but so you know what we'll we're gonna

533
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,259
leave that for just one second what I'm

534
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:36,660
gonna do is I'm gonna assume that I have

535
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:38,519
you know something like this going on

536
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,640
and then we're gonna address that in a

537
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,680
second so if I come through here you can

538
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,240
see that it's basically the exact same

539
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,730
code as what this would be right it's

540
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,589
the same code as as text out but what we

541
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,200
would do is when we actually go to

542
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:57,329
output a glyph we would want to include

543
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,690
that in our rectangle right we need to

544
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:02,549
do all this exact same code and so I can

545
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:07,309
just make a thing here that's like you

546
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:10,200
know internal rectangle - oops rectangle

547
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:12,389
that's like get text dimensions or I

548
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,920
don't know something like that but I

549
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,970
really don't want to do that and the

550
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,410
reason I don't want to do that is

551
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,960
because I'm afraid that these two pieces

552
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:21,779
of code will fall out of sync so what

553
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,019
I'd rather do is maybe make one function

554
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:27,299
here that's like you know I'll take the

555
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:31,379
bug text out and we'll make that sort of

556
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,970
be a wrapper here and then I'll take

557
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,870
this and make this be something like

558
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:40,380
debug you know do text op or something

559
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:43,079
or a debug text op and what that'll do

560
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:47,040
is that will take some of this

561
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:49,949
information in but then what it actually

562
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,970
does will be dependent on some kind of

563
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:55,590
an operation code okay so it'll be

564
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,960
something that's like sort of the the

565
00:22:55,589 --> 00:23:06,029
sort of Buber text function you know

566
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:08,370
it'll take this stuff like so what is

567
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:10,079
the font info actually used for it's

568
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:13,409
getting okay so the horizontal bands man

569
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:19,470
that's your stuff so that will take all

570
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:24,750
this stuff and it won't need to do any

571
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:26,400
of these and it'll do this and then when

572
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,170
it kind of comes down through here all

573
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,880
of this code would be the same like that

574
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,370
would all do exactly what you would

575
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,550
expect it to do but then at the very end

576
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,069
it would sort of have some opinion

577
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:38,960
about what was going to happen here

578
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:47,210
instead of doing of pushed bitmap it

579
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:50,210
would actually just do some kind of an

580
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,769
if on the up about whether it was

581
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,730
gathering information or actually

582
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:58,730
drawing right and so you know I'll do

583
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:06,410
something like say okay if op equals

584
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:08,569
draw text or something if the opposite

585
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,950
draw text then we'll do it else I guess

586
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:15,730
right we're now will only have one other

587
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:18,890
op techstop sized text or something and

588
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:23,089
what I want to do here is include in my

589
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:25,520
rectangle again that that's sort of the

590
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:28,189
part of the the other rectangle that's

591
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,470
actually here right so what I want to

592
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:34,789
know on this push bitmap call is I want

593
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:36,950
to know for that push bitmap how big the

594
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,930
actual bitmap is going to take up

595
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:42,259
because I I sort of have the dimensions

596
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:45,980
here right for it so I know how big it

597
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:47,690
should actually be so I should be able

598
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,880
to just go ahead and reverse that out

599
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:55,430
right so if I go into here

600
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:58,280
handmade code render group if I go to

601
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,560
push bitmap you can see that it's kind

602
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,569
of got a thing that it does here to

603
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,759
figure out exactly what it's going to do

604
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:07,099
in terms of like how things are aligned

605
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,170
and where they're going to go and so

606
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:11,119
what I would like to do is I'd like to

607
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,550
get some way of accessing that

608
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,569
information in a way that doesn't

609
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:20,210
involve me actually calling push bitmap

610
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:23,509
right so what I want to do is pull that

611
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:27,799
out right as something that I can access

612
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:30,619
separately so something like bitmap dim

613
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,779
or something or like bitmap you know

614
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:36,099
used bitmap dimension or something like

615
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:38,149
this where this stuff here can be

616
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:42,769
received in a reliable way

617
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:45,430
and so if I did that we would just it

618
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:45,430
would get one of those

619
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,320
like so and it would just be exactly

620
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:55,409
that code and it would be like get used

621
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:57,918
bitmap dim or get bit mapped in

622
00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:01,649
something like that it would take

623
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,809
exactly what happens here right so that

624
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:05,838
stuff is is all used I don't know that

625
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:09,358
it actually needs the render group

626
00:26:05,838 --> 00:26:12,269
probably because the basis is going to

627
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:16,918
be important there so I assume that we

628
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:18,659
would do something like this yeah I

629
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,450
assume we would do something like this

630
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:24,349
and so then there's the the basis as

631
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:27,088
well I guess would also be part of that

632
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:28,618
so you'd get back the basis to size the

633
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:37,858
alignment you'd get back all that stuff

634
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:40,798
and then I guess yeah I guess that's

635
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:44,519
really all that would need to happen as

636
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,469
far as I can tell that looks about right

637
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:54,058
and so we would just do something like

638
00:26:46,469 --> 00:27:01,499
this use bitmap Tim Tim Tim sighs did a

639
00:26:54,058 --> 00:27:02,788
line get P yeah and then the basis so

640
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:04,288
now we know that code has been kind of

641
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:07,048
pulled out and we can use it whenever we

642
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:10,940
want to figure out what would actually

643
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:13,499
happen with this stuff so then this guy

644
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,690
can just be changed to actually use that

645
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:17,608
right so he can do something like that

646
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,769
bitmap Tim and he doesn't do any of that

647
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:22,259
stuff anymore he uses this as sort of a

648
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:24,628
pass through passes the same things that

649
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:27,108
he was passed we get that information

650
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:27,108
back

651
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,289
like so and then I think we're good to

652
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:38,799
go

653
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:41,960
yeah yeah so that's also Jim basis

654
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,349
that's also Jim basis but that's about

655
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,380
it

656
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:48,289
and so then somebody in here could

657
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,800
easily do that instead so instead of

658
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:58,159
calling push bitmap you'll just get the

659
00:27:51,799 --> 00:28:00,799
dimension and again past the exact same

660
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,300
stuff so I guess I have to pass these

661
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:08,029
things here so I'll just have like

662
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:09,490
something like fit map scale or

663
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:21,589
something like that

664
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:22,849
bitmap scale and bitmap offset and now

665
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:24,649
I've pulled those out into common

666
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:27,139
computations as well so then I know

667
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,120
again that these two can be very very

668
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,950
very similar code paths that will not

669
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:35,599
fall out of sync right okay so now I can

670
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,799
get that dimension back and let's just

671
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,409
double check I want to make sure that

672
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,819
this actually works at all so let's

673
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,650
actually clean up the compile errors

674
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:45,740
here and get it to the point where we're

675
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:50,540
fairly confident that it's working all

676
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:52,370
right so just clean that up and then go

677
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:56,299
ahead and make this work with the text

678
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:57,589
out stuff and so I'm just going to

679
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:59,569
introduce a thing up here where we just

680
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:02,949
have something like Iman debug text

681
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:09,769
operation we're just close call it up

682
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:13,850
debug text up raw text debug tech stop

683
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:15,859
sighs text and that way we can just pass

684
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:19,250
that operation in you know what do we

685
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:22,309
expect to do to this guy and maybe I'll

686
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,529
actually put that more primal so after

687
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:26,119
you kind of get you know maybe you pass

688
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:32,720
that as the first thing that whatever

689
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:44,069
you're going to do it's and now

690
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:46,740
whoops what is the problem oh right we

691
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:50,730
need to actually get the loaded bitmap

692
00:29:46,740 --> 00:30:02,069
don't we so that's actually passing the

693
00:29:50,730 --> 00:30:04,200
bitmap ID here you know so that's a

694
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:07,138
little trickier right because if we have

695
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:15,690
we have to get the actual loaded bitmap

696
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:17,638
that can always fail and but as far as I

697
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,200
know we do actually need we will

698
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:21,178
actually need that bitmap information

699
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,278
because we don't that stuff is not

700
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:26,519
actually in the bitmap info it's in the

701
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:29,069
bitmap itself right so there isn't

702
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,798
really any way that we can short-circuit

703
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:34,589
that process we would have to be able to

704
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:36,329
do it where we kind of where we kind of

705
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:37,980
see what it is so I think what I'll

706
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:41,668
probably do is say since we don't care

707
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,440
very much about this sizing if we if the

708
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:45,899
asset that we're trying to size isn't

709
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,399
there we'll just we won't bother because

710
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:49,439
it won't be rendered this frame anyway

711
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:50,849
we'll just assume that we don't actually

712
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,169
care about that at least for the time

713
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:59,240
being so I guess what we'd say is we'd

714
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:59,240
say get bitmap like so

715
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:11,740
and then we would just go ahead and try

716
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:15,759
to get the dimension of that thing of

717
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,679
the bitmap and if we don't get the

718
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,569
bitmap back we just assume that we don't

719
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:25,660
actually process that piece of text that

720
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:27,129
seems fair enough right so if we want to

721
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,460
do it that way

722
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:34,510
we just come in here and we can call

723
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:37,870
this now and again like I said I kind of

724
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:40,720
want this stuff to be a little bit more

725
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:43,928
sane I would like this stuff to be a

726
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,808
little bit cleaner than it is so I might

727
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:48,370
also do a little bit of cleanup there so

728
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:51,069
we're gonna go ahead and pass the fact

729
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:53,139
that we're trying to draw the text that

730
00:31:51,069 --> 00:32:01,200
will pass the debug state the render

731
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:07,179
group the font info P and the string

732
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:10,000
okay so that should be everything and if

733
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:12,669
we run that we get what we expect so

734
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,859
everything's fine so now what I want to

735
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:16,780
do again let me just quickly I'd like to

736
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:19,599
quickly clean this up this stuff doesn't

737
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:22,658
have to happen every time right so the

738
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:25,538
debug state itself when it actually goes

739
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:26,549
ahead and does this debug State right

740
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:28,839
here

741
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:30,548
once we have the render group we could

742
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:32,470
just say that we also have our font

743
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:36,038
stuff so what I'm thinking is we just

744
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:40,230
say okay there's like debug font is here

745
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:40,230
and the debug font info is here as well

746
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:50,579
and we just say that when we do the

747
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:53,590
debug begin thing right

748
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:55,509
debug start I don't know why I call it

749
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:58,000
start and not begin it's just kind of

750
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:58,960
weird I usually call things begin just

751
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,579
seems like a mess-up

752
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,590
you know what I mean but what are you

753
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:08,798
gonna do so yeah if I if I go in here

754
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:12,099
when we actually sort of do our render

755
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:14,859
begin when we actually start the

756
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:18,699
rendering happening where we do begin

757
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:21,729
render at that point we have a valid ID

758
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,650
for our render group passes and so I

759
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:27,579
should just be able to do this right

760
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:29,470
here you know I should just be able to

761
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:33,369
say okay we're going to do a push font

762
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:35,019
and we're going to do a get font info so

763
00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:43,779
that we just have that information

764
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:47,619
available like so um that's all I really

765
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:51,099
wanted to do with that that's that's

766
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:54,250
basically it right and so then when

767
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:56,289
debug techstop comes in here really all

768
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:59,079
it has to do is see whether it had a

769
00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:02,409
font or not it doesn't need this stuff

770
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:05,859
to be passed to it it doesn't need any

771
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:07,990
of that stuff it can just assume that

772
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:10,799
that it got that oops you know I should

773
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,358
do I should have done it differently

774
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,679
what I'd like to do is just grab those

775
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:23,230
out like that and then just do debug

776
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:27,929
state under group loaded font debug

777
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,929
fonts 8h a font

778
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:36,548
you vote wanted though okay and I'm just

779
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:40,000
gonna do a check on the font if we got

780
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:43,329
the font then we assume we're good to go

781
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,460
and could keep on trucking right

782
00:34:43,329 --> 00:34:47,818
I could also if I feeling really frisky

783
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:51,010
I could actually just go in here and and

784
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:53,168
also do that where we sort of say okay

785
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:55,179
and in fact I could just do it this way

786
00:34:53,168 --> 00:35:01,000
as well assuming that you have both of

787
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:01,838
those you're set to go to town okay so

788
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,778
that should do it

789
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:07,328
I think and that will sort of get us out

790
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:08,739
of the business of having to check all

791
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:11,559
those things and load them in every time

792
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:18,179
so we have loaded fonts we have a GG

793
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:27,960
font info or what is it just a font and

794
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:32,098
that's all we need so let's take a look

795
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:37,298
debug oh that's wrong debug state

796
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:39,068
okay so debug fonts this stuff doesn't

797
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:40,719
need to passing this now that can all go

798
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:43,719
away so it just looks like that which is

799
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,338
much saner I think I kind of wanted that

800
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:48,028
to be first don't ask me why just

801
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:53,880
personal preference

802
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:56,139
oops and then that looks good

803
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,420
alright double check make sure I didn't

804
00:35:56,139 --> 00:36:00,690
break nothing all right so that's all

805
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,690
good

806
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:14,369
everything is copasetic so now that I've

807
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,349
got that straightened out I should be

808
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,239
able to get the dimensions of this font

809
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:22,829
pretty easily when I get back this

810
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:25,169
bitmap dimension thing you know that is

811
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:30,170
going to tell me exactly what rectangle

812
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:34,940
I actually need to think about right

813
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:37,680
because let's see where that is that

814
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:42,630
you've mapped in let's get that up in

815
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:44,699
here where it can be more easily used so

816
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,680
year's bitmap dim is going to have all

817
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:48,719
the information we need right it's gonna

818
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:52,199
have the the transform basis I don't

819
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,929
know if we should save the input P but I

820
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,210
don't know we will for now but anyway so

821
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:59,460
if we have this stuff this is sort of

822
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,170
the transformed version and it's got the

823
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,789
size the alignment and so on I guess we

824
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,970
do want these because they kind of tell

825
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:09,029
us where we what what it things were in

826
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:11,549
this sort of original space before we

827
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,960
transformed it so if I just want to get

828
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,820
the dimensions out of that what I want

829
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,960
to use is the size and the P for that

830
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:22,260
right so I can do a rectangle that's

831
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,690
like you know the glyph dim and I think

832
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:31,890
what I should be able to do is say I

833
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:35,190
want a rect min dim where I say whatever

834
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:37,739
it told me the P was and whatever it

835
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,750
told me the size was that's what that

836
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:43,349
what that's the bounding thing in the

837
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,760
input space of of that glyph and then I

838
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:47,159
can say if I was trying to get a

839
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,840
rectangle out of this guy right I'll

840
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:49,799
just stick rectangle returning for now

841
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,030
we might want to something a little

842
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:59,580
fancier later but we'll do result here

843
00:37:53,030 --> 00:38:04,980
inverted infinity rectangle like so and

844
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:06,269
then I will just return it so we start

845
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,639
with nothing we start with the the

846
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:10,679
rectangle that contains the opposite of

847
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,750
anything and then every time through

848
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:17,309
here I would just do whatever that

849
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:19,139
result rectangle is I do take that glyph

850
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:21,090
and I'd include it so what I want to do

851
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:23,009
is say I want to I want to Union these

852
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,380
together right I want a union of the

853
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,480
existing thing and the new thing and

854
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,460
that you know if I just keep unioning

855
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,420
those together I should get eventually

856
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,800
what I actually want MTD basis result P

857
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,460
looks like for some reason it spilled

858
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,600
down in here

859
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,599
that's just oversight on my part okay

860
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:56,329
let's see rectangle two is what we

861
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:56,329
actually have right yeah my bad Oh

862
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:03,060
rectangle two in rectangle two I uh we

863
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:05,639
only have one of the other huh

864
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:08,250
where's my inverted infinity rectangle

865
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:10,618
when you need it inverted infinity

866
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,230
rectangle - I do we have so we don't

867
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:17,970
have I think I want that to be like you

868
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:22,219
know I think I want one of those for

869
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:25,858
everything right I want I want a

870
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:29,368
rectangle - version of that for sure so

871
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:42,119
I probably wanted to I in a two so that

872
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:48,119
I can return that do I have I do look at

873
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:51,869
that okay so I'm gonna go look at the

874
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:55,140
rectangle to code and just stick this

875
00:39:51,869 --> 00:40:02,059
kind of in there there it is so now I've

876
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:07,069
got that and I can go fix this situation

877
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:07,070
this is going to be like that now yeah

878
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:31,239
and off you go so this is a to I this is

879
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:32,409
a to that's to rectangle min Jim aren't

880
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:39,298
these both V twos

881
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:39,298
I guess Dimpy is not so will convert him

882
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,650
don't know why we can't convert him

883
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:52,778
we'll take a look at we must not have

884
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:54,220
one of those and then we want Union we

885
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:55,659
want to have one of those for our

886
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,980
rectangle too as well so it looks like

887
00:40:55,659 --> 00:41:00,338
we did some of these two rectangle two

888
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,920
eyes but not rectangle two again this is

889
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:05,230
why I say this sort of thing normally I

890
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,289
would met a program if you like using

891
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,219
templates that you are okay with them

892
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:14,559
templates will solve this problem for

893
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:16,838
you as well and so you know just so you

894
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,670
know this is the exact same code there's

895
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:19,960
nothing happening differently here so

896
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,068
normally you just go ahead and you

897
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,679
generate that because there really isn't

898
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:30,989
any there isn't any magic to it right so

899
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:30,989
okay let's take a look

900
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:55,019
okay oops forgot one it happens it

901
00:41:53,530 --> 00:42:00,160
happens

902
00:41:55,019 --> 00:42:02,110
believe you me and finally we don't have

903
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:06,879
a way I guess to convert from a v3 to a

904
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:09,430
v2 which is just seems like an oversight

905
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:15,369
right you want to be able to just go oh

906
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:20,789
you know you got a v3 as input no

907
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:27,880
problem just copy the members we do have

908
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:30,429
and out it comes alright again running

909
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,039
just fine everything seems kosher now we

910
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:35,019
can use this function and see whether

911
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,570
we've actually done anything useful or

912
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:42,639
whether we have just made a giant mess

913
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:45,519
of everything by saying okay we've got

914
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:53,250
text out let's also make sure that we

915
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:56,949
have debug get text size or something

916
00:42:53,250 --> 00:43:00,039
and again that is just gonna take

917
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:02,529
exactly the same two things here

918
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:07,059
so in fact I guess we don't really need

919
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:12,970
the P either we can just say we've got

920
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:16,119
string and oops got string and we are

921
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:24,549
going to make the result be debug text

922
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:30,539
op debug text size text we will place it

923
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:30,539
at zero zero and that is all

924
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:43,250
oh yeah pass the debug state okay so if

925
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:46,519
we do that we should now be able to draw

926
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:49,309
the boundaries of our text and see if

927
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:51,230
they're at all accurate right so we

928
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,960
should be able to now do something like

929
00:43:51,230 --> 00:44:02,090
we get a rectangle to back that's like

930
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:05,480
our text box right we go ahead and use

931
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:08,120
the same string and then we could draw

932
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,889
that right we should be able to drew a

933
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:14,630
push rect outline where we or you know

934
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:16,190
what we can even do just a regular push

935
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,630
rect for now since we don't have a

936
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:21,320
pushrod outlet it takes a rect I don't

937
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:23,890
think and I'll just go ahead and make

938
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,840
you know some kind of a dark bluish

939
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:28,129
backdrop around the text that we can

940
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,470
look at and verify that it's in the

941
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,170
right place so I'll just go ahead and

942
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:34,959
pass the text bounds to that and that

943
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:39,680
should do it

944
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,300
so now we can see where we're at oh and

945
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,149
of course I should probably put them at

946
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:48,260
the right location as well so I should

947
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:51,769
probably offset this guy by whatever the

948
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,510
P the text P actually is I assume we

949
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:55,670
have an offset function don't really

950
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,140
know it looks like we have one for

951
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:02,349
rectangle three but not for rectangle

952
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:02,349
two let's see here

953
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:17,570
so we just need this guy and that's

954
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:21,710
about it none of the two overloads could

955
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:29,360
convert rectangle to and V to offset so

956
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:29,920
it's actually that way and that's that's

957
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:37,329
it

958
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:41,360
Hey look that is pretty much exact right

959
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:43,219
and so again that was a pretty good

960
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,590
transformation that I did there again

961
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:47,239
good code transformation to know if you

962
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:48,829
want to do the exact same piece of code

963
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:50,359
but have two different results come out

964
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,069
of it sometimes especially if you're not

965
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,690
as super concerned about the performance

966
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:56,360
of that since this is the debug code we

967
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:58,220
certainly aren't oftentimes it can be

968
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,620
much nicer to go let's write it once

969
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:03,230
let's pass the operation through as

970
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:06,589
something to do and what this is really

971
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:09,740
doing is it's getting it's sort of a way

972
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:12,890
of working around C's limitation of not

973
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:14,959
having a good way to do things like say

974
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:17,480
closures where you can just pass some

975
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,889
entire set of stuff you want to do down

976
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,650
through some function that does things

977
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:23,420
to it you know

978
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:26,240
functional programming languages have a

979
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:30,320
lot of other things that you can do that

980
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:35,739
make this less of a necessary thing but

981
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:38,210
again C C++ not designed by the smartest

982
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:40,429
folks not not the brightest bulbs on the

983
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:42,740
tree so they of course added like 8

984
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:44,239
billion language features and just only

985
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:45,739
recently address some of these and of

986
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,799
course adjust them in like the worst and

987
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:50,569
most Awkward way possible and so you

988
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,920
know your mileage may vary if you decide

989
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,690
trying to do that so I tend to still

990
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,159
stick to the C way of doing things which

991
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,110
tends to actually just work out a lot

992
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:58,549
much better lot better in practice which

993
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:00,800
is to just pass an OP code through and

994
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:02,600
off you go so there you go

995
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,310
so now that we have that if we actually

996
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,319
wanted to Center again which was kind of

997
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:07,670
the original goal of having that so now

998
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,110
we can kind of get our text balanced and

999
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,579
all that sort of thing centering is

1000
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,010
really pretty trick trivial at this

1001
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:14,869
point because we know what the Tex P is

1002
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,700
and we know what the bounds are so all

1003
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,579
we really have to do is just take what

1004
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:19,230
those bounds actual

1005
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:21,929
are we would just say get to the

1006
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:25,199
dimension of the text bounds and we just

1007
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:28,259
subtract half of them off right and that

1008
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,989
would would line us up with the with the

1009
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,820
center and so now you can see there's

1010
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:34,319
the point and you can see that the text

1011
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,090
is perfectly centered around it again we

1012
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,769
still kind of are drawing the the size

1013
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:39,750
of it originally at the location which

1014
00:47:37,769 --> 00:47:41,969
we don't really need we can get rid of

1015
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:45,150
that now and in fact I can just get rid

1016
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:47,939
of the whole thing that makes sense so

1017
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:50,250
that's again pretty cool right

1018
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,659
now we've got sort of a radial menu

1019
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,030
there that's centered around the point

1020
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:55,949
we can double check that you know

1021
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,540
everything kind of works fine by just

1022
00:47:55,949 --> 00:48:00,059
saying let's say we've got a lot of of

1023
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:04,050
items there and there they all are right

1024
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:05,309
and that's all good again we got it sort

1025
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,539
of think more about maybe how we're

1026
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:08,639
gonna lay this out exactly because

1027
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:09,659
things at the top are more problematic

1028
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,190
than things at the bottom so we might

1029
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:13,379
want to not think just because the way

1030
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:14,670
of text works so we may need to do some

1031
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,420
other things there but for the moment

1032
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:20,039
everything seems to check out just fine

1033
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,789
let's also just go ahead it mean it

1034
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:25,019
seems pretty straightforward as well to

1035
00:48:23,789 --> 00:48:26,909
just go ahead and make it so that you

1036
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:29,369
can pick things when we come in through

1037
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:31,739
here you know we've got again that that

1038
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:34,109
Mouse be the location of the mouse right

1039
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:36,779
so it'd be pretty free for us to go

1040
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,820
ahead and pass a mouse key in to the

1041
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,519
actual function if we wanted picking in

1042
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,440
care again really really trivial there's

1043
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,989
that Mouse pee when we come through here

1044
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,599
we just want to know which of the menu

1045
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:50,069
items are you closest to let's say so

1046
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:52,199
all we have to do is just keep a best

1047
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:54,930
distance and the best distance of course

1048
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:58,319
would start out at the at the highest

1049
00:48:54,929 --> 00:49:02,039
thing and then what we do is we maybe

1050
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:05,250
say best menu index something like that

1051
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:07,380
right and again this is just quick and

1052
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,010
dirty and then you know tomorrow cuz I

1053
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,329
guess we've got we've got about 10 to 12

1054
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,790
minutes left on the clock so I just want

1055
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:16,289
to I mean no sense in burning 12 minutes

1056
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:19,679
I might as well implement something in

1057
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:21,090
the 12 minutes so you know we start out

1058
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,489
with some kind of a notion of what the

1059
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,800
best menu index is and then I come

1060
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:27,569
through here and I say as we go through

1061
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,160
and maybe you know what I what I do with

1062
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,140
the best menu at X is also set it to

1063
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:33,659
something that's not actually

1064
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:35,819
valid like that right so yeah the best

1065
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:38,639
night is Jax we go through and now we're

1066
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:39,750
just gonna see like who is actually you

1067
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,519
know what maybe the maybe oh they also

1068
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,019
just say let me call that hot menu index

1069
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,759
or a new hot men index something like

1070
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,849
that so we'll figure out what's the hot

1071
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,170
menu index we know where the text is

1072
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:52,170
because we can go in here and say all

1073
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:54,720
right let's bake in that that thing

1074
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,980
where we're gonna draw it right that's

1075
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:56,969
where we're gonna draw it oh you know

1076
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,500
what I guess we don't really want that

1077
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,919
though we want to leave it this way I

1078
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,510
guess

1079
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,500
so that's the center point of the text

1080
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:04,830
which is probably what we want to

1081
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:07,500
actually measure although you know we

1082
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:09,480
also have the text bounds so I guess we

1083
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,880
could just do whether you're how close

1084
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,380
you're out of the bounds I don't know

1085
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,570
what the best one is to do I'm gonna do

1086
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,860
the simpler one first I'm not sure which

1087
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,420
one I want either one of them is

1088
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,070
actually really simple so we'll just do

1089
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:23,849
text fee for now we'll just do text fee

1090
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:26,190
for now so we got distance if we go to

1091
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:27,839
our math library right I think we've got

1092
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:31,349
business between or something like this

1093
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,930
or a length right yes we've got length

1094
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:35,789
squared and make this that distance

1095
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:38,250
squared so I can just do what's the

1096
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:41,880
length squared between the the text

1097
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:44,550
feeding the mouse P and that's this

1098
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:46,289
distance squared if the best distance

1099
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,930
squared so far that we've come across in

1100
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:50,670
all of the buttons is greater than the

1101
00:50:48,929 --> 00:50:54,599
distance that we see here then this must

1102
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:56,130
be a closer menu option right and then I

1103
00:50:54,599 --> 00:51:00,809
just say that that's gonna be the new

1104
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:02,700
one that I'm gonna take so once I have

1105
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:04,860
that information now I know which menu

1106
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:06,539
item is is hot on this round through and

1107
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:09,150
so when I get to the end here I could

1108
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:11,789
just say okay I now know which menu item

1109
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:15,690
is hot and maybe I want to have that

1110
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:18,630
sorted here or something so I say like

1111
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:21,510
best menu index or something or hot menu

1112
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:24,690
index you know and then I say all right

1113
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:26,850
I've got my DX take hot menu index

1114
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:29,400
equals new hot menu index there we go

1115
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:34,650
and for the last thing that we'd want to

1116
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:36,750
do ok debug text out at has a slight

1117
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:38,639
issue to it I realized we don't allow it

1118
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,380
to change color at all which is probably

1119
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,639
not what we want so we probably should

1120
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,869
do a color thing here what we pass in

1121
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,219
and then when it's doing its color

1122
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:47,230
instead of initializing it just

1123
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:48,548
initializes it to that and then if you

1124
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,838
use some of those overrides it could

1125
00:51:48,548 --> 00:51:50,980
still overwrite it but that way we can

1126
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,719
leave specify what we want the color to

1127
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:56,980
be so that's all good we're coming here

1128
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:59,108
to our renderer we can now choose to

1129
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,880
render in a different color so what I'll

1130
00:51:59,108 --> 00:52:02,409
do is I'll just say oK we've got a menu

1131
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,778
item color so this is the item color

1132
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:07,179
here the item color is just going to be

1133
00:52:04,778 --> 00:52:08,980
I don't know white for now but in the

1134
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:11,469
event that this menu item index that

1135
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:12,909
we're on is the debug States hot menu

1136
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:15,669
item index so it's what the person's

1137
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:17,348
hovering over then we could just say let

1138
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,789
the item color equal something that's

1139
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:20,890
going to show that it's selected like a

1140
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:23,170
yellow color or something like that then

1141
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:25,989
we can just pass that in when we draw

1142
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,130
the text right so I'll pass in the item

1143
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:32,039
player and then I got to go make sure

1144
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:34,528
that passes through length squared oops

1145
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:40,869
wanted the distance between those two

1146
00:52:34,528 --> 00:52:46,960
and debug ticks that app needs to take

1147
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:54,700
that color and pass it through so there

1148
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:57,519
we go and you know now we know what the

1149
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:59,798
person's picking right whatever they're

1150
00:52:57,518 --> 00:53:02,199
closest to is what they're what they're

1151
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:04,528
picking at the moment so that's again

1152
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:04,528
pretty easy

1153
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,809
nothing really say about that other than

1154
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:12,608
it's really easy right you saw it happen

1155
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:14,890
make a little radio menu not

1156
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:16,389
particularly difficult and if we really

1157
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:18,838
want to write we can just kind of finish

1158
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:22,838
things up again maybe we just end today

1159
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:25,420
just with before you know we go any

1160
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:27,338
further with that maybe what we do here

1161
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:31,180
is we just say oh yeah you know - we can

1162
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:33,969
also ask about that precedent if the

1163
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:37,419
precedents if you will maybe I just go

1164
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:38,588
ahead and stick that in here for now we

1165
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:41,200
don't really have anything better to do

1166
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:43,538
with our lives or ourselves we will just

1167
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,489
do something like this so we'll grab

1168
00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:47,890
this in here we'll first take that mass

1169
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:50,139
P and then what we'll do at the end this

1170
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:52,858
will say you know if you if you press

1171
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,858
the mouse button

1172
00:53:53,670 --> 00:54:01,139
on one of these guys it'll it'll do the

1173
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:03,119
option and maybe I want right maybe I

1174
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:04,980
want write down or write up kind of a

1175
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,069
thing maybe maybe I want it to go gay

1176
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:10,590
yeah you know I've been at it again

1177
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,019
we're just sketching this out it's it's

1178
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:16,100
it's not hard so we'll just go ahead and

1179
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:18,509
say all right there's menu active and

1180
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:20,369
and that's that's all there is

1181
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,020
so I'm going to take it back I don't

1182
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:23,789
think we're gonna bother with any of

1183
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:26,880
that we'll just pass it in the mouse pee

1184
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:29,340
and that's fine and then we can just out

1185
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,050
here implement that debug menu stuff so

1186
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:35,760
again this will be really really simple

1187
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:38,150
all we have to do is say if input mouse

1188
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:46,200
buttons

1189
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:49,590
right is down and dude down then draw

1190
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:51,239
the debug menu okay and the other thing

1191
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,829
that we can need to do here is we need

1192
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:56,309
to make sure that we're centered around

1193
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:57,269
something logical so well I guess we

1194
00:54:56,309 --> 00:54:59,070
don't need to do that quite yet but

1195
00:54:57,269 --> 00:55:01,949
we'll talk about that in one second so

1196
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:04,380
we'll draw the debug menu and then what

1197
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:07,169
we can do is say if it didn't if it you

1198
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,970
know if it's not right if the platform

1199
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:12,690
mouse button right handed down blah blah

1200
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:14,519
blah if we know that it was up then

1201
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,980
let's just see if the half transition

1202
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:18,780
count is greater than 1 right because at

1203
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,670
the half transition count is greater

1204
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:24,330
than 1 it means that they let go that

1205
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:25,980
frame right and so if they let go that

1206
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:28,529
frame we would want to potentially

1207
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,019
execute something and so what we can do

1208
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:31,590
is we can just say you know all right

1209
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:35,309
fine

1210
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:40,530
let's see what you know let's see what

1211
00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:43,949
you actually hit you know what would you

1212
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:45,330
actually would you actually hit and

1213
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:47,609
there's actually there's a little

1214
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:49,019
something there's a little something you

1215
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,970
know we probably almost want to do that

1216
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:54,090
because we want to process the last

1217
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:55,230
mouse movement I would think so I'm

1218
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:57,210
gonna go ahead and do that as well right

1219
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,559
because you don't want to on the frame

1220
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,880
where they let up we want to look at

1221
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,920
what that mouse PS and find what the

1222
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,200
closest thing was this time before we

1223
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,760
process it and so I'm just gonna see if

1224
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:07,769
the many ways Eero we have toggle

1225
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,530
profile graph that's actually a

1226
00:56:07,769 --> 00:56:11,610
so we can actually process that one we

1227
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:14,750
can just go ahead and say alright if

1228
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:20,550
that's the case then the debug state

1229
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:28,340
profile on equals not give us a profile

1230
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:28,340
on right so again pretty straightforward

1231
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:35,340
nothing nothing particularly odd

1232
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:37,589
happening here but you know I should be

1233
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:40,100
able to do this now in theory although

1234
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:42,630
I'm not actually seeing that happen I

1235
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:45,509
wonder if this case is not quite hitting

1236
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:47,579
right input mouse button splat for mice

1237
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:49,470
button right half transition count

1238
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:50,130
greater than zero that should have

1239
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:55,230
worked

1240
00:56:50,130 --> 00:57:01,099
why did that not work is the question is

1241
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:01,099
the question so I would like to know I

1242
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:06,269
would like to know also I suppose

1243
00:57:03,889 --> 00:57:07,949
another thing we should say here is

1244
00:57:06,269 --> 00:57:12,710
these things don't have to happen

1245
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:18,259
anymore while I'm in the neighborhood

1246
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:26,099
I'm just hanging out ain't no thing

1247
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:27,330
might as well get rid of that okay get

1248
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:29,190
rid of that to do it was a stupid to do

1249
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:31,489
anyway so I just want to see what's

1250
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:37,730
happening here why we never hit my case

1251
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:43,889
does this case not happen it does happen

1252
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:50,099
hot menu index is one really

1253
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:53,730
oh I was picking the wrong one I'm kind

1254
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:55,440
of dumb kind of dumb that way yeah so

1255
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,900
our radial menu is now sort of

1256
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,329
operational but obviously we've kind of

1257
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:03,119
got a couple of the things we don't want

1258
00:58:00,329 --> 00:58:04,680
to do oh you know what - we have that

1259
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,298
right mouse button pressed pause thing

1260
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:08,538
let's just go ahead and make that on the

1261
00:58:06,298 --> 00:58:08,538
menu

1262
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:20,578
yeah and so we'll just do pause

1263
00:58:17,068 --> 00:58:23,940
debug collation or toggle debug

1264
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:28,318
collation so that's really all we need

1265
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:29,460
there now for those two things and so

1266
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:31,259
the only thing I was gonna say is it

1267
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,630
doesn't come up where we click the mouse

1268
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,900
button it always comes up in the center

1269
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:40,318
right so what I'd like to do is say okay

1270
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:41,789
if it ended down right then I'd like to

1271
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,469
do the same thing here where we have

1272
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:44,849
like if the half transition count was

1273
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:48,449
greater than zero that means they like

1274
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:51,539
clicked it they clicked it and so what

1275
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:55,078
I'd like to do is say the menu P right

1276
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:56,910
our menu P at that time when first goes

1277
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:00,240
down it is gonna be wherever the mouse

1278
00:58:56,909 --> 00:59:03,058
was at that point in time you know I'm

1279
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:05,548
saying so there's a there's just this

1280
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:07,920
concept of the the menu P where it

1281
00:59:05,548 --> 00:59:09,630
should be and then in here whenever we

1282
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,430
figure out where the text actually is

1283
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:13,289
we're just gonna offset that by whatever

1284
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:15,328
the menu P is that way the menu can move

1285
00:59:13,289 --> 00:59:19,079
around with the mouse and is more like a

1286
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:21,119
normal radial menu you know so now you

1287
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,160
know if I if I look at the full screen

1288
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,980
version of this I can kind of go

1289
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:28,670
anywhere I want to write and do toggle

1290
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:32,639
profile graph or toggle debug collation

1291
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:34,559
right so now I actually have a fully

1292
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,058
functional radial menu just not very

1293
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,769
pretty yet so we should probably do a

1294
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:39,569
little work on it but I've got a radial

1295
00:59:37,768 --> 00:59:41,518
menu and it only took a you know a few

1296
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:43,650
minutes would that take 30 minutes 45

1297
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:45,629
minutes and I don't know how long we

1298
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:49,910
started into that but pretty

1299
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:49,910
straightforward right not not much

1300
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:57,030
all right so again sort of wrapping up

1301
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:59,699
we have a lot more work to do before we

1302
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,930
would actually consider this UI in in a

1303
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:03,509
state that I'm gonna be happy with it

1304
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:05,519
because right now it's it's kind of very

1305
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,260
disparate you know I I don't like the

1306
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,759
fact the menu items are separated from

1307
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,710
these things and it's a little you know

1308
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,470
it it just all we did was just put in

1309
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:15,179
the base code for using it and so this

1310
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:16,439
is gonna be a fairly classic compression

1311
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:19,889
oriented programming style thing I'm

1312
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,990
gonna do here next time on tomorrow's

1313
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:24,269
handmade hero we'll start to pull out

1314
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:25,439
some of what we just implemented into

1315
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:28,230
something that's a little more coherent

1316
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,090
by sort of lifting up a little bit but

1317
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:31,679
that's the basics and now we have a

1318
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:34,230
radial menu and radial menus are good

1319
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:37,440
and so we can continue to kind of like

1320
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:40,650
explore that as we go forwards let's go

1321
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,179
ahead and go to the Q &amp; A so if you have

1322
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,519
questions about what we've done on

1323
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,559
today's stream please post them to the

1324
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:49,789
chat nap but a Q : in front of it so I

1325
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,789
can see it

1326
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:14,200
I think you added v 3x y 4v 3 2 X 2 VG

1327
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:17,860
conversion I did you're right I think I

1328
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:24,069
did that smarter isn't it past me was

1329
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:29,019
smarter than then then future me past me

1330
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:31,320
was smarter that's just better because

1331
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:36,389
then you control which ones you grab

1332
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,390
right yeah

1333
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,510
even if the menus in the circle get

1334
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,730
cluttered we could make it so that each

1335
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:55,340
button in the circle led us to another

1336
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:57,199
circle layer subset of buttons yeah I'm

1337
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,519
not like I said I'm not sure what I want

1338
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,199
to do with this yet in terms of because

1339
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:02,719
I mean I'm gonna see what options we

1340
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:05,239
actually end up having in there but

1341
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,279
we'll kind of get we'll kind of get

1342
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:08,059
there once we we haven't really figured

1343
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,710
out how we're even going to layout

1344
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:11,719
things in this circular menu yet so you

1345
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,550
know next time well well dive in a

1346
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:14,779
little more and as we go we'll kind of

1347
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:19,100
figure out how we want them in used to

1348
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:21,230
work flock 93 can you explain a bit more

1349
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:24,230
on the closure stuff and how to do it in

1350
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:31,429
C I didn't quite understand it so the

1351
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:36,679
closure stuff is just if I have

1352
01:02:31,429 --> 01:02:38,719
something where I am going to say it's a

1353
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:42,769
good example let's say have something

1354
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:47,929
like do complex iteration over things

1355
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:49,550
you know and I'm gonna do some iteration

1356
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:51,289
where I walk a treat so in fact you know

1357
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,760
what you don't even have to guess I'll

1358
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:54,380
just load up some actual handmade Hiro

1359
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,630
code that actually has to do this and

1360
01:02:54,380 --> 01:03:00,470
then you should be able to see what I'm

1361
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:03,920
talking about okay so you see this thing

1362
01:03:00,469 --> 01:03:05,809
here get world chunk for example so get

1363
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,470
world chunk what it does is it looks

1364
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:12,199
through a list and it figures out which

1365
01:03:09,469 --> 01:03:14,480
world chunk it wants by comparing each

1366
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:16,369
thing you know it first figures out the

1367
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,619
hash it goes into the right slot in the

1368
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:20,869
hash it then goes through and compares

1369
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:22,789
and tries to find a particular one if it

1370
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:24,529
didn't find one it will like get a new

1371
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:26,349
one and and all this other stuff right

1372
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:30,170
there's all these things that it does

1373
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:32,000
and so if you wanted to write something

1374
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:35,000
now were you like I want to write

1375
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,010
something that just does something to

1376
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,230
everything in this list or something

1377
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:41,900
like that or you know something that

1378
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:46,340
maybe you know what not even sure that's

1379
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,510
the best one it might not be the best

1380
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:50,870
one to illustrate it because there's

1381
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:53,860
there's a slight twinge to that one that

1382
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,859
makes it not as good

1383
01:03:56,309 --> 01:04:04,170
what's the best place in him ah I got I

1384
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:17,318
got it

1385
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:19,659
uh so at least I think I got it okay so

1386
01:04:17,318 --> 01:04:22,599
let's say we were to take something like

1387
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:25,179
this so here is a very complicated thing

1388
01:04:22,599 --> 01:04:26,588
draw a rectangle slowly right here's a

1389
01:04:25,179 --> 01:04:28,960
very complicated function if done that

1390
01:04:26,588 --> 01:04:32,318
does a ton of stuff it then has a bunch

1391
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,510
of code inside where it basically says

1392
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:36,099
okay for every it does a bunch of work

1393
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:37,480
to figure out all the pixels and whether

1394
01:04:36,099 --> 01:04:40,240
the pixels were highlighted and all this

1395
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,980
stuff and then inside it has what is

1396
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,379
essentially a shader it has the code

1397
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,030
that's like for a given pixel I want to

1398
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,730
compute what the color should be how do

1399
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:50,410
I do that and that's all in here

1400
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:54,099
now if we wanted to make multiple

1401
01:04:50,409 --> 01:04:55,899
shaders right the logical way you would

1402
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:57,970
do this is you would have in your

1403
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:00,970
programming language a way to say oh by

1404
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:03,368
the way I want you to just have a way

1405
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:06,969
for me to say all of this external

1406
01:05:03,369 --> 01:05:09,430
iteration code just make that code be a

1407
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:11,980
reusable chunk and I just want to

1408
01:05:09,429 --> 01:05:13,659
replace this part here so I'm gonna

1409
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:17,170
stick something in here that's like do

1410
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:19,000
the stuff semicolon and then I want to

1411
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:21,849
be able to call quote-unquote this

1412
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,769
function and tell you what to replace do

1413
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:26,680
the stuff with and so that it can access

1414
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:29,289
all of this information right that's

1415
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:31,929
like the most basic use that's not even

1416
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:37,619
a closure that's just a macro almost

1417
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:41,649
right but oftentimes that thing itself

1418
01:05:37,619 --> 01:05:43,720
wants to have access to a separate stack

1419
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,760
frame so it wants to have access to

1420
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:48,250
variables that are not necessarily known

1421
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,720
by this function so for example let's

1422
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:52,269
say that one of these is the normal

1423
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:55,949
mapping thing and it needs access to the

1424
01:05:52,269 --> 01:05:58,269
lighting environment whereas the other

1425
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:59,409
way we might call it doesn't do any

1426
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:01,989
lighting so it doesn't need access to

1427
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:04,210
that so what we want to do is pass in

1428
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:06,519
not just the code to execute but also a

1429
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:08,829
little stack frame a little set of data

1430
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:15,400
that goes with it that it can just go

1431
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:16,809
ahead and do right and so you know other

1432
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,730
programming languages have a variety of

1433
01:06:16,809 --> 01:06:21,250
things things like closures which allow

1434
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:22,900
you to encapsulate this the data that's

1435
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:26,110
referenced by something by a piece of

1436
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,700
code into itself to be passed through to

1437
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:29,710
somebody else where they can do stuff

1438
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:31,239
with it and then it can come back to you

1439
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:33,070
and have done the things that it needs

1440
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:34,359
to do in your stack frame right it

1441
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:38,410
allows you to kind of mix these stack

1442
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:40,539
frames together in a very useful way it

1443
01:06:38,409 --> 01:06:43,000
allows that but more importantly it is

1444
01:06:40,539 --> 01:06:44,679
also just even separate from the closure

1445
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,719
part of it the fact that you can sort of

1446
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:48,909
pass code into something and have that

1447
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,099
code execute inside another piece of

1448
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:53,649
code is something that C can't do and

1449
01:06:51,099 --> 01:06:56,440
C++ recently added lambdas which kind of

1450
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:58,599
allow you to do some of that stuff and

1451
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:00,429
that is the thing that I was saying we

1452
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:04,360
don't have if we don't want to go down

1453
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:07,029
the C++ nightmare route so what I did is

1454
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:10,240
sort of the poor man's version of that

1455
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:12,280
what I did is say okay let's just put in

1456
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,679
that place where we would which right

1457
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:16,840
here in that place where we would have

1458
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:19,629
wanted to pass in the tech the thing to

1459
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:21,309
do will actually just put all the code

1460
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:22,960
in there and just have a variable that

1461
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:25,509
tells us which one to do and since

1462
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:30,250
branches are relatively cheap it

1463
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:31,900
probably isn't that bad right so that's

1464
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:34,090
what we did and of course we don't have

1465
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,220
full closures so these things cannot do

1466
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:38,019
anything like have data that comes

1467
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,279
through that only they know about like

1468
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:40,389
the thing I saying before they can't

1469
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,710
really talk to someone else's stack

1470
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:43,779
frame or do any of the convenient stuff

1471
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,280
like that that we might want but like I

1472
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:48,070
said for up for a poor-man's version

1473
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,220
it's totally usable hopefully that makes

1474
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,220
some sense

1475
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:02,940
why did you use radical menu or sorry

1476
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:04,380
radial menu for helical menu why did you

1477
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:06,838
use radial menu over lists or other

1478
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,550
format I didn't I just no I at least

1479
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:10,769
want a radial menu we will probably also

1480
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:12,990
put in a list the radial menu is good

1481
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:14,550
for quick picking so I probably want to

1482
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:16,229
have radial menus for just a quick turn

1483
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:19,469
on and off and then I probably also want

1484
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:21,838
a more like linear drop-down any sort of

1485
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:25,500
a situation for picking other things so

1486
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,759
we're gonna do them all Elvan it would

1487
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,619
be cool if the menu items are aligned

1488
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:30,899
with the circle borders that way there's

1489
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:32,670
less chance of Tex colliding yeah we

1490
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:34,289
should also wrap the text a little bit

1491
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:40,409
so there's more stuff we want to do

1492
01:08:34,289 --> 01:08:42,060
there Elvin you mentioned she doesn't

1493
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:43,439
officially support closures did you ever

1494
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:46,140
make an attempt to hack it maybe buy

1495
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:48,028
functors or something like that not

1496
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,410
really although I do often times do the

1497
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:50,460
thing where I have multiple manage

1498
01:08:49,409 --> 01:08:51,930
stacks like you've seen me doing

1499
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,119
handmade hero and some of that sort of

1500
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:55,588
gets into closure II territory but no

1501
01:08:54,119 --> 01:09:01,229
I've never tried to hack closure

1502
01:08:55,588 --> 01:09:02,850
specifically in any real way have you

1503
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:04,679
ever considered a debug output for the

1504
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:06,298
stream where we can see your keystrokes

1505
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,520
you mean like something that sort of

1506
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:10,769
just puts like ctrl G at the bottom when

1507
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,569
I hit ctrl G or stuff like that no I

1508
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:15,259
haven't really and most of the reason

1509
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:18,420
for that is I don't I mean I'm not an

1510
01:09:15,259 --> 01:09:20,189
Emacs I'm not a passionate Emacs user so

1511
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:25,409
I don't really care if people learn how

1512
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:28,588
to use Emacs I mean hopefully there's

1513
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:33,088
some better editor to use soon maybe if

1514
01:09:28,588 --> 01:09:35,939
if mr. fourth-dimension gets for code or

1515
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:40,278
up to up to speed we can just be using

1516
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:40,278
that instead but yeah

1517
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:45,380
elleven often times are using someone

1518
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:47,029
else's API engine you end up having to

1519
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:48,739
fight with it to have it do what you

1520
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:51,109
want from it do you think that is a sign

1521
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:52,548
that one should leave that API and try

1522
01:09:51,109 --> 01:10:02,570
another write his own instead of

1523
01:09:52,548 --> 01:10:09,019
fighting all the time it's a tough

1524
01:10:02,569 --> 01:10:12,829
question I the answer is that it depends

1525
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:14,600
a lot of times that's true you know if

1526
01:10:12,829 --> 01:10:16,399
you're if you're using unity or

1527
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,630
something you're probably gonna spend a

1528
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:20,059
lot of your time fighting with it or

1529
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:21,800
whatever and and it's just like you're

1530
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,179
making you're making a trade-off of

1531
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,699
basically saying yeah this thing is not

1532
01:10:23,179 --> 01:10:26,989
gonna be architected to do what I want

1533
01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:30,500
to do it's just this kind of thing that

1534
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:32,509
is whatever it is and I'm just I'm

1535
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:36,859
rolling the dice and saying that I bet

1536
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:38,900
that I can save time in the long run by

1537
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:40,159
using unity because they've because of

1538
01:10:38,899 --> 01:10:42,799
all the code they've written for me

1539
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,119
versus all of the aggravation and time

1540
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,770
I'm gonna have to spend trying to get it

1541
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:47,390
to do certain things that it's doing

1542
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,400
wrong or that doesn't do right for my

1543
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:53,810
game and you're making that judgment

1544
01:10:49,399 --> 01:10:55,789
call right so sometimes I would say no

1545
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:57,170
it doesn't mean you should switch right

1546
01:10:55,789 --> 01:11:00,319
it doesn't mean you shouldn't use unity

1547
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:03,590
because the total time to develop the

1548
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:06,679
game may still be shorter if you use

1549
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:08,000
unity than if you don't right especially

1550
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,050
if you're not a very experienced

1551
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,710
programmer or something like that right

1552
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:17,239
so sometimes you have to think of the

1553
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:19,609
fighting as the cost of not having to

1554
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:23,329
write the code yourself and it may end

1555
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:26,119
up being a win right again it all

1556
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:28,429
depends other times if you're really

1557
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:30,260
fighting with it and it's not working it

1558
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:32,270
may be the fact that like okay you just

1559
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:33,980
can't do this you're gonna end up

1560
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:37,130
basically rewriting almost the whole

1561
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:39,919
thing yourself anyway in c-sharp you or

1562
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:42,020
whatever just to work around all the

1563
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:45,440
things that it doesn't do right that you

1564
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:47,870
need it to do and then yeah it was a bad

1565
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:50,210
idea to like keep using that thing you

1566
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:52,579
know and unfortunately there's really

1567
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:54,949
that's a really very tough decision

1568
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:58,220
especially for a novice game developer

1569
01:11:54,949 --> 01:12:01,340
make knowing which one of those is going

1570
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:03,320
to be true is very very hard and it's

1571
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:06,289
closely related to another similar

1572
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,929
decision which is what thing to use

1573
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:11,000
library engine right for example you're

1574
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:12,619
a novice game developer you don't have

1575
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,729
the skills to make an engine should you

1576
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:21,140
use Unreal Engine or unity right or game

1577
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:24,619
maker and you know unless you've built

1578
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:26,119
things in all three it's very hard to

1579
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:29,630
know the answer to that question right

1580
01:12:26,119 --> 01:12:31,909
because yeah you will fight all three of

1581
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:33,949
those you will fight because things that

1582
01:12:31,909 --> 01:12:35,389
you will want to do it will not do in

1583
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:37,639
the way you want to do them or the way

1584
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:40,220
that your game needs them done that will

1585
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:45,079
happen which one of them will be the

1586
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:46,610
least fighting right and so it's

1587
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:48,529
definitely a case it's definitely the

1588
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:49,219
case that those are all very hard

1589
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:51,559
decisions

1590
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:53,210
fighting is definitely a sign that the

1591
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,500
thing doesn't do what you want it to do

1592
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:56,720
the way you want to do it but that

1593
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,399
doesn't mean you need to stop it means

1594
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,770
you just need to be aware of it and beat

1595
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:02,929
and understand that everything is a

1596
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:06,290
cost-benefit trade off and if you start

1597
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:08,570
to sense that writing maybe a particular

1598
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:10,609
component from scratch or a whole thing

1599
01:13:08,569 --> 01:13:12,859
from scratch is going to be the better

1600
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:15,349
way to go then you need to do that right

1601
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:16,819
and that's again unfortunately the kind

1602
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:18,740
of thing that's very difficult for a

1603
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:20,569
novice programmer to make because it's

1604
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:23,000
it's about experience in a lot of sense

1605
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:24,679
and there's really without being burned

1606
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,529
a few times and seeing how you get

1607
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:31,670
burned it's oftentimes hard to know just

1608
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:35,210
how hot the pan is right so that's

1609
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:38,300
that's an issue certainly what I would

1610
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:39,649
say in in and this probably doesn't go

1611
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,690
for any of those things because because

1612
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:42,739
in in those cases I think most of time

1613
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:46,039
before fighting it's probably because

1614
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:51,170
it's janky there are certain cases very

1615
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:52,640
limited cases but certain cases where

1616
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:55,329
you're fighting the API because you

1617
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:58,850
actually don't know what you're doing

1618
01:13:55,329 --> 01:14:05,750
and an example for this for of this is

1619
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:08,450
probably like when I was say 20 years

1620
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:11,090
old if you had shown me the

1621
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:12,679
iö completion ports API in Windows I

1622
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:16,279
probably would have said it was stupid

1623
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:17,990
and I would have or would have had to

1624
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:21,409
fight with it to get it to do what I

1625
01:14:17,989 --> 01:14:23,389
wanted to do nowadays I think the i/o

1626
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:26,539
completion port API is like pretty darn

1627
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:29,420
close to perfect and that is just

1628
01:14:26,539 --> 01:14:31,670
because I get how a certain type of code

1629
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:33,380
should be written now and I get what it

1630
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,880
needs to do to be performant and I get

1631
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:38,539
what it needs to do to be properly

1632
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:41,779
multi-threaded and until you know all of

1633
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:45,760
that stuff a very well-designed API may

1634
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:47,750
actually seem stupid or confusing or or

1635
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,869
that it has something wrong with it but

1636
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:54,949
it's actually you who are correct that

1637
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:56,689
happens fairly rarely but once the mount

1638
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:58,279
does happen and you know I suppose it's

1639
01:14:56,689 --> 01:15:00,019
not a surprise that the i/o completion

1640
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:02,000
port API is an example of something like

1641
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:06,350
that because that was designed by some

1642
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:10,000
really really great operating system

1643
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:13,780
guys like back in the day of cutler days

1644
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,779
so you know

1645
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:20,979
are you ready for the world to end

1646
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,750
tomorrow script about crazy Christians

1647
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:25,539
uh no I would prefer that it did not end

1648
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:29,170
tomorrow I would really like to ship our

1649
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:30,430
first game at Mali rocket so if they

1650
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:32,109
could hold off on the end of the world

1651
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:33,270
until after we do that I would really

1652
01:15:32,109 --> 01:15:35,380
like that a lot

1653
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:36,850
psi 9 since through I worked out quickly

1654
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:38,350
is its own translation unit are you

1655
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:42,539
going to write that code and straight as

1656
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:44,620
of instead of C intrinsics probably not

1657
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:46,659
although if we wanted to try that as

1658
01:15:44,619 --> 01:15:48,250
just an exercise sometime we could I

1659
01:15:46,659 --> 01:15:51,250
probably wouldn't do that before we ship

1660
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:54,100
the game though Qbert Caleb wait isn't

1661
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:56,619
for coder already better than Emacs some

1662
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,970
of it is the like refresh time and and

1663
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:59,439
some of the stuff is but there's a bunch

1664
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:01,869
of things in Emacs that I need that

1665
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:03,219
doesn't have yet and so until it's up to

1666
01:16:01,869 --> 01:16:05,489
that level of functionality I can't

1667
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,490
switch

1668
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,680
Cooper Caleb can you go into detail and

1669
01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:15,809
I have completion for it since you

1670
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:18,360
brought that up no because we're out of

1671
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:20,430
time and trying to explain why out

1672
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:22,229
completion ports are a good API would

1673
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:24,090
take a long time so that's probably a

1674
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:26,519
topic that's better saved for it for a

1675
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:31,460
different day all right

1676
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:31,460
I'm gonna wind it down wind it down

1677
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:38,579
save the blackboard all right

1678
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:39,479
thanks everyone for joining me for

1679
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:40,739
another episode of hand made here oh

1680
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:42,629
it's been a pleasure coding with you as

1681
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:45,420
always if you would like to follow along

1682
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:47,310
with handmade here at home with the

1683
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:49,140
source code yourself the source code

1684
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:50,730
actually comes with a pre-order of the

1685
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,950
game so if you preorder handmade he

1686
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:54,989
wrote up if you preorder handmade hero

1687
01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:56,189
the game on here org it comes with a

1688
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:58,380
source every night after I'm done I

1689
01:16:56,189 --> 01:17:00,509
upload it and you can grab it play

1690
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,710
around with it and experiment so if

1691
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:03,600
you'd like to do that check out handmade

1692
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:05,010
here org we also have a patreon page you

1693
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,630
can go to support the video series

1694

to other members of the community or use

1698
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:17,159
a anti Oso guy they've put together it's

1699
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:18,929
really handy and there's also a tweet

1700

bot the tweets that schedule it used to

1701
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:21,810
be track has a stream live that is the

1702
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,460
place to check out speaking catching a

1703
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:25,440
stream live I would like to do some more

1704
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:27,750
UI coding tomorrow and I hope you do too

1705
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:28,439
if that is the case please come back

where we will do exactly that until then

1709
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:40,079
please have fun programming and I will

1710
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:42,890
see you guys on the Internet

1711
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:42,890
take it easy everyone
