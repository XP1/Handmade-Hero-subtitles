00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:08,429
okay hello everyone and welcome to a

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,190
little sort of mini tutorial on my setup

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,530
of new Emacs I want to just say

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:16,679
beforehand that this is not part of the

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:20,969
actual handmade here a stream and I am

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:23,489
NOT a a max advocate in any way I am NOT

7
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,500
trying to tell you to use Emacs I I

8
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:28,288
don't have a particular editor that I

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,899
think is great I know everyone has like

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,609
sort of this religious conviction that

11
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,199
the particular editor is great I have

12
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:36,390
never seen an editor that I thought was

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,100
particularly good I feel Emacs is

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,570
roughly the same as most editors it's

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,210
getting a little on in yours and it's a

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,058
bit too slow these days and a bit too

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,500
buggy but you know it's sub simply the

18
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:47,759
same as any other editor most of the

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,140
things you can do any max you can do in

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,519
other editors and most of the things you

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,899
know that it is you could do in Emacs if

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,539
you really wanted to and so on so forth

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,890
so I don't necessarily you know push

24
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:02,489
Emacs or anything like that

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,260
but I would say that you know I also if

26
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:05,908
you're going to use an editor it's not

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,219
necessarily a bad choice I don't know

28
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,840
that there is a good or bad choice but

29
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:11,789
what I did want to do is a lot of people

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,579
had written in and said they wanted to

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,560
try and use my eMac config and follow

32
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:18,209
along with the handmade hero stream the

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,530
way that I do it so what I'm going to do

34
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:22,140
is kind of just go over how my

35
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,670
configuration works and so that you can

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,079
understand what I'm doing when you see

37
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,549
it on the stream and if you want to use

38
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,719
Emacs yourself you certainly can now if

39
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,259
you are one of the people who have

40
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,349
pre-ordered handmade hero on the

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,728
handmade hero org site the source zips

42
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:45,030
all come with my Emacs config so

43
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,640
basically where's here there we go sorry

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,019
I've been I had to do a sync on the

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,109
witness so that's still running in the

46
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:55,949
background there okay so basically if I

47
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:58,170
go ahead and go into the handmade hero

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,719
directory so this is the place where you

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,009
would have your zip file if you follow

50
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,500
along at home with the source if you've

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,438
pre-ordered if you go into the misc

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,250
directory right there's a dot Emacs file

53
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,389
in there there's there's this guy I

54
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,379
don't know why there's like I should

55
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,269
probably get rid of it

56
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,740
de files or things that Emacs creates as

57
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,230
backups but I shut that off so I think

58
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,570
that only happens when there's a bug and

59
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,250
it can't load but point being in here

60
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:24,810
you can see that there's that dot Emacs

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,939
file and that dot Emacs file is

62
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,180
basically just my configuration it's all

63
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,770
written in list because Emacs runs on

64
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,200
sort of a variant of Lisp it's called

65
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,390
Emacs Lisp I don't actually know Lisp

66
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,009
hardly at all you know the only

67
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,679
interaction I've ever had with Lisp is

68
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,109
to customize going to Emacs so I really

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,780
don't know what is going on with Emacs

70
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,760
Lisp at all but what I do know is that

71
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,960
it is similar to lists but probably

72
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,819
different in a couple different ways

73
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,219
such that they call it Emacs Lisp and

74
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,750
not Lisp if you are a Lisp person you

75
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,509
probably will know the differences if

76
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,560
you're not you probably don't care but

77
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,909
there's probably a page somewhere that

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,449
summarizes them as well if you really

79
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:08,909
want to find out okay so if you want to

80
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:11,280
use this file you can actually look I've

81
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,500
also got an eMac stop back in here that

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,270
I use to run Emacs you can see it and

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,479
basically what you do is you pass minus

84
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,760
Q minus L and then the name of the file

85
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,310
the name of that Emacs file wherever the

86
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,709
path is that allows you to actually run

87
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,240
Emacs with my config you can also drop

88
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,150
it in what's called your home directory

89
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,040
which on Windows doesn't mean very much

90
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,840
I'm not sure where it defaults to but on

91
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,310
UNIX for example you all know what the

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,140
home directory is it's the tilde slash

93
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,719
shorthand whatever or you know slash

94
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,069
users slash KC whatever it is you can

95
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,759
put the dot e mixed on there and it will

96
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:45,780
automatically load but ignoring all of

97
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,669
that because that's neither here nor

98
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,490
there once you actually start up Emacs

99
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,229
on whatever platform you are running I

100
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,240
am basically going to go over all my

101
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,219
keyboard shortcuts and what they do now

102
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,409
you'll notice when it opens up by

103
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,150
default I have it set up into this two

104
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:03,569
pane mode so that there's like a pane on

105
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,010
the left and a pane on the right the

106
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,109
reason I do that is what I like to look

107
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:09,449
at H files and CPP files at the same

108
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,030
time and I tend to put my like struct

109
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:14,429
definitions in on one side and my code

110
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,230
on the other so I can see them it's

111
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,000
basically just an easy way to keep

112
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,859
everything up on the screen so that I

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,160
kind of have a quick reference always

114
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:25,469
when I need it so basically that is just

115
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,850
there's there's a bunch of commands in

116
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,920
Emacs that do that

117
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,810
sort of thing but basically they are all

118
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:38,100
in the in the dmax file let's see here

119
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,370
if I open that up down here split should

120
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,410
be some kind of that so basically that

121
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,930
in my Emacs file this startup windowing

122
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,550
line basically sort of has what's

123
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,170
happening there this split window

124
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,180
horizontally thing is the thing that

125
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,610
like takes the window whatever it is and

126
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,970
divides it down the middle and you can

127
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,800
keep doing that sort of thing right and

128
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,140
it would divide it again and that sort

129
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,430
of stuff so that's basically just split

130
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,169
window horizontally and split window

131
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,920
vertically does the other kind of thing

132
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,180
right basically those are just ways of

133
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,819
dividing up the screen real estate and I

134
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,220
don't ever do anything pretty much other

135
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,079
than what I've got exactly right here so

136
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,600
I just have that on startup and I just

137
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,620
use it that way okay so that is

138
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,050
basically what comes up when you

139
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,840
actually start going to Emacs using my

140
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,180
config now what you'll notice and I've

141
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:29,299
already done this on this thing or ready

142
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,009
to demonstrate this window thing is

143
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,319
Emacs basically has like sort of the

144
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,490
equivalent of a little like top level

145
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,319
it's got like a little way that you can

146
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:38,850
just start executing commands as if you

147
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,730
were running Lisp sort of it's not

148
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,780
really that but it's kind of like that

149
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,629
called the mini buffer and the mini

150
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,069
buffer is if you hit escape X right you

151
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:49,560
hit this not hold them down but you like

152
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:52,560
hit escape then you hit X which is

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,480
called meta X you get this little thing

154
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,189
down here you can see the M dash X and

155
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,160
you've got this little blinking cursor

156
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,230
and that's basically for whenever you

157
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,820
get into a situation where you need to

158
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,310
execute some commands that you don't

159
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,750
have set up for easy use so anytime

160
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,879
you're doing something out of the

161
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,459
ordinary you hit that meta X and you get

162
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,769
down there and what you can do there is

163
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,799
if you if you hit tab to complete things

164
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:18,509
you'll see all the commands you could

165
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,400
actually do and if you start typing some

166
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:23,219
of them like I typed split and hit tab

167
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,959
you can see that it will show me just

168
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,050
the things the commands that have that

169
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,149
involved now Emacs have so many commands

170
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,550
in it it's crazy I don't even know what

171
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:34,649
ten percent of those commands are like I

172
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,960
mean if I actually do meta X and hit the

173
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,969
tab and scroll through that it's just

174
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,649
like I don't even know I mean what is

175
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,110
what is quick

176
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:45,959
I have no idea you know you could type

177
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,840
it in and see what it does quick calc

178
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:53,159
and pair there's a wide I don't know two

179
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,560
plus five okay so I didn't review that

180
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,419
was there I never knew Emacs had that

181
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,129
apparently you hit medics quick calc and

182
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:02,519
it's got a calculator of course it does

183
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:04,500
cousin Emacs has everything you know

184
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:06,359
that I that would have saved me a lot of

185
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,019
time all these years of going with that

186
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,639
right but I didn't know I don't know

187
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:16,079
what is that what else can you do with

188
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,680
this if I'm in here MedX quick calc what

189
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,199
else can I do

190
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,810
can I do something crazy like two to the

191
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,970
sixth power unbelievable uh okay what

192
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,339
else I don't even know it's there

193
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,260
I'm going to start using this is it do

194
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:34,969
hexadecimal no it can't

195
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:37,288
oh it because it interpret the XS as x

196
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,160
all right I don't know

197
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:42,750
so so there you go this is cut this is

198
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,550
this is the majesty of Emacs there's so

199
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,769
much stuff in there so anyway if you're

200
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,329
down in here you tip type escape X you

201
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,529
get in here you can start typing stuff

202
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:52,288
you can hit tab and it'll try to

203
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:54,239
complete it for you with a can but if

204
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:55,800
you decide at any time and this is true

205
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,960
across all of Emacs basically if you

206
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,579
decide at any time that stuff has gone

207
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,779
horribly wrong and you didn't want to be

208
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,459
where you are so you don't want to be

209
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,219
down in the mini buffer you can hold

210
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,049
down control and hit G hold down control

211
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,250
so control G gets you out of there get

212
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,199
you out of the mini buffer and it'll

213
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,300
generally abort stuff that's going on in

214
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,300
the mini but if you need to get out now

215
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,560
suddenly when you hit that MedX thing if

216
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,150
there's that one if you said like let's

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
say you did this quick Cal thing and

218
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,019
you're like I don't know I want to learn

219
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,819
more about that it actually has some

220
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:26,598
documentation built into it so you can

221
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,879
type in describe function for example

222
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:31,769
and then you can type like quick calc in

223
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,559
there and it'll give you any

224
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,509
documentation that it actually has on

225
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,759
that thing it'll tell you where the

226
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:40,830
actual thing is implemented in the Emacs

227
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:43,468
list and you can even click on the thing

228
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,290
usually and go to the Lisp so this is

229
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,209
like the source code for it now like I

230
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:50,639
said I can't program lists partly at all

231
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,929
so you know I'm never really probably

232
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,569
going to understand most of the stuff

233
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:54,039
that's in here

234
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,690
like I'd have to really pay attention to

235
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,189
even know what was going on but if you

236
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,380
were a list person you could just go in

237
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,560
and take a look and see how things are

238
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:03,789
implemented if you cared right so

239
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,339
there's some other things you can do if

240
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:08,259
you type meta X help you can get this

241
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,480
sort of thing that sort of tells you a

242
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:13,210
bunch of keyboard shortcuts that you

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,200
could type in to get more help the most

244
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:19,930
common one is apropos which is a so if

245
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,490
you hit a you can then type in anything

246
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,159
you want like let's say we just type in

247
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,169
calc and hit return and that will

248
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,169
actually do kind of like a search for

249
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:31,689
all of the commands that have calc in it

250
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:34,059
right so you can see all the stuff that

251
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:37,240
you can do all the commands that have

252
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:39,250
calculate somewhere so yeah I mean

253
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,990
budget stuff you can do there I'm not

254
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,309
going to go into detail too much on that

255
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,019
stuff because you kind of get the idea

256
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:46,809
I'm just going to go ahead and talk

257
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:51,490
about all the things that I actually

258
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:53,079
have bound keys so you can tell the

259
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,070
stuff that I think is important and that

260
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,290
I use often so alt F you hold down alt

261
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,700
you hit F is one of the major things

262
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:04,000
that I used and that just means load a

263
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,520
new file and when you're in there you

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,980
can basically hit like tab to do

265
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,779
completion and you can hit delete will

266
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,000
go back like a whole directory you can

267
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:13,629
type in a thing and autocomplete it that

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,269
sort of stuff

269
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:20,529
I'm going to in the misc directory put

270
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:21,309
like an Emacs keybindings dot text right

271
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:23,919
now

272
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:26,319
Emacs sometime recently introduced a

273
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,769
really annoying feature which is that if

274
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,690
the thing that you type in is not in the

275
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,429
path where you're putting it so like you

276
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,720
see in fact I can show you for example

277
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,699
here I'm trying to create a new file

278
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,460
right I'm trying to connect create Emacs

279
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,830
keybindings dot text and so you know if

280
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,210
in this case if I hit return it'll

281
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,310
actually make the file and that's all

282
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,050
good but let's say I was in here and I

283
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,819
was looking for a file but did happen to

284
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:51,429
exist somewhere else like let's say that

285
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,950
build that bat or something right it'll

286
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:56,529
do this search for it and if it finds it

287
00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:00,490
which you can see that it did it

288
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:02,379
actually then moves you to the it like

289
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,169
moves you right to the directory that

290
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:06,189
that thing was in and I hate this

291
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,809
feature I have

292
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,160
not gone spelunking in the list to

293
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:10,779
figure out usually there's ways to turn

294
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,159
these features off I have not gone

295
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,449
spelunking the list to figure out how to

296
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,169
turn that off but I hate that feature

297
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,370
but just be aware that it's there I

298
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,679
don't know if there's anything you can

299
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,049
do to get back to where you were I don't

300
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,819
know if control-j no it doesn't so I

301
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,889
don't actually know that that feature

302
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,690
drives me nuts be aware of it and it

303
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,039
just it's I don't even know I do not

304
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,440
know how to turn it off someone who's a

305
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,000
list guy could totally tell me and we

306
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:40,690
could put it into the dot Emacs bomb

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:45,490
that would be great anyway so alt F on

308
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:49,240
my Emacs is that's Alps make a little

309
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,570
thing here is load file in the current

310
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,950
window right so that's pretty important

311
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:59,170
alt s which I just did is save the file

312
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,800
in the current window write whatever the

313
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:06,429
file is that you're on right now

314
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:09,609
similarly alt shift F so if you just hit

315
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:12,250
shift on there then it opens that same

316
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,080
load file but whatever I load will load

317
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,879
in the other window right so I

318
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,830
oftentimes will do stuff like I'm in

319
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,230
this window working on something and I

320
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:23,230
want to open a file in the other window

321
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,850
I can just hit alt shift F and do it

322
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:33,370
that way right so I have alt shift F

323
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:38,470
that would go here right load file in

324
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:39,519
the other and that's you know pretty

325
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:46,500
straightforward right

326
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:49,240
so that's mostly how I get files in I

327
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,250
mean and I don't think I do anything

328
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,649
else for like file load and save I think

329
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,889
that's mostly it now if you already have

330
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:59,289
a file loaded you can always load a file

331
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:01,389
again so I can always hit alt shift eft

332
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:02,799
again and load something again a second

333
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:05,049
time even if it's already loaded and

334
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,179
that's fine it'll just make another view

335
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,679
of that thing and whatever the it's not

336
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:10,059
like it opens it multiple times we have

337
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,949
to worry about multiple copies it's

338
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:14,279
always the same file unless you

339
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,629
specifically ask Emacs to have two

340
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,659
separate versions of a file loaded which

341
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,110
I never want it to do so I don't have

342
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:21,578
anything

343
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:26,560
to that but you can do that it's just a

344
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:28,088
different thing so the other thing is if

345
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,909
you just want to switch to a buffer that

346
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,709
you know is already open I also have alt

347
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,809
B and alt shift be bound to the same

348
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,338
things as F so if I hit alt B it'll just

349
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,169
list all the buffers that are open and I

350
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:40,660
can just immediately type to one of them

351
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:41,979
and left and right arrow keys in here

352
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:44,799
while you're in the mini buffer cycle

353
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,360
through options obviously so I can I can

354
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,429
also switch buffers that way and alt

355
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,019
shift B switches them to them in the

356
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,659
other window and you can have the same

357
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:55,299
buffer open multiple times and they

358
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,519
synchronize right so you there's no like

359
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:59,740
I said again you can have as many views

360
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,310
into the same buffer as you want and

361
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,430
that's fine

362
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:05,619
so basically much like alt F and alt

363
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:09,250
shift F there's basically just these

364
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:13,209
which is a switch to buffer in the

365
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:15,549
current window switch to buffer in the

366
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:18,069
other window right and that's that's all

367
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,419
that is now similarly if you want to

368
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,420
just ping-pong back and forth between

369
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:28,838
the windows like I do often that is all

370
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:31,509
to W so alt W is a switch or like I know

371
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,269
- I'll call it switch to the other

372
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:35,889
window right I don't know these are bad

373
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,060
descriptions probably but you know what

374
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:41,139
I mean hopefully if you're watching this

375
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:44,198
you will understand what I mean okay

376
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:47,198
so basically that's most of how I get

377
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:49,778
around in things that are nonspecific

378
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,000
but if it is a specific type of file

379
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:53,980
like that I typically work with there

380
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,708
are some additional options so if I'm in

381
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,019
handmaid dot cpp for example and i would

382
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,969
like to get to handmade dot h because I

383
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:05,198
typically want to be able to go between

384
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:07,899
CPP's and HS I have alt C bound to that

385
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,419
so alt C just toggles between seeing the

386
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:16,149
H file and seeing the CPP file right so

387
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:19,389
alt C switches between H file and CPP

388
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:22,299
file or I should say toggles between H

389
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:25,899
file and CPP file in current window

390
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:28,000
right and the exact same thing as before

391
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,419
with the shift I tend to bind shift to

392
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,039
just mean do it in the other window so

393
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:33,519
that's basically what the shift does in

394
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,279
this case

395
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,750
well if I was in this window looking at

396
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,220
handmade EVP and I want to see the H

397
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,649
file in the other window I just hit alt

398
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,350
shift C and now I've got it in here

399
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:49,209
right make some sense hopefully that's

400
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:52,620
that's pretty clear so it's basically I

401
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:57,129
think that's everything in terms of

402
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:59,440
navigation I want to say trying to think

403
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:02,470
if I've got any other sort of stuff

404
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,380
that's that's about like loading files

405
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,820
and things but I don't think so

406
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:09,820
there might be some obscure ones but

407
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:14,590
those are most of them so okay so if you

408
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,940
have a buffer open and you want to get

409
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,490
rid of it you just don't want it open

410
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:22,690
anymore alt K will kill the buffer it

411
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:26,320
just goes away right so alt K you know

412
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:29,650
kills the buffer and it will ask to save

413
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,540
it first if it's modified right so it

414
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,419
doesn't kill it with prejudice it kills

415
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:36,339
it sort of cordially so if I type some

416
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:40,269
stuff in here and then hit alt K it'll

417
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,190
ask down in the you know in the mini

418
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,779
buffer it'll say hey did you actually

419
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,250
want to kill it and in this case I'll

420
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,579
say yes I did because I didn't want to

421
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:51,100
save those changes right pretty basic

422
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,860
stuff like I said nothing particularly

423
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:58,930
interesting there so let's get to actual

424
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:01,060
editing so let's say I go into a file

425
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:02,439
and I'll use a file that we didn't

426
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:04,659
haven't actually done anything in just

427
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,850
to kind of show you when you Oh to load

428
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:11,589
a CPP file or an H file I have Emacs

429
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:13,240
just insert this stuff directly and so

430
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:14,679
that'll happen any time you open a CPP

431
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,390
file or an H file that's just baked into

432
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,779
my DX file so you have to do anything to

433
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,830
make that happen that just happens so if

434
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,990
you're in here and you're starting to

435
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,740
edit code so you know you're doing you

436
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,730
know food on H and then you're doing boy

437
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,609
main int argc caressed our RV or

438
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,779
something like this and type stuff all

439
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:36,269
the indentations done for you

440
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:39,660
automatically usually so basically you

441
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:41,970
know I don't actually have to do

442
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,880
anything like hit tab or anything I just

443
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,980
start typing whatever it is that I want

444
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,770
to have happen and I don't do any

445
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:52,170
indentation it's it's syntactic

446
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:53,549
indentation but sometimes you get into

447
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,600
circumstances where you've done

448
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:59,220
something and it doesn't update like it

449
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,079
only updates the current line usually

450
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,308
when you do that it doesn't update

451
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,689
anything else so well though the

452
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:05,849
indentation is proper when you're

453
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,640
entering code it doesn't try to maintain

454
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:10,469
that indentation in the rest of the file

455
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,900
and so if I did something like enclose

456
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,519
the Ascend and if you can see that it

457
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:19,110
didn't actually indent eighth indent

458
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,279
anything over here and so one of the

459
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:22,529
things that you need to know how to do

460
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,928
is to do automatic indentation of a

461
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,308
block so in order to do that I have

462
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,040
first have to teach you what a block is

463
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:33,599
in Emacs so what a block is in Emacs is

464
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,190
basically every time you are moving the

465
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,319
cursor around you there's sort of an

466
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,970
implicit location which is wherever the

467
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:45,089
cursor is now if you want to at any time

468
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,670
you can sort of record where that

469
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:49,289
location is by holding down control and

470
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,808
hitting space and you can see down at

471
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:55,609
the bottom it says mark set so basically

472
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:58,829
control space this sets the mark right

473
00:18:55,609 --> 00:19:02,279
now if the mark is set what that means

474
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:03,960
is that location wherever it is is now

475
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,389
like a reference point that Emacs can

476
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,910
use for whatever you want to do that

477
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,740
operates on blocks so it's basically

478
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,029
like a much better version of selection

479
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,700
because it doesn't muck up your display

480
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:16,259
at all but it silently sort of has this

481
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,120
opinion of where things are set so I

482
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:20,099
just go to someplace I set the mark and

483
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,109
then I know I can always do stuff in

484
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:26,480
reference to that mark so I can just do

485
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:29,579
ctrl ctrl tab is re indent block row tab

486
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,220
re and n block and so I know I set the

487
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,409
mark right here I can then go hit ctrl

488
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,529
tab and it re indents everything in the

489
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,509
block right now similarly I can do stuff

490
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,889
with that block just like you would do

491
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:43,410
with the selection and most editors

492
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,759
right if I have the mark set let's say I

493
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,050
want to get rid of this for statement

494
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,519
here right

495
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,930
and obviously home and then just go to

496
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,629
home and then line I don't those are not

497
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:56,240
special but I hit control space I can go

498
00:19:51,630 --> 00:20:03,390
here control Q is copy right so ctrl Q

499
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:09,120
copies the block control F paste the

500
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:11,670
block control W cuts the block so

501
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,459
basically if I do control space control

502
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:17,330
Q I can start hitting ctrl F to insert

503
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,779
copies of that oh and I should also say

504
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:22,740
hmm

505
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,839
alt U is undo right so talk about that

506
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,329
one second so it's a little bit you have

507
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,949
to know about that okay so I can I can

508
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,599
also go in if I want to instead of

509
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,450
copying the block of control control w

510
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,980
kills it but I could it still goes into

511
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,049
the paste buffer so I can still reap a

512
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,519
sit-in and so on so that's just the

513
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:40,109
basic kind of text editing stuff you can

514
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,619
do in any editor but it all works with

515
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:46,259
at that point so that point that you

516
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,819
drop down is kind of handy too because

517
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,529
let's say you've got like a bunch of

518
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:52,230
these right I just got a bunch i got a

519
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:54,269
bigger file right and i was doing some

520
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,370
things up up here so i like cut this

521
00:20:54,269 --> 00:21:00,299
thing out right and then i went down

522
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:02,339
here and I like pasted it in right but

523
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:06,509
now I want to go back up to where I just

524
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:10,709
did that cut I have don't ask why I do

525
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:18,089
not know I believe it's this but I have

526
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:20,670
alt shift : it pops back to previously

527
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:23,009
marked locations I don't know why it's

528
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:25,410
alt shift : I think I was running out of

529
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:27,359
keyboard assignments or something but

530
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,130
basically alt shift : goes back through

531
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:35,219
the history of all the places that you

532
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:36,810
ever set that mark so alt shift that so

533
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,350
I guess it tightly semicolon but that

534
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:44,069
would just basically alt : I guess pops

535
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:45,599
back to the previous mark and so it's

536
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,039
kind of handy to be able to do that

537
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,209
because it means you can do stuff in one

538
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,529
location with a code jump to another

539
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,500
location to go do something and then

540
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:53,129
immediately sort of Bunji back to the

541
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,230
location

542
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,570
that you previously were at and I do

543
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,610
that a lot on the stream it saves a lot

544
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:02,609
of like searching around for stuff so

545
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:04,979
that's kind of handy so let's say that I

546
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:07,288
also have I'll show you another thing in

547
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,548
terms of navigating around similar to

548
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:13,220
that mark thing let's say that these

549
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:15,929
were all like actual functions right

550
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,630
just different names of functions and

551
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:21,419
things that sort of stuff so I've got a

552
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,520
bunch of these now let's delete these so

553
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,679
I've got a bunch of those and let's say

554
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:31,650
that I want to jump to a particular

555
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:33,900
function in a file so all J will jump to

556
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,480
a function by name so if I'm just in a

557
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,429
file and I hit alt J I get index item

558
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,839
down here and I can hit tab for the

559
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:41,669
completion again and it'll just show me

560
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,279
what the functions are on file I can

561
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:45,870
just do G underscore main and then it

562
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,668
jumps me right to that so that's an easy

563
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:49,259
way for me to navigate around if I know

564
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,669
the function that I want to go to it's

565
00:22:49,259 --> 00:22:52,558
pretty easy for me to just go ahead and

566
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,390
get directly to that function so it's

567
00:22:52,558 --> 00:23:00,149
pretty that that's a pretty good feature

568
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:02,038
and I use it a lot so that's mostly how

569
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,220
the navigation and the block stuff work

570
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:06,779
undo is a little bit odd in Emacs so I

571
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,409
want to talk a little bit about how it

572
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:13,408
works basically it's kind of doesn't

573
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,450
have undo and redo it just has one giant

574
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:18,210
undo buffer that keeps getting bigger so

575
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,058
that's when you undo something

576
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,970
the act of undoing it goes on to the

577
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:27,750
undo buffer and doing something other

578
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,600
than undo changes the direction of the

579
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:33,240
unwinding in the undo buffer it's kind

580
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,849
of like get in the sense that people who

581
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,669
know how to use it find that it's

582
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:41,009
intuitive but if you don't know how to

583
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,030
use it it's completely opaque it's one

584
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,710
of those things where it's just like

585
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,859
either you're used to it or you're not

586
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,090
and it's completely bizarre so I don't

587
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,609
know but basically if you're typing

588
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:53,250
along here right and then you start

589
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:54,658
undoing this stuff without you and now

590
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,869
you're like oops I didn't mean to do

591
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,330
that

592
00:23:54,869 --> 00:23:59,729
I want to reap it that stuff in well if

593
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:02,399
I hit well if I keep hitting alt u it'll

594
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,740
keep undoing more stuff so what I have

595
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,909
to do is like interrupt the undo chain

596
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,769
by doing something like say

597
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,419
just hitting the left you know the right

598
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:12,038
arrow or something like that to do

599
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:13,749
something that's non-destructive but

600
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,819
just do it do anything doesn't matter to

601
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:19,419
do something that isn't undo then when I

602
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:21,999
hit alt you it'll start unwinding that

603
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:24,099
undo stack right to the point where

604
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:26,108
there's nothing left to undo and then it

605
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:28,839
restarts on doing right because the undo

606
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:29,978
buffer is always growing it's just it's

607
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,108
very odd

608
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:34,269
I don't expect you to get used to it

609
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:36,548
right away it feels fine for me to use

610
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:39,788
but I don't think it's a good design but

611
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:42,489
it is the head of the design so you know

612
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:46,269
what are you going to do so that's

613
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:48,460
basically how undo works alright so

614
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,778
there's a couple of the things I'm

615
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,298
trying to think of all the stuff that I

616
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:55,659
tend to do from day to day that that

617
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:58,269
people might want to know about so

618
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:00,460
keyboard macros I haven't used them yet

619
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:04,118
on the stream but I do use them normally

620
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,739
so let's say I have I got all these sort

621
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:07,778
of functions that are like a underscore

622
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:08,979
main B underscore main C under screaming

623
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:11,858
oh I know what to do let me do this

624
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:13,629
before I get search control s is search

625
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,278
and it's exactly what you would expect

626
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:18,759
in any editor you just start typing and

627
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:21,429
you get it you hit ctrl s to move or

628
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:25,808
ctrl R to go backwards so basically it's

629
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:27,129
ctrl s start incremental search and then

630
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:34,210
once you're in there

631
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:38,798
ctrl s sort of moves to next next

632
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:45,788
occurrence let's say and control our

633
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:48,638
oops moves to previous occurrence just

634
00:25:45,788 --> 00:25:51,249
like you would expect I also have alt o

635
00:25:48,638 --> 00:25:55,028
is query replace so if I wanted to

636
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:56,950
change our GC to our count I can just

637
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:58,329
type those two in return I type the

638
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,149
first one return and second one return

639
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:05,499
and then it's just why your n at each

640
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:07,868
one so yes yes no yes no yes no yes yes

641
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:09,729
right something like that so if you want

642
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:11,918
to do a replace you can do that

643
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:14,080
and similarly I have the ability to do

644
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,389
replacement inside a paste this is kind

645
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,888
of handy so let's say I have this block

646
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:20,689
and I'm going to paste it a couple times

647
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:22,908
right but when I paste it

648
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,369
I want to be able to change the X to

649
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:27,769
something else after you do the paste

650
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:29,298
that mark is set to where you did the

651
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:32,659
paste from that's how Emacs works

652
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:35,658
Boult l does it replace inside the

653
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:38,419
marked region only so I can replace X

654
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:40,039
with Y just in that region right and

655
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:45,049
it'll work so I do it again

656
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:46,368
I'll tell X to Z do it again X 2 Q right

657
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:49,158
you can just keep on doing it so that's

658
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:55,098
kind of handy so basically that's a alt

659
00:26:49,159 --> 00:27:02,599
o is query replace fault L is replaced

660
00:26:55,098 --> 00:27:05,269
inside block right um I don't think

661
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:07,578
there's anything else about those is

662
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:10,669
there anything else that I do I'm

663
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:12,019
probably forgetting some things yeah I

664
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:15,919
don't know Oh one thing I should say

665
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:18,828
along with alt s alt M triggers the

666
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,159
compiler right so that's that's

667
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:28,219
basically I should say execute looks for

668
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:29,899
and execute a build dot bat right so

669
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:32,028
yeah that's how I was doing that if you

670
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,498
hit alt M it will actually do a

671
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:35,019
compilation it'll prompt you to save

672
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:38,028
things and then it'll do the compilation

673
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:46,788
to me all right

674
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:47,358
so keyboard macros keyboard macros are

675
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:52,298
pretty simple

676
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:57,048
you hit a alt Open bracket so basically

677
00:27:52,298 --> 00:28:02,658
alt and then this begin recording

678
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:08,028
keyboard macro then alt close bracket is

679
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:12,129
end recording keyboard macro and then

680
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:14,778
alt uh whatever you want to cut a single

681
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:21,108
apostrophe I guess that's what that is

682
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:23,058
yeah is is replay keyboard macro now it

683
00:28:21,108 --> 00:28:24,828
may not sound like keyboard macros are

684
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:26,328
particularly useful but they are in

685
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,068
Emacs I don't know if they are another

686
00:28:26,328 --> 00:28:29,690
language in other editors as well but in

687
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:31,928
Emacs you can actually get a lot of

688
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,710
functionality about the out of them

689
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:35,570
so you

690
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,190
in bed searches and cut and paste and

691
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:39,439
all that stuff in a keyboard macro so

692
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,880
for example let's say we actually have

693
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,048
we have all these functions and they're

694
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,399
all like a underscore remains B

695
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:47,298
underscore main and what we want to do

696
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:49,959
is we want to turn them into something

697
00:28:47,298 --> 00:28:52,460
that looks more like main underscore a

698
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,250
right so we want to move we want to

699
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,419
change where that thing is right so what

700
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,960
I can do is I can start recording

701
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:04,130
keyboard macro I can hit ctrl s to do a

702
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:08,690
search hit a underscore right then I can

703
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:10,880
hit basically delete to delete the the

704
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,070
the underscore that's kind of was in

705
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,100
between the main hit controls space to

706
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:18,648
mark the location hit ctrl I should talk

707
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:20,990
about these later control left arrow to

708
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:24,918
get back to the previous word ctrl W to

709
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:29,259
cut ctrl s to search for the the

710
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:31,309
parentheses go back one insert the the

711
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:35,000
underscore that I was talking about and

712
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:38,569
then paste in the new one right and if I

713
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
go ahead and do an alt bracket to finish

714
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:43,788
that one then you can see when I when I

715
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,839
go ahead and replay it on something

716
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:47,379
right it would do

717
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,339
oh well no I guess I messed that up

718
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,659
sorry I was talking a little bit too

719
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,408
much in there maybe I missed it up let's

720
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:57,110
try one more time

721
00:29:51,409 --> 00:30:02,630
search for main move back one a little

722
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:06,079
thing delete that mark it W move forward

723
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:06,980
for that underscore paste should work

724
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,960
there we go

725
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,808
so then we go down and we can replace

726
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,509
all of those with their swizzles

727
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:16,398
equivalents so yeah that's basically it

728
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,169
and you can make arbitrarily complex

729
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,219
stuff that way it gets finicky like you

730
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:20,538
saw it didn't work the first time

731
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,808
because I messed something up that's

732
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:25,308
pretty common and it's typical to be a

733
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:26,450
little finicky so you only really want

734
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:27,859
to do that if you're actually doing a

735
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,850
lot of heavyweight edits that are

736
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,038
actually gonna save you a lot of time

737
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:32,750
but it works pretty well so the other

738
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,308
thing that I meant to say that I forgot

739
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:37,398
about was basically if I hold down the

740
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:42,888
ctrl key I can move basically by larger

741
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:45,489
increments so basically ctrl + arrow

742
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:45,490
keys

743
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:53,330
people's move cursor by larger

744
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:55,759
increments in this like word for white

745
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:58,668
space is usually what it looks for so up

746
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:01,509
and down is by white space see and let

747
00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:05,870
you write or by word so that's about it

748
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:08,210
so let me take a brief look at the Emacs

749
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:10,369
file and just see if there's anything

750
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,690
obvious that I haven't covered yet

751
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,058
because I suspect there's a couple of

752
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:19,250
the things that I just haven't talked

753
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:21,829
about so we talked about the buffers we

754
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,890
don't need the to do thing that's a log

755
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:28,069
loading thing we talked about that we

756
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:32,240
talked about save oh I should say that

757
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:35,329
tab completes our cycles through

758
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,460
completions for a word so basically if

759
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:39,589
you're in somewhere editing and you want

760
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,970
to do main you can just hit tab and

761
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,699
it'll cycle through all the possible

762
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,798
things that's nothing quickly special

763
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,720
sort of like intellisense but it's just

764
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:49,970
word based it's not understanding the

765
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,850
code or anything

766
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,980
let's see those are also see fill

767
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:57,889
paragraph okay so that's probably a

768
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:01,730
little bit interesting so alt and period

769
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:03,799
is to reflow a comment you can basically

770
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,409
do that so for example if I'm in here

771
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:10,519
and I did some kind of comment where I

772
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:15,320
was like you know do you do this is a

773
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:19,460
long comment that starts get long-winded

774
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:22,700
and maybe the person didn't do a great

775
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:28,278
job of figuring out where the line

776
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:32,600
breaks should have gone and now it's all

777
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:35,089
messed up and so if I hit alt period

778
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:37,428
anywhere in there it'll just do it and

779
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:39,139
it that includes making more lines if it

780
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,409
needs to right so they can it can do it

781
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:44,149
like that and it also I believe will

782
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:46,100
automatically if you're using the other

783
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:47,629
kind of comment where you need it where

784
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:49,069
it's only one lines worth of comment I

785
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,440
believe it'll just yeah it just

786
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:53,119
automatically inserts more of the

787
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,669
comment markers for you so it's kind of

788
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,129
a catch-all it just does the right thing

789
00:32:54,669 --> 00:33:01,390
pretty much in all circumstances

790
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:04,990
so that's where we flowing comment let's

791
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:08,580
see what else do we have we've got all

792
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:12,009
of those those are not necessary anymore

793
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:15,869
set marker pen bla bla bla

794
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:18,129
yeah yeah yeah covered all those

795
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:21,969
exchange point in mark we don't really

796
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:25,390
use ok so next in previous error those

797
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:32,669
are probably worth doing so Alt + + alt

798
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:38,230
shift + R basically go to the next error

799
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:41,620
after a compile and go to the previous

800
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:43,650
error after a compile and basically all

801
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:46,959
those are if you run that alt em thing

802
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:48,909
and then you want to go back and forth

803
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,759
between errors it's Alt + + Alt shift M

804
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:55,390
really pretty basic okay and there's

805
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:58,150
another good one - alt G is a go to line

806
00:33:55,390 --> 00:34:00,038
number so basically if I'm on any file

807
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,538
and I hit alt G you can type in a line

808
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,679
number like 10 and it'll hop you right

809
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:04,119
to that line number which is sometimes

810
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,380
good if you have an external tool that's

811
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:07,359
giving you line number information you

812
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,179
just want to go right there that's

813
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:18,159
pretty pretty useful these are not

814
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:21,220
useful revert buffer is probably useful

815
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:25,148
so we'll put that in there for now so

816
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:26,439
alt R is revert buffer and we all

817
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:28,148
probably know what that is right it's

818
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,590
just a few if you make a bunch of

819
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:30,909
changes in a buffer they're just wrong

820
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,470
and you're like I want to go back to

821
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,539
what's on the disk you hit all our it'll

822
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,250
ask you for confirmation and then you

823
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,659
get back to the buffer as it stands on

824
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:41,800
disk so just like in any other editor

825
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:43,740
nothing particularly odd there so we got

826
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,780
the compilation stuff we covered that

827
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:50,138
we've got some variables here

828
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:52,000
that's time those are not useful and

829
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,789
that's it so I think this is basically

830
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,800
it like that's that's literally and I

831
00:34:54,789 --> 00:35:00,519
should get rid of all that bogus code in

832
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,400
the next hand made friends we haven't um

833
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:07,780
so yeah I think that's basically it so

834
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,410
this is a quick reference guide for

835
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,410
Casey Zeman

836
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:16,750
keybindings that is basically all you

837
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,550
need to know that's all I'm doing on the

838
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,880
stream is I think basically just these

839
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:23,380
things and so like I said my needs for

840
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,180
an editor are relatively modest if

841
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,280
someone just built an editor that was

842
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:31,299
lightning fast had good syntax

843
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,970
highlighting good good indentation by

844
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,660
syntax and then supported all of these

845
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:36,879
features

846
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:39,969
I could probably that was bound to these

847
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,160
keys trivially with the two pane layout

848
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:43,750
I could probably just switch to it in no

849
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,219
time right because it's this all like

850
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,480
this is all I use I don't really need

851
00:35:45,219 --> 00:35:48,939
anything else

852
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,559
so like I said I suspect I mean I don't

853
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:55,090
know for sure but I suspect if you were

854
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:57,190
using say sublime or something like that

855
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,599
that you could if you wanted to and I

856
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:00,220
don't know that you necessarily do want

857
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:02,530
to edit exactly the way I do but if you

858
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:05,529
did I suspect you could probably set it

859
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,570
up to be very close to exactly these

860
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,190
things because they're like I said

861
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,690
they're not really that complicated

862
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:12,460
there may be some things like I don't

863
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,409
know if it keeps a mark history and

864
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,059
stuff like that there maybe it's just a

865
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:18,608
few things that a particular editor just

866
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:21,369
doesn't do but for this for the most

867
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:25,119
part a pretty similar editor config

868
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:28,480
could probably be made in in most text

869
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,050
editors except of course window I mean a

870
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,119
visual studio like I tried back into k-8

871
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,140
to get a thing that was opponent Emacs

872
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:37,630
and there were just a number of reasons

873
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:39,098
why it didn't quite work because of the

874
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,690
way that they handle key bindings they

875
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:43,030
couldn't emulate these key bindings

876
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,889
correctly hilariously they used to have

877
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:47,050
a plugin that allowed you to but then

878
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:48,730
they like nerfed it like it didn't work

879
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,289
anymore and I don't know if they ever

880
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,199
got the plug-in working again it's just

881
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:54,338
it's classic Microsoft nonsense weird

882
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,569
like every time you install a new

883
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,338
version of one of their piece of

884
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,690
software you get less features than you

885
00:36:57,338 --> 00:36:59,980
had in the previous version I don't know

886
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,079
how that ever happened but that's where

887
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,760
we've ended up so anyway I think that's

888
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,829
basically it so I'm going to call it

889
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,480
quits now on the Emacs thing and we'll

890
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:09,969
take a 10-minute break before starting

891
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,199
the regular handmade hero stream so I'm

892
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:15,029
going to go here and go ahead and turn

893
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:15,029
that off so I can have a clean recording
