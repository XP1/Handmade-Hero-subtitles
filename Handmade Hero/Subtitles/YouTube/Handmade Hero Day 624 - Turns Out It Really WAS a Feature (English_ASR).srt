00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,040
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,759
hero the show where we code a complete

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,879
game

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,359
live on the stream and uh

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
we are really just going back to what we

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,439
were doing

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,118
um when we stopped last week we

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
were in the middle of just finishing up

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:24,800
our tag stuff and we had a lighting

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,640
problem uh that we want to look into and

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240
and really that's all we're doing

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,080
i'm going to go ahead and go to the

13
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,280
handmade directory here

14
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:36,799
and open up four coder

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,640
or not oh

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,159
you know what i just realized i didn't

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,399
run the shell

18
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:47,759
just missed shell.bat there we go

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,759
um so

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,839
if i remember correctly there's really

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
two or three things we still had left to

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,960
do

23
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,000
um i'm going to open up remedy here and

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,399
just just show you

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,679
so one problem is that we had kind of

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
like a weird lighting prob

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,799
a bug which appears to be related to

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
like two large

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,400
values contaminating the lighting so you

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,720
know you can see like

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
if i'm not uh hopping around here you

32
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,679
know i can i can

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,158
do what i would normally expect to do

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,118
and the lighting appears to be correct

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,320
um for the most part but then i end up

36
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,599
in a situation where

37
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,359
occasionally and it's a tricky problem

38
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,599
because there doesn't seem to be

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,759
a lot of rhyme or reason to it like it

40
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,000
just kind of happens sometimes

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,359
um and it is not happening now

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
unfortunately

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,280
but the lighting will just become

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
infinitely bright

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
and it looked like this was just maybe a

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,079
problem with some out of bounds

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,719
computation or some kind of initialized

48
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,078
values

49
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:51,118
seeping in there um but we don't know

50
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,399
so unfortunately that's like seeming to

51
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,680
be a little bit

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,478
har difficult to repro at the moment and

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
so

54
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,799
i don't actually know what we would

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,759
do about that uh we're gonna have to try

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,280
and get a

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,399
more provocable case uh than this

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,199
but uh there it is

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,759
i'm like trust me it's there so you can

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,000
see this

61
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,039
and it appears to be a thing where you

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,479
end up with

63
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:24,159
values that contaminate right

64
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,159
um like you know

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,959
there's some really high light value

66
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,639
and because we know lighting values in

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,039
our system propagate

68
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,079
um like that like one really out of

69
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,679
bounds value

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
would in theory propagate to all the

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,239
cells eventually which is what i assume

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
is happening

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
so i think we just have a bug where we

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,159
compute something poorly or we've got

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,280
some kind of way that a trash value can

76
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,120
get in there

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
and it may be as simple as us just

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,159
guarding against that

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,598
but we need to kind of find that because

80
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,318
we can see that it happens and it

81
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,039
happens

82
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,079
you know maybe only rarely but rarely in

83
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,679
this case is

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
you know it would certainly happen

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,480
during the play of the game it's

86
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,878
frequent enough that that would happen

87
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,560
so

88
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:10,399
we know we gotta fix it um it's not so

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
it's not a one in a billion thing

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
um so we we should look at that and then

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,840
the other thing

92
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,839
that uh we know is busted is we just

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,000
haven't ported some of the tag stuff yet

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,120
for example here is the uh title screen

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,919
when we go to uh

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,640
you know when it's supposed to play the

97
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,318
cutscenes

98
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,679
you can see that it's not finding the

99
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:36,958
actual graphics or at least i assume

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,879
that's what's happening

101
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
uh and i believe that's just our tag

102
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,120
system um

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,238
is is being slightly busted there so

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,439
what we need to do

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,000
is we just need to look at why it's not

106
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,120
finding

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,158
those particular resources if i go

108
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,280
to the tags and i look at the

109
00:03:54,158 --> 00:04:00,079
intro cutscene hht um

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,000
you can see the tags here are like shot

111
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,200
index one layer index one

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,199
like that kind of stuff right um

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,239
i don't actually know what we're doing

114
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,518
inside the cutscene at the moment to

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,519
find these things

116
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,959
so it may be that we're just doing

117
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,000
something stupid

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,879
but whatever it is we need to go uh

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,839
figure out like why it can't find it so

120
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,040
if you look here

121
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:32,000
we have a get tag hash that is

122
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,800
uh you know looking at the at the layer

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,720
index

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
one plus whatever the layer index was

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,440
supposed to be

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,199
and then like a shop tag so in theory

127
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,439
the shot tag needs to be like

128
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,600
intro cutscene shot index 1 would be

129
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,040
what should be in that tag

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
and i don't know if that is what's in

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
the tag so we just need to go see

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
like are we picking these correctly that

133
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,519
way

134
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
you know what what's going on so you can

135
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,879
see here

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
where we've got like our our shot

137
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,399
information

138
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,959
you can see here that it's it's intro

139
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,959
cutscene

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,439
so it looks here like there's only one

141
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,439
tag shot index here

142
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:28,400
so i guess i'm not sure i understand

143
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,400
where intro cutscene is coming from

144
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,879
so is that getting bundled up in here or

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,840
something

146
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,839
because that that would be a problem

147
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:45,120
so so i think i mean maybe i'm wrong

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,879
about this but it kind of looks like

149
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,000
actually like just tag intro cutscene

150
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,918
is missing uh that might be the only

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,879
problem is that we weren't providing the

152
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,879
intro cutscene tag

153
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,519
um so it didn't know what cut scene we

154
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,840
were trying to load that

155
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,038
that might be it i don't know but we

156
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,038
should at least fix that first

157
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,120
yeah so it looks like that may have been

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
all there is

159
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,840
um let's just double check

160
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,879
so yeah so that turned out to not be a

161
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,239
big deal um

162
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,918
so that's fine we also have the trees

163
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:49,840
is the other one so we'll go we'll go

164
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:49,839
double check that as well

165
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,000
um

166
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
sorry i just want to make sure we we

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,959
wait long enough to

168
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,959
know that there's no weirdness going on

169
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,839
here

170
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,000
uh yanchen lee did this artwork

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,840
for someone's asking

172
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,360
i don't see anything missing so i mean

173
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,839
we could probably stop now but i'm just

174
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,840
you know

175
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,680
are you in texas are you asking me if

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:55,839
i'm in texas

177
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:55,838
i am not in texas

178
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,519
why thank you dusty dino

179
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:41,278
so that's all the cutscenes

180
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
right uh so that looks totally

181
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,080
correct like i don't see anything weird

182
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
going on there

183
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,680
um

184
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,399
so i think we're good um so

185
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,799
i think the only other tag issue that we

186
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,639
had

187
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,879
on the list is that if we go to an

188
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:04,958
outside area

189
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:08,720
um we don't have trees

190
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:11,679
right like you could oh my gosh

191
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,680
the baby is there

192
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,440
that's just a weird like placement bug i

193
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,440
guess there's like a baby there

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
hold on a second we should at least

195
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
align the baby we don't want our game to

196
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,240
have a baby with no head

197
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,360
that would be a very different kind of

198
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,360
game that'd be like one of those like um

199
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,278
like horror games like silent hill or

200
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,639
something

201
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:40,320
um so hold on a second let's

202
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:40,319
let's make one of those

203
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,559
bind points um

204
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,319
something like that probably

205
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,680
and

206
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
um

207
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,120
there

208
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,799
okay now our babies is better

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,959
much better um all right

210
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:28,799
so uh what we need here is to figure out

211
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,879
why our trees aren't there and

212
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,639
you know i think that's probably just

213
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,159
just because when we change the tags we

214
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,919
just haven't updated the thing that

215
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,278
actually puts the trees in to use the

216
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,559
correct set of tags

217
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,879
so i don't think this is going to be

218
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,439
particularly interesting but

219
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,958
uh we need our trees back also it was

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
kind of nice that our trees were not

221
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,759
there because it means we got to see the

222
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,838
fact that our baby was there

223
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,439
i guess the system was randomly placing

224
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,200
the babies in there because we had kind

225
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,519
of thrown in that thing that throws

226
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,120
like people up in the corner like that

227
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,320
oh my god dude nobody

228
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,320
puts baby in a corner except us like we

229
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
put baby in a corner

230
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,879
like we put baby in a corner there is

231
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,200
baby baby is in a corner

232
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,600
i feel like that's like a violation of

233
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,440
the meme

234
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,879
nobody puts baby in a corner because we

235
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,320
literally

236
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:22,078
we literally put the one baby

237
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,839
that exists in this game into a corner

238
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,759
um so all right let's

239
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,200
take a look at what's going on with the

240
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,838
trees here

241
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,480
um and then that would be the last thing

242
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,560
before

243
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,879
like then then we just have to look at

244
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,879
um

245
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,319
what's going on good stop this stop

246
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,120
everyone

247
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,120
okay uh

248
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,320
we need oops

249
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,639
we got it all we need to look at the

250
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,120
intro cutscene hht

251
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,919
i also need to make note of a four coder

252
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,759
thing to fix

253
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:04,639
there we need

254
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,639
per character file

255
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,760
delete

256
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,720
um so looking at this stuff

257
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,159
here uh we just need to grab the base

258
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
game hht

259
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,439
and look at those trees because we know

260
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,000
that the trees are busted

261
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,560
you can see we've got like a damaged

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,360
tree

263
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,359
a fall tree a dark tree a winter tree

264
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:35,199
and i'm guessing we just don't set any

265
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,199
of this stuff correctly

266
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
in the generator now like the generator

267
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,639
probably just

268
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,639
doesn't do that um

269
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,198
somewhere here somebody is setting tree

270
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,639
to something

271
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,639
and we have no idea who it is

272
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,959
so let's see

273
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
um

274
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,519
this is all debug stuff which we don't

275
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,360
care about

276
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
it looks like this is the thing that

277
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,800
adds the tree

278
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,560
um i don't see anything else so it looks

279
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:21,039
like this

280
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:24,000
so here we're like adding trees

281
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,000
get tree tags

282
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,198
and

283
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:35,120
yeah that that's totally wrong i think

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,799
because there's no actual tree in here

285
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,480
right so i i assume

286
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,559
we would have to at least put the tree

287
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,720
thing in there

288
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,958
i mean i could be wrong but let's find

289
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,959
out

290
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,679
uh what did we why do we have oh right

291
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,278
it's this okay

292
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,958
so i think that's all we would need to

293
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,399
do is just put tree because it looks

294
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,278
like we have damaged tree

295
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,039
dark and winter and so in get tree tags

296
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:06,078
we really just need to make sure that

297
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:09,360
before we pick one of those

298
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:13,838
we put in a tag tree i think that's it

299
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,839
um but i don't know so let's take a look

300
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,320
yeah so so i think that was it because

301
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,320
like there's trees now

302
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,839
um it does look like we're

303
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,680
we're grabbing some trees that are not

304
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,839
what we would expect like we're grabbing

305
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,638
some non-winter trees which i don't know

306
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,680
maybe we were expecting um also they're

307
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,320
tiny which

308
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,319
may just be um

309
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:50,399
that may just be some kind of an

310
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,399
artifact

311
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,759
of

312
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,759
of settings i'm i'm not sure about that

313
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,278
like is that just the scale

314
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,759
it is so so i think that's just because

315
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,199
maybe we weren't using these trees

316
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,000
before

317
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:18,958
so it may just be like that this scale

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,958
needs to be changed to something higher

319
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
um

320
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:37,838
so like like that

321
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,759
i don't know so you can see these are 2

322
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,600
4 8 43 22.

323
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,039
so i don't know if they should be

324
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
similar like like i don't really know

325
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,240
how these should be situated i guess i

326
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,479
should probably go in here and actually

327
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,480
look

328
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
i mean that kind of seems right i don't

329
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,798
know it's

330
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,798
kind of tough to tell i should probably

331
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,599
have something that turns off foliage

332
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,038
just so it's a little easier to see but

333
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,719
yeah i mean it just looks like

334
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,160
these were just never configured is

335
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,838
really the only problem

336
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
it looks like otherwise they're fine

337
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,720
all right i'm satisfied with that for

338
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
now

339
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
so let's see if we restart the game if

340
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,639
now we've got proper trees looks like we

341
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,640
do

342
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,720
all right

343
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,798
so that seems fine i do feel like these

344
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,360
are not quite aligned properly so let me

345
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,400
just

346
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:07,839
let me just fix those a little bit more

347
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,679
um it looks like they kind of need to be

348
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,678
more like that

349
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,839
just to be consistent

350
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:29,839
i think i mean again pretty hard to say

351
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,839
that seems about right though

352
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:44,558
all right

353
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,558
okay

354
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,640
so i think at this point we

355
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,759
are mostly done

356
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,880
with any tag stuff we needed to do

357
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,038
and we really now

358
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
just need a way to figure out our

359
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:08,480
lighting bug i think

360
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,719
um and i guess i would say the

361
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,519
biggest issue we're going to have here

362
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,640
is just the

363
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:17,839
lack of ability to provoke this bug

364
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
it would be really nice

365
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,159
if we could find some way to make it

366
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,280
happen reliably

367
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,000
right um so it would be really nice if

368
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:33,200
we could do

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,240
something that would you know

370
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,840
cause it to to

371
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:43,359
cause it to screw up the lighting in

372
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,319
in some way that we knew we could make

373
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:49,439
it happen and

374
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,439
i sort of was doing this before that's

375
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,599
weird

376
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,759
but it just seems like we've got some

377
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,439
weird stuff that got introduced

378
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:02,798
so i don't know

379
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,519
um yeah like what is going on there

380
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,400
right that

381
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,839
that also kind of seems like a bug like

382
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,919
a lighting style like

383
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,158
nan ish sort of thing to me like it just

384
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,400
seems like stuff's a little bit weird

385
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:21,840
um and then it fixed itself right

386
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,840
it's weird

387
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:35,840
very disturbing

388
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,480
hmm so how do i want to go about finding

389
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,200
this

390
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,200
i suppose

391
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,359
so we sort of have one thing that we

392
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,839
already can do

393
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,839
which is we're looking at

394
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,879
we already have the thing that does the

395
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,440
like show

396
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,000
us you know show us the out of bounds

397
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
values

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
right because we have the thing yeah

399
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,919
like why did that

400
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
make it happen

401
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,039
super annoying

402
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
so we already have the thing that like

403
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,000
does

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,600
the that shows the um the spec valid and

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,919
diffuse valid

406
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:57,759
which looks like it correlates um

407
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,640
with it a little bit but you can see

408
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,640
like here when we do that the spec valid

409
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
becomes invalid temporarily and then

410
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,159
becomes valid again

411
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,480
which is so weird like that would mean

412
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,000
that there are some very large values

413
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:16,880
somewhere in our lighting grid you know

414
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,880
and we just don't know where they are so

415
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:27,839
like i would really love to know

416
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,320
where those values are and why you know

417
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,279
what i'm saying

418
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,678
and why it's inconsistent so why did it

419
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,960
like do that a couple times like why is

420
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,120
spec invalid right now

421
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,120
you know what i mean like where are the

422
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:53,918
invalid specular and diffuse

423
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:56,158
entries you know

424
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,159
so

425
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:10,798
here's our validator um

426
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,000
these are relatively tight bounds but

427
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,038
you know

428
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,000
even so they're pretty wild like

429
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:23,839
i don't know what the max light value is

430
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,839
at the moment

431
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,038
but i think we had something and it was

432
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,280
not that high

433
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:31,279
right

434
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,840
so max light intensity is 10.

435
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,119
so like in order to have a number over a

436
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,439
hundred

437
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,519
you would have to be like receiving

438
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,159
contributions from lots of

439
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,519
full bright lights

440
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,679
i don't know we should take a look at

441
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,158
some stuff here so is max light emission

442
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,159
a thing

443
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:07,679
yeah i don't think so

444
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,679
um

445
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,880
i'm going to go ahead and say i want to

446
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:21,038
see why we're getting these values so

447
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,720
something over a hundred just should not

448
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,960
be happening

449
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,960
um

450
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,960
let's verify that we're getting mostly

451
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,919
positive and not negative

452
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,880
so i'm gonna if zero this out and i'm

453
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,799
gonna say

454
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:43,200
that it's a valid component if c

455
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,200
is greater than or equal to like

456
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:50,558
negative 0.1 so like

457
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,320
anywhere basically like like any place

458
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,599
where we get a significant negative

459
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,918
value would invalidate the region

460
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,918
um

461
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,880
which number is says seven so we're

462
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,839
saying that there's

463
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,080
actual negative numbers there i mean am

464
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,639
i right about that like wouldn't that

465
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,798
that would have to be the case right

466
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,400
we're looping over texels

467
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:21,839
and like we're having negative 0.1

468
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,480
which is crazy so let's just see like

469
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,519
let's just go find out what the heck is

470
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,480
happening there because

471
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,639
that's nuts like are we not looping over

472
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,640
the textiles properly did nobody like

473
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,080
clear these or something so they're just

474
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,000
garbage values

475
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,439
you know like what happened because

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,919
that's just ridiculous

477
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,159
and so we kind of need to figure out

478
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
like why we're getting something that

479
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,720
happens that way

480
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,919
it just doesn't make any sense

481
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,919
i'm going to go ahead and switch to

482
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:57,839
debug

483
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
um so i just want to do

484
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:14,240
an od here

485
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:18,319
and then i just i'm gonna um

486
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,319
break when result is

487
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:26,558
negative

488
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,558
so i'm going to provide a line for

489
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,440
myself there that i can use

490
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,639
uh to break into the code so on validate

491
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,278
text component

492
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,159
uh here in the atlas code i'm just going

493
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:43,359
to go ahead and break there

494
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,360
and let's take a look um

495
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,839
that code is right here and i am going

496
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,080
to put a breakpoint

497
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:57,119
there so now when we run

498
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,000
in theory we should get a situation at

499
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,639
some point

500
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,640
where we

501
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,159
so this is good that this happened again

502
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,439
because

503
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,039
last time this happened um

504
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
george was saying that the problem was

505
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,079
because handmade hero hadn't

506
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,759
loaded the executable yet but that's

507
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,319
obviously not true

508
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,079
right so so there is some problem that's

509
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,278
going on with remedy bg

510
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,558
lately where like it can't set a break

511
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:30,880
point

512
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,879
even though like i've definitely loaded

513
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:36,319
um

514
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,558
like there's no question this is loaded

515
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,639
right i mean how could it not be loaded

516
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,200
because if it wasn't loaded like how is

517
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,200
it doing

518
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,519
i mean how it's like this this in order

519
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,240
for this to happen

520
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,599
this has to have in order for this to

521
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,200
print out a value

522
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:59,038
this code has to have ran right

523
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,840
so so it seems like it it isn't

524
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,839
or shouldn't be possible um

525
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,839
for me to be seeing what i'm seeing on

526
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,879
the screen and not actually be able to

527
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,879
set a break point here

528
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,759
that's just

529
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,120
i don't know so i'm not sure what's

530
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,080
going on

531
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,479
uh i don't know why that's happening but

532
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,960
it

533
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,480
it it comports with what i saw before

534
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,919
and so i really don't think this has

535
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,440
anything to do with not

536
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,720
having loaded yet because by the time

537
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,399
you see this on the screen

538
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,919
everything's loaded and this is

539
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,599
definitely loaded

540
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,880
right now it might be

541
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,879
something to do with like

542
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,720
when you've loaded remedy or something

543
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:51,599
like

544
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:54,120
maybe i need to restart it

545
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,278
um or something or maybe i need to

546
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,879
rebuild

547
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,119
because it doesn't like this particular

548
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,720
build but something's borked

549
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:07,199
uh and i don't know what it is

550
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,640
if i step in so if i set a break point

551
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
like can i set a breakpoint

552
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,879
at like validate atlas

553
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,839
so like that's even weirder

554
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,839
um

555
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:31,038
like

556
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:43,278
what is happening

557
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,880
is this some other handmade

558
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,880
light atlas or something

559
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,600
so something's super weird there

560
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,038
right because like

561
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:09,759
it does oh

562
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:12,798
the file is loaded twice

563
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:14,640
that that like switched files did you

564
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:18,798
see that george

565
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:22,000
something's really weird about that

566
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,200
i have handmade light atlas twice

567
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,240
up there right so it's just loaded

568
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,240
multiple times

569
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:37,679
it could very well be that it's not

570
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:40,960
disambiguating the file names

571
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,720
it could very well be why

572
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,079
wouldn't it always load from the

573
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,200
substitute drive though

574
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,199
i don't know

575
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,320
but yeah you're gonna have to

576
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,399
disambiguate those names for sure

577
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,398
right um

578
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,079
like you gotta call the like canonical

579
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,559
the name canonical

580
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:05,839
random crap in windows but why

581
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,558
we should have been having this problem

582
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,240
a lot maybe this is because of something

583
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,158
they changed in the pdb

584
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,200
is why it's happening now because that

585
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,840
that would have been happening to us the

586
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,840
whole time it's never happened before

587
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,839
right

588
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,319
that's great that we got to the bottom

589
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,320
of that though

590
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,240
how can i find out the full path copy

591
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,240
full path

592
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,919
yeah so that's busted

593
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,038
where is that coming from is that

594
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,360
because the pdb

595
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,359
is now baking sea colon in there

596
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,038
i wonder if like the if microsoft

597
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,079
changed the way they're building the

598
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,200
pdbs to

599
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:55,519
now use a canonicalized non-substitute

600
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,519
name

601
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,880
so if that's the case

602
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,479
that's almost certainly what's going on

603
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,200
then they probably did that

604
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,159
and if that's the case it means that if

605
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,038
i close

606
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,640
all of these tabs so they're all gone

607
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,038
right

608
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,840
then i should never i should quote

609
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,158
unquote

610
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,480
never have this problem if i don't load

611
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,120
a file myself

612
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,558
right because it will always pick the c

613
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,038
colon one

614
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,639
here because that will be the only thing

615
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,079
that's in the pdb

616
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,120
so we should be able to work around this

617
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:36,879
problem for now by just getting rid

618
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:39,599
of all of my files and now in theory

619
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
right all of the files will always come

620
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,678
from c

621
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,519
colon but now that i've done that we can

622
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,600
now watch as well and see

623
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:50,159
i bet that is what um

624
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,678
i bet that's exactly what microsoft did

625
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,278
it's the kind of thing they would do and

626
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,798
not tell anyone because they didn't know

627
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,319
they did it like because they don't

628
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,398
even know how to program windows so they

629
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,839
probably just changed which stupid

630
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,678
c-sharp thing they call from in the

631
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,639
middle of their compiler like 50

632
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,080
000 stack entries deep and then forgot

633
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
that that thing will canonicalize the

634
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:08,639
file

635
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,799
or something right that's probably what

636
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,440
happened anyway it doesn't matter

637
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,440
i think we've got it now so that's good

638
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,640
okay um so let's take a look we're

639
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,159
probably going to have to

640
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,399
try to provoke this bug a little bit

641
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,120
here but we just need to find a case

642
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,158
where it's not

643
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:31,199
valid um or hope that we had a case

644
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,240
where it's not valid uh but you know who

645
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,798
knows

646
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,000
so uh yeah of course unfortunately it's

647
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,839
doesn't seem to be hitting that

648
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,440
particular case and

649
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,519
uh and like now our spec valid and

650
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,798
diffuse valid are

651
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,038
are never triggering um but

652
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:54,398
you know this is this is par for the

653
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,398
course with the heisenberg

654
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,639
and one thing that i will say as well

655
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,480
that makes me like

656
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:09,200
extremely unhappy

657
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,199
about this um

658
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:20,719
one thing that makes me upset is i don't

659
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,760
actually know that this isn't some weird

660
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,158
release mode only thing

661
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,159
so

662
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,158
like if i'm really hoping this has

663
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,158
this is not like a microsoft compiler

664
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,519
thing

665
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,039
if this turns out to be a microsoft

666
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,039
compiler thing i'm going to be so

667
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:49,838
unhappy

668
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,920
but like we were seeing those spec valid

669
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,239
and diffuse valid things

670
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,960
were like wrong all the time in release

671
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,239
mode

672
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,039
like you didn't really have to do

673
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:17,838
anything to make them

674
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:17,838
go wonky um

675
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,359
xx the big info or whatever uh we

676
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,480
we don't actually have any um

677
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,078
different we we have fpfast in both now

678
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,719
it may be that when you have od

679
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:48,560
on it just doesn't do it um

680
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,519
but either way i mean most of our

681
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:54,559
lighting code is

682
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:56,639
cmd so like there is no

683
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,000
i don't even know what fpfast would even

684
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,118
really be doing

685
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,880
all that that's all that interesting um

686
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,519
which is not to say that it might not be

687
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,480
the case

688
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,480
i just don't know

689
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
is this guy gonna hop left forever

690
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,519
whoa

691
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,838
how did i pick up an what is happening

692
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:41,838
how did i gather this little dude

693
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,838
that's pretty impressive

694
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,000
so how did i end up doing this what is

695
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,639
causing that i'm very interested to know

696
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,838
now so

697
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:08,400
since we're in debug mode we should be

698
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:12,320
able to look at how we were able to

699
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,280
acquire this uh

700
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,559
skull friend i don't know what you want

701
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,800
to call that

702
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,679
but we definitely have acquired a skull

703
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,720
friend

704
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:25,598
right skullfriend is like

705
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,239
on is is like attached to us it's like

706
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,000
the skull friend is attached to our hat

707
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:33,919
currently right so if you look

708
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,358
it it looks like the skull friend is

709
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,838
literally like on

710
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:37,838
our hat

711
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,839
there's nothing particularly weird about

712
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,838
it it's just a skull friend

713
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:18,639
and somehow it's attached to our hat

714
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:20,640
let's take a look in the brain code

715
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,639
so i can't open a file right because

716
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,078
that'll open the wrong one so i need to

717
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,239
just look in here and then set the

718
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,560
breakpoint via name

719
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,838
so if i go in here and just do execute

720
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,599
brain

721
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,358
um

722
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,000
i'll just set one there so that we can

723
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,000
load the file

724
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:46,559
yeah so i'll look inside execute brain

725
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,800
and i'll just stop um

726
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,960
on the on the snake ones because i'm

727
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,280
pretty sure

728
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,639
i'm pretty sure these are all gonna be

729
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,680
brain snake

730
00:38:54,639 --> 00:39:01,118
right um and

731
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:04,159
hopefully we should be able to see like

732
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:09,039
the snake parts

733
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,039
somehow um

734
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,839
i guess the problem is we don't know

735
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:16,400
really which one we're looking at

736
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:16,400
somehow

737
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,599
one of these got like attached

738
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,599
to the hero

739
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,039
and i suppose it could be well trying to

740
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:57,838
think if there's any way it could

741
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:57,838
be the hero controller controlling it

742
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,039
i mean you would think it would kind of

743
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,199
have to be because if the

744
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,159
it would have have to be disconnected

745
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:13,598
from this brain

746
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:13,598
now actually so really i guess

747
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,318
it would have to go through here

748
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:25,838
wouldn't it

749
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,838
so let's take a look at that

750
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:39,839
and let me take a look at head

751
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,318
head body glove

752
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,079
so here there's there's really only just

753
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,839
these three

754
00:40:52,079 --> 00:41:07,839
and nothing else that comes through this

755
00:40:53,838 --> 00:41:07,838
routine ever

756
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:20,879
this is a puzzler i don't even know

757
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,519
if i can think of how it would be able

758
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,519
to do that

759
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,639
like it's hopping along with me

760
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:54,880
right

761
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:54,880
it's actually leading me it's leading me

762
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,760
like it's got like the place where

763
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,559
like when my head goes in that direction

764
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,040
its

765
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,400
head goes all the way over there and

766
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:17,838
then it actually does

767
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,838
a jump

768
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:28,239
that's really amazing i

769
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:31,838
literally can't think of how we're able

770
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:31,838
to do that

771
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:58,639
it even takes the it even

772
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:13,838
picks the correct facing direction

773
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:13,838
for the skull

774
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,160
i'm sure this is just a case of the fact

775
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,599
that like i haven't

776
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,838
programmed on this game in a really long

777
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,960
time uh because we were away for a bit

778
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,199
and we were doing

779
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,639
like lighting for a really long time so

780
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:30,799
i'm sure it's just a case of like

781
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,679
if i my brain was more up to speed on

782
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,720
the entity system

783
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,480
it can't be as amazing as it seems

784
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,318
but it almost looks like someone added a

785
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,199
bunch of code to do this

786
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,559
on purpose because if we if you asked me

787
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,719
to do this if you're like

788
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,400
oh can you attach a skull to the

789
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:48,799
person's head

790
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,480
that like hops along but not not

791
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,839
directly attached to the head it kind of

792
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,519
just does its own hop

793
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,078
right and it follows it and all that i'd

794
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,800
be like oh

795
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,760
okay well we're we're gonna have to add

796
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,280
right we're

797
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,319
like i would i would have said we would

798
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,319
we would have to add

799
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:09,838
um

800
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,318
wait a minute

801
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:31,279
maybe not okay so let's

802
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:33,679
see here add player

803
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,680
so

804
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,720
does it always do

805
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:51,838
aha yes

806
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,838
i think i see what's going on now

807
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:05,838
hmm

808
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:20,800
okay so

809
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:24,719
maybe maybe

810
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,720
what happened here is that somehow

811
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,639
and this is not really a solution to how

812
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,078
the bug started but it's at least a

813
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:34,879
solution to how the bug

814
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:38,480
is happening i forgot that we don't

815
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:42,000
currently actually use the head

816
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,440
the head is just a piece

817
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,480
that's placed on

818
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,960
the body you can see that here

819
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:56,480
right so the entity for the body

820
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,720
is actually just has both of the

821
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,679
has all the has all the assets placed on

822
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:01,919
it right

823
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,199
so there's the glove entity and that has

824
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,838
a glove asset

825
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,719
that we're drawn where it is and then

826
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,838
there's the

827
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,598
body entity and that has the body the

828
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,838
head and the hat

829
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,838
like all of those are all on there

830
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:24,239
so the head actually doesn't normally

831
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:29,440
have anything associated with it

832
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:33,039
actually actually

833
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,240
so did it somehow get

834
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:39,759
a piece associated with it magically

835
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:42,799
so let's look at that first

836
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,280
so if i reset this breakpoint inside

837
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,599
here

838
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,519
we should be able to look at the head

839
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,519
and see if now it actually has

840
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:00,318
yes

841
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,318
so that's what happened

842
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,720
that's that's what actually happened

843
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,519
so normally the head would have

844
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,679
no pieces associated with it and somehow

845
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:21,599
it ended up getting the pieces

846
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,598
for a skull thing

847
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:25,838
right

848
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:46,079
so presumably this is a case of the

849
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,800
code not like it could just be a case of

850
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,760
the code

851
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,079
not initializing something properly so

852
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,040
like when an entity got unpacked it

853
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:59,119
didn't like clear it

854
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:02,960
or something so let's

855
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:06,000
before we kill this because you know

856
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,720
i don't actually know that we've quite

857
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,719
tracked it down

858
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:21,838
but when we unpack an entity

859
00:48:49,519 --> 00:49:02,800
so you can see like we've got all this

860
00:48:52,239 --> 00:49:07,199
stuff that we do

861
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,519
um didn't we just have a function called

862
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,719
fill

863
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:13,759
unpacked entity so why can't i find that

864
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:17,838
fill unpacked entity

865
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,839
here we go um

866
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:38,078
so you can see here where we do

867
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:41,680
our copy and clear we

868
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,680
we grab the entity data

869
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:51,039
that we were unpacking

870
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,039
we clear the part that

871
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:03,440
um

872
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,440
we clear the part that that is not saved

873
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:13,838
what does register entity do

874
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,280
so i want to see what happens in acquire

875
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:09,199
unpacked entity slot

876
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,280
so if you retrieve

877
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,719
one of these you're assuming you're

878
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,359
going to romp over the whole thing which

879
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,959
i think

880
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,960
is going to happen

881
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,880
my guess is

882
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,598
that that couldn't possibly produce the

883
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,599
overall problem the

884
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:37,838
the part where we need to allocate a new

885
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:37,838
world chunk

886
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:56,480
so yeah like this part here

887
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,160
i'm a little nervous about so when we

888
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,280
get a world chunk

889
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,318
do we actually clear that out before we

890
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,920
provide it back

891
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:08,159
because that may just be it

892
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,159
right

893
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,838
like this used chunk space thing

894
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:43,280
i'm going to go ahead and say that

895
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,280
is the problem so

896
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:51,119
it looks like in here we don't actually

897
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,000
clear this out when we go to make a new

898
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,119
entity

899
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,639
right so if we're going to

900
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,880
create a new entity into this

901
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:04,318
chunk it doesn't look like we ever clear

902
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:08,000
it which would be a bug

903
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:10,239
you know what i'm saying my

904
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,679
question is where does that actually

905
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:15,838
happen

906
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,838
and let's just see

907
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,838
now we do

908
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:33,280
so it looks like we do always clear it i

909
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,639
mean that's gonna clear that whole piece

910
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,880
of memory

911
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,879
right

912
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,358
so if every time we create an entity we

913
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,680
clear it

914
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:52,400
when we do the copy we copy so

915
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:57,838
that's gonna romp the whole thing with

916
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,838
valid stuff

917
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,159
so i guess i don't know what are some

918
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,280
clues

919
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,920
we could look for here that would tell

920
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,839
us

921
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,838
how this happened

922
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:39,920
you

923
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,118
i'm a little bit interested to know

924
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,599
so all that would have like literally

925
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,118
the only thing that would have to happen

926
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,680
is that brain ideas

927
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,280
brain id's value would get set to one

928
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,159
because the rest of this stuff

929
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:19,200
is already right like even just a

930
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,598
cleared entity would have these set

931
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:23,919
so it's it's only this that's actually a

932
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,920
thing

933
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:35,838
right

934
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,039
that all seems unremarkable because this

935
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,798
is just

936
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:50,159
it's setting things like the color and

937
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:52,480
you know in the dimension so on

938
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:54,719
so the things that are set to dim 1.5

939
00:55:52,480 --> 00:56:03,760
like this has to and with piece count 2

940
00:55:54,719 --> 00:56:09,598
i assume that has to be the snake

941
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,599
so like i'm guessing that if we look

942
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,838
we would see

943
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:34,319
no no

944
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,798
so we would see in here like the snake

945
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,318
would be

946
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,318
like a one point

947
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,838
five kind of a thing yeah

948
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:13,838
so add brain

949
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:16,798
that

950
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,240
aha

951
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,358
so now we may be getting

952
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:29,358
somewhere

953
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,119
aha

954
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,318
yeah okay this is just this is just a

955
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:45,598
case of me not remembering

956
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,599
what we did right

957
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:56,639
so here's what actually happened

958
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,639
right

959
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:09,838
yeah everyone sees it now right

960
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,039
y'all see it

961
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:25,440
does does the chat i'm looking at the

962
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,358
chat window

963
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,079
do you see the bug do you know what the

964
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:30,078
bug is now

965
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,599
i mean i can still be wrong we haven't

966
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,838
actually gone and like

967
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,838
looked at it but

968
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,000
no one's gonna answer no one's gonna

969
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,000
raise their hand

970
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,880
okay class who wants to tell me what the

971
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,719
bug is

972
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,000
you have enough information to know what

973
00:58:52,719 --> 00:59:05,838
the bug is now

974
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:05,838
unless i'm wrong which i could be

975
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,679
floor is lava like raised is that you

976
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,680
raising your hand

977
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:21,920
enemy panda you were on reddit

978
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:25,119
how are you gonna find a bug on reddit

979
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,119
the whole thing is a bug

980
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,039
enemy panda do you have diamond hands

981
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:31,039
that's my question

982
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,359
are you making crazy money on stonks

983
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:51,039
yeah somebody took my names got it

984
00:59:47,679 --> 01:00:01,838
and you've got it

985
00:59:51,039 --> 01:00:01,838
only backwards

986
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,280
all right so the problem is we have this

987
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,960
concept of a reserved brain id here but

988
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,760
it looks like at some point

989
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,000
we just got rid of it because add brain

990
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,680
is

991
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,679
like not using that

992
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:26,240
right so as a result

993
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:29,280
it means like that so this this

994
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:31,759
we we i think we were just trying to be

995
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,400
saucy and we were like oh we can have

996
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,200
our brain

997
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,680
ids just use this because since

998
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:41,039
everything goes through a hash table

999
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,159
it doesn't matter right but the problem

1000
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:46,000
is we had

1001
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:49,519
used uh an allocation scheme for brains

1002
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,358
for heroes here where rather than

1003
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:54,480
calling ad brain

1004
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:58,400
we just used like

1005
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:01,519
and i don't actually know why

1006
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,920
um like i don't know why this doesn't

1007
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,719
call

1008
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,318
ad brain or why we had reserved brains

1009
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:09,358
in the first place

1010
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,079
there may have been a reason it may be

1011
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:12,480
that that reason

1012
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:16,400
is gone in which case we could fix this

1013
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,400
bug by just calling add brain

1014
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:28,078
um

1015
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:32,318
so i really don't know

1016
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:33,359
i want to see if anyone ever uses that

1017
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:39,838
reserved brain

1018
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:39,838
id stuff at all

1019
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:53,838
what was it called

1020
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:09,679
so it looks like the reason we were

1021
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,680
using that

1022
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,640
is because when controller input comes

1023
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,640
in

1024
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:22,318
we needed a way of figuring out

1025
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,318
what controller it was

1026
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:35,679
right um

1027
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:38,078
so it looks like

1028
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:39,199
it looks like the reason for this is

1029
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,440
just to have

1030
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:44,480
a way of knowing what controller would

1031
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,480
control which brain

1032
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,798
and that seems okay i guess

1033
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,400
i don't think there's a reason why we

1034
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:55,920
wouldn't do that

1035
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,838
so i think that just means like when we

1036
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,519
create a world

1037
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:05,199
we probably should just make the last

1038
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:17,838
use entity be the oh

1039
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:17,838
which we did

1040
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,359
where is where is that at

1041
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:31,838
reserved brain id there it is

1042
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:45,838
so we actually did do that

1043
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:58,798
so somehow the bug is not quite that

1044
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:01,358
somehow even though we aren't picking

1045
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,079
any of the reserved brain ids or we

1046
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,679
shouldn't be

1047
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:07,920
anyway picking the reserved brain ids

1048
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,919
right

1049
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:12,480
somehow we still ended up with the

1050
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:16,319
correct brain id

1051
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:19,039
in here right

1052
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:21,679
somehow we still end up with that so i

1053
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,680
take it back

1054
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,838
this

1055
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:37,759
is not coming from here

1056
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:40,400
presumably i mean

1057
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,839
we don't we don't know for sure right

1058
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,880
but presumably

1059
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:44,880
this is not coming

1060
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,599
it's not coming from last used entity

1061
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:57,359
storage index

1062
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:09,838
no there's still a bug chat you're not

1063
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:09,838
off the hook here

1064
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:17,920
you so you still have you still have to

1065
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:21,199
find the bug

1066
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,000
just because it's not that bug

1067
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:25,919
so i think we probably want to double

1068
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,318
check that this is true

1069
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:37,838
um so i'm not sure we

1070
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:37,838
actually want to do that yet but

1071
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,798
we do need some other coherent

1072
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,838
explanation for why

1073
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:51,519
we were able to put pieces into this

1074
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:55,679
thing that has a brain idea value of one

1075
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:58,159
right and furthermore

1076
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,838
there should be more than one thing

1077
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:03,038
going into that slot

1078
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:05,599
at this point as well because like

1079
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,720
or this got overwritten either because

1080
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:10,480
there would have

1081
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:12,318
also been an entity for the head

1082
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,240
so the only two things that could have

1083
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,318
happened are the entity for the head

1084
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:17,439
had its pieces overwritten with snake

1085
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,798
pieces

1086
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:25,119
right um

1087
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:28,000
or there are two and it replaced the one

1088
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:30,838
that would normally have a brain slot so

1089
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,719
what i'm kind of interested in knowing

1090
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:38,480
here um is in like handmade

1091
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:47,838
uh world mode where it does the brain

1092
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:47,838
unpacking part um

1093
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:01,838
i guess i don't know exactly where

1094
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,838
that's happening

1095
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,200
so right here

1096
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:17,358
this

1097
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:20,000
so in here we don't

1098
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,558
check to see if there was already

1099
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:29,838
something

1100
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:29,839
in this slot right

1101
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,198
so i guess what i would say is this

1102
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,198
looks like

1103
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:26,319
this looks like something that could

1104
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:30,960
also be part of the problem right

1105
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:34,719
so we could be doing something

1106
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:38,000
where we are getting a brain

1107
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:40,239
and we don't actually

1108
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,439
and we yeah like if if the part where

1109
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:44,318
the brain gets

1110
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:44,318
gets created

1111
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:52,319
if the part where the brain gets created

1112
01:08:48,640 --> 01:09:07,838
is like not

1113
01:08:52,319 --> 01:09:07,839
working correctly so here's us checking

1114
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:15,359
here's us checking for brain hash slots

1115
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:18,719
right get hash from id we pass

1116
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:22,400
in an id value there we

1117
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:25,600
use whatever the storage index

1118
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:29,838
dot value is for the brain we loop

1119
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:35,838
through the brain hash

1120
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:35,838
by probing linearly

1121
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,838
this does not seem like very good code

1122
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,039
i i would just like to say that i don't

1123
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:07,840
think this code is very good

1124
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,719
um so i would say that this is a bit of

1125
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,880
an issue

1126
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:14,480
uh so if we take a look at the sim

1127
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:19,199
region

1128
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:19,198
you can see the brain hash in here right

1129
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,840
um

1130
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:39,439
and we're linear probing the brain hash

1131
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,840
i'm assuming we clear it every time

1132
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,920
yep so we clear it every time

1133
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:56,079
and then we go through here and we just

1134
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:59,199
linearly probe the brain hash

1135
01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:03,119
to find one that we can use

1136
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:03,119
and you know

1137
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,000
essentially what we do is we say if

1138
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,920
there was nothing here we'll use

1139
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,439
it if there was something here and it

1140
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,359
happens to be the one we're looking for

1141
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:24,639
well we'll use that as well

1142
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,639
right and then that's it

1143
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,400
we then say okay we will assume that we

1144
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,719
got this thing

1145
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:32,719
um

1146
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:43,840
i'm not quite sure what this is about so

1147
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:44,238
this is just saying look if there wasn't

1148
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:55,840
any

1149
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:55,839
a brain in there

1150
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,239
then we use one that's in here

1151
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:23,840
sorry no we use one that's in here

1152
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,079
and this is just a bit over complicated

1153
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,678
at this point as well but i guess the

1154
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:43,519
reason we did this is so it would be

1155
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,760
faster to clear it

1156
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,760
right

1157
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,639
so we use one that's in here and we just

1158
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:54,399
record that fact into the brain hash so

1159
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:57,360
that it'll be looked up again

1160
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:58,319
that's basically it and we do the mark

1161
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:00,960
occupied

1162
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:00,960
on that hash

1163
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,840
um

1164
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:24,000
so i'm not horribly offended by this

1165
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:25,279
it just seems like over complicated at

1166
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,399
this point because i think it's gone

1167
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:31,039
through enough iterations that's like

1168
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:32,079
there's it it really could be much more

1169
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:35,920
straightforward

1170
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:38,719
than it is now um but i don't see any

1171
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,079
obvious problems with it yet it gets

1172
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,679
cleared every time and then the brains

1173
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:42,640
are assembled so in theory that should

1174
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,719
have been okay

1175
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,760
and also even if it wasn't okay it

1176
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,760
wouldn't explain why

1177
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,640
we were able to get an entity that had

1178
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:55,840
the right brain id

1179
01:13:52,640 --> 01:14:01,840
and the different pieces there

1180
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,840
so if we go look for snake again

1181
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:15,840
from metal gear solid

1182
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,840
um

1183
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:53,359
so there's a couple different things

1184
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:55,840
here so

1185
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:57,679
i'm also wondering because we know that

1186
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,400
our transactional occupy thing

1187
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,760
like our is occupied thing we broke

1188
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:03,359
right

1189
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,079
um and that was kind of on our list to

1190
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,719
go things like our list of things to go

1191
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,640
fix and it's a bit weird right that

1192
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:13,679
that's happening

1193
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,880
so we kind of want to know what's up

1194
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,279
with that

1195
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,279
and

1196
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:23,599
i do wonder if there's any way inside

1197
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:25,198
that that you can have something weird

1198
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,199
happen i still don't know how you end up

1199
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,399
with an entity that has this value for

1200
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:30,319
the brain though

1201
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,479
that's the reason why i thought we had

1202
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,158
the bug because it seems like

1203
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,158
the only way that should really happen

1204
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:37,198
is if you called add snake and the add

1205
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:40,319
brain call

1206
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:53,839
for the brain id right

1207
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:53,840
gave you back a one

1208
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:02,559
one thing that's a little odd is why t

1209
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,559
bob

1210
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,600
and dt bob have floatmen so do we do

1211
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:12,159
that

1212
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:18,079
anywhere uh

1213
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:18,079
so that would be f32 min or r32 min

1214
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,840
right

1215
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,960
hmm

1216
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:33,359
so how did that get set to

1217
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:36,238
floatmen i don't even see floatmen on

1218
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,079
here actually because float min

1219
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:40,718
float min is actually a different thing

1220
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:43,039
it's the smallest possible value

1221
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,880
representable by a float which we don't

1222
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:47,359
really have

1223
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,840
so like how did these get set to those

1224
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:49,839
values

1225
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,520
because that doesn't make a lot of sense

1226
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,519
either right

1227
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,960
i want to look and see i would like to

1228
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,479
know

1229
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:25,520
if other what what other

1230
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:25,519
parts here have that yeah so

1231
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:45,840
nobody else has that

1232
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:45,840
so that seems really suspicious as well

1233
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,119
that's just really weird i i don't know

1234
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:59,840
why it has

1235
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:59,840
those strange values for ddt bob

1236
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,920
you

1237
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:09,839
so how many people have hit point max

1238
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:17,440
so in init hit points it is set

1239
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:18,319
and it looks like that is the only place

1240
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:20,719
where it is set

1241
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:21,840
so in theory the only people who can

1242
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:25,679
have this be true

1243
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:28,719
are people who have init hit points

1244
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:31,119
called on them so who has that there's

1245
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:34,880
the function itself

1246
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:39,119
here is the snake call

1247
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:41,119
and here is the monstar call right

1248
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,158
and we know it's not gonna be monster

1249
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:46,880
okay

1250
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:50,158
so we don't call this on anybody else

1251
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:54,079
so we know for sure that this

1252
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:57,759
is a snake head

1253
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:57,760
like that's definitely true

1254
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:03,199
because not only does it have the pieces

1255
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,639
from the snakehead

1256
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:08,319
but it also has the hit point max from

1257
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:11,440
the snakehead

1258
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,799
so there's only two possible things that

1259
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:16,799
could have happened

1260
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:20,079
one is that somehow we called

1261
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,800
adds we we executed the add snakehead

1262
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,840
stuff

1263
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:28,079
and when it went to fill in the brain id

1264
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:31,199
it filled in a one erroneously

1265
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:34,559
or somehow we took a snakehead

1266
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:38,479
that had the brain id value associated

1267
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,480
with it filled out properly

1268
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:45,439
but then we overrode it somehow so like

1269
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,960
we

1270
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:52,319
corrupted the value somehow

1271
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:57,198
again it i literally can't think of how

1272
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:59,198
something that precise would happen

1273
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:01,198
because it's not like it wrote garbage

1274
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:03,039
over the whole thing

1275
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:04,399
it literally would have had to have

1276
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:15,840
pinpointed that

1277
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:15,839
you know what i mean

1278
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,319
and i don't see anything weird going on

1279
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,879
here like it seems like the add brain

1280
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:42,000
function

1281
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,359
is very straightforward it seems like it

1282
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,319
would do

1283
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:46,319
what you would expect

1284
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:52,719
i don't really want to kill this

1285
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,399
run of the game but i think i'm going to

1286
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:58,639
have to and i also

1287
01:21:54,399 --> 01:22:04,799
want to know if i can reproduce this

1288
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:04,800
so i'm going to try a couple things

1289
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:15,198
first things first yeah

1290
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:17,519
um i'm gonna snap step into all

1291
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:19,359
calls to add snake and i want to see

1292
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:24,400
what all of the snakes

1293
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:26,319
get for their brain id uh

1294
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:39,839
because first let's just check to see

1295
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:39,840
what happens

1296
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,760
all right so nothing particularly

1297
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:53,039
strange happening there

1298
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:55,360
let me just make sure

1299
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:55,359
um

1300
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:07,840
and let's look at how it is set

1301
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:21,840
okay um

1302
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,920
so i don't see any

1303
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:35,198
an initial way that this could possibly

1304
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,359
have set the brain id

1305
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:39,359
to something else right

1306
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,679
so that seems pretty straightforward

1307
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,560
so we had to have called this and then

1308
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,920
we have to

1309
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:54,719
somehow be overwriting the brain id

1310
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,440
part of it incorrectly like the copy

1311
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,960
doesn't work

1312
01:23:55,439 --> 01:24:01,519
properly or something like this

1313
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:05,198
so in the actual entity structure if we

1314
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:08,400
go look at how it lines up

1315
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:11,519
it's the first three things

1316
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:14,158
yeah um

1317
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,080
and when we do our copy inside the sim

1318
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:30,719
region like doing the unpack

1319
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:35,359
there um is it inside world

1320
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:37,760
so um there's nothing particularly weird

1321
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:40,479
about what happens here right so we do

1322
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,480
the pack

1323
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,840
um

1324
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:55,920
the copy is pretty straightforward

1325
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:55,919
there's nothing

1326
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,840
strange about it really

1327
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,560
so i don't see a lot of ways that that

1328
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:13,840
could have been

1329
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:13,840
corrupted either right

1330
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:55,840
nothing weird there i mean this is all

1331
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:55,840
really pretty straightforward

1332
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,840
and you know like in theory if we had

1333
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:06,879
something happen here like when you

1334
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,840
called add entity

1335
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,840
if it gave you back

1336
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:21,600
the entity for the head here

1337
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:24,719
so like if this call

1338
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:27,760
here somehow gave you

1339
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,399
back but you would see it immediately

1340
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,920
you wouldn't

1341
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:32,559
that would be when you first added the

1342
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,319
player so even that can't really be true

1343
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,600
right so that can't happen either

1344
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:37,119
because you'd see it immediately you

1345
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:42,159
wouldn't have to wait till you hop

1346
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:42,158
down to where the other ones were

1347
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,840
right

1348
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,840
uh

1349
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,960
this part's a little odd but again

1350
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:12,480
shouldn't really

1351
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:19,359
have anything to do with it because if

1352
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:33,839
if start was never pressed

1353
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:33,839
well i mean yeah well

1354
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:44,319
yeah i'm not sure about that part this

1355
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:46,639
seems a bit janky but again

1356
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:48,158
not sure i see what this would have to

1357
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:50,480
do with anything

1358
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:50,479
um

1359
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:01,840
like that just doesn't seem relevant

1360
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,840
anyway

1361
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,840
what is this

1362
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:43,840
the heck

1363
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:51,520
dude so wait a minute are you telling me

1364
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:55,039
right now that this isn't a bug

1365
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:59,440
this was a thing we added as a

1366
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:59,439
feature at some point just for fun

1367
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:11,440
hold on i think we may have just spent

1368
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,880
this entire time

1369
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:14,719
thinking there is a bug just because we

1370
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,639
don't work on this game very often

1371
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:19,439
it looks like we added the ability to

1372
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:22,480
like pick up a head by hitting return

1373
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:25,839
right it looks like we we've got code to

1374
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:25,839
do this

1375
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:39,840
hold on a second

1376
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,840
yep

1377
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:07,679
oops so we did that on purpose

1378
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:12,238
uh my bad

1379
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,239
so yeah that happened

1380
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:21,520
uh and you can swap them

1381
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:24,159
so i can like right

1382
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,960
so we have the ability to swap heads in

1383
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,519
the game

1384
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,198
and i just forgot that you could do that

1385
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,800
and the only reason that it wasn't

1386
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:34,559
obvious i guess

1387
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:39,440
is because when we did it

1388
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:42,320
we because we use we make the pieces

1389
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:44,559
for the head currently so like if if we

1390
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:47,679
had done

1391
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:49,360
oh man yeah this is the problem with

1392
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,000
only programming once a week on

1393
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:51,920
something

1394
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,079
after a while you forget everything you

1395
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:58,880
added

1396
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:58,880
so like if we had done this

1397
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:03,119
no wonder it was really hard to figure

1398
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,679
out why there was a bug there was no bug

1399
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:07,279
chat you're finally off the hook of

1400
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,719
course you should have told me that

1401
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:11,439
like so i don't really want to let you

1402
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,960
off the hook i feel like you should have

1403
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:14,479
you should have told me that but it's

1404
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,520
okay so

1405
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:19,759
if we had instead here oops

1406
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,199
um if instead here instead of this

1407
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,800
connect piece

1408
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:27,839
um stuff that was happening here

1409
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,960
uh so you can see the way this thing

1410
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,880
connects the body

1411
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:37,439
body piece nonsense here like headpiece

1412
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:37,440
thing uh i think

1413
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:45,599
really what we would do for that feature

1414
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:49,359
is we would have had like

1415
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:52,719
head headpiece like this

1416
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:58,319
um and then this would have added

1417
01:31:52,719 --> 01:32:01,760
uh the head onto on

1418
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:06,158
onto the head onto the the head entity

1419
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:13,840
right um

1420
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:13,839
and uh oops

1421
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:25,039
yeah uh i think i'm not sure why is that

1422
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:28,880
complaining what did i do wrong

1423
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,880
uh head headpiece

1424
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:44,799
i'm not sure why that is complaining

1425
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,800
connect piece head headpiece

1426
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:49,198
oh uh because the yeah we need to tell

1427
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:50,960
it

1428
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:52,839
yeah yeah we need to tell that that's on

1429
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:56,639
the head as well

1430
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:59,920
sorry um

1431
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:01,840
so like we can't keep moving the head

1432
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,158
way out in that direction anymore

1433
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,199
because it disaggregates from the hero

1434
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:10,638
obviously but i think

1435
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,879
that's like what

1436
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,800
we were either planning to do or used to

1437
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,440
do when we added that feature right so

1438
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,000
the head

1439
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:19,759
was was linked onto the separate entity

1440
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,840
so if you like went over here

1441
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:26,880
and like did that um you swap

1442
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:30,400
right you swap heads with whatever it is

1443
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:33,679
that that there was what you know

1444
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:35,119
whatever it is that you had um as long

1445
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,560
as it was in a radius of 10 it looked

1446
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:39,679
like it would just search

1447
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:43,199
for anything that was a head swap right

1448
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:45,520
um so that's

1449
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:46,638
actually i kind of like that i mean that

1450
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,000
seems cool

1451
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:53,440
actually i'm i am in favor of this

1452
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,439
so i think we're going to leave that in

1453
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:05,839
i like that a lot

1454
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:11,519
uh so yeah i think that's a good thing i

1455
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,800
don't i don't think i don't think we get

1456
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,960
rid of that

1457
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,199
right um i think that's something that

1458
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,119
probably stays in

1459
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:20,319
and and so i think all we really want to

1460
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:23,679
do at that point

1461
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:27,039
is the head itself

1462
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:29,920
has that sort of leaning problem

1463
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:30,840
uh that we would we would sort of want

1464
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:34,319
to

1465
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,319
fix and

1466
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,639
i guess i don't really know

1467
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:46,400
so when we look at the head you can see

1468
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:50,000
here that it kind of does a

1469
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:53,439
some computation about the

1470
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:56,719
way the head is attached there um

1471
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:57,759
and you know this is the problem i would

1472
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:01,840
assume

1473
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,840
so like

1474
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:12,000
so like probably this just needs to get

1475
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:13,520
modified by something probably

1476
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,039
i don't know let's let's go ahead and

1477
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,119
run this uh

1478
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:19,840
and we can just edit the code in real

1479
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:23,439
time till we get something that we like

1480
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,440
um so

1481
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:30,479
we also have got a z offset there which

1482
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:32,719
i don't think we necessarily want

1483
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:32,718
um

1484
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,760
i'm also not sure why does it disappear

1485
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,158
why are we getting a disappearing head

1486
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,840
on

1487
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:43,839
moving forward like that

1488
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:00,719
so

1489
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:02,399
clutch is not happening clutches is only

1490
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:04,319
was only when we were holding down the

1491
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:05,920
space bar right so that's the clutch

1492
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:09,359
thing

1493
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,920
right uh

1494
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:13,519
and that's obviously too much anyway so

1495
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,079
you know this this would be something

1496
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,280
way

1497
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:17,279
less than that um

1498
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,118
yeah so that would be the delta we would

1499
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:30,639
want so you you probably want

1500
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:33,920
like you know 0.3

1501
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:35,440
plus or something i'm not sure

1502
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,199
uh and then i'm just i just don't

1503
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:38,960
understand quite what's going on here

1504
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,439
it's like we've got some issue where

1505
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:44,800
when we're going to the left

1506
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:48,000
we we lose the head placement is

1507
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,119
is borked right um now i don't know if

1508
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,760
that's actually true

1509
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:54,719
so i just want to double check and nerf

1510
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,239
the entire expression temporarily

1511
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:57,760
because it might be it's from somewhere

1512
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:02,399
else no it's from there

1513
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:05,600
so for some reason like you can't have

1514
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:07,039
this ddp value coming through here so

1515
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,560
something's totally

1516
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:14,960
wrong with that ddp value so

1517
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:17,840
like this process

1518
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:19,118
has an issue maybe a bug with the way it

1519
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:24,000
gets normalized

1520
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:24,000
right and does it get used anywhere else

1521
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:34,879
not really so it looks like this value

1522
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,880
is kind of just

1523
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,159
busted so let's take a look at what's

1524
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,199
happening there um

1525
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:44,000
so so i think this equation then is fine

1526
01:37:41,198 --> 01:37:46,158
you know modulo a little bit of tuning

1527
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,520
we might want to do

1528
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:53,679
but it looks like the ddp value is

1529
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,320
just totally wrong also hop requested is

1530
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,000
like

1531
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:58,238
something that goes down here so we're

1532
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,679
not going to do that right now

1533
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:03,279
um so this ddp value if we look at what

1534
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:06,560
happens it's taking the con

1535
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:08,000
hero ddp which is this um

1536
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,760
it's looking for the length of that

1537
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,520
which seems fine

1538
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,520
it's looking to see how long it is if

1539
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,239
it's a particular length

1540
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:17,119
it goes ahead and does a square root and

1541
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:20,959
inverts

1542
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:22,719
that uh so it's it's just trying to get

1543
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,319
get a way to length like change the

1544
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:31,840
length back to a normal

1545
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:31,840
right um

1546
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:46,000
i have no idea why you double normalize

1547
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,920
that so so looking so what you can see

1548
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,158
here is like right we

1549
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,279
we take the length of this thing we say

1550
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:53,839
if the length of it

1551
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:54,960
is you know if it's non-zero basically

1552
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,360
we normalize it

1553
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:59,520
and then we can change ddp normal into

1554
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:02,479
an actual normal

1555
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,159
we then say if the if the length like

1556
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:07,359
the motion like the speed

1557
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:10,839
right is greater than one

1558
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:13,839
we want to normalize that as well

1559
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,840
uh

1560
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:17,759
so we compute both the normal version

1561
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:20,399
and

1562
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,079
we normalize the thing if it's greater

1563
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:24,079
than one which means we're trying to

1564
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:27,359
produce a value

1565
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:32,238
that becomes like

1566
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:32,238
one sized when it's large right

1567
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,800
i have no idea what we were doing there

1568
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:40,880
but i guess it's like

1569
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,079
you you want to look at the acceleration

1570
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,079
for the guy and

1571
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,118
like i guess we have the we allowed the

1572
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:48,079
acceleration to

1573
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:49,279
be up higher than one and if we wanted

1574
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:50,719
it lower than one then we would just

1575
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:52,158
shrink it down but if it was higher than

1576
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:53,840
one we wanted to can't

1577
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:57,439
clamp it so this is basically like a

1578
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,440
clamping function right

1579
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,599
why that would behave differently when

1580
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,559
you were moving to the left than moving

1581
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:23,840
to the right i'm not sure

1582
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:23,840
so that's a little strange um

1583
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,679
that's a little strange so all i'm gonna

1584
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,639
do here

1585
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:43,199
uh we've got this hopping right uh i'm

1586
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,400
gonna

1587
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:49,519
recompile in the problem

1588
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:52,399
which is this right here

1589
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,880
um so that we lose the head when we go

1590
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:55,839
left

1591
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:58,400
i'm going to take this out so the thing

1592
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:01,119
that normalizes the ddp

1593
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:01,118
is now gone

1594
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,960
so it looks like it has nothing to do

1595
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:08,880
with that clause so

1596
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,920
we're not hitting this or if we are it

1597
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:13,840
doesn't matter right

1598
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,840
so it literally has something to do with

1599
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:19,840
the con hero ddp

1600
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,840
like moving leftward

1601
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:26,158
which seems kind of strange because i'm

1602
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:29,759
not sure

1603
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:32,799
how that would pose a problem

1604
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,600
but evidently it does so what i'm going

1605
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,480
to do here

1606
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,520
is i'm going to try modifying this

1607
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:40,158
slightly

1608
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,960
so instead of putting ddp in this place

1609
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:45,039
i'm going to put

1610
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:47,840
conhero ddp right so i'm going to use

1611
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:47,840
direct oops

1612
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,840
so i'm going to use this value directly

1613
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:00,319
like what it gets constructed here right

1614
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,079
so that now i know i'm just using that

1615
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:03,439
value vanilla

1616
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:05,279
then i'm going to go ahead and i'm going

1617
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:05,839
to try putting in some various values

1618
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:07,359
here

1619
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,600
so for example if i look at what the

1620
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:10,559
controller actually sets the ddp value

1621
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,560
to

1622
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,239
so i can you can see here that like here

1623
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,920
here are the various values right

1624
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:17,359
so this is the one that we expect to be

1625
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,639
bad negative one

1626
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:22,799
here and zero here yeah so

1627
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:24,319
i'm assuming that now i could do that so

1628
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,440
i could just place

1629
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,719
negative one here and zero here

1630
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:32,238
and that i would just get the head

1631
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:35,840
missing all the time right

1632
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:37,519
and it is and then i would expect to be

1633
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,840
able to move it to the plus side

1634
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:42,159
and have the head reappear which also i

1635
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:45,279
can um

1636
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:57,839
so that's pretty weird right like i

1637
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:57,840
don't know why that would ever happen

1638
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:26,638
so my guess is that

1639
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:26,639
oh hold on a second i just heard a puss

1640
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:42,560
come on come on come on

1641
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,560
that's a good puss

1642
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:49,600
sorry i had to let the puss in here is

1643
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:53,840
puss

1644
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,840
this is molly bean

1645
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:05,118
this is our this is our sweet puss molly

1646
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,118
she's a very good puss she likes to

1647
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:10,239
be involved in programming activities

1648
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,520
and it is probably time for brushing

1649
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:16,238
do you want to be brushed yeah

1650
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,239
of course you do

1651
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:24,319
it's important for for good furs

1652
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:27,359
for high-end furs

1653
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:27,359
nice soft coat

1654
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:35,839
yeah that's a good puss

1655
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,840
that's a good puss

1656
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,039
okay that's a good puss

1657
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,639
that's a good place

1658
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:59,359
okay so what we've got do you want to go

1659
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:02,559
on my shoulder

1660
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:06,079
want to go on the shoulder okay

1661
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:09,199
so what we've got here is we've got

1662
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:09,198
a uh

1663
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:13,439
like presumably some kind of knock-on

1664
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:15,678
effect i'm guessing because it would

1665
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:17,919
seem a little weird if

1666
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,118
setting it to a negative one there could

1667
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:22,158
could actually cause

1668
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:25,198
this problem directly that seems

1669
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:26,158
odd i mean it's possible but it just

1670
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:29,919
doesn't seem

1671
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:30,719
all that likely um so i'm guessing that

1672
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:34,239
some

1673
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:37,760
uh unrelated value is just

1674
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:40,158
uh put into a bad like there's some kind

1675
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:42,560
of a

1676
01:45:40,158 --> 01:45:43,519
cop like a downstream computation is

1677
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:48,480
what i'm assuming

1678
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:50,800
what you're doing puss okay okay

1679
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:50,799
um

1680
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,119
i'm assuming there's like a downstream

1681
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:58,719
computation in this case

1682
01:45:55,118 --> 01:46:00,880
that has some

1683
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:02,000
when it happens to be just exactly that

1684
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:05,600
negative one

1685
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:08,960
right that that causes a problem

1686
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:11,679
we can't actually uh see happening

1687
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,279
but if we look down like if we go

1688
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,840
inspect sort of the

1689
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:16,479
the derived values that that use like

1690
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,880
head p

1691
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,238
for example which is the is the value

1692
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,279
that we're setting here

1693
01:46:20,238 --> 01:46:24,799
if we find things that are related to

1694
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:26,639
head p

1695
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,719
we may find that there's something

1696
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:31,199
obvious going wrong there

1697
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:32,319
right so you can see there are multiple

1698
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:35,678
places

1699
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:35,679
where this comes into play

1700
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:42,238
uh and so we would expect that like

1701
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,118
maybe for example this head delta value

1702
01:46:42,238 --> 01:46:46,718
here

1703
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:47,599
is a problem uh maybe the head distance

1704
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:50,719
value here

1705
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:52,840
is a problem uh

1706
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:54,719
again we just got to kind of look and

1707
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:56,400
see

1708
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:58,239
sorry i gotta reset the microphone after

1709
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:01,679
the puss the puss

1710
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:04,638
adjusts the microphone often

1711
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,639
what do you think puss

1712
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:09,839
what do you think what do you think puss

1713
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:18,479
all right so anyway uh we want to look

1714
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,000
at the head p

1715
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:21,599
here and we just want to see like what

1716
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,319
things are related to it

1717
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:25,440
so we have the head distance for example

1718
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:28,238
uh that's computed

1719
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:30,079
and the head distance does do like some

1720
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:31,599
stuff here where we we map it into a

1721
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:34,639
range and we change

1722
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:36,239
this ddt bob based on what we see so you

1723
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:37,440
know whatever this value actually is

1724
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:40,479
here

1725
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:43,198
um we we produce you know

1726
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:45,519
some kind of a clamped value from it uh

1727
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:47,519
i don't see a lot of problem there but

1728
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,760
you know what i would do now is i'd say

1729
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,920
we've got we've got this reliably

1730
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:53,600
you know in us in a state where we can

1731
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:58,319
turn the head off

1732
01:47:53,600 --> 01:48:00,239
by us by setting this negative one

1733
01:47:58,319 --> 01:48:02,799
so now let's just go and disable

1734
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:06,559
anything that could be related to that

1735
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:10,639
right so if we uh

1736
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:14,159
take head p here and we just say

1737
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:15,359
okay like this this thing this head

1738
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,799
distance

1739
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:20,319
where we set the body uh ddt well that's

1740
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,000
the body though so i don't see how that

1741
01:48:20,319 --> 01:48:26,639
could really be related but

1742
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,639
whatever we'll we'll remove it anyway

1743
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:31,519
um so this way we we know we're not

1744
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,880
setting that

1745
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:37,920
ddt bob value right

1746
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:42,000
and then i'm also going to remove

1747
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:43,760
this head delta computation

1748
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
and i'm just going to get rid of

1749
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:49,280
everything that's related to the head p

1750
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,840
at all so in here uh you can see there's

1751
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:52,079
more but

1752
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:53,920
those are outside of the the actual hero

1753
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,158
brain function

1754
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,279
so here you can see like the head has

1755
01:48:56,158 --> 01:49:00,158
returned

1756
01:48:57,279 --> 01:49:00,880
which would suggest that this head delta

1757
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:04,799
value

1758
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,800
is the problem in this case

1759
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:15,840
so i think we can put this back in

1760
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:21,599
right um and now we just have to focus

1761
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,800
on what is going on with this head delta

1762
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:24,560
value

1763
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:27,840
so in terms of where this is used it's

1764
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:31,039
literally in only two places

1765
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:33,039
and this just looks like

1766
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:34,238
nonsense so it's taking the head delta

1767
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:35,679
and it's adjusting the y so that's

1768
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:36,238
what's probably happening here is it's

1769
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:40,560
totally

1770
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:42,718
corrupting um

1771
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,599
something to do with the body's y-axis

1772
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:45,679
so that it can't

1773
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,039
place the head at the correct location

1774
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:50,960
or something like this

1775
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:54,880
right um but we'll see

1776
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:56,800
so let's leave this where it is

1777
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,719
right and say that the head delta is not

1778
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,159
going to be a thing

1779
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:01,760
it's just not going to happen at the

1780
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:04,000
moment

1781
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:06,079
uh and then we're going to go in here

1782
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:10,960
and we're going to

1783
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:13,359
uh put this this ddp value back in

1784
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,359
like so

1785
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:22,079
um and and then that solves our

1786
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:23,678
particular problem there

1787
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:25,599
and so then all we really have to do is

1788
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:28,960
go oh i see so

1789
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:32,800
probably this head delta thing

1790
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:35,920
this was trying to do some work here

1791
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:39,199
where we were attempting

1792
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:40,800
to use the actual displacement of the

1793
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:42,479
head from the body which we expected to

1794
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:46,239
be quite large

1795
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,238
right um

1796
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,840
we probably by by making it so that it

1797
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:57,039
only moves a little bit

1798
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,960
relative to the body um by putting in

1799
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:02,158
that 0.1 maybe

1800
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:02,880
uh well no it could have just it could

1801
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:04,238
be just any

1802
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,520
that anything was causing the problem so

1803
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:06,399
maybe it was the problems there the

1804
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,199
whole time

1805
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:11,839
but we know that it has some some effect

1806
01:51:09,198 --> 01:51:14,719
in here so that two head delta lines

1807
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:16,800
so i'm gonna remove this and we're gonna

1808
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:20,639
narrow it down to which line it actually

1809
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:23,760
is um so here's us moving

1810
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,760
uh and you can see

1811
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:29,439
it still happens i'm gonna get rid of

1812
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,439
the floor displace

1813
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:36,238
i'm gonna get rid of the y-axis

1814
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,158
and so it sure looks like the main

1815
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:50,000
problem anyway

1816
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:52,960
is with the body y-axis setting

1817
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,639
now why the body y-axis setting getting

1818
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:57,920
set to something different

1819
01:51:54,639 --> 01:52:00,560
would cause the head to disappear is

1820
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,760
kind of confusing because that you would

1821
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:04,960
think

1822
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:07,039
that the y-axis would do if it

1823
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:08,319
was warped enough to make the head

1824
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:11,039
disappear you would just

1825
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:12,399
expect the body to be drawn improperly

1826
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:14,158
as well

1827
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:16,079
i i mean or at least that's what i would

1828
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:18,158
have expected right

1829
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:19,118
but that's not actually what's happening

1830
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:22,238
here so

1831
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:24,799
you know we're able to get the head to

1832
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:24,799
disappear

1833
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:32,079
um with this body y-axis setting

1834
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:35,279
uh that somehow does

1835
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:35,760
not actually cause the body itself to

1836
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:38,880
warp

1837
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:42,079
very much my guess there

1838
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:45,840
is that we over we don't use the body y

1839
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:48,479
axis maybe maybe we use some other thing

1840
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,599
so that like when we draw the body it

1841
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:52,879
just doesn't

1842
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:54,880
get the it doesn't

1843
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:56,480
inside the pieces when we draw them i

1844
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,079
seem to recall we added a thing that

1845
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:00,638
allowed us to just say

1846
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:02,800
what axes you were using like do you

1847
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:04,319
want to actually use does x or not

1848
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,079
i would assume that that is what's

1849
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:09,759
happening here so this

1850
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:11,920
head delta x y bit here

1851
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:14,079
is is going to pick up whatever that

1852
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:17,920
stuff was for the y-axis

1853
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:20,800
for the body y-axis right

1854
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:22,960
so we know that if we do this where we

1855
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:25,679
just have the y-axis set to

1856
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:26,158
to nothing in particular right uh it's

1857
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:29,199
just

1858
01:53:26,158 --> 01:53:31,359
it's just regular y um

1859
01:53:29,198 --> 01:53:33,678
that we get the correct behavior and so

1860
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:34,238
the only question here was do we care

1861
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:35,920
about

1862
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:37,759
the other part now since we don't seem

1863
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:39,359
to even use it i would say we can

1864
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,599
probably just get rid of this

1865
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:43,439
um i don't know what florida's place

1866
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:45,199
does anymore because again it's been so

1867
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:46,879
long since we've looked at this code

1868
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:49,359
it was kind of mostly just stuff we

1869
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:52,000
threw in there for placeholder anyway

1870
01:53:49,359 --> 01:53:52,960
but if you look at florida's place it

1871
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,039
looks like that's

1872
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:56,639
mostly there just to figure out if you

1873
01:53:55,039 --> 01:53:59,920
wanted to like make the thing

1874
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:03,599
bob with the head bob right um

1875
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:05,199
so i think that's fine as it is probably

1876
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:07,279
so i think that's all we really need to

1877
01:54:05,198 --> 01:54:08,319
do and now we have our swappable heads

1878
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:12,158
back

1879
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:12,158
uh which seems good right

1880
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:17,039
okay um so everything seems to be

1881
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:19,598
working here the hero can hop in

1882
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:21,039
have a little visit with one of the

1883
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:26,000
orphans

1884
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:26,000
we can go back down the stairs

1885
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:37,839
uh we can steal ahead

1886
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:53,920
and go back and have a conversation

1887
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:53,920
and it's all fine

1888
01:54:54,399 --> 01:55:05,839
all right

1889
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:16,639
all right so we still have the lighting

1890
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:19,359
bug to look at for

1891
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:20,000
so we're not quite done yet but at least

1892
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:23,359
we're a little

1893
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,039
closer um i think we've got all the tag

1894
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:26,880
stuff done

1895
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:29,439
so we're really just looking at lighting

1896
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:33,840
now we can do a brief q a

1897
01:55:29,439 --> 01:55:33,839
before we stop

1898
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:49,919
the the goal is uh

1899
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:51,599
the head stealing feature by the way

1900
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,039
kind of just has to go in the game now

1901
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:54,800
that it caused that much

1902
01:55:53,039 --> 01:55:56,399
consternation so like we're we're gonna

1903
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,199
have to just make that be a game play

1904
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:02,638
thing

1905
01:55:57,198 --> 01:56:02,638
like that's just what's gonna happen

1906
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:10,158
come on up come on up that's a good puss

1907
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,840
okay

1908
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,920
that was literally not a bug it was a

1909
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:27,039
feature

1910
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:27,520
uh i guess we must have some we must

1911
01:56:27,039 --> 01:56:29,198
have just

1912
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,880
either someone asked a question about it

1913
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:32,638
and i said sure we can do that or

1914
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,920
sometime i was like let's test it and we

1915
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:38,159
added that

1916
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:40,158
so um i'm not sure

1917
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:43,839
what yeah i i don't know why that

1918
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:43,839
happened but it did

1919
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:49,840
the coding environment is for coder and

1920
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:57,439
we use

1921
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:58,880
visual studios compiler

1922
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:00,158
the linux branch has the debug release

1923
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,118
bug as well and it triggers all the time

1924
01:57:00,158 --> 01:57:05,118
i set up okay great

1925
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:08,158
um that's that's very good because um

1926
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:09,039
the the hope is that it's not like a

1927
01:57:08,158 --> 01:57:10,479
code gen bug

1928
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:14,719
so like hopefully we should be able to

1929
01:57:10,479 --> 01:57:14,718
find it uh we'll look at it next weekend

1930
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,760
so it was a q a request okay well it's a

1931
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:23,279
feature now like i'm

1932
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,119
i'm going ahead and making that part of

1933
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:26,238
the game so you can steal heads and the

1934
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:39,839
heads will do things

1935
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:39,839
i guess

1936
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
uh george i don't know the answer to

1937
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:59,920
that question but it is

1938
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,840
true that switching to four coder flurry

1939
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:03,920
means that the build is getting called

1940
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,800
in a potentially different way

1941
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,520
because before it was called with my

1942
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:10,159
build thing

1943
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:11,920
and now it is called with four coders

1944
01:58:10,158 --> 01:58:14,638
build thing

1945
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:15,279
and so it may very well be that four

1946
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:18,840
coder

1947
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:21,439
is canonicalizing those now and wasn't

1948
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:23,119
before which sucks because i don't

1949
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:35,839
actually want it to do that

1950
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:35,839
but it may well very well be doing that

1951
01:58:41,359 --> 01:58:48,000
ah so if you're talking about um

1952
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:48,719
the background doing a weird thing

1953
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,238
that's actually

1954
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:54,480
obs being a pile of crap um

1955
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:56,158
which is unsurprising it has nothing to

1956
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:57,198
do with four coder and i have no idea

1957
01:58:56,158 --> 01:59:02,000
how to fix it

1958
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:04,638
uh obs is just a gigantic pile

1959
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,840
uh and that's just kind of how it goes

1960
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,239
at the moment

1961
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,760
what ends up happening is anything that

1962
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:11,198
just has like a constant color

1963
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:15,599
background

1964
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:18,000
um like that sometimes just freaks out

1965
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:19,039
i've had it for like doing for capturing

1966
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,158
like visual studio

1967
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:24,960
as well um and i i

1968
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:27,279
do not know fundamentally what it is i

1969
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,279
you know

1970
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:32,000
who knows i don't know if it's ddr box

1971
01:59:29,198 --> 01:59:35,519
man striking again

1972
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:39,279
uh or what it is but

1973
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:44,080
it's a uh it's an obs bug

1974
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:47,759
or a black magic bug i i

1975
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:51,039
have never seen it happen in the actual

1976
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:54,079
obs window so i don't

1977
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:57,599
so it seems like it's a problem uh

1978
01:59:54,079 --> 02:00:00,158
so i don't think it's ddr box man

1979
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:00,719
this time i assume it's like a codec

1980
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:02,479
problem

1981
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,760
or something with the part where it

1982
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:06,559
actually does

1983
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,560
the compression

1984
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:12,479
and i do not know what is going on uh

1985
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:15,440
it's just

1986
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:16,000
you know we we looked at the obs code

1987
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:19,839
right

1988
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,079
we now know it's complete pile so

1989
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,599
who the heck knows what's going on in

1990
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:27,599
there something fantastic

1991
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:29,360
i'm sure uh but how we would go about

1992
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:32,880
fixing that i have no idea

1993
02:00:29,359 --> 02:00:32,880
right um

1994
02:00:34,158 --> 02:00:37,920
and and so you know like

1995
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,039
something in the 200 layers of code that

1996
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,960
that

1997
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:47,760
happen between calling blackmagic to get

1998
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:50,880
the thing

1999
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:54,560
and handing it through 17

2000
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:56,480
different ffmpeg plug-in nonsense who

2001
02:00:54,560 --> 02:01:00,320
the heck knows

2002
02:00:56,479 --> 02:01:01,919
um something's broken but i i

2003
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:04,000
have no idea how that's ever going to

2004
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:04,560
get fixed right it probably just never

2005
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,158
will

2006
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,560
or if it does get fixed it'll get fixed

2007
02:01:06,158 --> 02:01:10,479
accidentally right

2008
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,920
um i also don't know if we can update

2009
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:15,919
obs because i don't know

2010
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:17,359
if the if anyone ever fixed the ddr box

2011
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:21,039
man problem

2012
02:01:17,359 --> 02:01:25,439
so it may be that the latest versions of

2013
02:01:21,039 --> 02:01:27,760
obs have the ddr box man bug

2014
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:29,598
fixed in which case we could try just

2015
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:32,079
upgrading to obs to see if someone

2016
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:33,840
accidentally fixed the bug in the codex

2017
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:36,479
or whatever is happening for that weird

2018
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:38,319
strobing effect

2019
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:40,559
again that's assuming that it's not a

2020
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:41,359
bug in the blackmagic capture it could

2021
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:43,360
be that i'm just

2022
02:01:41,359 --> 02:01:44,719
not noticing it like it's happening and

2023
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:46,238
i'm just focused on the other screen so

2024
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:47,599
i don't see it happening

2025
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:50,238
and it is actually happening in the

2026
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:52,639
capture but at least i have not actually

2027
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:55,598
seen that yet so i haven't actually seen

2028
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:56,880
the weird strobing effect happening in

2029
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:58,800
the actual live view

2030
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,319
it only seems to come out in the actual

2031
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:03,520
stream recording

2032
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:04,000
uh so so it has to like pass through the

2033
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:07,040
codec

2034
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,039
first i think

2035
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:18,000
someone asked the swap would work on the

2036
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:20,399
orphans as well not

2037
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,599
currently if we probably will want to do

2038
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:22,960
that now that we know it's a

2039
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,639
feature but the reason it doesn't do

2040
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,880
that is because

2041
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:29,118
the orphans at the moment don't actually

2042
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:31,520
have heads

2043
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:32,559
i don't think so the orphans at the

2044
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,800
moment are

2045
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:36,400
are just like a static piece of geometry

2046
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,199
so we should probably just create the

2047
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:39,039
orphans as

2048
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:40,799
actual little entities and then they

2049
02:02:39,039 --> 02:02:43,840
would be head swappable yeah so we

2050
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,840
should we should definitely do that

2051
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:47,840
but

2052
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:56,000
well again stunt coder that i mean

2053
02:02:54,238 --> 02:02:57,919
that's purely conjectural though right

2054
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,319
like you have no idea what's happening

2055
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:00,319
there

2056
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:01,679
it it may be that it just only happens

2057
02:03:00,319 --> 02:03:03,198
sometimes because

2058
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,118
there's tons of windows that don't have

2059
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:06,479
the problem and then sometimes they do

2060
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:08,559
right

2061
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:15,839
so i mean how would we know that black

2062
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:15,840
would make a difference

2063
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,920
you

2064
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:59,119
um all right so it doesn't look like we

2065
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:03,198
have any questions

2066
02:03:59,118 --> 02:04:05,519
uh we yeah so if you know

2067
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:05,519
um

2068
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:13,760
oh uh duff g no it's it's not twitch

2069
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:15,039
so this happens in the actual videos

2070
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,639
recorded from obs

2071
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:18,319
you don't you don't have to stream

2072
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:20,239
through twitch

2073
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:21,519
so twitch twitch is not adding that

2074
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:23,039
artifact

2075
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:24,560
i mean twitch may also be adding the

2076
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:26,158
artifact since i don't watch the twitch

2077
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:27,360
stream i don't know if there's like more

2078
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:30,719
artifacts

2079
02:04:27,359 --> 02:04:35,359
but you i get the um

2080
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:38,960
i get the artifacts from

2081
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:43,118
in the locally saved obs recording so no

2082
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:44,960
like no twitch no twitch involved

2083
02:04:43,118 --> 02:04:47,519
like like even if i even if i don't even

2084
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:48,960
have streaming turned on if i'm just

2085
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:53,280
recording locally

2086
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:56,560
that strobing artifact happens

2087
02:04:53,279 --> 02:05:00,078
right so uh it's

2088
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:00,639
it's something to do with the way that

2089
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:04,238
they've

2090
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:07,920
modified the recording in obs

2091
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:12,000
or it's a black magic capture problem

2092
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:12,000
and i i don't know like

2093
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:17,679
the the optimal thing would be if

2094
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:19,679
i could do a recording and get the

2095
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:23,039
strobing to happen

2096
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:24,960
with one that i watch the obs window for

2097
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:26,960
the whole time

2098
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:28,319
so i can verify that it doesn't happen

2099
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:31,920
in the capture

2100
02:05:28,319 --> 02:05:36,319
it only happens in the codec

2101
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:36,319
but i i can't actually

2102
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,719
until i've done that i don't actually

2103
02:05:38,238 --> 02:05:41,439
know for sure that it isn't a capture

2104
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:49,840
problem

2105
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:49,839
because it could be either or

2106
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:55,840
so

2107
02:05:57,439 --> 02:06:03,839
is there any scheduled ending uh no we

2108
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:03,839
have not scheduled any ending

2109
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,279
at the very least we now know that we

2110
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:17,840
will not stop the series until we

2111
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:17,840
actually can swap heads with the orphans

2112
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:21,039
all right

2113
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:29,760
thank you everyone for joining me for an

2114
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:31,678
episode of handmade hero it's been a

2115
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:32,079
pleasure coding with you as always if

2116
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:33,440
you

2117
02:06:32,078 --> 02:06:35,279
would like to follow the series at home

2118
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:37,279
you can always pre-order the game

2119
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:38,880
on handmadehero.org and it comes with

2120
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:40,238
all the source code so you can follow

2121
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:41,679
along at home

2122
02:06:40,238 --> 02:06:43,598
maybe you would like to go try to find

2123
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:46,480
the lighting bug

2124
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:47,920
supposedly it's reprobable at home folks

2125
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:51,439
have said it is

2126
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:52,960
so you know now's your chance to try

2127
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:55,279
hunting down a pretty hard bug

2128
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:56,639
right uh i'll be back next weekend to do

2129
02:06:55,279 --> 02:06:57,359
that we seem to have gotten rid of all

2130
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:59,520
the other

2131
02:06:57,359 --> 02:07:02,000
things that we needed to fix up uh with

2132
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,960
respect to tags our trees are back

2133
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,960
um our

2134
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:13,599
our what was the other thing we did the

2135
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:15,520
um

2136
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:16,880
cutscenes couldn't think of the word our

2137
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:19,679
cutscenes are back

2138
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:21,359
so all that stuff is good um and so all

2139
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:22,719
we got to do now is track down that

2140
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:24,960
lighting bug and then i think we're on

2141
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:26,158
to new features

2142
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:28,239
and we'll be back to do that next

2143
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:30,559
weekend uh that's it for today

2144
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:31,359
until then have fun coding everyone and

2145
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,440

2146
02:07:31,359 --> 02:07:35,839
