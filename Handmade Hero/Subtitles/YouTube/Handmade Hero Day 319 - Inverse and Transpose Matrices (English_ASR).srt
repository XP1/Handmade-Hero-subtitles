1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:08,099
alright hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,919
handmade Hero the show where we code a

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,080
complete game live on stream we found

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,849
some bugs yesterday and we fixed some of

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,089
those bugs yesterday as well as doing

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,528
some optimization work but we had a bug

7
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:21,028
that we needed to leave til today cuz I

8
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:25,829
think it's gonna be relatively involved

9
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:29,039
with math wise and so you know normally

10
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:32,579
I would say ten years ago well let's

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,469
let's say 15 years ago not 10 years ago

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,000
would've been fine ten years ago I think

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,829
this is the kind of math problem that I

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
wouldn't think about very long I just

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,579
feel like oh here it is

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,350
but since I've been spending my time for

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,079
the past god I don't even know how long

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:49,020
not doing these kinds of math problems I

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,239
am often a little bit rusty at them so I

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,250
feel like this is you know I just felt

21
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:58,679
like it was likely it was likely to take

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,679
some time to work it out

23
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:04,640
due to the rustiness of it I kind of

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,049
figure out I wonder why Milton always

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,060
loses the ability to capture the tablet

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,330
when it's been open for a while nobody

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,710
seems to know why someday I should go to

28
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:20,728
bug it we have the source code but I

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:23,938
don't know why and you does anybody else

30
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:30,750
so anyway point being let's take a look

31
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:37,188
here here we are on day 319 and this is

32
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:40,019
for you no skew UVs

33
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:42,508
should actually say skew UV mapping

34
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,828
maybe and for those of you who don't

35
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,728
know what I'm talking about because

36
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:50,129
maybe you didn't see yesterday's stream

37
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:52,828
we wrote a thing that looked a

38
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,920
quadrilateral mapping routine when we

39
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,468
originally wrote the renderer for this

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,960
game because remember we don't require

41
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,609
OpenGL at the moment we actually can

42
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:07,078
just render the game entirely in

43
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:10,080
software ourselves and so what what was

44
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:13,889
going on there was we wrote a mapping

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,219
routine where you could give it a y-axis

46
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,599
and an x-axis and you could rotate those

47
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,919
however you want it and you could scale

48
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,259
those so ever you wanted and it would

49
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,359
work the image so you know you could

50
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:26,009
look map an image on you could do

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,920
something more like this if you wanted

52
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:32,159
to and it would you know stretch the

53
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,869
image out right so standard texture

54
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,120
mapper basically that worked with a

55
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,590
quadrilateral the quadrilateral has to

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,860
be you know a parallelogram so not a not

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,849
a rhombus but a you know an actual it

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,680
always has two sides both sides parallel

59
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:52,919
and that'll work fine and we you know we

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,680
got that working and it was fine but we

61
00:02:52,919 --> 00:03:00,359
never really supported the ability to

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,400
skew so stuff like this if you were to

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,410
actually construct using a real

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,780
parallelogram not a rectangle not a

65
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:09,000
rotated rectangle but an actual

66
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,430
parallelogram where this you know is not

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,500
ninety degrees this is some other angle

68
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:21,510
here that is not 90 this is not 90 we

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
don't really support that and the reason

70
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,840
that we don't support that

71
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,199
is because I kind of took a shortcut in

72
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,360
how I did the UV mapping of the

73
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,949
quadrilateral and so I just wanted to

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,870
take this opportunity to describe what

75
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:35,789
that shortcut was we probably described

76
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,140
it at the time but we probably didn't

77
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:38,609
dwell on it very much because we weren't

78
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,849
really thinking about the skewness of it

79
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,320
or at all and and so on and so forth so

80
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:46,650
maybe let's just take a minute to kind

81
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:50,519
of talk about what was going on in this

82
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,370
situation so first let's talk about and

83
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,560
I'll try to not make too many math

84
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,659
mistakes but you know like I said it's

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,840
I'm a bit rusty at these so you're gonna

86
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,579
have to bear with me on that

87
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,789
conceptually speaking I just want to say

88
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,269
here is what we're actually doing okay

89
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:15,689
so we have if you would imagine this is

90
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:18,649
our texture and on this texture we've

91
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:22,259
got you know some pixels or whatever and

92
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:23,519
essentially you could think of this you

93
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,288
know if you want to think of it

94
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,479
conceptually you could think of any

95
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,500
point on this thing you know

96
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,509
we could think of this as being defined

97
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,040
by all these points you know if you

98
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,990
didn't don't even think of it as a

99
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,790
texture map just think of it as a space

100
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,090
in where there's a bunch of colored

101
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,410
points right because we're talking about

102
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:42,209
transform we wanna think about the

103
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,620
transform so pixels we don't care about

104
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:45,269
pixels right now we're not even thinking

105
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,370
about pixels let's just think about

106
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,599
points right that are on this texture

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,860
map and the point could be anywhere it

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,360
could be over here could be in here

109
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,400
could be on the surface whatever any

110
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,590
point in this texture map right so what

111
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,859
we know is that we've got these basis

112
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:04,379
vectors here right that define this and

113
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,310
these are the X&amp;Y basis vectors of the

114
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:10,110
texture and then what we're doing when

115
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,879
we do a texture map conceptually

116
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,250
speaking even if this isn't how we're

117
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,579
actually computing it is we're taking

118
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,779
these and we're sort of specifying where

119
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:25,039
those go on the screen right so let's

120
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:27,750
take the case of when I was still using

121
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,900
rectangular rotated rectangles rotated

122
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,180
scaled rectangles you know we have a y

123
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:35,370
axis and an x axis right and those

124
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,590
correspond here so we're essentially

125
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,500
taking points and we're transforming

126
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:41,639
them over here so if we wanted to and

127
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,990
you know we should also point out

128
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,419
there's also an origin right so there's

129
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,759
there's some kind of a basis point here

130
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,259
that we're talking about and so I don't

131
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,939
know what we'll call that let's just

132
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:59,430
call that I don't know we'll call that a

133
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:03,810
so all right so if we have a point here

134
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,819
a point P what we want to know if we're

135
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,060
talking about the forward transform so

136
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:10,889
I'm talking about if I actually had a

137
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,560
bunch of points and wanted to transform

138
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,120
them into the space right so if I'm

139
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
talking about the forward transform

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,850
which obviously doesn't help us at all

141
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,009
in this particular circumstance but

142
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,230
trust me it matters why we want to think

143
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:23,759
about it that way for a second what

144
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,240
we're basically asking for is how to

145
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,029
create a P Prime over here that's in the

146
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,949
same place as the texture would be if

147
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:34,109
the whole texture was kind of warped you

148
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,060
know and smooth and warped over to the

149
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,949
location that we want the texture to be

150
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:45,389
on the screen right so you know P Prime

151
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:51,269
is our screen position and P is the

152
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:53,039
Texel space position right and so we

153
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,740
could talk about this transform and

154
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,560
maybe a was a poor choice here because I

155
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,210
probably would use the large a for it

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,399
but I don't know will will will sort of

157
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:08,339
creatively turn that into a B let's say

158
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,469
we've got an a here so I'm just gonna

159
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,439
describe this transform a that's gonna

160
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,350
take these points and do the operation

161
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,240
that I want to do right so assuming that

162
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,640
this is how I'm going to conceptualize

163
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
it what I'm saying is that if I was to

164
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,550
multiply you know if I was to perform

165
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:31,680
the transform a on the point P I would

166
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,840
get back that P Prime right and so this

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,850
is a very straightforward sort of matrix

168
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,379
statement I would be making I'm saying

169
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,830
that I have a transform that is the

170
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:43,230
transform that moves from texture space

171
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:46,800
that's where this is at zero zero that's

172
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:50,610
where this is at 1 0 and this is 0 1

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,189
right this like known space and it you

174
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,400
know it moves everything over to this

175
00:07:53,189 --> 00:08:00,230
other space here where the origin is not

176
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:03,479
0 0 it's at B and these vectors are not

177
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:05,430
0 1 and 1 0 there are some random

178
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:09,360
vectors that are whatever they are we

179
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,100
they could be anything right so let's

180
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,410
talk about that shortcut that I took

181
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,030
given this matrix equation the most

182
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,450
simple kind of matrix equation you can

183
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:19,919
really ever have let's talk about what

184
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,659
this actually looked like now I know

185
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,400
that some people's eyes gloss over when

186
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,680
you see matrices and so I always like to

187
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,209
just remind everyone that really we're

188
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,430
just talking about bags of numbers here

189
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,379
this is a 2d transform let's take a look

190
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,099
at what this actually looks like if we

191
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:37,769
if we talk about it specifically right

192
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:40,440
so what's this P prime here right

193
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:43,500
well this P prime is this right here

194
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,850
that's just the X&amp;Y coordinates of the

195
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,980
point on in screen space right so that's

196
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,170
literally just like the screen X and the

197
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,610
screen Y that's all we're talking about

198
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:57,360
for this P prime vector

199
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,279
we then have some matrix a right and and

200
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,740
who knows what that matrix a is we're

201
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,839
going to talk about that in a second and

202
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,610
then we've got this vector P here and

203
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,280
what's the vector P well that's the U

204
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,379
and V coordinate right that's like

205
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,750
whatever the UV coordinate was to get

206
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,039
that point of the texture map right so I

207
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,629
don't know what it is here point eight

208
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,039
point eight something like that kind of

209
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:21,899
it looks like maybe your point nine

210
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:24,089
point nine who knows right and so the

211
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:27,689
question is just what is this a right

212
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:31,470
what is this a vector here right and so

213
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:36,330
in order to in order to actually do the

214
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:38,040
origin transform with the B we could you

215
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,139
know you've seen matrices where we

216
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,939
extend two homogeneous coordinates and

217
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,559
include the translation and the matrix

218
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,510
and all that stuff we're not going to

219
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,529
look at that at all so what I'm gonna

220
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:51,840
say is I'm gonna say that we just have

221
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,970
the B is a is a seperate origin shifting

222
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,889
term out here right I'm just gonna say

223
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,019
that you know we don't care about that

224
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:00,629
that's just you know whatever that this

225
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:02,340
screen space origin is here wherever we

226
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:04,679
wanted it is this other term because we

227
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:07,139
don't care about that at all right we

228
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,399
can trivially to perform the reverse

229
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,169
mapping which is the thing that we

230
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,029
actually care about or the forward

231
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,729
matters that matter we can always just

232
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:17,250
subtract away this origin and get just

233
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,830
the vector P Prime and this then becomes

234
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,809
the same zero zero right so translating

235
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,550
this back to the origin is trivial and I

236
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,279
don't want to complicate the matrices

237
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:27,629
for you thinking about the homogeneous

238
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,789
nature of them and that other stuff

239
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:32,850
because that's really graphics trickery

240
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:33,689
it's not really that important and not

241
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,690
something we need to concern ourselves

242
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,730
with for this problem at all so let's

243
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,430
take that out of the equation pun

244
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,879
intended and just focus on the actual

245
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:46,859
part we care about which is the actual

246
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:50,309
transform of the shape right so that

247
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:53,700
skewing stretching transform which is a

248
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:55,879
two by two transform on the U and V that

249
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,060
bends it into this shape that it's in

250
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:02,700
okay so let's think about what has to

251
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,189
happen there right well I've got an S X

252
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,899
and an S Y and what I want to do is I

253
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,629
want to interpret them remember s

254
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,028
X was interpreted this way originally

255
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,720
right oh I'm sorry I don't mean that I

256
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:18,419
meant UV I've got a little hell of

257
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,480
myself there so that you write is

258
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,778
interpreted this way and that V is

259
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,188
interpreted this way right so

260
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:31,129
essentially here is the V here is the

261
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:36,028
you okay so if I wanted to reproduce

262
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:38,278
this point over here then what I was

263
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,588
thinking to myself right is I was

264
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:42,899
thinking to myself well okay if I want

265
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:45,869
to go you know however far I need to

266
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,490
come this way for my you coordinate and

267
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:49,800
however far I need to come this way for

268
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,990
my V coordinate well then clearly the X

269
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,618
vector you know whatever this X vector

270
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:57,688
is here that is just the columnar

271
00:11:55,619 --> 00:12:01,499
component of this guy so you know I've

272
00:11:57,688 --> 00:12:05,879
got X X X Y whatever this if that's this

273
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:08,699
vector here right and I've got Y x y y

274
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:12,149
as you know and that's this this axis

275
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:14,878
here that's all I need now why did I

276
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:19,558
think that was true right well look at

277
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:22,800
what happens if I if I'm actually going

278
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:24,120
to if you actually multiply these out

279
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,479
right I taught you how to do matrix

280
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,470
multiplication so even if you don't know

281
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,490
beforehand made here you should know now

282
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:35,879
if not where were you when we covered

283
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,379
this we've done it multiple times now so

284
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,058
remember if I multiply this out you'll

285
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:41,188
see what I get

286
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:44,249
remember you you think of it this way

287
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:45,509
you take the first element in the row

288
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:47,490
and the first moment in the column you

289
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:49,678
multiply them together so it's u xx

290
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,539
right then you take the next element

291
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:55,499
next element and multiply those together

292
00:12:51,539 --> 00:13:02,370
as a sum so V Y X right

293
00:12:55,499 --> 00:13:10,589
I do the same thing here so I do you X Y

294
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:13,798
and I do v YY wish u and V were a little

295
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,959
more clean right and this is the result

296
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:17,999
I get right it's a vector result right

297
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,578
there's two elements to it this one in

298
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:22,739
this one and if you look

299
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:26,308
how these break down you can see these

300
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:26,699
terms isolate very very cleanly don't

301
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:30,269
they

302
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:32,578
right I could rewrite this very by just

303
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:39,480
cleaving it at the plus line and this is

304
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:45,318
clearly U times xx XY plus V times V y X

305
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:48,149
V Y Y ok now what are these two oops I

306
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:52,289
doubled my V there for no reason here we

307
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:54,808
go y x YY right and this is just the

308
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:58,230
x-axis this is the y-axis of my

309
00:13:54,808 --> 00:14:00,928
transform up there so it's just UX + V Y

310
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:04,139
right and that's exactly what I said I

311
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:06,749
wanted I wanted to go out the x axis by

312
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:11,909
U and I wanted to go up the y-axis by Y

313
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:16,019
that's what I was trying to do right so

314
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:17,488
that is why I constructed in my head

315
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,578
when we were doing this that is why I

316
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:22,920
was thinking this way right so my a

317
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:30,149
matrix I know what it is it's it's

318
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:34,498
exactly what what I just said right it's

319
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:37,918
exactly this but this is not an

320
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:40,589
operation that we ever actually do right

321
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:42,749
it's just not an operation we do we

322
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,149
never have to in hand meet here at the

323
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:47,939
moment anyway we never have to take a

324
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:50,369
point in texture space and map it onto

325
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:52,828
the screen because remember the way we

326
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:56,910
do our texture mapping is we just loop

327
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:58,798
over the pixels and we try to figure out

328
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:02,639
where in the texture map each pixel came

329
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:05,610
from so we actually don't want a we want

330
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,829
the inverse of a right we want to do the

331
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,369
backward transform that's what we were

332
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:13,198
doing okay so how did I write that

333
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:16,559
backward transform right what did I

334
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:19,558
actually type in as the code well if you

335
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:23,068
remember what I typed in is from the SX

336
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:25,078
sy here mm-hmm and I'm gonna go ahead

337
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:26,128
and eliminate be entirely we're just not

338
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:26,878
gonna like I said we're not good at all

339
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,038
we're gonna pretend we already

340
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,629
subtracted B out so pretend that this is

341
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:33,990
the entirety of our equation it's just

342
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:36,750
SS X Y times you know

343
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,730
equals the matrix times a UV right so

344
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,230
what did I type in well I typed in two

345
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,259
dot products I don't know if you

346
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:48,570
remember this right but the dot products

347
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:50,970
i typed in were if we let's call this

348
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,110
the you know at the s vector well I

349
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,600
guess we called it P Prime

350
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,550
so that's fine the dot products I I

351
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,649
typed in where I wanted to take P prime

352
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:07,740
transpose X so I wanted to dot product

353
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:10,830
this end this together right that was

354
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,690
going to be my you coordinate and I said

355
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,490
I was going to take the same thing with

356
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:18,810
the y axis and that was gonna be my V

357
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,519
coordinate right that's what I said now

358
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,958
why did I say that I might have

359
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,220
explained at the time I don't know if I

360
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,539
did if I didn't but I hope I did but now

361
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,670
let me just explain it again because

362
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:31,379
it's crucial to understand where I got

363
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:36,028
that before you can really understand

364
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:37,620
what the bug is okay so where does this

365
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:40,559
come from where does this concept come

366
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,129
from well remember we have our matrix

367
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:50,909
equation P prime equals AP okay and we

368
00:16:44,129 --> 00:17:00,659
know that that is s XS y equals x x XY Y

369
00:16:50,909 --> 00:17:04,349
x y y x UV now I want to solve this

370
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:06,869
equation what I want to do is I want to

371
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:08,759
get the U and the V right that's what we

372
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:12,269
need to look up into the texture but I

373
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,429
only have the SX and the sy right so

374
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:19,170
effectively what I have to do is solve

375
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:23,339
this equation for P in order to actually

376
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:26,519
produce the UVs that I want so what that

377
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:29,129
you know involves is multiplying by the

378
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:31,589
inverse of this a matrix right if I have

379
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,210
P prime equals a P well if I want to

380
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:35,909
solve this equation I need to multiply

381
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:40,009
both sides on the left by a inverse a

382
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:42,960
inverse P prime equals a inverse ap and

383
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:44,730
any matrix times its inverse obviously

384
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,670
is going to equal the identity matrix

385
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:51,710
right so that goes away

386
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:52,920
and I get a inverse P prime equals P

387
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,529
okay

388
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,509
and so since what I'm trying to solve

389
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:59,849
for is the P means that the thing that

390
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,329
I'm trying to compute is a inverse P

391
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:04,649
Prime

392
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:08,069
that's what I want right so I want

393
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:11,009
moving back up to here if what I want is

394
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:16,799
a inverse P Prime well that means I've

395
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:19,170
got this X X oops XY Y x y Y matrix that

396
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,460
I have to invert somehow and we don't we

397
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,740
haven't really talked much about how to

398
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,360
invert a matrix right so we have to be

399
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:30,630
able to invert a matrix that's one thing

400
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:33,799
we have to do and then we have to we

401
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:39,300
have to take this and multiply it by the

402
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:43,289
input the SX X Y right that's what we

403
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:45,149
have to do so I never inverted this

404
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,279
matrix right that's inverting a matrix

405
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,509
is not in the code and I don't know if

406
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,129
we talked about inverting the matrix or

407
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,640
not or what happened but that never

408
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,360
happened

409
00:18:50,640 --> 00:19:03,150
so how did I get from wanting to do this

410
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:06,059
equation to computing this right how did

411
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:09,690
I get there because it's kind of close

412
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:14,940
right I mean this is the this is P prime

413
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:19,070
here right and it does produce the U and

414
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:22,370
the V and the x and y-axes are there but

415
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:26,099
what you know how did I get there well

416
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:28,919
the answer is I kind of used a little

417
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:30,569
bit of a trick it just mentally without

418
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,470
probably going into too much detail of

419
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:36,899
it that is if you want to invert a

420
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:40,559
matrix if you know some things about the

421
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:43,170
matrix you can take a shortcut there's a

422
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,210
number of things that you can do what

423
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,420
are those shortcuts well let's start

424
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:52,519
with a very simple one let's suppose

425
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,519
that you have an orthonormal matrix

426
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,810
or rather that the vectors in the matrix

427
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:02,629
xx and YY or orthonormal what does that

428
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:05,839
mean well an orthonormal pair of vectors

429
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:10,810
is a pair of vectors that meet at 90

430
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:15,799
degrees right and are also unit length

431
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:21,980
so this is you know one long and this is

432
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:24,019
also one long okay if you know that you

433
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,170
have an or if you have two orthonormal

434
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:30,829
matrices I start to orthonormal vectors

435
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:35,120
so say that x and y were orthonormal to

436
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:37,819
each other then inverting your matrix is

437
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,859
as simple as rearranging the terms you

438
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:42,349
don't even really have to do any work to

439
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:45,559
invert the matrix if I have an

440
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:51,469
orthonormal matrix that looks like a X a

441
00:20:45,559 --> 00:21:00,190
Y DX dy like this right and I want and I

442
00:20:51,470 --> 00:21:00,190
know that a is a and B are orthonormal

443
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,230
right so I have this I know they're

444
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:08,599
orthonormal then the inverse of this

445
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,099
just equals the transpose and the

446
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:15,259
transfers just means flipping everything

447
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:19,579
around the diagonal right it's a X a Y B

448
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:21,049
X B Y right so you can see the ax and

449
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:26,029
the B Y stay in the same place that the

450
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:28,879
a YB x they swap right now it's a little

451
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:30,980
confusing it's like why why does that

452
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
happen right it's like it's one thing

453
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,250
for me to kind of sit here being mathy

454
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,279
about it and saying like hey guess what

455
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,490
guys the inverse in this case happens to

456
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:44,059
equal this so really you could say that

457
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:46,400
a inverse equals a transpose right in

458
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:49,519
the case where the vectors that make it

459
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,030
up happen to be orthogonal right but why

460
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:56,389
is that true you know Gibbs gives some

461
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:58,039
geometric intuition not to why that's

462
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,840
true or some algebraic intuition or

463
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:02,509
whatever well I can probably give you

464
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,639
both my linear algebra skills aren't so

465
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:06,970
rusty that I can't

466
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,520
probably demonstrate that in in

467
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:15,519
both ways actually so let's start with

468
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:18,129
the algebraic way and and you know I'll

469
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,859
show you the geometric way second so

470
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,299
what actually do I know about inverses

471
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,798
right what is an inverse of a matrix

472
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:25,779
well you know you can think about

473
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,000
inverses of matrices very much like

474
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,308
inverses of anything else right it's the

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,529
opposite operation and it's the thing

476
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:34,808
that is the unitary inverse in this case

477
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:35,710
so for example to map it back to

478
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:36,908
something that you may be more familiar

479
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,788
with if you're not too comfortable

480
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:42,610
matrices let's say that we just took a

481
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:47,109
you know a number like let's say we took

482
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:49,658
the number a equals five right so it's

483
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:51,579
just a symbol a it equals five if I

484
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,559
wanted the unitary inverse of this right

485
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:56,079
if I wanted to the the multiplicative

486
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:59,908
inverse if you will right if I wanted to

487
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:02,949
say what multiplied by a gives me one

488
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,299
right so I have some number I want

489
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,490
something that I'm going to call a

490
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:10,359
inverse I'm going to multiply it by a

491
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:13,390
and I want it to equal one right that's

492
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,889
what I want to have happen well you can

493
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,500
find out pretty trivially what this is

494
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:20,730
right you have an equation in only one

495
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:24,130
unknown a inverse right and I have a

496
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,990
known value for a which is five so if I

497
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,760
have a inverse five equals one

498
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,909
well then a inverse is pretty obviously

499
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,129
1/5 right and that's exactly what you

500
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,260
know intuitively you know if I give you

501
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,700
the number five you know that one over

502
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,400
five is the thing you would multiply it

503
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,850
by to reduce it back to one right and so

504
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,769
for any you know a one over a is always

505
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:47,319
the multiplicative inverse of it you can

506
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:49,990
always take anything well if that thing

507
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:52,750
is not zero you can always take anything

508
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:55,000
and you know you know invert it like

509
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,369
that and you get something that will

510
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,950
multiply out to one so the inverse of a

511
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,599
matrix is a very similar concept there's

512
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,538
just a lot more to it because there's

513
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,730
just so much more involved right but

514
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:09,519
it's very similar it's the thing that I

515
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,429
multiply a matrix by in order to produce

516
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,319
the identity in order to produce a value

517
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:16,809
which when multiplied when you multiply

518
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,398
by it it does nothing right because

519
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:20,950
that's what this was right this was a

520
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:23,379
way of producing one

521
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,390
which is the the value that does nothing

522
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,550
when multiplied right it is literally an

523
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,490
ineffectual multiplier right and that's

524
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,740
the same concept for inverting a matrix

525
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:35,769
when I do a matrix inverse times itself

526
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,240
you know when I do a inverse times a I

527
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:39,879
get the identity matrix the identity

528
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,710
matrix is just like one it's the thing

529
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,450
that you can multiply other matrices by

530
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,430
and it does not affect them

531
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,830
it's a pass-through right and it

532
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:50,950
actually looks you know like this right

533
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:55,389
it's just it's just a you know ones down

534
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:57,009
the diagonal the whole way right and so

535
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,259
anything that you multiply by it just

536
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:01,299
produces a copy on the other side it

537
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:05,410
does it does nothing so it's exactly

538
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:07,509
like one for multiplication it's just

539
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,350
this is for matrices so hopefully you're

540
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:11,230
comfortable enough just with

541
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:15,009
conceptually what that means a inverse a

542
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:17,829
equals the identity matrix well now I

543
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:20,799
can tell you algebraically why that

544
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:24,460
inverse transpose Y this is true for

545
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:28,119
orthonormal vectors right and so let's

546
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,940
say we just do out exactly what I am

547
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,769
suggesting we do here let's say that we

548
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,350
pretend that a inverse equals a

549
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:38,259
transpose and I have these vectors that

550
00:25:35,349 --> 00:25:44,230
are orthonormal right so I start with a

551
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:46,809
X a Y B X B Y okay that's the matrix and

552
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:51,190
I'm going to reproduce exactly this

553
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:55,539
equation that I wrote write a inverse a

554
00:25:51,190 --> 00:26:00,190
equals the identity matrix okay so if I

555
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:01,839
were to take the transpose of this

556
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,029
matrix which I just told you how to do

557
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,679
right this is this is a up here this is

558
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:08,470
gonna be a transpose right here right

559
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,410
which I'm saying equals the inverse I

560
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,600
know that my ax and my B Y stay in the

561
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:17,830
same place I know that my B X and my a Y

562
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:19,480
switch right well let's multiply these

563
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:21,909
matrices together we know we're gonna

564
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,069
get another 4x4 I'm sorry another 2x2

565
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,690
matrix of the four element matrix we

566
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:27,099
know how we do right we know how to

567
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,660
multiply we've done this a bunch of

568
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:33,009
times I handmade here oh so it's going

569
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,360
to be ax squared right ax times ax ay Y

570
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:38,079
times a y

571
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:40,919
right so it's like x squared a y squared

572
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:44,980
right that's what that's going to be

573
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:50,080
then here we're going to get ax BX + a

574
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:51,370
YB y right ax BX a YB y down here we're

575
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,119
going to get kind of the opposite of

576
00:26:51,369 --> 00:27:02,259
that right doot-doot we're gonna get ax

577
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:06,969
BX + a YB y oops right that quickly yeah

578
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:09,190
ax BX a YB y right and you can see how

579
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,009
it's kind of like producing the exact

580
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,930
same terms all right and then the same

581
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:17,230
thing that happened up here to this this

582
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,640
vector which is squaring itself

583
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,490
essentially is going to happen to these

584
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:26,290
down here right so I get BX squared plus

585
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:27,730
B Y squared right so this looks like a

586
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:29,109
bunch of gobbledygook right it's like

587
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,000
what's going on here like I thought you

588
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:33,399
were gonna tell me how this equals the

589
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,740
identity matrix I don't understand well

590
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,330
if you actually look closer at what

591
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:42,039
these things are you can very quickly

592
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:44,889
see why it actually is the identity

593
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:50,319
matrix and here's why

594
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:52,930
well what is ax BX + a YB y right what

595
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:56,769
is that it's the dot product of a and B

596
00:27:52,930 --> 00:28:00,250
that's a transpose B right remember a

597
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:02,859
transpose B ax times BX plus ay Y times

598
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,400
dy it's the dot product right same thing

599
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:06,969
up here

600
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,330
that's just a transpose B what's ax ax

601
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,839
plus ay Y a Y well that's a transpose a

602
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:16,599
and what's BX BX plus B Y B Y well

603
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:20,379
that's B transpose B so actually the

604
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:25,689
matrix that I produced is a transpose a

605
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:27,580
a transpose B B transpose B and a

606
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:33,549
transpose B again these are equivalent

607
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:36,730
terms well what are those values I would

608
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:39,759
invite you to look back here at a and B

609
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,860
are orthonormal and what did I say what

610
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,559
did I say orthonormal ment I said it

611
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:47,399
meant they had unit length and that they

612
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,399
met at a right angle

613
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,480
okay do you see it yet if not I'll keep

614
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:57,369
going a transpose a you know the dot

615
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,599
product I want everyone in Hamming here

616
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,638
are you better into the backtracked I've

617
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,189
said it so many times you know the dot

618
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:05,648
product of a times a it's the length of

619
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,409
a time's the length of a time's the

620
00:29:05,648 --> 00:29:12,099
cosine of the angle between them right B

621
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:13,629
times B length of B times length of B

622
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:16,869
times the cosine of the angle between

623
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:20,319
them right a transpose B last term

624
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:23,798
length of a length of B cosine of the

625
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:25,658
angle between them well tell me now what

626
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,269
are all these lengths I just said

627
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:30,669
everything has a length of one right so

628
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:33,878
all of these terms go away they're gone

629
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:36,159
because they're all equal to one so all

630
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:38,469
we have left is the cosine of the angle

631
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,360
between them well what's the cosine of

632
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,509
the angle between two vectors that are

633
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:46,538
the same vector right that's an angle of

634
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:49,929
0 and a cosine of 1 which means a

635
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:56,038
transpose a and B transpose B are both

636
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:56,038
equal to 1 hey guess what 1 1 a

637
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,149
transpose B what's the cosine of 2

638
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:04,839
things that are 90 degrees apart what's

639
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:09,099
the cosine of that well it's 0 right the

640
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:12,459
cosine is 0 when it gets to 9 degrees 0

641
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:18,308
0 that's exactly what I wanted right 1 0

642
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:20,048
0 1 so effectively you can think of this

643
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:22,869
and when if you go down the linear

644
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:26,138
algebra path this is you know this is

645
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:27,939
real basic linear algebra stuff that I'm

646
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:30,638
doing here but if you've never done

647
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,980
matrices you know obviously it's it's I

648
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:35,979
think it helps to kind of ease into it

649
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,889
obviously but you can always think of

650
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:41,079
matrices as just a giant bag of dot

651
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:44,408
products right it's just dot product of

652
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:48,069
this you know this vector dotted with

653
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:50,620
that vector is is this entry right so

654
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:53,019
each entry you can think of a mate reply

655
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:56,109
as taking all the possible dot product

656
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:59,169
combinations that you can make from two

657
00:30:56,109 --> 00:31:01,058
incoming matrices and each element of

658
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:02,710
the corresponding matrix is a

659
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:09,700
different combination of dot products

660
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:13,298
right so that is a really easy algebraic

661
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:16,960
way right of seeing why the inverse is

662
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:20,829
the transpose because when you happen to

663
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,079
know that these are orthonormal all the

664
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:24,638
math just comes out right when you

665
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:26,980
actually do that multiply look

666
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:29,229
everything on the diagonal happens to be

667
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,889
a dot product of a vector with itself

668
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,480
and all of them are length one and

669
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:36,428
everything on the other diagonal happens

670
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,579
to be a dot product of two vectors that

671
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:42,129
are 90 degrees apart right and so to put

672
00:31:39,579 --> 00:31:44,259
it in sort of meta algebraic terms if

673
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:47,548
like I said if you start to think of

674
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:50,798
these as just a series of vectors right

675
00:31:47,548 --> 00:31:53,908
then what you can think of is if I was

676
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:57,190
to start with some vectors up here

677
00:31:53,909 --> 00:32:04,049
ABCD who knows so four vectors each for

678
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:07,538
long and I transpose them ABCD right

679
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:09,730
then you can just think of the diagonal

680
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:12,490
of the matrix just being all the dot

681
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,429
products of things with themselves right

682
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:17,919
B transpose B C transpose C D transpose

683
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:20,200
D all the way down however big you made

684
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,809
this matrix I don't care and then all

685
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,970
the off elements are all the dot

686
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:28,298
products of some vector with some other

687
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:31,889
vector so the reason that conceptually

688
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:34,480
speaking any matrix times its transpose

689
00:32:31,888 --> 00:32:36,008
will give you the identity if you know

690
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,288
that all of the vectors in it are

691
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:39,849
orthonormal all of the columns of it are

692
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:42,249
all all the rows of it or NAR thermistor

693
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:45,219
everywhere you want to think of it right

694
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:47,589
is because you then know that all of the

695
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,990
diagonals will become one because you're

696
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:51,490
always taking the dot product of a unit

697
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,460
length vector with itself and that's

698
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,679
always one and everything off the

699
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,929
diagonal is always going to be the dot

700
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,879
part of some vector with some vector

701
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:02,200
that's 90 degrees apart from it so it

702
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,158
actually doesn't even matter at that

703
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,749
point what their lengths are they're

704
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:06,820
like to be anything but the cosine term

705
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:09,250
will always be zero so everything off

706
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:11,079
the DL becomes zero and the only thing

707
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,368
you get when you have ones down the

708
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:14,889
diagonal and zeros everywhere else is

709
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:17,049
the identity matrix so

710
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,350
conceptually algebraically I hope that

711
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:23,519
makes some clear sense as to why this is

712
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:25,480
true right so now let's look at

713
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,730
geometrically why it's true because some

714
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,930
people like to think in geometric terms

715
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,970
some people like to get out direct terms

716
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,650
somebody like to think both usually

717
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,779
being able to be both is usually best

718
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:36,220
because some things work well objects

719
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,410
some things work well geometrically it's

720
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,730
handy sometimes to be able to switch

721
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:44,050
back and forth between them when

722
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:46,720
something's not working but let's talk

723
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:52,289
about the geometric construction of this

724
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:57,009
right so like I said sort of previously

725
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:58,420
we could think of one of these vectors

726
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:01,180
you know when it I'm sorry one of these

727
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:05,650
matrices and I guess let me write it out

728
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,990
a x a y be X B Y we could think of one

729
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,960
of these that these matrices like a and

730
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,510
I'm gonna I want to you know sort of

731
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,519
have something a vector here than I can

732
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:18,580
multiply by it so that I can show

733
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,869
something algebraically right I in fact

734
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:21,699
I don't even really have to do it again

735
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:22,779
because I suppose I already did it my

736
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,859
Allah just rerun it again it's easy

737
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:31,480
enough to rewrite right it's a you ax

738
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:34,480
plus the b x ua y plus vby

739
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,710
right and so what i said was well you

740
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,719
know you can see very clearly that

741
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:42,099
that's u times a plus V times B right so

742
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,289
geometrically we've talked about this

743
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:47,049
many many many many times right all

744
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:49,360
that's doing is saying well all right if

745
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:52,870
you imagine that I had some perfect

746
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:56,260
space over here where I had you know U

747
00:34:52,869 --> 00:35:00,519
and V like this to get to a point and

748
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:04,300
there's my my vector u V right if I then

749
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:07,179
take some other you know basis here

750
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,970
which is my ax so here's my here's my a

751
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:13,239
and here's my B I can then just

752
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:17,589
reinterpret these right I can say I want

753
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:20,319
to go this far along in you and I want

754
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:22,420
to go that far along in V and I get to

755
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,690
that point right and that's the forward

756
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,250
transform of this thing right this is

757
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,630
we've done this so many times you just

758
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,670
go you along the

759
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,260
vector and then V along the B vector and

760
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,530
you get to the point and that's how you

761
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,540
do a basic transform right well if you

762
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,940
think about what the inverse of this is

763
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:41,889
right so I want to do the inverse

764
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,840
operation geometrically I don't want to

765
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:47,679
go this way I want to go that way

766
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,890
right well what would I do instead of U

767
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,609
times a plus V times B I want to do the

768
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,579
opposite

769
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:57,250
I want to dot product right I want to

770
00:35:54,579 --> 00:36:00,039
project so I want to take this and

771
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:01,659
project it onto the a so I want to take

772
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:02,590
whatever this vector is what am I going

773
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,420
to call this vector

774
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:06,510
I guess we'll call this vector P because

775
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,599
I have nothing better to call it right

776
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:14,410
so if this is my point P here I want to

777
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:16,059
dot product it with a to produce u right

778
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:18,069
I want to drop that perpendicular down

779
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:20,650
to produce the U value and then I want

780
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:23,680
to dot product it with B for the same

781
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:26,200
reason to produce that V value well how

782
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,719
do I produce a dot product with a and

783
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:31,179
with B right

784
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,459
it's exactly what I just said if these

785
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:36,489
are going you know in the column order

786
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:40,119
if I was to transpose them so it's a X a

787
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:42,549
Y B X B Y right if I take that transpose

788
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,099
now they're lined up such that

789
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:49,620
multiplying by the matrix does the dot

790
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,619
product there it is right there right so

791
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:58,090
now instead of computing the thing that

792
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:00,219
moves you out along the vectors

793
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,920
conceptually speaking which is this I

794
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:04,719
produce the thing that dot products with

795
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,980
those vectors which is the measurement

796
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:10,089
version right so again you can see

797
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,650
conceptually speaking if you want thing

798
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,019
about geometrically you can just think

799
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,690
about it as going the transpose if

800
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:18,699
everything's orthonormal the transpose

801
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,849
takes you from vectors you move along

802
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:24,069
and instead of multiplying by those

803
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,529
vectors your two coordinates it makes it

804
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,480
so that now your dot product against

805
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:30,400
against them right and that's the

806
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,920
difference between thinking of a matrix

807
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,920
in column form and thinking of it in row

808
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:41,110
form right if I have a matrix that looks

809
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,519
like this to me and once you're like

810
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,710
once you're into linear out

811
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,150
you just think this way usually if I

812
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:48,309
have a matrix that looks like this I

813
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,950
think ah this is a forward transfer

814
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:53,440
matrix because it's been labeled such

815
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:56,349
that the common terms are going down

816
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,230
right so I know that when I multiply by

817
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:01,960
something I'm a producing a series of

818
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:05,889
vector products whatever I put here I'm

819
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:10,269
effectively multiplying by you know that

820
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:16,750
column right and then I'm adding the

821
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:20,590
next column times something right so

822
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:23,019
when I see columns of of coherent values

823
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,309
going down a matrix I know this is

824
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:25,960
effectively something that when

825
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:27,730
multiplied by a vector you will

826
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,380
basically be producing a series of

827
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:34,539
scaled you know summed vectors right

828
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,970
those those column vectors these are

829
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:41,230
effectively the scales that scale each

830
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:44,019
column of the vector right but if I see

831
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,150
it the other way round if I see it

832
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:48,730
labeled like this now I know what we're

833
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,410
doing is we're measuring right we're

834
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,090
taking the dot product of something

835
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:55,420
against it right it's the same operation

836
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:57,490
same multiplication it's just where what

837
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,108
values did I put in it that determines

838
00:38:57,489 --> 00:39:00,879
what I get out right same you know

839
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:03,279
matrix math is matrix math but the

840
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,019
values I put in and how I've arranged

841
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,810
them in the matrix determine what I'm

842
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:09,699
computing obviously and so you can kind

843
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:11,619
of see that if I'm thinking rows or

844
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:14,199
thinking columns not sorry thinking

845
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:19,119
columns are thinking rows that depends

846
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:20,469
on what this matrix does conceptually so

847
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,410
hopefully that gives you enough of

848
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:27,069
understanding of why if we go all the

849
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:31,989
way back here scroll through the

850
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:34,690
blackboard of why I wrote this because

851
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:37,329
what I did is I just transpose the

852
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,940
matrix conceptually speaking I wanted to

853
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:42,670
go backwards so I transpose the matrix

854
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,760
but all of that stuff I just explained

855
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:49,750
to you now you can see that only works

856
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,369
if these things are orthonormal now I

857
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:56,079
knew they wouldn't be orthonormal

858
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:59,798
because we tested scaling right

859
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:03,818
so when we tested this thing if you

860
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:06,400
remember we tried making things bigger

861
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:09,958
or you know not in your first inning but

862
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:14,229
we kept this angle at 90 degrees right

863
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:19,838
so what does that do to our matrix right

864
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:23,909
if I've got an ax ay Y B X B Y matrix

865
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:27,608
right and I know these things are scaled

866
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:30,159
right so I know that a has a scale on it

867
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:31,808
we'll call that I don't even know I hate

868
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,368
having to make up letter names for

869
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:36,579
things

870
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:40,689
I'm like so bad at it but anyway so

871
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:43,749
let's call that M and we'll call this

872
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:45,219
one n right so now I've taken these

873
00:40:43,748 --> 00:40:48,548
vectors and instead of them being

874
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:50,739
orthonormal they're still at 90 degrees

875
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:52,748
to each other there's still orthogonal

876
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:55,088
vectors but they are not orthonormal

877
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:59,108
vectors anymore and the reason is

878
00:40:55,088 --> 00:41:05,199
because a is M long and B is M long and

879
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:08,588
M is not equal to oops 1 and n is not

880
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:13,989
equal to 1 there's something else right

881
00:41:08,588 --> 00:41:15,699
so now what happens to our fundamental

882
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:17,019
you by the way I hope everyone was

883
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:18,009
interested in the matrix thing today

884
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,478
because apparently that's all we're

885
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:21,248
gonna do I don't know sometimes I get

886
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:24,879
into it and it's just we're into it at

887
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:26,978
this point so anyway what does that do

888
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,949
to the fundamental operations we were

889
00:41:26,978 --> 00:41:32,318
trying to do before ok now you can see

890
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:35,380
immediately why this works for the

891
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:37,568
forward case because all this m and n do

892
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,249
is they just multiply our U and V out

893
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:41,949
which is what we wanted right it just

894
00:41:39,248 --> 00:41:49,228
makes it go further ok because what I

895
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:54,699
get is M u ax and you know plus n v bx m

896
00:41:49,228 --> 00:41:57,098
you a y plus n vb y right all I've done

897
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:59,588
is just increased the distance I moved

898
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:04,059
along my vectors instead of going UA

899
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:05,018
plus VB I am now going mu A plus M VB

900
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:08,019
that's it

901
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:09,909
right so the forward transform works

902
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:13,029
great now let's see what

903
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:15,098
happens if I transpose this matrix does

904
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,829
it work for me again right does it just

905
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,690
magically work well what would I get if

906
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:22,269
I transfer this matrix well I have ma X

907
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:27,490
right but now down here I actually have

908
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:31,960
n I actually have n B X right and then

909
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:35,169
up here I have my M a Y and here I have

910
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:39,730
my n B Y right you can see that's just I

911
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:43,539
swapped these two right so now when I do

912
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,670
my dot product right so I'm going to dot

913
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:47,970
product this with something now when I

914
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:50,650
do my dot product I have a problem

915
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:54,308
there's a problem here we know the

916
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:56,440
length of the a vector is 1 if it's just

917
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:59,769
a but when it's been scaled by M now the

918
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,289
length is M so previously when I was

919
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:04,509
doing stuff like a transpose P right

920
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,289
which is what this was producing for me

921
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,299
before right

922
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:09,130
if I had my point I was trying to

923
00:43:07,298 --> 00:43:13,150
measure here and I multiply this out

924
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:18,849
right now instead of a transpose P I've

925
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:22,630
got M a transpose P right this is the

926
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:25,390
value I want a unit length a transposed

927
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:29,890
with my P but there's this multiple in

928
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:31,719
there and I don't want that right so how

929
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:37,199
did I compensate for that in the code do

930
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:41,250
you remember what I did is I I baked out

931
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:44,288
the M effectively right I took and I

932
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:47,048
looked at what the length of a was ahead

933
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:50,049
of time and then I divided it by that

934
00:43:47,048 --> 00:43:52,778
number right to get it down to be

935
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:58,750
orthonormal again right I basically made

936
00:43:52,778 --> 00:44:04,599
it back into a unit like vector if that

937
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:05,889
makes sense so I hacked in some code it

938
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:07,990
silently hack it in but I mean I

939
00:44:05,889 --> 00:44:10,269
mentally knew that I could compensate

940
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:13,149
for just the scale and still use the

941
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:17,469
same trick by effectively turning the

942
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:21,910
things into orthonormal vectors if that

943
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:23,798
makes sense so yeah so that was that was

944
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:29,618
what was going on there

945
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:32,139
and similarly I think we I'm trying to

946
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:36,189
think of exactly how we ended up doing

947
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:37,629
that but I think we yeah we used the

948
00:44:36,188 --> 00:44:39,278
fact that it was squared to do a

949
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,519
division I don't really remember exactly

950
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:44,708
what we did but point being that is why

951
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:47,288
it was working for scaled is because I

952
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:51,278
took advantage of the fact that we could

953
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:53,199
effectively think about this where the

954
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:55,599
scale was separate and still do the same

955
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,759
trick now for those of you that want a

956
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,969
little hint of me of linear algebra like

957
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:02,108
a little bit or why you know what that

958
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:04,599
would look like if you were being more

959
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:08,469
formal what you could think of it as is

960
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:10,778
if I have an a matrix and I want this a

961
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:12,548
matrix to be orthonormal right because I

962
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:14,018
want to be able you know I've got

963
00:45:12,548 --> 00:45:18,608
something like this and I want to be

964
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:22,718
able to do this right and when I do that

965
00:45:18,608 --> 00:45:25,119
I want to be able to do a transpose well

966
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,789
if I've got a matrix that's just it

967
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,459
would be orthonormal except the vectors

968
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:32,199
in it happen to be scaled then what I

969
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:34,178
could do is think of that as two

970
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:37,479
separate matrices I could think of that

971
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:39,219
as s AP equals P Prime where s is a

972
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:40,958
scaling matrix and a is an orthogonal

973
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:43,298
matrix an orthonormal matrix where all

974
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:45,728
the vectors are orthonormal right so a

975
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:48,219
is our original matrix and s is just a

976
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:50,348
matrix that has the scales in it so if

977
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:54,729
we had here like we were up there we

978
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:56,289
have the M and the N right then if you

979
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:57,548
look at what happens to a matrix that

980
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:59,469
looks like this where it's a diagonal

981
00:45:57,548 --> 00:46:02,469
matrix with just numbers on the diagonal

982
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:05,499
that acts as something that will scale

983
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:07,599
other matrices right or vectors that's a

984
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:09,458
scaling matrix why does it do that well

985
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,048
you can kind of see if I just write it

986
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:15,759
out if I've got you know my matrix here

987
00:46:14,048 --> 00:46:18,518
a without the scale in it well what do I

988
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:21,938
produce here well a times M is obviously

989
00:46:18,518 --> 00:46:25,268
M ax right a Y times zero is nothing so

990
00:46:21,938 --> 00:46:29,038
there's no extra term right similarly B

991
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:29,038
X times M here

992
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:36,219
where is that right

993
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:49,650
that's not correct this has to be on the

994
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:50,809
other side yeah I think I've got this

995
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:55,980
backwards

996
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:57,119
in fact I do okay so like I said try not

997
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,469
to make too many mistakes I don't know

998
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,469
that I made any yet but that one was one

999
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:11,430
so si AAS - we'll explain everything

1000
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:14,489
since we're here so why did I just have

1001
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:16,049
to back that up all right so so far

1002
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:18,389
we've mostly talked about matrices

1003
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:20,190
transforming things singularly well when

1004
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:23,279
you do matrix multiplication it's

1005
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,980
actually ordered appended and you know

1006
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,810
that's I guess one of the main things

1007
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,750
that sort of separates it conceptually

1008
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:32,969
from regular multiplication when you

1009
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,849
think about working with it you know if

1010
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:38,699
I if I have a times B and a and B are

1011
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:41,159
both numbers you know it's like flat 5 +

1012
00:47:38,699 --> 00:47:45,000
4 whatever B times a is the same thing

1013
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:46,529
right so I can commute the terms in

1014
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,289
multiplication and it doesn't matter I

1015
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,630
can move them all around in matrix math

1016
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:53,550
sometimes that's the case sometimes it

1017
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,500
may be that two matrices can be swapped

1018
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,630
and their product will be the same but

1019
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,980
in general it's not when you have two

1020
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:02,369
matrices because the multiplication

1021
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:06,539
happens by columns on the second it's by

1022
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:08,190
columns on this guy and by and by rows

1023
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:10,590
on the first guy right mean you saw me

1024
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,990
do this multiple times right I line them

1025
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:14,700
up and I do it like this

1026
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:18,149
because of that it matters who's in

1027
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:20,399
which slot right for diagonal matrices

1028
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:22,950
it doesn't matter because you're always

1029
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,539
gonna produce the same terms on the

1030
00:48:22,949 --> 00:48:26,250
diagonal they're always gonna just pick

1031
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:28,889
out the exact same things but for all

1032
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:31,050
the off diagonal elements it will differ

1033
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:34,139
potentially depending on the structure

1034
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:37,620
of the matrices right so actually these

1035
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:40,170
two things are different if I scale here

1036
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,940
or scale here I get a different result

1037
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,289
and if you've ever worked with 3d

1038
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,940
graphics before even if you didn't

1039
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:46,500
understand matrices that well you kind

1040
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,329
of have found this to be true of

1041
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,480
transforms if you've looked at an

1042
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:53,190
equation like this where I do ASP the

1043
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,490
scale happens to P 4

1044
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:59,429
and then the rotation of a whereas the

1045
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:02,068
other way round happens here first a

1046
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:03,989
first pin is rotated by a then it is

1047
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:06,088
scaled right and those are two very

1048
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:08,518
different geometric operations if you

1049
00:49:06,088 --> 00:49:13,409
think about it right if I was to take

1050
00:49:08,518 --> 00:49:15,778
and start with a point P right and I was

1051
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:17,250
to apply a scale to that point right you

1052
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:19,858
know maybe out to here or something like

1053
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:23,548
this and then I was to rotate the point

1054
00:49:19,858 --> 00:49:26,670
around if that makes sense right

1055
00:49:23,548 --> 00:49:29,759
I might get a very different result

1056
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:32,250
if the scale is non-uniform right if the

1057
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:33,358
scale was uniform which I guess I kind

1058
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,099
of drew so I should I should draw a

1059
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,170
non-uniform scale so let's say I'm gonna

1060
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,269
scale along this axis at only this axis

1061
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,509
right so the scale is very non-uniform

1062
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:44,399
if I do that and then rotate I'm gonna

1063
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:50,219
get something very different than if I

1064
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:55,950
rotate and then do that scale right so

1065
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:59,159
if I was to have a scale that was I'm

1066
00:49:55,949 --> 00:50:03,328
out of time darn son all right well

1067
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:05,038
anyway so that actually is captured by

1068
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:06,119
the matrix map and you were about to see

1069
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:06,990
it happen there so I'm gonna do it again

1070
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:08,490
for you

1071
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:10,199
now that I've explained what's going to

1072
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:12,568
happen so it's not going to be too

1073
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:18,899
confusing right so let's say I have my

1074
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:26,759
scale matrix em em this time two M's and

1075
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:31,349
then my my a matrix right well now I'm

1076
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:34,980
okay I get em ax and BX and I get em a Y

1077
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:36,450
and B Y right that was equivalent to the

1078
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,740
thing I was about to draw there which is

1079
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:40,230
like hey if I just scale everything

1080
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:41,368
uniformly then the point ends up in the

1081
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,318
same place because it doesn't matter

1082
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:45,210
whether I rotate first and then scale or

1083
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:47,670
scale first and then rotate because

1084
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:50,099
they'll put me in the same place that is

1085
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:52,349
captured by the matrix math and you can

1086
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:55,528
see it since the MS will multiply

1087
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:58,019
everybody the same it doesn't matter

1088
00:50:55,528 --> 00:51:02,838
where I was I could flip these two guys

1089
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:02,838
around right do the exact same operation

1090
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:14,030
in the reverse order doesn't matter

1091
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:18,379
right I still just get em ax and BX ma Y

1092
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:20,900
M dy right it's the exact same thing but

1093
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,950
if I actually wanted to reproduce the

1094
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,099
thing I was talking about with a

1095
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:27,829
nonlinear scale right so when there's m

1096
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:37,279
and n I can't do that anymore if I try

1097
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:39,079
to do it at the head end right then I

1098
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,790
end up with the problem I had before I

1099
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,409
and that I you know again it's like I

1100
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:43,849
said I'm pretty rusty at these sorts of

1101
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:44,899
things so you can understand why I

1102
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:45,799
didn't catch it till actually so it

1103
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,789
happened I was like wait and I was like

1104
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,920
oh right that's supposed to happen

1105
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:51,619
that's the whole point of matrix math a

1106
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,570
lot of times anyway so you can see in

1107
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:57,500
this case I get ma X and then 0 a Y

1108
00:51:53,570 --> 00:52:02,769
right I get em B X here zero for the B Y

1109
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:08,690
term I get a X drops out the N a Y and n

1110
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:11,239
B Y right and that's no good that's not

1111
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:13,670
what I wanted right you can see that

1112
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:16,399
that scale what I wanted was mg R and

1113
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:21,099
here but instead I got M's here and here

1114
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,099
right now if I do it the other way round

1115
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:34,989
now I get what I wanted right I get ma X

1116
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:39,980
right 0 times BX I get NB x here right

1117
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:41,989
then I get ma Y and and B Y and that's

1118
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:45,619
what I actually wanted

1119
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:49,369
so anyway getting back to it what I was

1120
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:52,369
saying was in this case you can kind of

1121
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:55,219
see that if I wanted to split these up I

1122
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:58,279
could now I have to be careful and I was

1123
00:52:55,219 --> 00:53:03,039
sloppy before like I said getting rusty

1124
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:06,260
but I can split them up I can split up a

1125
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:09,199
non-uniform scaled but orthogonal so

1126
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:12,470
still right angle pair of vectors I can

1127
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:15,529
split them up into a scale and the unit

1128
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:17,899
vectors and then I have an easier

1129
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:22,339
problem so if I know

1130
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:27,588
that I've got a s P equals P Prime right

1131
00:53:22,338 --> 00:53:30,500
and I know that this is this one happens

1132
00:53:27,588 --> 00:53:34,460
to be orthogonal so a inverse equals a

1133
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:36,889
transpose right then I can invert this

1134
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,449
much more straightforward and it's the

1135
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:40,009
trick idea before but you can see how

1136
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:42,169
it's going to work right first I

1137
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:45,920
multiply both sides by a inverse so I

1138
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:47,869
get a inverse a SP equals a inverse P

1139
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,970
Prime right well what do I know about a

1140
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:52,190
inverse a gets the identity matrix so

1141
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:53,088
I'm just left with s P equals a inverse

1142
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:55,700
P Prime

1143
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:58,608
right same thing with s so I multiply

1144
00:53:55,699 --> 00:54:02,348
both sides by s inverse right and now I

1145
00:53:58,608 --> 00:54:05,630
get P equals s inverse a inverse P Prime

1146
00:54:02,349 --> 00:54:09,650
okay this we already know it's a

1147
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:12,079
transpose we just said that was true so

1148
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:16,548
the only problem we have is how do we

1149
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:18,710
compute s inverse well we can use the

1150
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:20,929
exact same trick I used before right if

1151
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:28,159
I know that I've got some scale values M

1152
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:31,429
an n right this is my S matrix right I

1153
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:33,730
want some matrix I don't know what it is

1154
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:33,730
right

1155
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:42,909
I want something so that when I look at

1156
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:45,500
the terms that are produced I get one

1157
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:48,019
right I get the identity matrix ones on

1158
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:50,088
the diagonal zeros everywhere else well

1159
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:53,449
it's not that hard to figure this out

1160
00:54:50,088 --> 00:54:56,599
even by inspection right if I want this

1161
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:57,980
to be one well this is a zero so that

1162
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:00,650
means it doesn't matter what's in there

1163
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:02,329
at least not for this term so I just

1164
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,400
need to put something here that makes M

1165
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:05,180
equal one well I just told you what that

1166
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,539
was up there

1167
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:12,169
welcome to Cove inverse right 1 over m

1168
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:14,599
done okay

1169
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:16,010
same difference here right zero times n

1170
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:17,510
write this term falls out

1171
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:20,510
what's the N well it's just gonna be 1

1172
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:22,369
over n right so I know already that my

1173
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:25,190
term is just it's just a really trivial

1174
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:26,869
matrix it's just 1 over m 1 over N zeros

1175
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:30,079
and zeros right and you can see how that

1176
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:32,030
multiplies out to the 1 1 1 right so

1177
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,530
when you have a scale matrix 2

1178
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,730
the scale matrix you just have to invert

1179
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,530
all the diagonal elements because

1180
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:39,170
there's no cross terms right there's

1181
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:42,050
nothing in anywhere else so it's set

1182
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,789
effectively what you could say is in

1183
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:48,410
order to do this I really just have to

1184
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:50,750
do this and I'm done and that's exactly

1185
00:55:48,409 --> 00:55:52,219
what I did I just did it in my head kind

1186
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,829
of when we were doing it I think I

1187
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:57,399
explained it geometrically but this is

1188
00:55:54,829 --> 00:56:01,039
the actual matrix math that happened

1189
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,300
okay so now we finally get to the thing

1190
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:03,529
that I guess will now have to wait to

1191
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,970
Monday for us to actually do because I

1192
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:10,730
am out of time but we don't have a

1193
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:13,849
matrix like that we don't have a matrix

1194
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:15,889
that's separable into Si and the reason

1195
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:18,230
is because while the scale might be

1196
00:56:15,889 --> 00:56:24,799
separable just fine the a is not

1197
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:27,469
orthonormal right it's not so since we

1198
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:30,590
don't have orthogonal vectors we don't

1199
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:34,339
have cosine theta equals one or zero in

1200
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:36,470
all of our terms we can't use a inverse

1201
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:38,780
equals a transpose so what we're

1202
00:56:36,469 --> 00:56:42,019
actually going to have to do next week

1203
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:45,680
to fix the bug is we're actually going

1204
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:48,199
to have to invert the matrix for real we

1205
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:50,750
have to take the a matrix and invert it

1206
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:54,169
now thankfully it's a two-by-two matrix

1207
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:55,849
that's a really easy matrix to invert we

1208
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:58,220
don't have to won't even have to use

1209
00:56:55,849 --> 00:57:00,980
like a linear algebra assistance package

1210
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:02,689
or any sort or an iterative solver or

1211
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:04,639
anything like that we'll be able to just

1212
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:05,240
directly do it out algebraically and

1213
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,099
it'll be fine

1214
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:09,439
but that's what we actually need to do

1215
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:12,860
and when we do that I think then we will

1216
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,980
get what we need for doing our texture

1217
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:18,320
mapping properly that was a lot to drop

1218
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,730
on you so let's go ahead and go to the

1219
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,530
Q&amp;A and guess people have questions

1220
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:24,309
because I realized we kind of got all

1221
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,310
the way into it there

1222
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:09,500
you've got some salty dogs what does

1223
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,500
that mean

1224
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,630
what are salty dogs

1225
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:34,839
and yeah anyway I guess while I'm

1226
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,949
waiting to see if there are any

1227
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,890
questions which I don't know if there

1228
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:43,899
are or not but that's like I said that's

1229
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:48,039
really basic linear algebra stuff it

1230
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:49,630
gets a lot cooler but if that sort of

1231
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:51,639
thing is that all interesting to you

1232
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:53,590
then you would you will love linear

1233
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:57,940
algebra because there's just tons and

1234
00:58:53,590 --> 00:59:00,190
tons and tons of that you know really

1235
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:03,280
cool it like you know especially if

1236
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:05,050
you've used matrices and you haven't

1237
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,030
learned really leage it yet so you kind

1238
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:09,519
of we're using them a little above your

1239
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:14,350
comfort level of really knowing what was

1240
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:16,929
going on I I mean I at least speak from

1241
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:21,069
my experience 20 years ago or whenever

1242
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:22,989
it was at this point it's just really

1243
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:24,400
rewarding to go learn how it all works

1244
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:26,019
because then it's very empowering and

1245
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,360
you don't have to they're not black

1246
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:30,730
boxes anymore you can just you know

1247
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:37,170
totally get what's going on and it just

1248
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:37,170
really helps you know so yeah

1249
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:51,730
uh I don't know if I knew or not that we

1250
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,640
would have to do reverse mapping I

1251
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:57,690
probably I mean that that we would have

1252
00:59:54,639 --> 01:00:00,219
to use do skew vector reverse mapping I

1253
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:02,650
suspect that I probably said something

1254
01:00:00,219 --> 01:00:04,419
like we aren't really going to be

1255
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:06,269
skewing things so we want to do is I

1256
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,400
probably even said that on the stream

1257
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:13,289
but hey we ended up skewing them so it's

1258
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:15,280
not a big deal it's it's really I

1259
01:00:13,289 --> 01:00:16,599
probably should just have inverted the

1260
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,580
matrix but sometimes I have mater I

1261
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:19,569
avoid doing certain math things so that

1262
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:21,940
we don't have to get into them at

1263
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:24,820
inappropriate times because you know it

1264
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:26,619
is an educational stream so if I can do

1265
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,240
something using only tools that we've

1266
01:00:26,619 --> 01:00:29,799
already learned and I don't feel like

1267
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,589
it's a good time to really attack a

1268
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:39,490
particular topic then I don't do the gun

1269
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:41,500
to it oh yeah my elbow is um it's it's

1270
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:44,139
actually fine it's just one of the

1271
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,389
things that happens usually when you're

1272
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:49,329
rock climbing is it's really easy to

1273
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:51,489
accidentally scrape you know scrape some

1274
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:53,469
skin and have it be a little bloody

1275
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:54,819
especially on like the elbow or other

1276
01:00:53,469 --> 01:00:56,769
places where there's not a lot of fat

1277
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,570
there it's like it's not really

1278
01:00:56,769 --> 01:01:01,030
cushioned you know it's just like right

1279
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:02,530
against the bone and so a lot of times

1280
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:04,780
when you're climbing especially if you

1281
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:06,610
screw up or you know or aren't paying

1282
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,260
enough attention about what you're doing

1283
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:10,090
you'll scrape something and so I had to

1284
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:14,230
it was a little bloody so I had to kind

1285
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:16,600
of stick um I had to just stick a gauze

1286
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:18,940
on it so I didn't I didn't want to blood

1287
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:23,159
stain to anything but it's not bad it's

1288
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,159
just a little it's just a braided

1289
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,588
so it looks like we don't have any

1290
01:01:55,088 --> 01:02:01,230
questions so that's good so everyone

1291
01:01:56,588 --> 01:02:03,940
just understands it all if I gave a

1292
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:07,568
basic matrix math quiz everyone will

1293
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:10,409
pass everyone will pass with flying

1294
01:02:07,568 --> 01:02:10,409
colors

1295
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:31,750
Lord Marshal other than transpose do you

1296
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:39,029
need much more from linear from linear

1297
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:42,550
from linear algebra yeah I mean so I

1298
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:45,040
guess what I would say is like linear

1299
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,900
algebra and also geometric algebra if

1300
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:55,079
you want to be like with the cool kids

1301
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:57,970
now both of them there's I don't know

1302
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:01,049
hundreds of valuable things you can

1303
01:02:57,969 --> 01:03:08,709
learn for game programming in them I

1304
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:11,740
mean there's just linear algebra is is

1305
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:14,050
almost in some sense a field created

1306
01:03:11,739 --> 01:03:17,108
entirely for solving things on computers

1307
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:19,619
like I mean that's not really true but

1308
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:22,150
it's it's kind of that way it's like

1309
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:23,710
basically solving giant numerical

1310
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:26,829
problems is specifically what linear

1311
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:28,150
algebra was made for and so you know

1312
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:31,329
when you're a computer programmer it's

1313
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:33,099
hard to imagine not finding useful

1314
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:39,639
things studying linear algebra like

1315
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:42,009
pretty much you know I mean and I mean

1316
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:47,289
everything like the people who won the

1317
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:49,869
Netflix prize right the the thing for

1318
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:53,949
trying to figure out what people will

1319
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:57,850
rate an X flicks movie given a database

1320
01:03:53,949 --> 01:03:59,949
of prior ratings right is tons of linear

1321
01:03:57,849 --> 01:04:02,949
algebra the singular value decomposition

1322
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:06,309
turned out to be a very important part

1323
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:08,139
of solving the Netflix fly prize if I

1324
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:09,519
remember correctly so it's not it does

1325
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:11,829
not even games

1326
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:14,650
it's not even graphics it's everything

1327
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:18,069
like if you have problems on a computer

1328
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:22,930
that involve you know more than one or

1329
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:26,970
two variables linear algebra right so

1330
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:30,608
compression statistics

1331
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:33,699
yeah large data data mining it's all

1332
01:04:30,608 --> 01:04:34,719
linear algebra like it's not all the

1333
01:04:33,699 --> 01:04:36,309
nodules like that's all you need it's

1334
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:37,059
like but if the underpinnings are all

1335
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:41,529
you need the

1336
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:47,500
algebra always so it's it's really hard

1337
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:50,350
to it would be really hard to study too

1338
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:53,130
much linear algebra like it's all really

1339
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:53,130
very useful

1340
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:07,039
there Marshall we had one example from

1341
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,930
my linear algebra book class in the book

1342
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:12,710
that used computers was surprised to see

1343
01:05:08,929 --> 01:05:15,559
it in there yeah I wish math classes

1344
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:20,869
taught math with computers a little more

1345
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:22,099
probably but you know I mean like

1346
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:23,510
everything else linear algebra is

1347
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:25,639
conceptual so you're trying to learn the

1348
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:27,770
conceptual parts the solving of it is

1349
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:31,159
not that interesting right it's the

1350
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:35,090
understanding what this the actual steps

1351
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:37,368
are that you can use and then you know

1352
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:38,150
you solving matrices by hand as complete

1353
01:05:37,369 --> 01:05:42,619
waste of time

1354
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:44,869
right and hopefully math classes have

1355
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:46,730
gotten passed ever doing that because no

1356
01:05:44,869 --> 01:05:52,250
scientist that I know ever solves their

1357
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:53,990
matrices by hand anymore right can you

1358
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:56,599
know once you know how to work at all

1359
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:58,339
you you know you've you've worked it out

1360
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:00,789
all symbolically and then the computer

1361
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,789
does the work

1362
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,250
and yeah I would agree with Sean McGrath

1363
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:26,900
on the fact that math papers should be

1364
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:29,599
published with C source code I always

1365
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:32,990
find that code is clearer than math

1366
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,700
usually I feel like a lot of times

1367
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:39,019
people have to torture stuff to put it

1368
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:40,429
into math for him but have I seen

1369
01:06:39,019 --> 01:06:44,690
Gilbert Strang his lectures on linear

1370
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:46,098
algebra I have seen some I watched like

1371
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:48,650
a couple of his intro to linear nature

1372
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:50,960
ones just because I learned linear

1373
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:53,180
algebra from his book his intro to

1374
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,679
linear algebra book so I just thought it

1375
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:56,509
was fun to see I wanted to see what he

1376
01:06:54,679 --> 01:07:00,559
sounded like or whatever but I haven't

1377
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:02,630
really watched any appreciable amount of

1378
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:08,650
I just kind of like watched the first

1379
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:08,650
one or two just to see

1380
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:43,739
delicious you suggest students not

1381
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:47,099
knowing how to solve linear algebra

1382
01:07:43,739 --> 01:07:48,389
problems by hand well let me be clear

1383
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:50,789
what I mean on that because I guess that

1384
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:52,469
could be taken two different ways what I

1385
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:54,240
mean is I don't think you should be

1386
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:57,480
numerically solving linear algebra

1387
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:01,229
problems right I mean you should know

1388
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,088
how you might do that but doing it is a

1389
01:08:01,230 --> 01:08:06,599
complete waste of your time right that's

1390
01:08:03,088 --> 01:08:08,159
what a computer is for what you do want

1391
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,180
to know how to be able to do by hand is

1392
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:11,940
the sort of stuff that I'm doing here

1393
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:14,190
right you want to know how to be able to

1394
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:15,990
manipulate symbolically things so that

1395
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:18,690
you can solve equations that you need to

1396
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:21,298
solve but once you've done it like once

1397
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:22,889
you've said oh this is gonna be in a

1398
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:24,420
inverse here and I know that it's not

1399
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:27,088
gonna so I need a real inverse you know

1400
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,880
blah blah blah you know don't invert the

1401
01:08:27,088 --> 01:08:31,409
matrix yourself because there's you can

1402
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,119
just ask mathematic up two and four if

1403
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:38,519
the matrix for you and then you know you

1404
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:40,619
won't make any mistakes right so you

1405
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,270
know I don't I don't think students

1406
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:43,198
should be sitting around doing menial

1407
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:46,259
math chores

1408
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:49,428
if there isn't a like conceptual point

1409
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:53,750
to it then it just seems wrong to me

1410
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:53,750
because what are they gaining you know

1411
01:09:41,449 --> 01:09:47,340
Jesse Meyer would you consider using C++

1412
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:51,329
templates for matrices say in 3d

1413
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:54,390
programming in 3d programming it's

1414
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:56,250
usually not necessary because there

1415
01:09:54,390 --> 01:10:00,480
aren't that many permutations of what

1416
01:09:56,250 --> 01:10:03,510
you want to do so typically the argument

1417
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:08,369
for doing something with templates is if

1418
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:12,449
you have a lot more like like if you

1419
01:10:08,369 --> 01:10:13,500
were doing more types of sizes so let's

1420
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:15,090
say that you weren't doing 3d

1421
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,010
programming you just had like a bunch of

1422
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:21,150
major stars it was four by three ten by

1423
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:24,600
ten six by nine whatever you know maybe

1424
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:25,769
then it makes some sense I don't really

1425
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:30,710
like templates because they're super

1426
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:34,800
janky and bad so I tend not to use them

1427
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:38,460
but if you don't mind the jank unis then

1428
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,000
you know then that's what they're made

1429
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,720
for

1430
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:45,590
in fact you know so they they if you can
