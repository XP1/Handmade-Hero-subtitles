00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:05,759
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,679
Hero the show we code a complete game

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,210
live on stream yesterday we got rid of

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,250
the C runtime library and our win32

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,620
loader and mostly in our regular game as

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,150
well in preparation for what I'm doing

7
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,809
now which is I'm going to be using sine

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,570
and cosine today probably to work on our

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:24,719
sampling quality and what's gonna happen

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,429
is we're gonna see that we really

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,778
probably don't want to be calling sine

12
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,250
and cosine C runtime library anymore

13
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:33,840
it's gonna be slow it's not gonna be for

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,219
wide anyway blah blah blah so we're

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,550
probably gonna want to be able to call

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,590
for wide sine and cosine or even if we

17
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,390
only call it one wide and then replicate

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,760
we're gonna want it to be nice and fast

19
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,890
and not slow like the one that's in the

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:48,479
SE runtime library so we'll have to

21
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,878
start looking at that next week but is

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,049
something we always want to do anyway

23
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:56,429
but it's you know finally at the point

24
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:58,788
where we actually care at least a little

25
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:04,409
bit and so that's what we're gonna do

26
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:06,150
next week probably however today we just

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,368
want to go ahead and use our crappy sine

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,799
and cosine that come with a see math

29
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,930
library in the C runtime library which

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,610
we still linked with the game and if you

31
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,189
remember from yesterday we now know

32
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,688
exactly the six routines we are using

33
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,179
that we didn't write ourselves we wrote

34
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:25,919
everything in this game ourselves except

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,650
for six functions or is it five eight am

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,269
to cosine sign floor and ceiling so five

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,630
functions I believe I'm not unless I'm

38
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,239
forgetting one so five functions that we

39
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,649
haven't written ourselves and we need to

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,359
replace those functions with our own

41
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,490
versus at some point that's what we're

42
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,989
gonna talk about next week for now we

43
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,509
can't still do the work we were going to

44
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,828
do using those functions as is because

45
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,478
we still have the ability to link with C

46
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:50,819
runtime library basically we can turn it

47
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:53,069
on and off in the build time so I have

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,048
it turned on right now so that the game

49
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:58,339
code even though the win32 code doesn't

50
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,880
link with it the game code does so

51
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,790
that's where we're at

52
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,789
let's go ahead and push forward on that

53
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,509
so here is what we stopped with I made a

54
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,789
actually I believe it was a stream

55
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:18,609
request at the end of the show yesterday

56
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:22,989
was to be able to draw the hemisphere as

57
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:25,510
a little like a set of points so here is

58
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,060
a stable sampling so we're just looking

59
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:31,979
at freezing the random number series at

60
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,390
a particular point and looking at how it

61
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,609
you know what the distribution over the

62
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:38,619
hemisphere is and what you can see about

63
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,720
this is it's a totally reasonable random

64
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,550
distribution over the hemisphere if what

65
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,859
your goal is is actual randomness

66
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,050
meaning unpredictability right

67
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,580
it seems pretty unpredictable the way

68
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,810
these points have been arranged it

69
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,060
doesn't look like there's a particular

70
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,580
structure to them so that's fine but

71
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,920
what we do see here is that it's not an

72
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,780
even sampling so remember we talked

73
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,649
about white noise vs. blue noise what

74
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,900
we're looking at here is something

75
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,129
reminiscent of white noise what we

76
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,780
wanted something more reminiscent of

77
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,969
blue noise which is to say that the

78
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,759
points on the hemisphere kind of want to

79
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:12,430
be placed in such a fashion as to ensure

80
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,519
that any individual part of the

81
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,140
hemisphere is not too far away from a

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,629
sample point right we want to make sure

83
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:22,359
that we sort of get coverage with our

84
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:25,120
points so we do want them to kind of

85
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,269
wiggle around and get some sort of

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,539
coverage at over the entire hemisphere

87
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:33,939
by randomly moving over every frame but

88
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,590
uh you know by the same token we want to

89
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:39,629
make sure that they're spaced in a way

90
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:44,049
that gives us some kind of a reasonable

91
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:47,199
arrangement of points in terms of making

92
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:50,230
sure no area gets on you know completely

93
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,389
unsampled on a particular frame so we

94
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:54,369
don't want big holes and what we can see

95
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,669
here is we do have those big holes right

96
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,739
and again that's not unexpected for

97
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:02,409
white noise white noise should be just

98
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:05,019
as likely to have clumps and holes as it

99
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:07,780
is to have an even distribution because

100
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:11,170
again it's it's random so there is no

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,729
sort of bias or force pushing it towards

102
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:16,089
uniform coverage

103
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:18,098
so we would expect that so what we need

104
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,899
to do is introduce that bias introduced

105
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:20,379
that uniform coverage constraint or

106
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,899
something

107
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:28,120
to try and keep it that way so that's

108
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:30,039
what we're gonna look at today and what

109
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,920
we want to do here is we want to go into

110
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,180
our lighting code we want to go take a

111
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,140
look at that part of the code that

112
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,360
actually does the sampling here it is

113
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,889
and what we want to do here is we want

114
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,600
to figure out ways we can make this

115
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,659
routine generate more interesting stuff

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,129
now this routine is can be as slow as it

117
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,770
wants because we're just doing testing

118
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:52,389
right now so we can just be as slow as

119
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:54,909
we want here and do anything we want to

120
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:57,519
do here so we're free to experiment free

121
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:01,720
to create whatever we want and so that's

122
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:04,180
what we're gonna do right now if you

123
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,340
take a look at how this is being set up

124
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,009
at the moment what we're doing here with

125
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:13,389
our normal is we've got sort of a thing

126
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:15,550
that picks a random bilaterals and it it

127
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,889
basically picks a direction and then

128
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,340
picks a distance how far it wants to go

129
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:23,919
out along the normal in 2d right so

130
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:30,329
we're effectively taking this this

131
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,330
process right here what day is today

132
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,160
we're effectively taking a process that

133
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,569
looks like this

134
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,370
where we take a flat disk and you know

135
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:46,110
what let me draw it a little more 3d so

136
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:48,750
we can puff it out in a second here so

137
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,480
in the plane you know we've got a circle

138
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,040
and what we do is we're picking a

139
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,420
direction in the circle so we're picking

140
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,430
like a direction like that

141
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,830
and then we're gonna walk out along that

142
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,220
direction a random amount so you know

143
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:04,319
here here wherever right then we're

144
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,170
gonna project that up onto the

145
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,969
hemisphere right now what that's gonna

146
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,920
do because of the way that it's being

147
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,500
done right now is this gonna concentrate

148
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,430
our sample points more strongly in the

149
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,279
middle than at the end why because we're

150
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:26,100
walking out along a line in a uniform

151
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:28,649
fashion right but that line is going to

152
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,640
so that line is going to spread out

153
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:34,889
those points as it gets further away so

154
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,269
if you imagine two of these right let's

155
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,699
say you were gonna take a bunch of these

156
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,629
and place them like so well let me let

157
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,339
me see if I can draw it a little better

158
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:46,079
here let's say we took a couple

159
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:48,989
different lines right if each of these

160
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,750
lines picked like one quarter let's say

161
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,610
so those are our points you can see that

162
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,860
those points remain very close together

163
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,960
but if each of these picked three

164
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,080
quarters you can see that those points

165
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,599
end up fairly far apart right so what

166
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,609
we're gonna end up having is less points

167
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,710
on the perimeter and more points in the

168
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,660
center this was by design right we this

169
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:12,810
wasn't an accident we meant to do this

170
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,360
why we want to concentrate our sampling

171
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,879
in this region because we know the

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,040
cosine law kills samples that are in

173
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,050
this region so rather than doing a lot

174
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,370
of sampling towards the edges we want to

175
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,449
do a lot more sampling towards the

176
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:30,360
center right and to a certain extent

177
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,769
that is what we accomplished if you take

178
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,870
a look at what's happening here you'll

179
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:36,509
notice we have a much stronger cluster

180
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,629
up near the top but the problem we get

181
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,339
is that you know even even there where

182
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,469
there's a lot of sample points they're

183
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,949
still just clumpy right we got a big

184
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,260
hole here at

185
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:50,769
clomp there there's a big clump here

186
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:53,469
which is roughly at the same degree of a

187
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:55,329
fan-out is here so what we we don't

188
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,670
really want that we want to see as it

189
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,099
gets further towards the end much less

190
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,780
sample points around that bend right

191
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,620
around that sort of end of the

192
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:09,669
hemisphere the ring but we want to see

193
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,649
it be even so even like any given band

194
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,430
should be as sparse as it should be

195
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:16,569
dictated by how far down we've gone

196
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,150
proportional to like the cosine law for

197
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:22,149
example but we still want to see them

198
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:24,310
evenly distributed around the ring so we

199
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:25,959
don't want to see like tons of sample

200
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,519
points on the right side and none on the

201
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,259
left or whatever and that's what we're

202
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,889
seeing here right and again that's

203
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:36,639
exactly what we would expect to see

204
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:39,939
because we don't do anything to prevent

205
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:43,449
pure random white noise clumping right

206
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,790
which will happen so let's think about

207
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:52,750
what we can do here to try and improve

208
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:54,099
the situation right all right first of

209
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,490
all let's take a look at how many sample

210
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,700
points we actually expect to have that's

211
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,019
a you know our first step so when we

212
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,280
think about how many samples we'll

213
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:06,519
probably have you can see that our ray

214
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,610
count here is 16 right which means if we

215
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,840
multiply 16 by 4 we get 64 which means

216
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,460
that the number that we're using right

217
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,160
here is actually accurate that's how

218
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,720
many we think we that is the correct

219
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:20,289
number we think we should be

220
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:24,370
distributing so our question now is how

221
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:27,459
would we distribute those 64 points in a

222
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,590
reasonable fashion right and we do know

223
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,720
also that we want to be casting four

224
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,210
ways at a time we want to keep those

225
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,129
four ways that we're casting at the same

226
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,269
time sort of pointing in roughly similar

227
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:39,269
direction right

228
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:48,659
so what I'd like to do here is I'd like

229
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,119
to figure out a way to maybe do some

230
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:52,798
regular eyes sampling and then maybe

231
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:55,470
jitter within the regular eyes sampling

232
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:58,649
now if we assume that we have at least

233
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,920
so again if we if we think we're going

234
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:04,769
to be sending out four random samples

235
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,409
per actual direction then that means

236
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:15,659
that we've got something that looks you

237
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:18,899
know like this right because obviously

238
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:22,469
if we go ahead and do 16 times 4 we end

239
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:25,589
up with 64 so or maybe the right way to

240
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,509
say that is 64 divided by 4 is 16 so we

241
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,970
know that we've got 16 primary

242
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:33,568
directions to distribute and then we've

243
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,790
got 4 you know sort of packets of rays

244
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:38,009
we're gonna shoot out in a particular

245
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:41,248
direction that want to be sort of semi

246
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:43,980
correlated right so what we want to do

247
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:47,668
is figure out how we can sort of wrap

248
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,668
these around and actually we may want to

249
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:52,649
start with something because the the

250
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:55,918
person who did most of the code for

251
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:58,558
handmade network actually Columbian on

252
00:10:55,918 --> 00:11:01,078
the chat I don't know if he's here he

253
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:04,860
was asking maybe we could do spiral

254
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:13,708
sampling right and I don't know let me

255
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:17,489
see a spiral point or see if I can get a

256
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:25,738
good I wish I knew what to search for

257
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:32,759
here spear spiral phyllotaxis is

258
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:37,249
probably the right word for it see if we

259
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,249
can get a diagram of this somewhere

260
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:46,569
so yeah this is kind of like it that's

261
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,110
not really what I wanted this is what

262
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:53,590
more what I wanted yeah so if we want to

263
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:57,220
take a repeating spiral and kind of put

264
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,930
it down the sphere that is what actually

265
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,970
Columbian was suggesting in its a pretty

266
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:08,889
good idea actually of a way to quickly

267
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:14,980
get something fairly abusive it's on

268
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:19,990
fear just trying to find a good diagram

269
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:22,149
here yeah here we go

270
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,750
so here you can kind of see a 2d and a

271
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:28,659
3d version of this here is like a 2d

272
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,039
just looking at a disc right and they're

273
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:32,129
referring to Vogel's method here which

274
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:35,559
is the way of like placing these points

275
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:40,750
on to the disc right and you can see

276
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:43,209
here how the points are produced in

277
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,190
polar coordinates so polar coordinates

278
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,560
meaning almost exactly what I've written

279
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:51,090
here right we take a direction and then

280
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:54,069
we go out that direction by a particular

281
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,480
distance and so in this case we're

282
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,790
creating that direction by taking a

283
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,649
random bilateral in this case we'd find

284
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:01,689
that direction by taking a random angle

285
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,120
and then using cosine and sine to move

286
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,270
to figure out what it is right so here

287
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:13,480
you can see what we've got in terms of

288
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:15,329
the the distribution and I believe n is

289
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,289
the number of points you want to do

290
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:23,139
right I'm assuming yeah n is the number

291
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:25,750
of points produced by the sequence theta

292
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:28,600
is presumably the rate at which you want

293
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:32,399
to spiral I would assume I'm not sure

294
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,399
though did they define third anywhere

295
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:54,759
I don't actually see them say that here

296
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:58,519
we go so figuring out the ideal angle

297
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,769
coefficient right there saying this is

298
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:03,799
the correct number of radians to use

299
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:08,750
it's the most irrational ankle I guess

300
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:11,088
I'm not sure what that means but I'm

301
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,570
sure that if pseudonym 73 were here he

302
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:17,779
would be able to tell us anyway

303
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,330
we can basically say that taking a

304
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:23,149
particular theta right produces

305
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,290
different kinds of spirals and I guess

306
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,088
you know we're kind of saying that we

307
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:27,649
want a nicely distributed one so we're

308
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,240
talking about ones that looked like this

309
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,309
rather than ones that look like this

310
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,440
although as you can see it is a free

311
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:36,259
parameter we can play with which means

312
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
that we don't actually have to think too

313
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:40,309
hard about it if we know we just want to

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,990
get one like this right there sort of

315
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:45,039
saying there is a there is a rule you

316
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,480
can use to arrive at that correct value

317
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,399
so that's how you would do it in 2d

318
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,350
right that's that's the algorithm for

319
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,230
producing this like sort of layout of

320
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,750
points and then you know the question is

321
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,278
well what do we do if we want to do

322
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,129
these on a sphere and they're basically

323
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:03,200
saying well you know it's not really all

324
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,970
that difficult to do they use

325
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,589
cylindrical coordinates right which is

326
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:12,560
basically the same as polar coordinates

327
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:14,270
but then with a height so these are very

328
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,429
closely related this is exactly the same

329
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:19,309
as it was so the angle distribution is

330
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:21,649
the same it's you know but that's

331
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:24,649
because this value is whatever we want

332
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,929
to set it to right but then the ti here

333
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,970
where we do this is actually going to be

334
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:31,519
changed it's gonna be changed to use

335
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,830
this zi value which is the height so

336
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,179
it's basically setting the distance we

337
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:39,320
go out to be proportional to the height

338
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:42,019
but we end up with a fairly concise

339
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,220
formula again for producing a set of

340
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,470
spiral samples and here's what that

341
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,810
looks like now what you can see here is

342
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,360
it does look like a pretty nice sampling

343
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:52,849
right it's a pretty good covering of a

344
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,700
sphere without having to actually do

345
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,399
real point repulsion or blue noise or

346
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,730
something that actually produces a true

347
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,409
ran

348
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:05,360
uniform covering but you know that's

349
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:08,269
pretty good right we'd be pretty happy

350
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,980
with that for 256 samples certainly now

351
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:12,409
we only have 64 samples so our sphere

352
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,079
would be more sparse unfortunately and

353
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:18,139
to be more concrete about that actually

354
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:19,789
we only have 16 samples but let's try

355
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:23,060
playing around with this you know I like

356
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:24,799
the idea I think Lybian had a good idea

357
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:28,129
here let's play around this a little we

358
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:30,679
can start with this formula and play

359
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:35,990
with this value to see what we get in

360
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:38,750
terms of placement for our 16 points

361
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,000
that we can then blow out 264 using

362
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,549
maybe jitter around the points or

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,169
something similar right so I don't know

364
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:48,469
we could do that the other thing we can

365
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:50,979
do is produce these using the

366
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:53,930
cylindrical coordinates and maybe

367
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:57,649
because we know how the cylindrical

368
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,509
coordinates go we could actually still

369
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:03,589
use cylindrical coordinates for actually

370
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:06,529
all of the points and then know that be

371
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:08,689
based on your index we could know which

372
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:10,338
four to group that would be close

373
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,860
together right so we could come up with

374
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:14,418
some rule for tiling these that might be

375
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,308
interesting so we've we definitely have

376
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:21,949
a lot of options here and you know we'll

377
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:24,230
kind of see we'll see right all right so

378
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,910
let's start with this what we want to do

379
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,110
here is say okay you know we're gonna be

380
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,019
doing we'll start with just doing this

381
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:34,399
mini and we'll we'll sort of forego the

382
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:39,740
sub in next part for now like maybe

383
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:42,140
we'll just nerf this so we're literally

384
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,710
just doing this part here and what we

385
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,690
want to do now is introduce a little bit

386
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,308
of polar coordinates so what I'm going

387
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,710
to do is I'm going to do a random angle

388
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:56,240
here and this is corresponding to this

389
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:58,789
part of the of the series right we want

390
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,440
this P I here we're going to be

391
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:05,418
producing this this value as an angle so

392
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,690
I'm going to switch to using a random

393
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:11,980
unilateral here and I'm going to say x

394
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,990
tau 32 right

395
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,110
so basically we're gonna take a value

396
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:21,250
from 0 to 2 pi and we're gonna produce

397
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:23,408
that angle right then instead of normal

398
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,480
being this what I'm actually going to do

399
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:30,669
is say it's going to be cosine of the

400
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:32,139
angle sine of the angle and then I'm

401
00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:36,330
going to compile right

402
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:39,129
so that will should in theory anyway

403
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:41,470
produce 16 points that are randomly

404
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,669
dispute over the Hemisphere in exactly

405
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,490
the same way we were doing it before

406
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:47,860
right so no nothing else happening here

407
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,179
so there's our 16 points and you know

408
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:51,250
there they are on the hemisphere as we

409
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:53,230
would expect and again that's just

410
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:58,329
changing this into polar coordinates now

411
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:59,980
so now we have our sort of angle normal

412
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:01,329
is a probably dumb thing to call this

413
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,460
because we sort of kept that because

414
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:05,619
we're you know using it the whole way

415
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,120
through but let's let's call this

416
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:11,678
something a little bit different or

417
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:16,928
maybe you know I'll start following this

418
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:20,860
here right so this is this is our angle

419
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:27,370
value which is this P or R oh I guess

420
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:32,079
that's the Greek symbol array for for

421
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:40,808
Rho naught P right this guy so anyway so

422
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:42,038
we could make it like so and right now

423
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:43,418
we're just computing that as a random

424
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:46,480
unilateral but then we will introduce

425
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:48,669
the spiral in a second there so we've

426
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,950
got the Rho then we've got this this ti

427
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:56,409
here that value is again kind of

428
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,200
computed off of this so we really want

429
00:19:56,409 --> 00:20:04,510
to start with this value first

430
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,399
so our Z value in this case is and this

431
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:09,038
Z value will get plugged straight in as

432
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:16,229
Z I believe but we want this to be 1

433
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:20,158
over 1 minus 1 over n here like so and

434
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,159
then that's going to multiply

435
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:33,179
one minus two times I oops and we're

436
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,740
probably have to make that be a float

437
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,389
here right because it's going to be I is

438
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,349
going to be an integer and we want to be

439
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:39,359
doing these with splitting put

440
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:50,058
calculations and then we're going to

441
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:50,058
divide that here by n minus one

442
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:01,558
and there's the complete equation so we

443
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,599
know that that's the equation for

444
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:08,388
producing the Z value let's go ahead and

445
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,388
divide that up yeah believe that's right

446
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:21,329
yeah so then when we want to produce TI

447
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,528
it's fairly straightforward right it's

448
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:27,048
just going to be the square root of one

449
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:30,960
minus whatever that value is squared and

450
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:37,079
again that's not actually T I guess is

451
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:40,409
that tau these are tiny little letters

452
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:43,439
yes that's tau so this is actually our

453
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:45,090
tau value I guess technically that means

454
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:52,399
this is Zeta right if we're really going

455
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:55,138
for it nope it's not that's an actual Z

456
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:56,609
all right so now we've lined ourselves

457
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:58,829
up with there now McClay Chur which is

458
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:04,378
good all right so this is going to be

459
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:05,759
your square root here and it's really

460
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:11,398
just square root of 1 minus whatever

461
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:14,159
that value is squared right so that's

462
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:18,689
pretty straightforward as well so again

463
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:21,200
this is the the the equations for

464
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,460
setting up the spiral sampling and

465
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,259
presumably here you know if we want to

466
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,860
kind of work this through a little bit

467
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:32,278
more carefully what's happening here is

468
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:33,039
just that this is producing you know we

469
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,920
know that this is

470
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,079
the angle so that's just telling us what

471
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,630
direction we're gonna go out so here

472
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,579
we're gonna say how high we are and so

473
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,790
all this is doing is saying well if for

474
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:48,699
that high here's how far out along the

475
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:51,159
thing we have to go right so really all

476
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,840
of the complexity here of producing the

477
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:59,950
spiral has been baked into the height

478
00:22:52,839 --> 00:23:02,019
value right and if we want to we can

479
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,670
probably reverse engineer exactly how

480
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:05,289
that works too right because we know

481
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:10,900
that it's supposed to be sort of

482
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:12,579
producing a stepping around the sphere

483
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,259
right so if you wanted to get a little

484
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:16,899
bit more fancy you could figure out

485
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:19,720
exactly what we were doing here in terms

486
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,210
of why we picked these particular ratios

487
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,240
right but for now let's just continue on

488
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:28,079
with using the prescription for Vogel's

489
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,079
method which by the way

490
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:46,308
should be here it is

491
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:56,250
this is the actual method and

492
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:03,599
unfortunately looks like maybe I don't

493
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:07,529
know if this actual paper exists

494
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:15,959
anywhere in PDF form doesn't look like

495
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:18,808
it necessarily does there we go

496
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,049
so this is the actual paper this is why

497
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:23,160
they call it Vogel's method is because

498
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,169
Helmut - Vogel right I don't know how

499
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,350
perhaps that Vogel Helmut Vogel

500
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,539
I'm not sure my pronunciation of

501
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:34,558
European names is pretty poor so anyway

502
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:36,808
here is the actual paper that introduced

503
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,308
this method so this is probably actually

504
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,259
the correct place to go if you really

505
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:43,079
want to figure out exactly why the

506
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:45,359
spiral is computed exactly the way it is

507
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,649
now I don't really care why the spiral

508
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,289
is computed exactly the way it is

509
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,630
because again I'm not really looking at

510
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:54,509
this as an important feature I'm looking

511
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,220
at this more as like what distributions

512
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:57,329
that people come up with that are

513
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,490
interesting and Clement stretched this

514
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,949
one it seems interesting I don't really

515
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,900
need to be able to edit this or make

516
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,700
meaningful changes to it so I don't

517
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,490
really care exactly how it produces the

518
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:13,980
spiral other than in an academic sense

519
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:15,990
however again we may want to get a

520
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,150
little bit more into it later on in

521
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,759
which case we should decrypt these more

522
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:24,240
directly and probably read that paper so

523
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:27,660
taking another look once we have these

524
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,039
values here again this is not going to

525
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,769
produce spiral yet because this value

526
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,299
has not actually been computed properly

527
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,750
so we're gonna have to now actually make

528
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:38,779
this be our theta value which we haven't

529
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:44,940
determined what that actually is yet

530
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:47,039
times our I value like so and we'll have

531
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,519
to define what our theta is out here

532
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:54,659
right so then we also have our other

533
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:57,289
values like N and we have our I value

534
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,590
which is you know actually just this an

535
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:02,599
iterator here and we've got our N

536
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:05,720
which has to be the total number of

537
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,069
points in the system like so and so the

538
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,490
only thing we need to do now is actually

539
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:13,058
compute that theta value and then we've

540
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,740
got the full set that was requested here

541
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:17,690
so in terms of the theta value it looks

542
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,849
like the theta value is actually used

543
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:28,220
the same in this case so it's the golden

544
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:30,168
it's the golden angle here times the the

545
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,940
N so if we take a look at how that's

546
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,788
actually be computed this is the

547
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,580
discussion up here right the golden

548
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:39,769
angle pi times 3 minus root 5 it's

549
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:41,449
roughly equal to you know this value the

550
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:43,519
golden is the most irrational angle

551
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:48,919
defined as 2 pi you know whatever blah

552
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:51,859
blah blah blah right so what we want to

553
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,630
do here is just put in an approximation

554
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:57,048
for it cuz I guess we don't really care

555
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,179
to we don't need it to actually be truly

556
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:01,970
irrational in that sense so what we can

557
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:04,548
do here is actually just use it as it

558
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:12,319
appears right pi times 3 minus root 5

559
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:20,808
should be sufficient for 4 for us so

560
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:22,369
let's see here 3 minus root 5 so that

561
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:25,629
should produce the actual value that we

562
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:28,819
want in theta again we've got the the

563
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,830
number there the 16 which is how many

564
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:33,769
points we want to distribute and then

565
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:36,858
off we go now I assume

566
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:36,858
[Music]

567
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:53,140
it's kind of interesting right

568
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:54,700
we don't really modify this value so you

569
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,430
know no matter how many points you're

570
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,890
distributing the distribution comes

571
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:04,170
entirely in the later section you always

572
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:07,300
do the golden angle part here right

573
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:09,430
which is pretty bizarre but that's just

574
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,539
you know that's actually the way there's

575
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,720
this little thing Oh

576
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:22,839
syntax highlighter so that's pretty

577
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:24,370
interesting right that's that I think

578
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,379
that's pretty interesting

579
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,000
so anyway again if we take a look at

580
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:36,010
just how this is computed right we don't

581
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:38,589
I guess I'm not sure exactly what this

582
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:42,990
is meant to accomplish here but you know

583
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:42,990
you can see a range N

584
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:55,799
I assume this is just saying we're gonna

585
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,470
do this over a number of points so I'm

586
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,450
assuming that's still just i but yeah

587
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,150
point being it's interesting to note

588
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,640
that this angle remains the same no

589
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,370
matter what n is because normally in

590
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,140
most distributions you would alter the

591
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:15,359
theta based on the n but here we don't

592
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:18,330
we only alter the placement where how

593
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:21,179
far out we place it we don't alter how

594
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:23,189
much we rotate each time which is kind

595
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,570
of an interesting if that's really the

596
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:28,110
way these work it's an interesting

597
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:31,079
observation right about how those angles

598
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:33,119
are behaving okay so now if we want to

599
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,500
actually produce the normal well at this

600
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,659
point we've pretty much got the

601
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,369
information that we need so we can

602
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,290
actually stuff these directly if we want

603
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:43,379
to we know the angle that we're talking

604
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:45,299
about here and we know how far out we

605
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,500
want to go so we really can dispense

606
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,700
with all of the rest of the stuff

607
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,140
because we've already computed it all

608
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:55,920
and just directly computer normal out of

609
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:58,440
thin air right so using the values

610
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,110
prescribed by the by Vogel spiral

611
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,509
formula we can compute those values and

612
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:05,879
then we can see how they are arranged

613
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:09,150
and if you look at them actually there

614
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,700
they are quite nice right those are very

615
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:17,340
nicely evenly distributed over the

616
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:20,309
sphere and in fact if we were to to

617
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:23,269
ratchet this up to the full 64 and take

618
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:23,269
a look at what that looks like

619
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:33,710
that is a really nice covering right it

620
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:36,269
looks lovely

621
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,440
now some things I would observe about

622
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:43,049
that is it's for a sphere so we do have

623
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:47,400
a bit of a problem that the formula as

624
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:50,579
written is giving us miracle data not

625
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:53,550
hemispherical data right so we don't

626
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:57,179
really want the formula to behave the

627
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:59,399
way the formula is normally behaving so

628
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,920
the N value that's used in here is not

629
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,460
really the N value that we want what we

630
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:08,580
rather want here is double the N value

631
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,279
right and the reason that we want that

632
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:14,639
is because we want the end to stop at

633
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,920
the hemisphere not the sphere so if we

634
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,460
take a look at what would happen for

635
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:23,070
example here if I multiply that value by

636
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,950
2 so that we only go run up to half of

637
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:28,079
it then we get the hemisphere that we

638
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,580
wanted without going without completing

639
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,490
the sphere towards the bottom which is

640
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:36,659
important right we don't want to have

641
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:38,309
any points go go to to the downward

642
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,410
facing hemisphere because we're only

643
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:42,750
currently sampling out away from the

644
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,009
surface not back in to the interior of

645
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,599
the surface if we were doing subsurface

646
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:49,920
scattering we would want that right but

647
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:51,809
we don't so there's the distribution of

648
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,330
points prescribed both the spiral as

649
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:57,240
suggested by Columbian and discovered by

650
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:59,639
Vogel in the 1970s and I agree that's a

651
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,309
pretty nice start right I think that's

652
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,630
pretty great now again if we go back to

653
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:05,129
looking at what we actually have to work

654
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,480
with in terms of points here it's

655
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:12,510
actually it's just makeup and we

656
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,920
actually only have 16 points to work

657
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:16,980
with here and so if we look at how those

658
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,769
are distributed those 16 points like

659
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,759
this we could imagine taking those 16

660
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:27,119
points and kind of fanning them out

661
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,890
differently right so for each of those

662
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,289
if we did do a sub in next year and we

663
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,960
wanted to add random jitter to it we

664
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:38,399
could add random jitter by randomly

665
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:41,569
jittering the the row and the theta

666
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:45,440
right or the Z in this case

667
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:58,769
so what I could do here is take this and

668
00:32:45,440 --> 00:33:00,179
introduce a random bilateral and what we

669
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:02,128
want to do here is add just a little bit

670
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,870
of jitter so you know we don't really

671
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:06,119
know how much jitter we want to add

672
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:09,528
because it's a pretty tough call in this

673
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,939
case we know we're rearranging up to tau

674
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:14,878
this is an angle right so it's

675
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:18,240
proportional to tau in terms of how

676
00:33:14,878 --> 00:33:19,638
large it is so this would be you know

677
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,558
[Music]

678
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:25,740
that would be one tenth of the angle

679
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:27,298
could vary this would be one sixth of

680
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,210
one tenth of the angle that could vary

681
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:33,359
right this would be a hundredth of an

682
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,220
angle and so on so I don't know exactly

683
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,949
how much we want to vary it there this

684
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,740
is a height so it ranges from zero to

685
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,778
one in this case so again we probably

686
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,019
want this to be varying a little bit

687
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:48,659
less than that but exactly what we want

688
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,878
we don't really know let's go ahead and

689
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:54,169
try those here and so now we would have

690
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:57,928
actual random coverage around each point

691
00:33:54,169 --> 00:34:00,059
and we can kind of see how that is right

692
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:01,980
and so those are not spread out nearly

693
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:03,599
enough as what we would probably want in

694
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,149
terms of getting sample coverage there

695
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,309
so let's go ahead and boost those up a

696
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:09,838
bit just to kind of spread the mount

697
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:12,539
more there you can see them spreading

698
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,909
out but again still not really spread

699
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:17,579
again also now that we've done this we

700
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,960
need to normalize this again in fact you

701
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:21,720
know what we can do is just just move

702
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,789
this down so that old should we

703
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,289
normalize it for us I believe although

704
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:27,358
it might not because of the way we're

705
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:29,068
doing row but it probably should right

706
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,219
yeah so there we go

707
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:34,588
so you know one of the problems though

708
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:38,309
that you can see is this ends up getting

709
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:41,190
back into sort of a more clumpy sort of

710
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:44,989
problem there right so again we may just

711
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:47,730
want to keep with the uniform sampling I

712
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:49,500
don't know it's hard to say but we may

713
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:53,820
want to keep with the uniform sampling

714
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,909
and then group back together

715
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,090
to produce something more stable I don't

716
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:02,099
know but it does seem like you know also

717
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,890
one of the things here is we probably

718
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:06,630
want the angle to vary more at the

719
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:09,299
bottom than at the top right

720
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,860
so as the eye kind of gets gets further

721
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:17,269
out you know it's probably something

722
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:23,820
more like well you know ft 2i over f/32

723
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:26,550
and times this random or whatever

724
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,750
something more like this so that the

725
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:37,019
variance in terms of the values

726
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:43,469
increases as you go right just taking a

727
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:47,360
look here so let's go ahead and make

728
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:47,359
those values get a little larger there

729
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:54,559
and I'm also going to now take the

730
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:02,489
training wheels off and allow this to

731
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,519
vary so we can kind of see how the

732
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:07,079
hemisphere is being sampled right so you

733
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,670
can see that this point gets no spread

734
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:11,519
and the reason that that point gets no

735
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,960
spread is because of this value here so

736
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,489
you know technically we would probably

737
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,679
have to do something where we do an I

738
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:19,019
plus 1 here just to make sure that you

739
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:21,989
know the ratio doesn't collapse at the

740
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:24,509
very top and that way this one can get

741
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:30,539
some motion as well but again it's you

742
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:34,130
know it's not fabulous and you can see

743
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:36,090
also since it can't really rotate itself

744
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,470
in terms of the way it's doing the

745
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,630
displacement the other equation you

746
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:43,799
don't get good sort of fan out there

747
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:46,170
either but either or like even just at

748
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,910
this point it's already you know

749
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,159
arguably better than what we were doing

750
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:53,579
before so that's kind of nice but we

751
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,799
still have a long way to go so I don't

752
00:36:53,579 --> 00:37:00,569
really like the random jitter much to be

753
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:03,450
honest I think this is kind of better

754
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,950
the question is what can we do here one

755
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:06,949
thing I'm curious about is let's suppose

756
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:12,169
we just offset our room

757
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:14,659
right like we just spun our angle by a

758
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:17,088
random amount so let's suppose that our

759
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:20,449
row is just offset is the only thing

760
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:26,509
that we offset and we offset the row by

761
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:28,639
whatever we want so it's just tau times

762
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,020
a random unilateral that's that's the

763
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,818
thing so we're just rotating this

764
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:34,789
randomly what kind of coverage does that

765
00:37:31,818 --> 00:37:37,489
give us right and if you look it's

766
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:39,588
pretty good right I mean that's looking

767
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:43,848
pretty good in terms of coverage there

768
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:48,048
you know I'm saying and if we so if we

769
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:49,579
were to do 64 samples this way I think

770
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:52,489
that would be pretty interesting the

771
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:56,450
problem is again the coherence of those

772
00:37:52,489 --> 00:38:01,189
samples isn't great right so let's let's

773
00:37:56,449 --> 00:38:02,868
go back to pausing this thing for a

774
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:10,599
second and just talk about what I mean

775
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:14,088
so here is oh that's wait a second

776
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,318
that's not what I wanted no wonder it

777
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:17,798
looked it looks better than it should

778
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:22,150
have looked that's not what I wanted

779
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:22,150
what I wanted was this

780
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:39,600
I wanted to pick one random value and

781
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:42,650
just jitter the sphere around right so

782
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:48,179
it should look like that always right

783
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:56,309
but then I wanted to jitter it around

784
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:59,519
so how's that coverage seems alright

785
00:38:56,309 --> 00:39:02,639
let's accumulate that coverage so let's

786
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,110
see how we do if we were to say you know

787
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:13,049
let me give ourselves a little more

788
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:15,539
Headroom here will this blow us up no

789
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:18,600
that's just fine so what I can do here

790
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:23,579
is say all right yeah let's let's go

791
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,599
ahead and stage make this stationary but

792
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:31,980
then what I'm going to do is I'm going

793
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:35,309
to run this multiple times you know what

794
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:37,579
and all I really needed to do was this I

795
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,579
suppose

796
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:47,750
so let's do this 16 times actually 10

797
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:49,969
times is probably better because I think

798
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,380
our blend rate is like 0.1 or something

799
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:53,719
like that it might actually you know it

800
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:57,318
might be 20 so it might be over 20

801
00:39:53,719 --> 00:40:02,348
frames is our average so let's just see

802
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:02,349
over 20 frames what it will sample right

803
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:10,608
so you know it's not awful but you can

804
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,680
see that you do get a little bit of a

805
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:18,710
regular pattern happening here because

806
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:28,219
you just can't seem to hit a bunch of

807
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:31,369
these points you know we may also want

808
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:36,078
to say well you know this this right

809
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:41,780
here this is the step function so we may

810
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:43,010
want to do something like this and I

811
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,760
don't know if that'll improve it at all

812
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,760
but probably not

813
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,060
interesting am i doing something weird

814
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,060
here

815
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,540
so I think you know maybe the better

816
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:16,840
thing to jitter would be to jitter the

817
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:19,599
actual I value because if we jitter to

818
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,789
the actual I value then we would get we

819
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,219
would move along the spiral which would

820
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:30,070
give us better coverage right so this is

821
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:34,449
probably a bad way to do it what we

822
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:36,910
probably want to do is maybe this what

823
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:38,230
do you think about this so as we move

824
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:45,099
through

825
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:46,869
oh and also we're not actually tracking

826
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:50,279
this properly because if we actually do

827
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:53,949
the sub index here the I values are not

828
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,900
yeah are not accurate here so if we

829
00:41:53,949 --> 00:42:00,669
actually want to do this maybe this is

830
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:05,050
the better way gosh it's really tough to

831
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:07,079
think about all right so let's

832
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:09,730
restructure this loop a little bit here

833
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:11,619
because I wasn't doing it fairly there

834
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,079
because I wasn't updating the eye

835
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:16,359
properly so let's back up a second

836
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,809
rather than trying to be clever like I

837
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,700
was doing before let's forget about the

838
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:23,349
fact that we need to bundle these for

839
00:42:21,699 --> 00:42:26,379
ray tracing let's just take a look at

840
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:29,650
the thing as how the distribution is and

841
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:34,990
then we'll try to back figure out what

842
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:37,000
to do about it right and you know what

843
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:44,259
let's take out these f/32 s because what

844
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:49,780
I can do here is just say hey these will

845
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:52,090
just be f/32 so here we go now we've got

846
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,910
I think the the fairer test of this

847
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:56,920
actual 64 rather than a 16 let's take a

848
00:42:54,909 --> 00:43:00,549
look at that again now that I'm doing it

849
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,860
fairly so there's our 64 points right

850
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,400
and now what I'm going to do is I want

851
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,860
to jitter the I value so this value here

852
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,070
is what I want a jitter so I want to

853
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:15,519
take a random unilateral to push on to

854
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:18,090
that that'll basically offset us a

855
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,090
little bit

856
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:38,130
so here's now the coverage and you can

857
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:41,380
definitely see it kind of biases towards

858
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:44,309
the spiraling line right it can't seem

859
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:49,000
to get it doesn't jitter it's it's

860
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:50,860
displacement this way which I guess

861
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,730
makes sense right cuz it's just making a

862
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,380
spiral can we move this out of here it's

863
00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:04,300
just making a spiral right it's just

864
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:07,090
doing that whoa what happened oh I I

865
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,830
moved the thing over to the stairs I

866
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:15,550
always forget that we do that weird

867
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:20,009
stare camera thing where are we what's

868
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,010
going on we got issues on this

869
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:32,039
so taking a look you know it's not the

870
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,690
worst distribution in the world but it's

871
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:35,819
not the best either it's got just this

872
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,818
heavy bias towards the Rings which you

873
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:43,739
would expect right that is act not

874
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:45,509
unusual but it does seem like maybe so

875
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:47,278
jittering the eye at least is not

876
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:49,889
exactly what we would want to do there

877
00:44:47,278 --> 00:44:51,900
so I guess the next question is should

878
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:58,288
we do more of a traditional jitter on it

879
00:44:51,900 --> 00:45:01,369
you know so we could try that

880
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:03,989
so instead of doing an eye offset value

881
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:09,539
let's try going back to the kind we were

882
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:16,920
doing before where we say produce the

883
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:19,579
stable spiral because this is kind of

884
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,579
what I'm hoping for

885
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:30,240
so now if I come in here what if we were

886
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:40,830
just to say normal equals mouths normal

887
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:51,199
so I just do exactly what we were doing

888
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:54,329
before and add pure pure just pure noise

889
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:58,338
into there and again I don't know how

890
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,338
much we want to separate those out

891
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,519
so that seems reasonable right because

892
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:31,820
those do seem to be growing in a in a

893
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:35,989
sensible way let's see if we can make

894
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:40,640
that work here's if there are three

895
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:45,319
times larger you know that's not bad

896
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:48,559
it's not perfect there's a fair bit of

897
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,860
nonsense happening there but it's not

898
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,860
horrible

899
00:46:54,639 --> 00:47:00,009
you know that's it's pretty good

900
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:06,519
what's up the sample count a little more

901
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:18,699
you know it feels all right you know so

902
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:21,140
I think that's not that's not horrible

903
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:24,289
the other thing we want to do here is

904
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:25,940
remember our I values want to be denser

905
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:28,820
towards the top than towards the bottom

906
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:31,159
so if you look at it right now it's kind

907
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:35,920
of a uniform you know jitter in that

908
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:35,920
sense right

909
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:41,960
and you also kind of have this problem

910
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:45,170
where as the spiral winds down at the

911
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,849
end you kind of end up with some some

912
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,460
nonsense happening there I don't know if

913
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:51,679
we want to try and fix that either but I

914
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,699
so you know if we wanted to in here we

915
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:57,829
could make this I'd be more proportional

916
00:47:54,699 --> 00:48:01,389
so the I value that comes through here

917
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:05,869
where we're getting an index from 0 to n

918
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:08,529
you know that maybe wants to be shifted

919
00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:12,769
so it's proportional to the cosine right

920
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:17,860
so we kind of want that to be almost

921
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:21,170
inverted like so that the the value is

922
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:25,190
distributed opposite the sort of as it

923
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:29,780
folds down so what we could do here is

924
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:32,720
say well you know I don't know maybe we

925
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:35,310
square root this value or something so

926
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:47,069
that it shrinks it

927
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:49,400
it biases back and we can adjust it and

928
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,400
so on

929
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:53,669
but if you take a look at you know what

930
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:58,440
happens there and you know let me let me

931
00:48:53,670 --> 00:49:02,340
remove the sampling the over sampling

932
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:04,230
value and just take a look at one what

933
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:08,550
you can see there is like hopefully we

934
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:12,809
could make this sort of shrink back up

935
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:16,740
to the top by by changing the increment

936
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:19,889
on I now part of the problem here is

937
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:23,599
that the theta value then becomes wrong

938
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:29,639
so it's kind of a little bit tricky to

939
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:32,549
know how we would adjust that sampling

940
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:35,879
to put more samples on the top than the

941
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:39,420
bottom because as you do this equation

942
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:44,160
doesn't really walk out along the spiral

943
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:47,909
per se what it does is it knows where it

944
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:51,210
should put a point for any given step

945
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:56,159
along the I so they're kind of jumping

946
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:57,929
around so when we change the stepping on

947
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,869
I you don't get an even distribution

948
00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:03,539
anymore look that's not really very good

949
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:12,539
right although maybe you know well here

950
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:15,420
let's find out what happens yeah like

951
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:18,420
you can see what ends up happening right

952
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,980
as if you adulterer those values you get

953
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:25,940
something very different so that's a

954
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,940
little bit harder

955
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:51,000
so I'm not really sure how we would want

956
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:54,740
to address that I guess one thing we

957
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,739
could do is play with this value as well

958
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:18,269
but yeah I mean I feel like we'd have a

959
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:22,679
hard time I don't know I feel like we'd

960
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:27,750
have a hard time concentrating our

961
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:50,009
values based on cosine theta unless I'm

962
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:54,000
missing something obvious I'm not seeing

963
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:56,190
it now granted I'm not familiar with

964
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,320
these distributions so you know maybe

965
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:02,789
maybe there is an obvious way we could

966
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,350
do it but I don't know so I may say what

967
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,900
if we just created a pattern that

968
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:08,339
actually has the properties that we want

969
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:16,500
directly because we could always reuse

970
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:20,340
it right so let's just let's think about

971
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:23,550
that and and see if maybe there's a way

972
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:25,500
we can sort of say hey let's try

973
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,480
something a little bit different so

974
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:31,590
let's suppose we went in here and and

975
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:38,820
you know I keep this guy so it's you

976
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:41,000
know still there but I'm gonna go ahead

977
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,000
and

978
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:51,590
make another one here so let's suppose

979
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:53,119
we did something where we said let's

980
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:57,650
generate the points that we actually

981
00:52:53,119 --> 00:53:01,009
want so here's the points and we know we

982
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:06,559
want you know 16 of them or something or

983
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:11,530
maybe we want 64 of them to start with

984
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,529
right and I'm gonna keep the point count

985
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:17,329
and then what I'm gonna do is I'm just

986
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:20,289
gonna say like alright while the point

987
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:23,569
count is less than the array account

988
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:29,690
points again the super slow

989
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:36,530
just doing super super slow I'm gonna go

990
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:44,809
ahead and draw these in them separate

991
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:48,620
pass so while I don't have enough points

992
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:51,759
I'm going to make a new point or just

993
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:54,769
you know a new point on the hemisphere

994
00:53:51,760 --> 00:54:00,020
and I'm just gonna do that

995
00:53:54,769 --> 00:54:03,639
100% random right so I don't even care

996
00:54:00,019 --> 00:54:05,960
do not care anything about this thing

997
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:08,059
don't matter what the distribution is it

998
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,199
can be anything at all the only thing

999
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:10,639
I'm going to do is make sure that it's

1000
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,989
only pointing upward because we're not

1001
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:15,679
actually making a sphere we're making a

1002
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:17,839
hemisphere right so that's it so just

1003
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:21,679
purely whatever doesn't matter

1004
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:23,840
scattered white noise not even uniform

1005
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,579
white noise for that matter because I'm

1006
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,930
not even doing a cube and then just

1007
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:30,230
projecting it onto a sphere so just a

1008
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:32,449
complete crap distribution and that's

1009
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:39,159
fine then what I'm going to do is gonna

1010
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:39,159
say alright let's just figure out how

1011
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:48,320
close we are to any other point right so

1012
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:51,019
I'm gonna say you know I'm assuming

1013
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,850
actually missing this points valid if

1014
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:56,539
the point is valid then I'm gonna say

1015
00:54:52,849 --> 00:55:01,190
points point count plus plus

1016
00:54:56,539 --> 00:55:03,889
oops plus equals point count sorry

1017
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:06,349
equals P and that's going to retire a

1018
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:08,239
point on to our sphere so what I'm gonna

1019
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:12,170
do for test index is say well if the

1020
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:15,259
points testing this value so one of the

1021
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:20,750
ones we've already added if the length

1022
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:27,230
squared of the distance between me and

1023
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:37,519
one of the test points is less than the

1024
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:38,960
minimum distance then it's over so you

1025
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:44,119
know they have to be that close or

1026
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,470
something I don't know right so this is

1027
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:47,929
just going to put random points on the

1028
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:49,819
sphere and guarantee that no two points

1029
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:52,009
are too close together based on this

1030
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:55,220
value that we set so that will give us

1031
00:55:52,010 --> 00:56:00,070
64 of randomly generated points off we

1032
00:55:55,219 --> 00:56:00,069
go then I'm just going to draw them

1033
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:31,248
and that's it

1034
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,420
all right so this is just an exercise of

1035
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,529
placing random points on a sphere and

1036
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:49,090
then discarding points that I don't want

1037
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:51,040
until we get a uniform coverage now the

1038
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:52,660
key to getting the uniform coverage is

1039
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:54,570
to make sure that the point repulsion

1040
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:57,339
value there that minimum distance is

1041
00:56:54,570 --> 00:57:00,280
sufficient so I'm gonna go ahead and

1042
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:02,829
adjust that value now basically until

1043
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,840
our routine crashes and that sounds

1044
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:06,069
weird but that's what I'm actually gonna

1045
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:10,230
do so you notice that gets a lot more

1046
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:10,230
random let's go one more time

1047
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:18,220
see you a routine crash because now it

1048
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:19,570
can't possibly do it right we've we've

1049
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:21,519
done it in an effectively impossible

1050
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:24,780
task so we know that our answer is

1051
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,780
somewhere like this

1052
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:37,329
so there's our lovely uniform we cover

1053
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:43,509
its fear and it's quite nice as you can

1054
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:46,690
see right it's pretty lovely and off you

1055
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:48,849
go now the reason I want to try it this

1056
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:51,480
way is because now what we can do is

1057
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:55,269
adjust the minimum distance for example

1058
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,298
based on where the point ends up height

1059
00:57:55,269 --> 00:58:00,670
wise so that things down towards the

1060
00:57:58,298 --> 00:58:02,798
bottom of the sphere are spaced further

1061
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:05,409
than things up towards the top of the

1062
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:11,588
sphere and so what we can do is say

1063
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:14,649
something like you know this men

1064
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:16,980
distance squared equals whatever our

1065
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:20,079
normal minimum distance squared would be

1066
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:24,010
times one minus the Z value so that

1067
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:28,660
basically as we get higher up we are

1068
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:31,780
allowed to be closer right and so you

1069
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:33,940
know this is probably not that's

1070
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:35,710
probably more like 1.5 so you know how

1071
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:38,829
close we well how much bias do we want

1072
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:40,269
there I don't know but this way we can

1073
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:44,710
say all right you're allowed to clump

1074
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:50,798
pretty tightly at the top you're not

1075
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:53,139
allowed don't ask me why I said minimum

1076
00:58:50,798 --> 00:59:00,599
sometimes and min other times I don't

1077
00:58:53,139 --> 00:59:00,598
know there we go

1078
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,949
and so now we should be able to sort of

1079
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:13,409
adjust those values accordingly to make

1080
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:15,750
our points cluster more towards the top

1081
00:59:13,409 --> 00:59:21,088
than the bottom so let's go ahead and

1082
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:32,068
try adjusting those values towards

1083
00:59:21,088 --> 00:59:33,989
something we want so you can kind of see

1084
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:42,000
us starting to get that clumpiness that

1085
00:59:33,989 --> 00:59:44,368
I wanted right and I don't know we may

1086
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,269
want this to be a higher powered value

1087
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:49,140
too

1088
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:51,358
right like you may want this value to

1089
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:54,568
get squared or square rooted I think in

1090
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:57,838
this case since the higher the value the

1091
00:59:54,568 --> 01:00:04,230
more it subtracts out we would want to

1092
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:06,269
square root the value right to make it

1093
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:11,539
clumpy er I believe don't quote me on

1094
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:11,538
that you're wrong about that

1095
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:20,869
now I'm pretty sure it should be square

1096
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:22,670
root right although actually I suppose

1097
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:26,389
if we're this is supposed to be

1098
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:29,599
proportional to the cosine weighting so

1099
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:31,579
there should be cosine less samples at

1100
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,779
the bottom so in some sense I guess what

1101
01:00:31,579 --> 01:00:36,409
we really want to do is shove this

1102
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:38,480
through a cosine right so what we'd

1103
01:00:36,409 --> 01:00:44,179
really like to do is say okay cosine

1104
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:49,940
so the cosine at 0 is 1 and the cosine

1105
01:00:44,179 --> 01:01:01,519
at 1 is 0 so we really want that right I

1106
01:00:49,940 --> 01:01:03,769
think oh wait no that's wrong

1107
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:15,110
that's not quite right since it's an

1108
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:20,780
angle we need 0 to PI over 2 right so if

1109
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:23,269
Z is 0 then we will we will want the

1110
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:26,269
full minimum distance so we will plug in

1111
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:29,389
0 if Z is 1 so it's pointing strict

1112
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:33,650
straight up then we will have it return

1113
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:35,569
1 I'm sorry it will return 0 so you will

1114
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:38,480
use no minimum distance things can be as

1115
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:43,870
close as you want that I think is

1116
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:47,329
correct in terms of allowing clumping

1117
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:49,400
right so now in theory if we increase

1118
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,819
that clumping value I think that should

1119
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:56,599
do it

1120
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:58,309
but don't quote me on that but I think

1121
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:02,239
we should be able to clump more towards

1122
01:01:58,309 --> 01:02:05,599
the top hopefully so there's a nicely

1123
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:08,059
clumped distribution right that falls

1124
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,969
off quite a bit as it goes now I don't

1125
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:14,150
know if we really want it to fall off by

1126
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:16,789
that much you know like maybe that's too

1127
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:19,730
much and so we may still want to bias

1128
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:22,420
that coverage value a little bit so we

1129
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:26,300
may want to say like look we need a

1130
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:30,440
little bit of separation

1131
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:37,310
so we're gonna always use a little bit

1132
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:42,409
of the minimum distance right sort of as

1133
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:44,179
we go and it will go up from there so

1134
01:02:42,409 --> 01:02:45,559
then this has to be knocked back down

1135
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:54,049
again and we have to again find that

1136
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:56,900
value so this force is a little more

1137
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:58,850
repulsion at the top again and now we'll

1138
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:06,530
see as we concentrate those points a

1139
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:11,319
little bit more so it can't quite find

1140
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:11,320
them so it's again something like this

1141
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:35,280
uh so there's our clumping that's a

1142
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:40,340
little bit tighter now right and off we

1143
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:50,040
go so let's try repeating this process

1144
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:52,950
doing the whole sample count thing to do

1145
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:57,329
this 20 times so that will actually see

1146
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:59,069
how our Gajic it is basically so in here

1147
01:03:57,329 --> 01:04:01,829
I'm gonna go ahead and initialize that

1148
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:03,800
Hemi Sirius on the outside of this so

1149
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:07,380
now this little buck wiggle around right

1150
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:12,980
and that's what our coverage would look

1151
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:12,980
like over some number of frames you know

1152
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:21,480
so so there we go

1153
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:27,559
and on any given frame you know we know

1154
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:27,559
that it looks like that

1155
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:44,050
so there's one option and that seems to

1156
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:46,300
be a pretty good way to start right I

1157
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:47,890
don't know to what extent we could

1158
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,570
really do this

1159
01:04:47,889 --> 01:04:52,269
so because we now have to produce

1160
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:54,670
bundles of points right so we could

1161
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:56,380
bundle these points up now but then we

1162
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:59,590
kind of end up with this problem again

1163
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:05,260
of how do we deal with the this sort of

1164
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:07,300
spread on the points and that's a good

1165
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:14,320
question so we kind of got to think

1166
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:18,060
about this a little bit and if we if we

1167
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:20,920
were to reduce this point count to 16

1168
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:22,779
and assume that each of the points was

1169
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,880
going to get four random fan outs

1170
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:28,320
happening with it what would our values

1171
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,320
be then right

1172
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:54,699
you know that's that's what 16 looks

1173
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:54,699
like

1174
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:17,309
now it's worth noting that distance wise

1175
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:19,109
we're not using a particularly good

1176
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:20,670
measure for distance because we're using

1177
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:23,970
the Euclidean measure for distance which

1178
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:25,139
will change quite a bit so and just to

1179
01:06:23,969 --> 01:06:26,639
give you a little bit of understanding

1180
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:28,289
of what I mean by that so if you take a

1181
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:31,469
look at how the distance value is

1182
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:38,940
interpreted there what we're talking

1183
01:06:31,469 --> 01:06:40,859
about here is a hemisphere so if we take

1184
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,150
two points on the hemisphere I'm just

1185
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,530
taking the distance between them like

1186
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:45,869
that which means that if you were to

1187
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:49,620
look at a cross-section of the arc that

1188
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:51,599
kind of contains them I'm looking at

1189
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:54,179
that distance but what we really would

1190
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:57,659
probably like to look at is this right

1191
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:59,339
how how much angle is between them and

1192
01:06:57,659 --> 01:07:01,559
that may sound like fairly complicated

1193
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:04,890
but it's really not because remember we

1194
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:08,549
know that if we have two normal right so

1195
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:10,349
if I have a and B and I know that the

1196
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:14,910
length of a is one and I know that the

1197
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:19,799
length of B is also one then a transpose

1198
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:22,679
B is going to be length of a length of B

1199
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:26,370
cosine theta which means that since

1200
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:28,710
these are both 1 I know that a transpose

1201
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:31,319
B is actually just equal to cosine theta

1202
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:33,240
so I can measure the angle between them

1203
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,000
very reliably by just looking at the

1204
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:38,719
cosine right I know that cosine theta

1205
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,980
will give me exactly

1206
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:43,589
well done exactly what I want and

1207
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:46,309
furthermore if I took the eCos right I

1208
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:49,910
would know exactly what the angle was to

1209
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:53,489
so I can basically pick a minimum angle

1210
01:07:49,909 --> 01:07:56,519
if I want to write and use that minimum

1211
01:07:53,489 --> 01:08:00,539
angle instead as the comparison function

1212
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:02,009
and that gives me a better a more stable

1213
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:05,340
way to compare the disks between the

1214
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:07,410
points if I want to now it doesn't

1215
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:09,450
really matter but it's worth noting

1216
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:11,460
right that that's something we can do

1217
01:08:09,449 --> 01:08:12,899
and since we're gonna do this in a pre

1218
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,699
process anyway because it's a slow

1219
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,230
process we can trivially do that and

1220
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:18,899
just it makes it clearer what's actually

1221
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:24,059
happening right so what we can do is say

1222
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:25,769
here there's a min cosine value and

1223
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,630
that's gonna be the cosine of whatever

1224
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:30,060
the angle is that we think is the

1225
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:31,739
minimum so you know we don't know what

1226
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,660
that value is but whatever the angle

1227
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:37,710
minimum happens to be that's what it is

1228
01:08:33,659 --> 01:08:41,639
right and then we have when we go to do

1229
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:43,819
our this minimum distance squared

1230
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:47,069
sort of situation that's gonna become

1231
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:49,680
this min cosine and the exact same thing

1232
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:51,720
will happen here but we just adjust the

1233
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,970
minimum cosine instead based on where

1234
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,230
you are on the actual sphere then when

1235
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:57,000
you come here what we're actually gonna

1236
01:08:55,229 --> 01:08:58,559
say is yeah and not that at all

1237
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,630
what we're gonna do is the inner product

1238
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:04,589
of these two points and we want to make

1239
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:06,779
sure that that inner product is going to

1240
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:09,029
be less than whatever our minimum is

1241
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:13,588
right so whatever that cosine value is

1242
01:09:09,029 --> 01:09:15,449
we want to make sure that it is less now

1243
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:17,640
since we know that these have to be

1244
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:19,649
acute angles we're not letting angles go

1245
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,200
past 90 degrees we don't care about

1246
01:09:19,649 --> 01:09:24,629
negatives here so we also want to

1247
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:27,318
probably make sure that we didn't get a

1248
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:30,420
angel' that's large enough in that sense

1249
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:34,560
so what we need to actually do is change

1250
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:36,329
the way that this is phrased to saying

1251
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,160
we want to be above a minimum cosine now

1252
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:39,568
why is that the case well that's the

1253
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:42,329
case because as things get closer

1254
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:45,150
together their cosine gets closer to one

1255
01:09:42,329 --> 01:09:54,750
right so we're actually looking to

1256
01:09:45,149 --> 01:09:57,389
maintain things that are wait no let me

1257
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:58,069
say that one more time I may still be

1258
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:01,590
correct

1259
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:04,079
as things get closer together angle lies

1260
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:07,380
there value gets closer to one and we

1261
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:09,960
want to throw those out right so what we

1262
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:12,210
want to look at is we want yeah now I am

1263
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:15,510
correct so we want to look at things

1264
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:18,649
that get above a certain amount right so

1265
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:21,360
we want to look to see is this too high

1266
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:23,609
and so we probably want to phrase this

1267
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,469
and say that there's a maximum cosine

1268
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:27,929
value you can have because it's not

1269
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:31,440
really a minimum it's a maximum cosine

1270
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:33,119
value you can have right which means

1271
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:35,909
that this has to be phrased in a

1272
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:38,039
different way this is not actually

1273
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:40,849
correct anymore right

1274
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:49,170
and so the maximum cosine value here

1275
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:52,020
although we do have sort of our

1276
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:53,579
adjustment value which is fine

1277
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,350
we need to phrase this a little bit

1278
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:58,380
differently because in this case what we

1279
01:10:55,350 --> 01:11:03,750
would rather do is we want that maximum

1280
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:09,119
cosine to get higher not lower right we

1281
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:13,409
want to get higher as we go up the this

1282
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:15,569
fear right so the maximum cosine is

1283
01:11:13,409 --> 01:11:17,939
going to be rather inverted from where

1284
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:19,679
it would have been so instead we're

1285
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:27,179
gonna be doing something like you know

1286
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:28,860
1.0 F it's minus the C value so in this

1287
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:33,170
case right what we're doing is saying

1288
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:36,359
alright look if the C value is like zero

1289
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:41,310
okay so we're pointing like straight up

1290
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:44,039
right is that right no peasy would be

1291
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:45,750
one and so that's gonna be the full

1292
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:47,609
angle so that would be zero right our

1293
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:50,279
cosine would our cosine value of

1294
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:54,479
pointing straight up would be zero we

1295
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:57,569
want to use the the fullest possible

1296
01:11:54,479 --> 01:12:01,049
maximum so we get the full range as it

1297
01:11:57,569 --> 01:12:03,210
comes down right and we are plugging in

1298
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:07,230
a zero there which will give us out a

1299
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:10,829
cosine of one we therefore want to force

1300
01:12:07,229 --> 01:12:13,889
very wide angles at that point right so

1301
01:12:10,829 --> 01:12:15,779
maybe not 1.0 like still again maybe we

1302
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:18,660
give it that Headroom or something there

1303
01:12:15,779 --> 01:12:21,329
but something like that it gets it's

1304
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:23,309
gonna be closer right so then we just

1305
01:12:21,329 --> 01:12:24,329
say all right look if you dock in there

1306
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:27,210
and you end up with more than the

1307
01:12:24,329 --> 01:12:28,859
maximum you know you're invalid and

1308
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:32,340
we're gonna throw you out otherwise we

1309
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:34,319
will keep you and it's good right so

1310
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:37,650
let's go ahead and take a look in here

1311
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,819
and start updating that constant value

1312
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:41,599
and again this is the exact same process

1313
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:44,670
we did before nothing mysterious they're

1314
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,950
just using a different error metric for

1315
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:49,140
how or a different distance metric for

1316
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:51,479
how close these points are which should

1317
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:52,820
give a slightly fairer results again

1318
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:59,389
I don't know that it will necessarily

1319
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:59,389
matter in practice it's just sort of a

1320
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:04,979
using the truer measure the one that

1321
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,159
would be more is more logical for our

1322
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:14,009
situation so that we can you know just

1323
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:19,800
have a cleaner result there I think all

1324
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:22,050
right so there we go there's our

1325
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,239
distribution of points again pretty even

1326
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:26,699
on the sphere and this time based on

1327
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:29,369
angle I want to sort of be able to clump

1328
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:30,899
those towards the top more and I don't

1329
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:33,659
feel like I'm getting enough of that at

1330
01:13:30,899 --> 01:13:36,960
the moment so I don't know if maybe we

1331
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:55,309
need this to kind of drop down a little

1332
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:58,560
bit oh that's because I wasn't using it

1333
01:13:55,310 --> 01:14:02,310
all right so now let's try to spread

1334
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:06,739
these out a little more again we want to

1335
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:06,739
keep clumping at the top as necessary

1336
01:14:16,939 --> 01:14:32,399
this doesn't seem to be producing much

1337
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:33,780
repulsion here so clearly this is not

1338
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:49,170
falling off the way that I think it

1339
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:52,229
should be or something well okay so this

1340
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:54,869
would do a cosine squared fall-off so I

1341
01:14:52,229 --> 01:15:04,109
guess technically what we really want to

1342
01:14:54,869 --> 01:15:06,948
do is this right so we actually want the

1343
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:10,049
cosine value probably to be put in here

1344
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:13,769
so that the maximum cosine as the Z

1345
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:17,250
value yeah so you know this Z value

1346
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:22,679
right let's talk about this for a second

1347
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:25,710
so this Z value is gonna go I guess I'll

1348
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:28,469
be at that in there this view here will

1349
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:31,409
now go from 0 to 1/2 pi so the cosine

1350
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:33,989
value will go all the way up to 1 as the

1351
01:15:31,409 --> 01:15:36,329
I'm sorry will go all the way to 0 as

1352
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:38,698
the Z value gets to 1 and it will be

1353
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:41,640
when the Z value is actually 0 so it's

1354
01:15:38,698 --> 01:15:45,389
down at the bottom it will actually be 0

1355
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:49,140
so the maximum cosine is any thing with

1356
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:53,130
90 degrees right so we can kind of

1357
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:55,829
adjust this now by saying you know

1358
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:58,020
whatever this value is that we put in

1359
01:15:55,829 --> 01:16:01,229
here maybe we don't we probably don't

1360
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:03,750
want it to quite be that aggressive in

1361
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:05,789
terms of what we plug in angle wise so

1362
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:10,429
let's say we have a minimum angle that

1363
01:16:05,789 --> 01:16:10,429
we want to have happen there right so

1364
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:18,570
let's say we want a minimum angle of 0.1

1365
01:16:15,689 --> 01:16:22,948
radians oh well that's not 0.1 radians

1366
01:16:18,569 --> 01:16:25,859
sorry Oh point 1 pi radians and then we

1367
01:16:22,948 --> 01:16:29,129
want to use the 0.4 as the rest of our

1368
01:16:25,859 --> 01:16:33,059
sign range right and that's how we're

1369
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:35,340
gonna set up our angle you know it based

1370
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:37,320
distribution there so let's play around

1371
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,480
with this a little bit and see if that

1372
01:16:37,319 --> 01:16:44,039
maybe gets us more what we were looking

1373
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:45,209
for so am I going the right way there I

1374
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:46,079
just want to make sure before I start

1375
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:47,630
trying to tune this and they're going

1376
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:52,319
right over there

1377
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:59,118
again as Z gets larger

1378
01:16:52,319 --> 01:17:02,069
we want our cosine value to get smaller

1379
01:16:59,118 --> 01:17:13,529
and that yet and so that's not gonna

1380
01:17:02,069 --> 01:17:16,319
happen right cuz we want as we want if

1381
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:19,139
this is 0 we want the output to be close

1382
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:21,210
to zero right so we actually want that

1383
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:28,319
to be minus we have that going the

1384
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:30,118
opposite direction all right so let's

1385
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:37,139
take a look and maybe that's too much

1386
01:17:30,118 --> 01:17:39,689
right in terms of of max cosines there

1387
01:17:37,139 --> 01:17:41,130
so we may want the thing to never quite

1388
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:43,879
get there right we may want something

1389
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:43,880
more like this

1390
01:17:49,939 --> 01:18:05,279
it's still not quite right so yeah we

1391
01:17:54,899 --> 01:18:07,199
could say that what am I doing wrong

1392
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,809
here feel like this should be okay right

1393
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:14,429
because the maximum cosine value here

1394
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:25,020
you know as we want it to be close to

1395
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:26,970
zero right I mean if we put cosine zero

1396
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:34,620
in the mat cosine would be 1 and nothing

1397
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:38,520
would be over it right I mean let's

1398
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:47,430
suppose we just do this no waiting at

1399
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:50,150
all so that angle still too large

1400
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:50,150
apparently

1401
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:03,199
and that angle isn't so that angle is

1402
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:06,380
supposedly our our neutral angle right

1403
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:09,079
like that's close enough so now if we

1404
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:10,550
actually went in here and said well okay

1405
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:11,720
as you get closer to the top

1406
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:12,920
you should get even lower this should

1407
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,590
definitely work because now you have

1408
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:18,649
even more room virtual room to place

1409
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:21,010
these points right at least I would

1410
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:21,009
think so

1411
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:27,340
so I should be able to increase this

1412
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:27,340
value

1413
01:19:50,408 --> 01:19:55,170
so it still feels like I should be able

1414
01:19:52,779 --> 01:19:57,789
to go a little bit more than that in

1415
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:59,829
terms of repulsion I also think actually

1416
01:19:57,789 --> 01:20:02,010
clumping wise I'm you know let me

1417
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:02,010
actually

1418
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:23,539
so that's starting to look pretty good

1419
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:34,979
so three nice two did not work right

1420
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:37,470
that was crashy yeah should write a

1421
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:40,979
little program that just finds out it's

1422
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:44,240
just like for any given value figures

1423
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:44,239
out where the crash point is

1424
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:20,350
2.8

1425
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,920
so I also want to try upping the sample

1426
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,439
count here so I can see what happens

1427
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,710
over several frames like what we end up

1428
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:39,710
with

1429
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:05,750
and I'm not really sure why we are

1430
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:13,340
getting that kind of somewhat clumping

1431
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:16,100
behavior there I don't know if that's

1432
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:17,750
somehow related to the way we're doing

1433
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,910
the randomness or if our random number

1434
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:24,738
generator because it's an XOR shift just

1435
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:29,840
isn't good enough that I really just

1436
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:36,289
don't know so it's kind of difficult to

1437
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:38,050
say what should be happening there right

1438
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:43,250
[Music]

1439
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:47,420
but it feels a little off if we do an

1440
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:50,630
aggressive over sampling so much more so

1441
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:54,489
than we would expect in practice how

1442
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:54,489
does that look does it still have them I

1443
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:05,149
mean it's tough to say because it's one

1444
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:10,039
of those things where you're like maybe

1445
01:23:05,149 --> 01:23:12,049
that's correct it's really hard to say

1446
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:14,329
it may actually be though that you know

1447
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:16,310
the XOR shift really does want to be

1448
01:23:14,329 --> 01:23:19,519
modified because the XOR shift may have

1449
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:25,280
problems with successive values not

1450
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:27,080
producing good pairwise values so we may

1451
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:32,300
want to look at that a little more

1452
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:35,079
carefully right because that could be

1453
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,079
affecting us there

1454
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:42,899
yeah it's hard to say so anyway what we

1455
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:44,939
could do now is take a look at what

1456
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:47,069
would happen sample wise if we did

1457
01:23:44,939 --> 01:23:49,409
something slightly different which is to

1458
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:55,979
say we could say let's keep the sample

1459
01:23:49,409 --> 01:23:58,559
count here as one and then instead what

1460
01:23:55,979 --> 01:24:01,639
we'll do here is we'll do 20 samples of

1461
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:06,710
the samples we have with a displacement

1462
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:16,619
so we'll say that the normal equals

1463
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:24,960
normalizer zero of the points point

1464
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:33,899
index and for each one of those points

1465
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:37,430
will do a displacement actually you know

1466
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:37,429
what I I'm just gonna do this way

1467
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:57,180
so if we take a look at this

1468
01:24:54,350 --> 01:25:00,360
displacement based method here so we'll

1469
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:03,360
say all right let's suppose that for

1470
01:25:00,359 --> 01:25:06,239
each of these points let's suppose that

1471
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:11,849
we did a random displacement around the

1472
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:14,010
points each time and draw what that

1473
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:15,900
looks like and furthermore we can do 20

1474
01:25:14,010 --> 01:25:19,949
times 4 cuz that's roughly how many

1475
01:25:15,899 --> 01:25:21,839
samples we'll take 4 per you know every

1476
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:23,429
ray will be a bundle of 4 and we'll do

1477
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,140
it over 20 frames it's kind of what we

1478
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:26,820
were doing before what would that look

1479
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:28,350
like

1480
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:30,029
if we put a little bit in there oh you

1481
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:41,970
know what that's way too much randomness

1482
01:25:30,029 --> 01:25:44,279
though I don't want it that random so

1483
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,780
here's what that would look like and

1484
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:48,829
again you can see sort of the random

1485
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:51,509
patches spreading out a little bit there

1486
01:25:48,829 --> 01:25:54,600
and so if I go ahead and make those

1487
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:57,539
random patch spreads be you know a

1488
01:25:54,600 --> 01:26:00,690
little bit wider you can see that it's

1489
01:25:57,539 --> 01:26:04,710
actually relatively good in terms of

1490
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:08,899
coverage there it's not too bad but you

1491
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:11,159
know yeah it could it be better probably

1492
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:13,259
what we could also look at here is this

1493
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:17,069
spread wants to be based on the Z to a

1494
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:22,579
certain extent so we want to you know do

1495
01:26:17,069 --> 01:26:22,579
something probably more like this

1496
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,970
where we have some current sort of

1497
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,620
minimum displacements and then we're

1498
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:38,600
gonna get some amount of displacement

1499
01:26:36,619 --> 01:26:40,250
from the sea so that things on top which

1500
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,910
are supposed to be clustered closer

1501
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:45,739
together anyway get less randomness

1502
01:26:43,909 --> 01:26:47,840
added to the you know less spread to

1503
01:26:45,739 --> 01:26:50,119
their samples than ones that are further

1504
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,880
down which you know maybe have to get

1505
01:26:50,119 --> 01:26:55,189
more so as the Z gets lower we want more

1506
01:26:52,880 --> 01:27:00,319
I guess that actually means we want this

1507
01:26:55,189 --> 01:27:04,879
kind of a thing right so we get the

1508
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:14,210
maximum when Z is lowest and the minimum

1509
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:17,239
when Z is highest so something like that

1510
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:20,980
not sure exactly how much you know that

1511
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:20,979
should factor in but something like this

1512
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:48,830
seems not too too horrible and if we

1513
01:27:46,699 --> 01:27:50,479
take a look at one of these again just

1514
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:56,899
so I can understand what would happen if

1515
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:58,459
whoops - just one of them you know how

1516
01:27:56,899 --> 01:28:01,149
bad is it we want to make sure that it's

1517
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:08,890
still fairly uniform for any given one

1518
01:28:01,149 --> 01:28:08,889
so actually that's I guess that's four

1519
01:28:11,949 --> 01:28:16,519
and so that that really doesn't help us

1520
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:20,239
much with the uniformity if we do it

1521
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:22,400
that way you know so I kind of think

1522
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:24,050
we're I kind of think it may be a losing

1523
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:26,989
battle to do it that way I think we're

1524
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:34,159
gonna have to distribute the 64 points

1525
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:35,929
as 64 points and go from there which is

1526
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:40,609
not fabulous but I think that's what

1527
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:42,289
we're gonna have to do and then we'll

1528
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:45,170
just have to figure out a way to

1529
01:28:42,289 --> 01:28:46,729
randomize those much more tightly or you

1530
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:51,409
know jitter them much more slightly than

1531
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:57,889
we were I'm not sure but doesn't look

1532
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:59,960
good for doing him in in sort of a 16

1533
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:03,730
than random 4 way which is what we would

1534
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:03,730
have liked but it doesn't look likely

1535
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:12,409
okay so let's take a look here we need

1536
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:14,779
to adjust this then for doing a full 64

1537
01:29:12,409 --> 01:29:17,869
point distribution because this is going

1538
01:29:14,779 --> 01:29:22,809
to be too much spread for these so

1539
01:29:17,869 --> 01:29:26,659
generally speaking we need a wider angle

1540
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:29,870
we need to make max cosine be a lower

1541
01:29:26,659 --> 01:29:34,099
value so the the value inside has to go

1542
01:29:29,869 --> 01:29:36,619
up right we have to get the these this

1543
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:41,960
value to be you know higher than it

1544
01:29:36,619 --> 01:29:44,890
should be right or I should say higher

1545
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,890
than it then it

1546
01:29:47,569 --> 01:29:54,630
sorry this values to be lower so the max

1547
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,609
cosine will be higher right so you know

1548
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:59,039
this this has to get knocked down I'm

1549
01:29:56,609 --> 01:30:00,149
not sure to where exactly but you know

1550
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:04,310
it has to be knocked down significantly

1551
01:30:00,149 --> 01:30:04,309
so we can just do a quick test to see

1552
01:30:19,319 --> 01:30:30,399
all right so there's 64 points repulsion

1553
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:30,939
wise let's go ahead and knock this value

1554
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:36,029
down a little

1555
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:36,029
OOP that's nope not what we wanted

1556
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:39,480
that's what I meant

1557
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:56,869
and maybe we can go ahead and knock this

1558
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,869
value up slightly

1559
01:31:04,809 --> 01:31:16,269
all right so let's take a look at this

1560
01:31:11,238 --> 01:31:16,268
distribution see every think of it

1561
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:31,440
so that does look pretty nice you know

1562
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:59,340
I think I think I'd be happy with that

1563
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:56,630
yeah and that seems pretty good so what

1564
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:59,449
we could do next time is we could then

1565
01:32:56,630 --> 01:33:01,789
try to bundle these into into ray

1566
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:03,590
bundles that make sense right so you

1567
01:33:01,789 --> 01:33:05,840
know try to cast like those four

1568
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:09,460
together and those four together

1569
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:12,500
whatever those four right try to produce

1570
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:14,260
segments on this that are you know as

1571
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,430
closely you know as compact as possible

1572
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:19,220
to maximize the chances that they

1573
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:20,659
Traverse and hit the same things so

1574
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:22,280
let's go ahead to a quick Q&amp;A and then

1575
01:33:20,659 --> 01:33:27,699
we'll finish up that because that's

1576
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:27,699
about all the time we have for today

1577
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:01,050
what do you think about a compile-time

1578
01:33:58,609 --> 01:34:03,299
switch to flip between pseudo-rng and

1579
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:10,440
senator Angie to see if it's an iron G

1580
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:19,890
issue I'm sorry I what's a what's a

1581
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:23,059
standard RNG I'm not sure I know what a

1582
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:23,060
standard orangy is

1583
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:39,039
Nixie why can't we use the spiral method

1584
01:34:36,609 --> 01:34:41,079
to generate 64 points that we group into

1585
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,939
16 groups of four based on direction and

1586
01:34:41,079 --> 01:34:45,039
then rotate the spiral 18 degrees over

1587
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:47,948
20 frames to samples the reason is

1588
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:50,829
because that won't cover the hemisphere

1589
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:53,678
like remember how it it produces sort of

1590
01:34:50,829 --> 01:34:55,899
steps along and if we rotate them it

1591
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:59,469
will just produce slices like us like a

1592
01:34:55,899 --> 01:35:03,250
peeled orange so we need ways of

1593
01:34:59,469 --> 01:35:06,130
displacing our points laterally as well

1594
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:07,539
and I'm not sure exactly how we want to

1595
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:09,699
do that yet

1596
01:35:07,539 --> 01:35:12,460
but we definitely need jittering more

1597
01:35:09,698 --> 01:35:17,339
than just rotation we need to jitter

1598
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:19,750
vertically as well if that makes sense

1599
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,610
what about a pre computed sample sphere

1600
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:23,439
that you rotate over the frame period

1601
01:35:21,609 --> 01:35:27,960
instead of random Jerry jittery

1602
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:27,960
so again rotation doesn't help us

1603
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:36,070
the problem with rotation is that we

1604
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:37,689
need to rotate on all axes and then a

1605
01:35:36,069 --> 01:35:41,409
part of our hemisphere would kind of dip

1606
01:35:37,689 --> 01:35:44,259
away right so remember let's say you

1607
01:35:41,409 --> 01:35:45,849
take a look at a particular cross

1608
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:48,039
section of your sphere right and you've

1609
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:51,400
got points here here and here

1610
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:54,010
right well rotation does give you the

1611
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:56,198
coverage this way but it gives you no

1612
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:58,960
more coverage this way so if there was

1613
01:35:56,198 --> 01:36:00,448
no point in this region anywhere in the

1614
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,939
ring on your initial random distribution

1615
01:36:00,448 --> 01:36:05,889
rotating it won't cover it right so you

1616
01:36:03,939 --> 01:36:08,109
need ways of of doing lateral

1617
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:10,030
displacement as well and so we need our

1618
01:36:08,109 --> 01:36:14,849
scheme to have lateral displacement as

1619
01:36:10,029 --> 01:36:14,849
well does that make sense

1620
01:36:18,389 --> 01:36:22,440
and that's true for the spiral as well

1621
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,590
the spiral will never give us what we

1622
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:28,919
actually want unless we jitter the

1623
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:30,389
spirals yeah I mean the spiral is a hard

1624
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,100
distribution to think about I feel like

1625
01:36:30,389 --> 01:36:34,770
it's kind of not one I really want to

1626
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:36,510
use largely because I feel like it would

1627
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:38,070
take a while for us to intuit it now if

1628
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:39,179
we actually sat down and really studied

1629
01:36:38,069 --> 01:36:41,219
it then I think we could play with the

1630
01:36:39,179 --> 01:36:45,630
formula and make it work but I'm just

1631
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:47,908
not sure about that off-axis rotation

1632
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:50,279
will cause our points to dip below the

1633
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:52,679
hemisphere so one of the problems is we

1634
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:55,559
need it to never be in the bottom

1635
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:57,210
hemisphere if we do an off axis rotation

1636
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,580
some of the points that we're low will

1637
01:36:57,210 --> 01:37:01,618
cross into here and that's unacceptable

1638
01:36:59,579 --> 01:37:03,630
we definitely can't have that because

1639
01:37:01,618 --> 01:37:05,399
then we're casting backwards into the

1640
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:08,090
interior of a volume which we really

1641
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:08,089
don't want to do

1642
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:26,979
hopefully that makes sense so yeah you

1643
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:33,520
know I don't know that we maybe the

1644
01:37:26,979 --> 01:37:35,439
right answer is to kind of like maybe

1645
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,050
the right answer is to study this the

1646
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:40,089
spiral formula and making a new adapted

1647
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:41,970
formula that's basically the same as the

1648
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:44,380
spiral formula that allows us to produce

1649
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:47,440
randomly spaced points in a specific way

1650
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:50,400
that we want that allows the for the

1651
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:50,399
jitter but I don't know

1652
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:06,640
I mean yet another way to do it would be

1653
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:09,400
to just produce quadrant based stuff

1654
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:14,320
where we just divide the sphere up into

1655
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:18,659
64 slices that we then randomly pick one

1656
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,659
point inside right

1657
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:39,579
and that might be good right best allies

1658
01:38:36,969 --> 01:38:42,579
the CRTs random number generator is

1659
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:44,680
complete garbage so you wouldn't compare

1660
01:38:42,579 --> 01:38:47,079
against that one if you were you'd have

1661
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:55,390
to go get we'd have to maybe implement

1662
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:57,550
one of the PC R G's like from O'Neill's

1663
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:59,560
paper or something because the see

1664
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:01,119
random the C runtime numbers R and our

1665
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,980
dinner is like the worst one ever

1666
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:07,238
those are linear congruential generators

1667
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:16,089
which are complete garbage right in fact

1668
01:39:07,238 --> 01:39:20,169
I can show you like X or shift is better

1669
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:22,440
than the C runtime libraries one if that

1670
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:22,440
makes sense

1671
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:50,140
where is that this is not what I want

1672
01:39:54,430 --> 01:40:01,570
that is not what I want at all no false

1673
01:39:58,569 --> 01:40:01,569
incorrect

1674
01:40:20,329 --> 01:40:23,409
this is so annoying

1675
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,130
this right

1676
01:40:38,618 --> 01:40:42,929
no still not right

1677
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:59,520
there yeah that's what I actually wanted

1678
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:06,230
and now so let's see if we can get it

1679
01:41:04,448 --> 01:41:09,489
Rand in here

1680
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:09,489
[Music]

1681
01:41:33,059 --> 01:41:37,550
come on it's got to be around in here

1682
01:41:34,889 --> 01:41:37,550
somewhere folks

1683
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:43,748
you know what forget it

1684
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:20,840
okay are we ever going to actually

1685
01:42:36,229 --> 01:42:53,769
so I think this is it

1686
01:42:56,498 --> 01:43:03,969
maybe not how is this the is this really

1687
01:43:00,948 --> 01:43:03,969
ran this is nuts

1688
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:21,038
this looks more like it there's the mall

1689
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:21,038
there's the ad there's the shift

1690
01:43:30,689 --> 01:43:34,299
well I wanted to show you the source

1691
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:35,440
code to it but unfortunately all I would

1692
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:37,420
be able to trace the assembly but it's

1693
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,368
just a that's all it is it's a multiply

1694
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:40,929
and add in a shift for a linear

1695
01:43:39,368 --> 01:43:44,469
congruential generator so that was the

1696
01:43:40,929 --> 01:43:48,779
code right there for it and so it's not

1697
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:48,779
like some good random number generator I

1698
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:53,100
it's just this

1699
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:07,720
right

1700
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:11,519
that's all it is

1701
01:44:10,109 --> 01:44:13,079
and you don't need to do the modulus

1702
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,600
because if you're just using the entire

1703
01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:16,920
number range this this is what you do

1704
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,570
afterwards to produce a particular

1705
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,079
random between some number and some

1706
01:44:18,569 --> 01:44:24,719
other number

1707
01:44:19,079 --> 01:44:26,670
so it's just this right and then the you

1708
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:29,399
know the well I guess this is probably

1709
01:44:26,670 --> 01:44:31,050
the shift right if you're doing one

1710
01:44:29,399 --> 01:44:38,699
that's just used as a power of two then

1711
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:40,890
it's just a shift right unfortunately we

1712
01:44:38,699 --> 01:44:42,449
don't have the source code to the MSB

1713
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:44,039
CRT to show you that that's just what

1714
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:47,059
it's doing but that's what the you know

1715
01:44:44,039 --> 01:44:47,060
that's what it was right

1716
01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:56,810
long believes this intended as a

1717
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:58,069
pre-press a stepper all these

1718
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:59,480
hemispheres your computer for every quad

1719
01:44:58,069 --> 01:45:02,779
every frame I'll probably a combination

1720
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:06,649
of two steps a pre-computation step and

1721
01:45:02,779 --> 01:45:09,139
then a per quad step and so we have to

1722
01:45:06,649 --> 01:45:11,539
keep the per quad part simple but the

1723
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:15,289
pre process step can be as complicated

1724
01:45:11,539 --> 01:45:16,579
as we want really could anything be done

1725
01:45:15,289 --> 01:45:18,260
with a centroidal Voronoi tessellation

1726
01:45:16,579 --> 01:45:19,760
covering the sphere is that too

1727
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:21,260
expensive is a terrible idea I know

1728
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,690
that's sort of what we're talking about

1729
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:25,250
like once I've produced these points on

1730
01:45:23,689 --> 01:45:27,198
the sphere you know maybe we produce

1731
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:29,840
regions that are sort of like a Voronoi

1732
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:32,269
region for each one of them and we

1733
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:35,300
randomized in between those right so we

1734
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:38,270
I don't know we'll see could we get a

1735
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:39,800
relatively performant blue noise yes you

1736
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:42,080
can do a relatively performant blue

1737
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:43,250
noise I'm doing the simplest way of

1738
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:44,809
producing blue noise but there's a lot

1739
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:48,500
of ways you can do it faster you still

1740
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:52,400
wouldn't want to do it for every quad no

1741
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:54,590
matter what you do but you can do it

1742
01:45:52,399 --> 01:45:56,569
much faster than what I'm doing in fact

1743
01:45:54,590 --> 01:45:59,900
I even have a thing I talked about that

1744
01:45:56,569 --> 01:46:04,029
on my blog in fact when I was talking

1745
01:45:59,899 --> 01:46:04,029
about the witnesses grass sampling thing

1746
01:46:16,269 --> 01:46:21,458
so I think gets in here

1747
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:41,760
yeah so here is you know the way that

1748
01:46:39,539 --> 01:46:49,140
we're doing it in him adhere right now

1749
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:54,600
is this graph and this is the the graph

1750
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:56,700
of it's the same as this graph in this

1751
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,470
graph are the same it's just a scaled

1752
01:46:56,699 --> 01:47:03,059
version that includes the highest point

1753
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:06,869
right and so here I talk about how you

1754
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:08,010
get rid of that here's the graph of you

1755
01:47:06,869 --> 01:47:10,949
know if you if you write the algorithm

1756
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:14,310
properly of how many test points you

1757
01:47:10,949 --> 01:47:16,500
need four point inserted then you can

1758
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:26,310
read about that here so it's a slog

1759
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:29,119
entry number ten so all right I'm gonna

1760
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:29,120
wrap things up

1761
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:41,109
thank you for joining me for those sort

1762
01:47:39,849 --> 01:47:44,409
of handmade hero so I'm pepper coating

1763
01:47:41,109 --> 01:47:45,879
with you as always next weekend well I

1764
01:47:44,408 --> 01:47:47,708
guess we won't have to replace cosine

1765
01:47:45,878 --> 01:47:50,319
and sine just yet because we still have

1766
01:47:47,708 --> 01:47:51,849
more stuff we can try just in terms of

1767
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:54,248
getting our Hemisphere sampling the way

1768
01:47:51,849 --> 01:47:56,469
we want it so maybe next weekend won't

1769
01:47:54,248 --> 01:47:58,090
have to happen but you know as you can

1770
01:47:56,469 --> 01:47:59,288
see we've got cut sine and cosine in

1771
01:47:58,090 --> 01:48:01,689
there now we don't know how much more

1772
01:47:59,288 --> 01:48:02,648
we'll have to do with it but you know

1773
01:48:01,689 --> 01:48:03,939
we're definitely getting to the point

1774
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:05,378
where we want to replace it anyways

1775
01:48:03,939 --> 01:48:06,878
because it's you know it's happening

1776
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:08,069
it's being used for real in the code

1777
01:48:06,878 --> 01:48:10,418
base now

1778
01:48:08,069 --> 01:48:11,889
so we want to get rid of the C runtime

1779
01:48:10,418 --> 01:48:12,488
library and that's something that's on

1780
01:48:11,889 --> 01:48:14,319
the hopper

1781
01:48:12,488 --> 01:48:15,938
but we can do more because we're only

1782
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:17,319
using the pre-computation step now so we

1783
01:48:15,939 --> 01:48:18,729
don't really care how fast it is and

1784
01:48:17,319 --> 01:48:20,469
maybe we end up only using it the

1785
01:48:18,729 --> 01:48:21,939
pre-computation step in case we in which

1786
01:48:20,469 --> 01:48:23,979
case we really don't care how fast it is

1787
01:48:21,939 --> 01:48:25,780
and it won't force the issue

1788
01:48:23,979 --> 01:48:27,609
but either way we've got at least one

1789
01:48:25,779 --> 01:48:29,828
more weekend we can do without having to

1790
01:48:27,609 --> 01:48:31,229
replace it so next weekend we'll play

1791
01:48:29,828 --> 01:48:33,878
around the sampling a little bit more I

1792
01:48:31,229 --> 01:48:35,679
hope to see you back here for that until

1793
01:48:33,878 --> 01:48:37,899
then if you want to follow along with

1794
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:39,368
source code you can always pre-order the

1795
01:48:37,899 --> 01:48:40,599
game on hand made here at organic comes

1796
01:48:39,368 --> 01:48:42,219
the source code so you can play around

1797
01:48:40,599 --> 01:48:43,418
through OMS your sampling and see if you

1798
01:48:42,219 --> 01:48:46,989
can come up with a good hemisphere to

1799
01:48:43,418 --> 01:48:48,550
sample for our lighting purposes that's

1800
01:48:46,988 --> 01:48:49,328
about it for today hope see you back

1801
01:48:48,550 --> 01:48:51,340
here next week

1802
01:48:49,328 --> 01:48:53,378
until then have fun programming and I'll

1803
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:55,649
see everyone on the Internet take it

1804
01:48:53,378 --> 01:48:55,649
easy everybody
