1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,028
start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:10,829
welcome to handmade hero the show recode

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:14,279
a complete game live on stream you know

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,589
I guess now that I've said this multiple

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,329
times when we started like all this week

6
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:19,679
I think I opened with we're going to get

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,198
to play around with our debug

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,939
visualization today but every day we

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,070
were thwarted because we had like some

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,500
nasty bug stuff that happened and and

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,210
things like this and so here it is

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,429
thursday and we have not got to do it

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,710
and i think now we can actually do it

14
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,390
because all of our stuff is working and

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,920
we actually will get the chance to do

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,058
that so i would like to actually do that

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,320
because i've been wanting to do it for a

18
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:42,750
while so i'm looking forward to it so i

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,609
have to jump right in today is day 1 88

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,128
so if you want to follow along if you

21
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:51,359
ordered if you pre-order the game on

22
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:53,549
handmade here org you want to unpack day

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,719
187 source code because that's what i'm

24
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,009
starting with today so if you're trying

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,609
to follow along at home that's that's

26
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:04,019
where you're at that's what you're doing

27
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:10,079
so let's go ahead and open open up the

28
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:12,140
old give it the old Emacs here and let's

29
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,530
let's just take a look at where we were

30
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,920
so here was our debug sort of you know

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,359
our debug output and you know there's a

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,700
couple things that you kind of notice

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,819
you're there one of the things that that

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,490
is clearly true as I kind of look at it

35
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,559
is it gets a lot slower as the game goes

36
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,298
and I think that makes sense because the

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,859
number of events remember we're just

38
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,130
kind of piling them up into a buffer

39
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:40,170
until we get 64 frames worth of debug

40
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:42,798
events that we're processing through and

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,079
when you think about what that means I

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,640
feel like that sort of suggests that we

43
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:49,529
don't want to be processing everything

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,540
all together like that right we probably

45
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,280
want to process as soon as we see a

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,070
frame boundary kind of like store off

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,399
the debug information for that frame in

48
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:02,819
a processed fashion I would think so

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,820
that we can then you know we can

50
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:07,679
essentially avoid this whole nastiness

51
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,929
so I feel like there's some optimization

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,120
that we want to do there but I'm just

53
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,560
gonna instead of doing that I think what

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,390
I'd rather do is just set the

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,729
number of debug frames down to a low

56
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,169
number so that we can play around the

57
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,199
visualization because I want to do that

58
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:23,549
first before i try to do any sort of

59
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,019
optimization stuff because I've been

60
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,310
like i said but want to do that for a

61
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,709
while but we kinda had to put it off for

62
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,659
bugs i'd like to do that before we kind

63
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,060
of go back in and look at how do we keep

64
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,859
it performant and keep it from taking

65
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,319
some you know too much of our time or

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,150
something like that so the max debug

67
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,818
event array count you know if i were to

68
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,430
set that down from 34 to something like

69
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:47,518
eight right so that we have a lot less

70
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,890
frames to deal with i strongly suspect

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,009
yeah so you can see how the frame rate

72
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:55,169
is drastically better right so what that

73
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,939
suggests to me is that processing the

74
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:59,339
frame information like we could easily

75
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:02,489
test be testing the game in this in this

76
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,140
at this frame rate this is fine and this

77
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,030
is still doing eight frames so it would

78
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,629
be eight faster eight times faster if we

79
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:13,110
only did one right or I should say it

80
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,370
would take 18 the time so it looks to me

81
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,500
like that's going to be a good solution

82
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,969
for us going forward so we can do that

83
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,769
before we kind of move off this we can

84
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:22,319
spend a little time making sure that we

85
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,969
kind of do one at a time that way but in

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,709
the meantime what I want to do like I

87
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,810
said first I'd like to spend a few days

88
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,180
making the system into something that's

89
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,739
useful to us in terms of visualization

90
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,000
because right now we can sort of start

91
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,230
to see you like we're getting there's

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,639
some information that we get from this

93
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:37,318
we can see we can visualize how our

94
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,818
threads are working like we can see how

95
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,318
long it takes to the thread psychic in

96
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,238
we can see the threads doing their

97
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,768
rendering work here and how much time

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,870
they're using to do that we could see

99
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,250
the debug rendering happening up here we

100
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,109
can see what we're doing in terms of

101
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,280
processing the debug information and how

102
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:51,810
long that takes and then waiting for

103
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,310
frames we can see all that stuff

104
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,568
happening so we we're already getting a

105
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,489
little bit of heads up but it's really

106
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,810
pretty janky right it's pretty ugly it's

107
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,209
hard to see what's going on and more

108
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,400
importantly well two things more

109
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,620
importantly I can't actually like hover

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,139
over any of this and find out what the

111
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,689
actual bars correspond to even though

112
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,340
you know we have that information right

113
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,680
so I can't do that and furthermore

114
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,048
there's no way for me to like zoom in on

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,319
this or open up one of these bars and

116
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,259
say hey you know show me for this

117
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,089
particular bar right that we got here we

118
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,009
may know a lot more information about

119
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,209
what's actually happening in here like

120
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,000
what it's what child

121
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,680
process what child functions were extra

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,589
in there and which ones took time and

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,990
that sort of thing but we have no way of

124
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,848
interfacing with that so what I'd like

125
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,160
to do is I'd like to open this up a bit

126
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:43,560
a try to make a little bit of a UI for

127
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,050
it essentially where we can navigate

128
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,978
through the debug information in a way

129
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,720
that allows us to actually get get out

130
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,848
what's what's already being recorded

131
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,500
because right now we have a tremendous

132
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:56,879
amount of information we recorded we

133
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,709
just don't have any way of actually

134
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,870
looking at it it's a visualization

135
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:02,189
problem basically and that's what i want

136
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,660
to start tackling because the only way

137
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:05,579
this debug information is actually going

138
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,939
to do us the kind of good that i want it

139
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:12,089
to do is if we can you know quickly get

140
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,740
what we need out of it so the first

141
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:16,288
thing that I'd like to do is just make a

142
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,329
little something so that I can interact

143
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:21,269
with these things some way that I could

144
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:22,769
like click on a bar for example I just

145
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:26,579
want to start with something like that

146
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:28,948
so how would we do that right well if

147
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,560
you remember a long time ago we actually

148
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,478
did include and I should probably open

149
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,810
up a my platform here we did include

150
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,758
mouse right so there's the mouse in our

151
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,949
game input we've got Mouse x we've got

152
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,020
mouse why we even have mousey I don't

153
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:44,819
know if we ever implemented mousey I'm

154
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,008
not sure we actually did that that's the

155
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,158
mouse wheel and I don't know if we ever

156
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:53,879
sort win32 handmade I don't think we

157
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:55,408
ever did that but maybe I'm wrong yeah

158
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,639
we don't support mouthfeel yet so we

159
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:58,079
haven't actually implemented that in the

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,348
platform layer so we wouldn't get any of

161
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,209
those but we did implement the the rest

162
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:05,908
of the stuff so in terms of getting the

163
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,319
mouse the mouse buttons and the XY

164
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,939
position of the mouse that's actually

165
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,250
stuff that we can already do for free it

166
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,810
just comes in and we can use it so what

167
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,810
I'd like to do is I'd like to go ahead

168
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,079
and implement just some light you I so

169
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,759
that we can we can browse that debug

170
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,079
information so let's start with the

171
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,218
simplest possible thing I'm gonna do the

172
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,959
simplest possible things r it's just to

173
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:26,069
show you how we're going to do that and

174
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,149
we'll talk a little about it the

175
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,009
simplest possible thing I think would

176
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,019
just be hover I just want to be able to

177
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,180
hover the mouse over one of those bars

178
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:35,459
and then I want when I hover over the

179
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,610
bar I want to show me I'll just have it

180
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:40,099
print out let's say I want it to print

181
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,470
out what the

182
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,879
name of that function was right just

183
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,000
like like what's the function that I'm

184
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,170
hovering over right now so in order to

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,819
do that the first thing you have to do

186
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,620
is you have to get the mouse information

187
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,769
to the debug system right because it

188
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,600
comes in and and and it doesn't actually

189
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:58,669
the cut there's no conduit right there's

190
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,860
no way to actually get that information

191
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,180
down and so what I'd like to do is just

192
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,400
take a look here we've got this debug

193
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,920
overlay it gets past the game memory it

194
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,479
does not get past any game input and so

195
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,400
what I'd like to do there again is just

196
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,330
have some way and we'll do the simplest

197
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,729
way possible you may have to upgrade

198
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:15,859
this a little bit in the future as we do

199
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,530
more in terms of game input but for

200
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,870
right now it should be sufficient when

201
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:23,000
we are here in you know our main routine

202
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,949
our land of people who have not kind of

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,050
been then sort of cleaned up and moved

204
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,209
out yet our game update and render

205
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,250
that's got the game input here right it

206
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:33,109
has the game input so all I'm going to

207
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,000
do is I'm going to start passing that

208
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,520
game input directly into the debugger

209
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,129
let's say here you go you can have that

210
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,229
now so then we have game input we've got

211
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:44,269
that and so in here we now know what the

212
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,439
XY location of the mass is we could just

213
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,259
look it up directly in there and that's

214
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:51,139
no problem right so now what I'm going

215
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:54,949
to do is I'm going to say well if we

216
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,990
take a look we've got in here we have

217
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:00,469
these rectangles right and we're putting

218
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,379
those rectangles you know onto onto the

219
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,780
render stack if we have the rectangle

220
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:07,250
and we have the mouse x and y there's no

221
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,809
reason we can't just compare those two

222
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,129
and figure out whether or not there's a

223
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,110
particular rectangle that we're over

224
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,540
right that should be a very simple

225
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,129
simple thing to do so what I can do

226
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,430
inside this routine is I can just say

227
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,409
like okay you know if like Mouse in

228
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,750
rectangle or something like that right

229
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,120
and I can just pass it like maybe the

230
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,670
input struct or whatever if I if the

231
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,230
mass is in the rectangle and and then

232
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,810
I'm going to have the rectangle somehow

233
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,490
so I'm just going to say rectangle here

234
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,500
if the mouse is in the rectangle then

235
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,269
what I'd like to do is output a line of

236
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,799
debug texts like because we already have

237
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,899
that going so I'll just use it right

238
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,699
we'll just go ahead and output a line of

239
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:48,319
debug text again doing the simplest

240
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,940
possible thing here I wanna well you

241
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,230
know what I can even grab the code here

242
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,170
this is the code that actually is

243
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,120
exactly what we want

244
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:55,799
right so all I'm going to do is when you

245
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,560
mouse in that rectangle I'm just going

246
00:08:55,799 --> 00:09:00,719
to go ahead and say ok if the mouse is

247
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,119
in the rectangle go ahead and output a

248
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,649
debug line of text that happens to be

249
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,299
all of the information that we use to

250
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,399
print out for one of these guys like

251
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:10,528
cycle counts hit counts that sort of

252
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,690
thing right so how do I get that

253
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:16,259
information out of this particular thing

254
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,810
in this case when we do the region stuff

255
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:21,448
you know I've got this these these debug

256
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,239
regions I need some way of having the

257
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:25,620
region corresponds to something right

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,289
because we're not storing that yet and I

259
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,360
need a way of getting that out so inside

260
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:32,909
handmade platform dot H we've got sort

261
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,649
of what is actually stored you know

262
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,909
right we've got like the debug record

263
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,620
which has kind of the information about

264
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:40,708
it and then we've got the debug event

265
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,028
which says stuff like what the what the

266
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:45,299
clock was for the beginning in the end

267
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:47,850
and that sort of thing so I kind of need

268
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,289
inside this region I want to be able to

269
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,620
act you know I want to be able to get at

270
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,849
this data and you know I don't know that

271
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,589
I want to necessarily point back to the

272
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,870
event because the event the collation

273
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:59,160
kind of does you know I want the

274
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,049
collation to probably take care of that

275
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,669
but the debug record for the file the

276
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:05,519
blocking the line number that's probably

277
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:08,338
more what I'd want right so I want this

278
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,659
region to probably have that in there so

279
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,240
I want to be able to say that there's a

280
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:13,889
debug record off of the region so that I

281
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,430
can grab it when we happen to mouse over

282
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:23,039
it like so and when I do that hmm yeah

283
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:24,838
when I do that I can then use that

284
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,759
record to get at least some of this

285
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,180
information I can get the block name I

286
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:32,129
can get the line number there and then i

287
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,870
can get sort of this other information i

288
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:36,328
might make this a little bit more

289
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,778
extended i might do something where we

290
00:10:36,328 --> 00:10:41,519
do like the block name and then you know

291
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,169
maybe I think what might be more

292
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,560
interesting than what we did before is

293
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:48,659
at the very end i'm thinking i might do

294
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,119
file in line so it will do like the

295
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:52,679
block name and then at the end it would

296
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,328
do you know the file name of the line

297
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,759
number at the very end so just be like

298
00:10:54,328 --> 00:11:00,028
where you know where this stuff is right

299
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,769
something like that so yeah so there's

300
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:04,570
there's that we just say ok there's the

301
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,399
block name and

302
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,720
and then here comes the file name and

303
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,419
line number so there's the file name

304
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,460
there's a line number and then inside

305
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:15,099
here we need to know some stuff we want

306
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,450
to know the cycle count and the hit

307
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,769
count is not relevant for this

308
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,870
particular function I guess you know

309
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,850
these two things are not particularly

310
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,620
relevant because we're talking about a

311
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,830
specific slight we're talking about

312
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,419
specific one of these so for now all i'm

313
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,850
going to say for that region is i'm just

314
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,339
going to say what the cycle count was so

315
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,550
I'd like the region to have the cycle

316
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:43,120
count in it and that looks roughly right

317
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:46,719
to me so something like that right for

318
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,509
now okay so if we do that then we can

319
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,420
output it and that's all good so now

320
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:55,210
what we need to do is upgrade our actual

321
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:57,099
storage or debug storage to include that

322
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,980
information right so it's got to have a

323
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,420
debug record in it so here's the region

324
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,019
it's got to know what the debug record

325
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:07,029
is and then it also has to know what the

326
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,669
clock count was right there is a cycle

327
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:12,490
count in there so that means that every

328
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:15,969
time when we do a debug frame region

329
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,310
when we do add region we want to record

330
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,500
that information right so I want to

331
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:23,889
record the cycle count here and I want

332
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,350
to record the debug record you know and

333
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:28,509
it's pretty easy to do the cycle count

334
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,330
right because that's just the opening

335
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,669
event clock we know and we know the end

336
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,889
you know we know we know the range it's

337
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:38,049
just that so it's pretty easy for us to

338
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,029
determine what that that is right

339
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:42,069
there's not a lot of mystery there so

340
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,110
that's pretty simple and then the debug

341
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,230
record we already got probably I'm

342
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,970
guessing is probably already queried up

343
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,330
here yeah it's right there it's called

344
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,460
source so I'll just go ahead and and

345
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,310
drop that in as well and so now we have

346
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:01,330
all that information right pretty

347
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:03,659
straightforward a debug overlay debug

348
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:07,410
overlay debug over

349
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:12,870
a does not have its thing updated game

350
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:17,159
input input like so and yeah there we go

351
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:19,379
so I think that's roughly it fix that

352
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,360
there I think that's roughly it so all

353
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,149
we have to do now is kind of shore up

354
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,980
some of this code here I don't remember

355
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,019
if we ever did anything with rectangles

356
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,460
we did so since we did stuff with

357
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,470
rectangles I'm just going to go ahead

358
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,629
and leverage that that we already wrote

359
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,540
and I'm going to say that we're going to

360
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:39,029
make a rectangle to here and I feel like

361
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,069
push rec should really take rectangle

362
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:42,689
tues optionally and so that's I think

363
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:45,060
would also be nice could fix some of

364
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,010
this absolute nonsense that was going on

365
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,719
here that I think even as i was typing

366
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,730
it in i said i was not super pleased

367
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,820
with it so let me take a look at what we

368
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,350
have for rectangle to it looks like i

369
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,960
can create one with the men in the max

370
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,820
and that's exactly what i want right so

371
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,150
if i create a rectangle here rectangle

372
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,120
to here with the men into max what i

373
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:09,779
could do is say all right I know the min

374
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:13,799
X min that the you know I know a bunch

375
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:16,379
of this stuff right here it is I know

376
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:18,209
the min and the max the only thing I

377
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:22,139
need to know now is what the X with the

378
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:27,139
min and Max XR and I said so that would

379
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:27,139
just be this stuff here right this is a

380
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:36,080
that's where the X starts and then the X

381
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:36,079
runs where is that width it's lane width

382
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:47,359
the fact you could really just think of

383
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:50,090
it this way right so it's kind of like

384
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,399
the the lane index it's it's going from

385
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:56,750
one to the next Lane indexes its its

386
00:14:52,399 --> 00:15:00,289
span you will you know so that's the

387
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,659
rectangle and that's all we really need

388
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:04,669
there what I would like to do again is

389
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:06,740
just say okay I want to just be able to

390
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:09,559
pass those around I should I feel like

391
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,810
it's it's a well within reason to be

392
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:15,169
able to pass those in so if i had a

393
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:18,579
rectangle to here where I've got you

394
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:21,319
know and this is the the region wrecked

395
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,270
something like that I don't really like

396
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,260
the way that's the lining up let's do

397
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:28,220
that that's fine so if I've got that

398
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,110
then what I'd like to be able to do is

399
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,570
pass that in here so there's a region

400
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,519
wrecked and assuming that it's got a

401
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,710
particular Z you can see that it's z is

402
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:41,210
0 so what I'd like to do is be able to

403
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:44,950
just pass the a 2d rectangle and a Z

404
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:47,030
coordinate and have that expand out into

405
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,620
something that gets caught you know pass

406
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,629
to push wreck so it's basically just

407
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,649
like does whatever fussy map it needs to

408
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:53,659
but it make sure that that's the

409
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:55,279
rectangle that actually gets pushed so

410
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,750
then what i can do is i can ask whether

411
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,850
the mouse is in the rectangle and i

412
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,860
think we probably organ also actually

413
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,930
implemented that you can see it's we did

414
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,060
right here right we have is in rectangle

415
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:08,989
so we could do is in rectangle right

416
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:11,239
here there's the rectangle and we could

417
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,889
just say whatever the mouse p is right

418
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,899
whatever the point is that represents

419
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:17,360
where that mouse is and that's again

420
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:19,189
really really easy because we have that

421
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,320
information so the mouse p if we want to

422
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:26,390
get it is just the input mass text input

423
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,980
mouse y so we know where it is I and I

424
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:32,480
think that i implement one of those see

425
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:36,620
if I did push wrecked so I think that's

426
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,210
really it for the most part that's like

427
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,700
the entirety of the code all we need is

428
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,870
something that actually handles that in

429
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,550
the render group because i'm basically

430
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,500
introducing a new way of pushing a

431
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,939
rectangle that's different from the way

432
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,659
that it was pushing the rectangle before

433
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,830
right so if i go ahead and and say like

434
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:54,350
there's going to be a different in line

435
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:57,259
for pushing your rectangle

436
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,930
it's going to be a rectangle too and

437
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:03,649
here's the rectangle and then there is

438
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:05,599
an rfid to for the z-coordinate then

439
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,180
what i can do is say alright we can turn

440
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,039
that into one of these for now let the

441
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,570
optimizer deal with it here and if we

442
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,149
ever find that's a problem we can write

443
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:17,269
it ourselves but all we have to do is

444
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:20,269
just do a get center on the rectangle

445
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:22,970
assume that's a call that we have let's

446
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:25,879
find out if we ever wrote that get

447
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,370
center there it is so we can just get

448
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,790
the center of that and we can say that

449
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:35,419
we want you know to make something with

450
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:37,460
that Center and the Z and the dimensions

451
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,310
would just be we actually also have that

452
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,319
for get dim so our rectangle there we go

453
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,200
is that and then we pass the color

454
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,939
straight through and I think that's

455
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,980
actually all we would need now let's

456
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,600
test to see whether that works at all in

457
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,930
terms of drawing because I kind of just

458
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,939
made that up but it does look like that

459
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,710
parts working so now what we have to do

460
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,480
is get our mouse hover thing working

461
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,539
what we want to be able to do is mouse

462
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,309
over these things and have them actually

463
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,480
show up now as you can see if I move the

464
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,879
mouse around we're not actually getting

465
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,500
that so we have to go ahead and work on

466
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,390
that code a little bit there's one thing

467
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,059
that I already know that we're going to

468
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,170
have to do that's why that wouldn't work

469
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,849
but we probably have some other things

470
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,500
to get that working as well so what we

471
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:19,699
want to do is is now move into figuring

472
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,920
out how to get the hover to work so now

473
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,039
we've added the correct drawing there we

474
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:28,120
know that we're drawing that rectangle

475
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:31,269
okay so here is the problem

476
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:36,259
fundamentally that we are going to face

477
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:38,740
that is that the mouse p right is not in

478
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:42,140
the same space as our rendering space

479
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,120
right because we don't we didn't

480
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,480
actually do any work to ensure that that

481
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:50,419
was true the mouse x mouse why is just

482
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,230
something that windows is outputting in

483
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:56,930
its coordinate space and we do not

484
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,630
necessarily render in that space so you

485
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:03,049
can actually see when we do our debug

486
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:07,389
overlay right when we actually do stuff

487
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:10,658
here that where is it diva

488
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:13,269
reset when we actually set up our debug

489
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:16,539
rendering you can actually see that we

490
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:19,088
do an orthographic projection and we use

491
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:24,419
the width and the height that creates a

492
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:27,668
space where we where we range from like

493
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,969
negative the negative half the width to

494
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,739
positive half the width right and

495
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:34,808
negative half the height that's re- half

496
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:37,419
height to positive half the height but

497
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:40,509
that's not going to be windows of space

498
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:43,719
at all and so we have some decisions to

499
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:45,940
make here and i'm not really going to

500
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:49,239
think too hard about this i'm just going

501
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,849
to make it work here and then later we

502
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:53,679
can kind of decide whether we want to

503
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:56,019
push this down to the platform layer and

504
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,288
make it be its responsibility to do this

505
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:00,819
mapping and in other words the platform

506
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:03,190
layer is handing us Mouse xmass why

507
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:05,468
should the platform layer be responsible

508
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,929
for putting it into a canonical thing

509
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:10,028
like that and the answer may be yes

510
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:10,929
right but I'm gonna get it working here

511
00:20:10,028 --> 00:20:12,729
for us and then we're going to think

512
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:14,169
about that and possibly push it down to

513
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:16,269
the platform layer and say that windows

514
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,278
the platform layer will translate from

515
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,358
windows into our coordinate system and

516
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:21,548
there's some reasons we might want to do

517
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:23,108
that namely if all of the platform

518
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:25,538
layers are responsible for converting

519
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:27,638
that Mouse coordinates then we know that

520
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:30,489
no matter what random Mouse coordinate

521
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:31,569
scheme they use it'll always be able to

522
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:32,588
be written in the platform layer

523
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:36,428
something that will convert them into

524
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:37,958
the ones we want right so what we need

525
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:39,969
to do here is we can say all right the

526
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:41,499
mouse X ranges from 0 to the width in

527
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:43,749
Windows I believe that's typically the

528
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:46,389
way it goes and we want to do you know

529
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:48,578
we want to essentially subtract half the

530
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:50,319
width from that right what we want to do

531
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:54,038
is something more like this we want to

532
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,769
do Oh point 5 f times with right now we

533
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:57,878
have to actually know what the width is

534
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,919
which at the moment we don't actually

535
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:01,658
have a way of telling that I don't

536
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,399
believe you can see that it comes in

537
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,320
here so what we want to do is start

538
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:07,208
storing that and i think this also is a

539
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,098
good point time to get rid of these

540
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:10,359
global variables as well so i think

541
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,858
we're going to do that immediately after

542
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:13,239
we get hover working because again i

543
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:14,858
said when i first put them here as like

544
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,058
we want to go ahead and move these out

545
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:19,148
now would be a good time to do that

546
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:19,660
right so i want to do something like

547
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,069
this

548
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,690
temporarily but then we're going to

549
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:30,329
change that okay so you know global

550
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:33,100
width is with global height table sorry

551
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:36,099
so that's what we're actually getting

552
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:37,929
past and what we want to do is say well

553
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,809
there's this there's some center right

554
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:45,180
and I want to offset things in terms of

555
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:48,039
that Center so we'll do that and then

556
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:51,039
we'll do the same thing for the height

557
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,389
but the mouse remember in Windows it

558
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,909
probably i believe mask where desert

559
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,210
reported right from the top down we are

560
00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:00,759
bottom up so really this is going to go

561
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,779
the other way it's going to start at

562
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:05,890
half the height and go down as the mouse

563
00:22:03,779 --> 00:22:08,319
increases so it's going to look a little

564
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,940
bit more like that right so that's

565
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,099
roughly what we're looking at this is

566
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,900
not correct yet just to be clear there's

567
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:16,000
problems with this still but that's

568
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,759
getting a little bit more towards what

569
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,250
we want to do so let's let's double

570
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:24,069
check and so i'm also i'll show you a

571
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,990
kind of a little bit of am of a trick we

572
00:22:24,069 --> 00:22:27,759
can do here to to make this a little bit

573
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,779
easier but let's see where we're at

574
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:34,420
there with that yes so you can kind of

575
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:36,549
see that now we actually do have hover

576
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,170
working don't ask me why that is down

577
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:41,470
there i do not know where that why that

578
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,180
is where it is but now we can hover over

579
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,390
any of these guys right and we can see

580
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,820
the actual information i just i do not

581
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:52,750
understand why oh i know i do you know

582
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:57,730
what I do understand why where's that at

583
00:22:52,750 --> 00:23:01,380
why yeah it's because it prints it on

584
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:05,319
the next one that's why so I'm going to

585
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,900
skip that for a minute I'm going to take

586
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:13,169
that lie there and say that this is

587
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,170
going to be a global height

588
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:28,650
yeah something like I'm going to start

589
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,060
this at the bottom of the screen and

590
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:34,500
then I'm going to add well no that is

591
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:48,529
the chart man so I'm just I'm just gonna

592
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:51,299
do that oh well or I'm not sharp min Y

593
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:53,549
is supposed to be negative over there we

594
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:55,139
go Plus 10 members start from the bottom

595
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:59,460
I always think top down even though I

596
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:03,480
try pretty hard to not not do that okay

597
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,860
so there we go yeah so there's reasons

598
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,450
why we're gonna have to fix a little bit

599
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:08,549
of that that's fine so now we can

600
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,500
actually hover so we're you know again

601
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,089
we've got sort of the basic thing going

602
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,150
we can hover over something and figure

603
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,769
out who it is right and it's what we get

604
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,450
these are what we expect to see or at

605
00:24:16,769 --> 00:24:20,220
least it's what I expected to see right

606
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,960
we can kind of see what's going on in

607
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,150
each of these and you can see that

608
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,920
gigantic bar for debug collation again

609
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,200
really pretty expensive something that

610
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,420
we're going to have to certainly get

611
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,769
down but now we can kind of go go ahead

612
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,050
through here and figure out what these

613
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:35,339
are and so that's good we've got some

614
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,690
more work that we'd like to do to make

615
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:41,579
that work out okay but but off we go so

616
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,590
like i said though we're not quite out

617
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,899
of the woods yet and the reason that i

618
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:47,849
say that is because we have some things

619
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,130
that are a little bit wonky i think in

620
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:52,230
terms of the way this is working so let

621
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,330
me just see i'm going to also well i

622
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,769
guess i can't expand it passed with the

623
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:58,409
actual width is so maybe that's not such

624
00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:01,889
a big deal but anyway you get the basic

625
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:04,800
idea right so that's all good now I do

626
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,690
not know why our last frame time is 0.00

627
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,349
milliseconds that seems like a pretty

628
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,750
odd thing to have happen so I'm if

629
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:14,339
you'll you'll excuse me for one second I

630
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,630
would like to figure out why that

631
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:20,250
actually is happening debug state frames

632
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,510
debug state frame cut minus one that's

633
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,970
because that's the last thing that's

634
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:26,480
open I suppose that frame is not

635
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,480
actually finished yet

636
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,640
so that makes sense that does make some

637
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,370
sense I feel like we probably shouldn't

638
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:38,480
put that frame into the rotation if it

639
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:41,000
hasn't actually been closed yet if that

640
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,240
makes sense so I feel like it should be

641
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,099
more like you know when we do the frame

642
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,980
count I don't just notice that but like

643
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:51,709
when we do the frames the last frame

644
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,829
that we create is never actually it

645
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,390
doesn't actually get closed because the

646
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:58,099
frame marker hasn't occurred for it yet

647
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,470
since the debug code collation runs

648
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:03,189
before the frame marker finishes so I

649
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:06,410
feel like that one should not really be

650
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:09,039
in there if that makes sense so I feel

651
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:12,650
like that in terms of how that works I

652
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,329
feel like the frame count stuff should

653
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,720
actually be be a little more

654
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:21,019
conservative so in here when we get to

655
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,870
this I feel like we should take back one

656
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:26,240
frame assuming it never gets actually

657
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:30,168
clear so you know at the end of all this

658
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,849
after we do after we do that stuff we

659
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,790
would do something like taking away one

660
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:37,039
frame not sure I'm not sure what the

661
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,859
best way to do that is it might be

662
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:44,240
something like this where we only

663
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:47,599
increment that frame count when we

664
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,640
actually have a positive frame so we're

665
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,548
like okay we had a frame it completed

666
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:58,100
now we increment the frame count that

667
00:26:52,548 --> 00:27:00,859
might be reasonable let's find out so

668
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,240
there's that's a little bit better so

669
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:04,129
all right so now we're hovering over

670
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,660
this stuff and that's good right

671
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,600
everyone likes a little bit of a hover

672
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,580
now and again but like I said I don't

673
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,168
love that and the reason is because you

674
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:13,369
know cross-platform wise we don't know

675
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:14,990
what those masks weirdness going coming

676
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:17,149
and basically what we'd have to do is

677
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,039
all the platform layers would then have

678
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,290
to emulate the way windows does their

679
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,490
mouse which doesn't necessarily make

680
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,599
much sense considering the fact that the

681
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,849
very first thing we're doing with that

682
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,798
data is swapping it over into our

683
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,089
coordinate system it seems like it would

684
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:30,558
make more sense for the platform layer

685
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:32,480
to translate the mouse into our

686
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,210
coordinate system instead you know what

687
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,120
I mean which is a center you know why is

688
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,319
up centered coordinate system so that

689
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,989
seems like a little more logical to me

690
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,369
so I think that's where

691
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,620
like to push that I think I'd like to

692
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:46,379
push it down to that and then we can

693
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:49,979
move on from there all right so if we go

694
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:53,730
ahead and move down from there here we

695
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:56,789
are in been through to handmade there's

696
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,170
the mass x mouse why stuff and so what I

697
00:27:56,789 --> 00:28:01,079
want to do here is I want to perform

698
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:05,130
this transform at a different time right

699
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,720
so you know instead of doing it here

700
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,380
what I want to do is I want to make it

701
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,690
so I can just do mouse xmass why like so

702
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,210
and that's you know all I would then

703
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,750
have to worry about and so if i look at

704
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:21,720
mass x mouse why in the platform layer

705
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,920
oops actually spell it right what I'm

706
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,720
going to do is I'm going to change those

707
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,759
two are 32 so that they can be floats

708
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,329
across the boundary which is what I

709
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,980
would think it would prefer and I'm just

710
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:34,649
going to assume that when we actually

711
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,339
create this this piece of information I

712
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,390
am going to take again and pre do that

713
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:44,459
sort of transform that I was doing

714
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:48,030
before so basically the mass p x and y

715
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:52,650
are going to have themselves sort of

716
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:55,579
flipped around so how would i do that in

717
00:28:52,650 --> 00:29:02,519
here I've got my game display somewhere

718
00:28:55,579 --> 00:29:05,250
see display it's like buffer or

719
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:10,230
something right a long times to work

720
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:16,619
with this code off-screen buffer in 3 2

721
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:19,849
off-screen oops buffer

722
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:23,250
win32 off-screen buffer star buffer

723
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:27,839
where is that in our main loop should be

724
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:32,519
somewhere should it not its global back

725
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:37,139
buffer that is what it is all right so

726
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,490
if we got a global valve ever what I

727
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,400
want to do here is say that the global

728
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:44,490
back buffer is wit right and the global

729
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:47,490
back buffer is height I'm going to take

730
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,190
those guys and I'm going to do exactly

731
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:54,230
what I do with them before so we're

732
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:56,490
going to take negative half the width

733
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:58,140
which is starting at the left side of

734
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,630
the screen in our coordinate system and

735
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,559
then I'm going to add the mouse p to

736
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:06,030
that which should move it across right

737
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:08,670
and I'm going to do the same thing with

738
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:11,519
the height here right so I'm going to

739
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,769
take start- half and then the mouse

740
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,839
since the mouse actually goes up right

741
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,710
i'm going to subtract it because as the

742
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:21,659
mouse gets bigger it should go oh sorry

743
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,390
that's not quite right I meant to say

744
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,759
start at the top of the screen and then

745
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:31,740
as the mass goes down i'm going to

746
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:33,329
subtract from it right now I think if

747
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,779
I'm not very much an error which of

748
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:40,470
course I maybe I think that's not quite

749
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:43,619
correct I think that's off x 1 pixel and

750
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:49,890
the reason that I say that right if we

751
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:55,500
take a look here at the blackboard so

752
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:57,960
here is day 1 88 if you take a look at

753
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:04,490
what's happening here if the if the

754
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:06,840
mouse X is actually equal to 0 right

755
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,230
then what we want to do is you want to

756
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:13,279
be on that first pixel right which is

757
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:17,730
negative 0 point five times the width /

758
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,910
potentially but when we get over to this

759
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:23,220
pixel right and again this this kind of

760
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,620
lard is largely about our pixel centers

761
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,440
which we haven't really formally defined

762
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,059
which is probably a bad idea it's

763
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,220
something maybe we should address sooner

764
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:38,429
than later but anyway what we don't know

765
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,589
what's unclear is what we want the

766
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:43,110
convention to be for where these pixels

767
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:45,990
lie so is negative 0 point five times

768
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:48,479
the width is that lying on this pixel or

769
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:51,660
at the edge of this pixel and similarly

770
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,789
is plus 0.5 lying on a pixel or on the

771
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,960
edge of the pixel and the reason that

772
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:59,279
this actually is important is because if

773
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,980
you think about what happens if you

774
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,279
Center your coordinate system then 0 0

775
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,529
is actually in a middle row right it's a

776
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:13,319
middle column if you will at a middle

777
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:16,019
row where does that actually lie right

778
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,629
is it off by half a pixel or is it

779
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:22,710
actually on a pixel if it's on a pixel

780
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:24,600
remember we have 19 20 on our in a 1080p

781
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:30,269
resolution that's how many pixels there

782
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:35,189
are right so 19 20 / 2 yeah is going to

783
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:38,039
be equal to right sorry 10 for this and

784
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,049
then that's going to be 9 so it's

785
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,720
actually going to have to carry itself

786
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:45,359
outs it's going to be what like 960

787
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,430
right you got to actually do long

788
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:51,079
division don't do this much anymore at

789
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:54,090
least I down so yeah to write x 9 is 18

790
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:56,939
grab the 120 that's going to be 6 yet I

791
00:32:54,089 --> 00:33:00,689
was right so it's going to be 960 pixels

792
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:05,269
two sets of 960 pixels which means that

793
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:08,400
the midline is not on a pixel it's on

794
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:14,339
the boundary between two pixels it is in

795
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,780
between pixel 959 and pixel 960 so the

796
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:25,529
middle of the screen is actually pixel

797
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:28,559
959 point live right so you see the

798
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:31,170
dilemma right you see what I'm what I'm

799
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,700
saying here at least hopefully you see

800
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,990
what I'm saying here I don't know it's

801
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,730
one of those things that only graphics

802
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,870
programmers get persnickety about not

803
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,849
really that much of a graphics

804
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:40,949
programmer but you know you could

805
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,359
understand you understand the reason if

806
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,080
you want to get every last little thing

807
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,019
right you can understand

808
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,939
why there's a bit of a problem there in

809
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:51,460
terms of how this stuff actually works

810
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:53,558
out because you know you have to think

811
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,480
about kind of what lines up where and

812
00:33:53,558 --> 00:34:01,960
why these things do what they actually

813
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:05,169
do right and so if this right here if

814
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:10,358
this is negative 960 and this is

815
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:12,460
positive 9 60 right then yeah if those

816
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:14,710
if those are meant to actually be

817
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:19,389
specific pixels it means that the

818
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:22,300
midline the 0 is has to be in between

819
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,679
two there's no other way to imprint ER

820
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,019
prett that coordinate system and still

821
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,289
have the right number of pixels you

822
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:31,440
can't insert a phantom row column of

823
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:39,250
pixels and have it actually be there

824
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:40,539
yeah so that's how that works don't know

825
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,619
what else to say other than that that's

826
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:47,108
just how that works so I assume that if

827
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:50,530
we were to do that if we were to take

828
00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:55,449
negative 960 and we put it there again I

829
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:57,760
think what's actually what's actually

830
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:01,000
going to be true of this coordinate

831
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,859
system right is that if the mouse X is

832
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:10,690
set to 0 then we will get we would get

833
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:13,630
the negative 960 right if it was set to

834
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:17,320
19 19 which is the furthest pixel / can

835
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,510
be it would be at plus 9 59 right so it

836
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,750
actually wouldn't be able to get to that

837
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:25,210
one extra pixel and so that's kind of

838
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,070
all so that's kind of again the dilemma

839
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:29,320
that I initially started with it's sort

840
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:32,849
of like saying well okay do we actually

841
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:37,930
want this one to line up at negative 9

842
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:39,970
59.5 right so that we actually do have a

843
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:42,039
full span so that this one goes so that

844
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:45,338
the plus and the minus are equivalent

845
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:46,929
because that way if we take right if you

846
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:49,509
if you're like how many pixels are there

847
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:53,618
actually in between these two right how

848
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:57,880
many are there if I take nine 59.5 and

849
00:35:53,619 --> 00:36:00,789
subtract negative 950 950 9.5 right that

850
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:08,380
actually gives me the 1920 that I needed

851
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:11,860
right so yeah right like i said i don't

852
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:15,220
really know I don't really know how we

853
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:17,140
want to to think about that I don't

854
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:19,059
really know what the best way is to do

855
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:21,159
that I'm not sure this is one of those

856
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:22,840
things where I feel like being a more

857
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:24,969
personally graphics programmer would be

858
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,769
helpful because I'd have a stronger

859
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:30,009
opinion about pixel centers which is

860
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:31,719
what this kind of thing which is the

861
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:38,710
domain in which this sort of thing falls

862
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:41,469
if you will and you know in my in my gut

863
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,869
I feel like I don't like the idea of

864
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:45,939
having different bounds to the left and

865
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:48,219
to the right but at the same time I also

866
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,320
don't know if I love the idea of the

867
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:54,189
mouse always being on half coordinates

868
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,019
right so I don't know I really don't

869
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,360
know since it's only for debug maybe it

870
00:36:56,019 --> 00:37:00,699
doesn't matter that much but point being

871
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,710
if we actually want to do it right if we

872
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:06,159
actually wanted to do it that way what

873
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,170
it would be is it would be this right it

874
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,719
would be negative with plus half a pixel

875
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:14,920
then plus the X that would actually give

876
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:16,659
you the entire span hopefully that makes

877
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,740
some sense like I said it's very

878
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:23,109
persnickety but right this would be the

879
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:25,059
other way again starting a point by

880
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:28,990
starting it than half pixel and going

881
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:33,969
through it and that would mean like I

882
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:36,819
said now the center the very center is

883
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:42,009
is actually going to be on an actual

884
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:46,930
pixel boundary so you know go figure so

885
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:48,700
I don't know I don't know I'm gonna

886
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:50,769
leave it that way for now but but you

887
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,989
know if people if there's a if there's

888
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:54,820
people who are more personally about

889
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:57,869
pixel centers I would very much be

890
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,769
interested to hear your opinions on it

891
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:01,449
it's the kind of thing that I think

892
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:04,000
through sometimes I'm doing rendering

893
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:06,349
but I don't have a strong of opinions on

894
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,150
it as I possibly should have if

895
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:18,079
makes sense so yeah let's see how we're

896
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:22,010
doing here looks like we're fine yeah so

897
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:28,759
that's all good okay so now we've got

898
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:33,500
about 20 minutes left oh go stretch a

899
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:36,110
little bit gotta stretch it out I so now

900
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:39,050
we want to do is let's let's try and

901
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:40,750
have some way that we can we can

902
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,220
interact with this a little bit more

903
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:47,510
what I'd like to do is I'd like to have

904
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:52,009
a way of saying stop the collation where

905
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:55,040
we're at freeze it essentially so that

906
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,930
we're not going to record any more any

907
00:38:55,039 --> 00:39:02,119
more information right we're just going

908
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:04,509
to stop and in order to do that I guess

909
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:11,960
what I would want to do is say okay

910
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:14,420
let's see here I think in order to do

911
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,820
that maybe the best way to go would be

912
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,920
to just say this stuff here where we

913
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,200
kind of do our allocation and our end

914
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,079
temporary sort of stuff I think I could

915
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:26,029
just make that predicated right so I

916
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,159
could just say you know what can we just

917
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:37,670
do something like this where we do if

918
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:40,099
debug state frozen or paused something

919
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,450
like that and so then in the debug state

920
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:47,000
I could just have something that's like

921
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:49,730
be 32 pause and then you know whenever

922
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,289
we do this we could do something like at

923
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:58,219
the end of our overlay here when we're

924
00:39:54,289 --> 00:40:00,320
doing our art debug overlay I could just

925
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:07,369
do something where we say oh yeah you

926
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:08,990
know if the mouse buttons and I don't

927
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:10,969
really remember much about how our mouse

928
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:15,079
buttons worked completely honest with

929
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:18,019
you so if our mouse buttons are these

930
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:21,199
enumerated in any particular way

931
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:26,030
doesn't look like it this doesn't look

932
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:29,299
like it to me yeah so I would say that

933
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:31,210
if the mouse buttons I'm going to go

934
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,210
ahead and add in a numeron ther win32

935
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:39,220
and made I'm going to go ahead and add

936
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,220
one there I'm going to do something like

937
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:46,690
you know enum game input mouse button

938
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:55,430
I'm going to do let's say platform is it

939
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,460
platform should I call out platform do

940
00:40:55,429 --> 00:41:00,079
we have any and numerous here at all we

941
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:05,840
have like no we knew marincin our

942
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:12,769
platform layer yeah all right well let's

943
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:22,030
see here i'm going to call it a platform

944
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:31,190
mouse button left middle right spended 0

945
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:35,030
stemmed one and I going to use these in

946
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:37,780
the platform layer now so we'll just say

947
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,780
yep

948
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:49,730
and there we have it so that's all good

949
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:52,579
and now I can actually go in here and

950
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:54,889
and say by name the one that I want so

951
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:58,699
i'm going to say whenever we hit maybe

952
00:41:54,889 --> 00:42:06,529
the right button will go ahead and

953
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:09,460
toggle that and i'm also going to do i

954
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:15,740
don't know if we have a went down macro

955
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:18,769
right see for them we don't at least we

956
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:21,919
don't seem too I'll see one so I'm

957
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:27,009
assuming that we did have transition

958
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,010
count do not check buttons anywhere half

959
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:41,289
half transition count well we really

960
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:46,219
just don't ever use this do we huh

961
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:49,179
that's a bit odd wouldn't you say that

962
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:49,179
we use this for something

963
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:59,308
so we just used whether it ended down or

964
00:42:56,429 --> 00:43:02,278
not that's all we do if it ended down we

965
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:03,720
we set one of those and off we go so we

966
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:07,858
never used the half transition camp

967
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:09,778
which is odd all right well I'm going to

968
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:12,210
introduce a new thing then because I

969
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:13,858
don't really like that idea I would like

970
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,289
there to be right for this platform

971
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:18,058
thing I would like there to be a way

972
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:20,549
that we can trivially tell whether

973
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:22,048
something was went down or not we have a

974
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:23,818
half transition count so we know when it

975
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:26,009
went down when it went up whatever right

976
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:29,579
so really what we want to know is

977
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:31,920
something like was pressed you know so

978
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:33,059
if we have a game button state right and

979
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,798
then we want to know if it was pressed

980
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:39,569
oops it's pretty easy to figure out if a

981
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:45,989
button was pressed right all we have to

982
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:48,630
do is say hmm so if the state if the

983
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:56,579
half transition count is greater than

984
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:58,410
zero meaning there was at least one

985
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:04,739
transition from up to down or down to up

986
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:06,328
and it ended down right then we know

987
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:08,278
that was a kind of press what I'd like

988
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:10,789
to I'd like to do I'd actually like to

989
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:14,699
count it so if the half transition count

990
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:18,150
is actually you can't come to think of

991
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:20,848
it if it's greater than one then it

992
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,460
definitely had to go down right at some

993
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:26,369
point because it went from down to up or

994
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,650
up to down twice it's greater than one

995
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:32,219
so if it's greater than one obviously it

996
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:40,670
was pressed or if the if the transition

997
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:40,670
count equals one and it ended down right

998
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:50,889
that means that it was pressed during

999
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:53,379
you know this particular time time slice

1000
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:55,358
I think that's what I think that's

1001
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,430
roughly what I would like if I'm

1002
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:59,019
understanding that correctly so what I'm

1003
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:04,299
going to do here is say if it was if we

1004
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:08,858
press that button then i would like to

1005
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,150
pause the debugging so you know for sort

1006
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:12,759
of chugging along here and i hit the

1007
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:15,849
right mouse button i want that stop of

1008
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:20,940
course that doesn't work at all which is

1009
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:23,410
not good which is bad she's just just I

1010
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,579
just don't understand where the code

1011
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:33,730
doesn't work sometimes why does it have

1012
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:34,960
to be so mean so yeah so let me just

1013
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,880
double check I probably just did

1014
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,559
something stupid there so if the half

1015
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,809
transition count is greater than one

1016
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:44,289
then we know that it was pressed if the

1017
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:46,059
hass transition count equals one and it

1018
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:52,019
ended down then we know that it was

1019
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:52,019
pressed as well that seems right Oh

1020
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:06,579
how did that get return true I obviously

1021
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:17,059
just type something really stupid there

1022
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:19,549
hold please the result is that whatever

1023
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:21,529
the state is it has a half transition

1024
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:24,110
count of greater than one which in this

1025
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:28,790
case we know it didn't because I at

1026
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:30,800
least I don't think it did or you know

1027
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:33,019
that a strange count that was one and it

1028
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:39,920
ended down that looks right to me it's

1029
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:46,759
our bar mouse button States busted kind

1030
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:53,329
of interested to see no got a result of

1031
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:58,450
zero ok so that's working now so you

1032
00:46:53,329 --> 00:47:01,219
must not clear them or something right

1033
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:04,129
yeah like we don't clear we just got it

1034
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:07,879
we've got a platform bug there we got we

1035
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:10,840
got it we got a platform bug it's what

1036
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:14,840
we got all right where is that book that

1037
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:18,519
bug that bug is is in there somewhere

1038
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:22,370
went through to process keyboard message

1039
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:29,750
let's go see where that's at what's it

1040
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:38,239
doing oh so do we probably just never

1041
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:40,250
cleared these guys did we in fact what's

1042
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:49,459
actually what actually clears these

1043
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:52,579
buttons am I am I just am I yeah I'm a

1044
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:57,409
little bit I'm a little bit nervous

1045
00:47:52,579 --> 00:48:01,279
about that code i'm not i'm not thinking

1046
00:47:57,409 --> 00:48:03,980
that maybe that was um maybe that was so

1047
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,550
good here's the mouse buttons that's the

1048
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:11,719
only place that it ever gets referenced

1049
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:15,350
that's not good right because it's never

1050
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:22,309
going to get cleared ever ever ever

1051
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:25,519
again that's that's a problem that is a

1052
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:32,480
problem and since we're doing it this

1053
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:34,639
way we have to fix this this is bad

1054
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,250
people this is this was this was just a

1055
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:46,129
bad this is this is BS this was bad

1056
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:49,550
science right here so bad software so

1057
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:52,010
yeah what we want to do here is say okay

1058
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,600
we we get this half transition count and

1059
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,980
that's fine but okay so at the start of

1060
00:48:53,599 --> 00:49:02,869
the frame we just need to clear the half

1061
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:06,469
transition count right I think that's

1062
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:07,759
probably all we need to do so when we

1063
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:10,039
process the cube our message this will

1064
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,220
do it so yes I think what we want to do

1065
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:16,130
here is say set this thing half

1066
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:20,539
transition count we want these all to be

1067
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:27,220
0 right so we want to do like left

1068
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:27,219
middle right extended 0 send one

1069
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:43,009
see if that doesn t better okay

1070
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,889
much better

1071
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:02,579
it looks like it's double triggering

1072
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:04,929
though so that's still not quite right

1073
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:08,069
that's still not quite right we set the

1074
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:11,529
half transition count 20 that seems

1075
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:16,300
reasonable and then this stuff should be

1076
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:18,790
oh and also these yeah it needs to copy

1077
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,360
this it needs to copy us up so this this

1078
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:24,489
code is just all garbage really because

1079
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:27,130
we need to copy our old state from the

1080
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:29,589
new one to the old one right and we

1081
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:31,240
weren't doing that either so it's just

1082
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:34,300
this is just this is just totally

1083
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:36,909
nonsense this is like the most nonsense

1084
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,650
a of nonsense things let's let's see if

1085
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:40,000
we can write something that's not total

1086
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,289
garbage I mean it's still kind of

1087
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,880
garbage but let's just see if we can

1088
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:44,469
write something better so here's the

1089
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,450
mass wetin index we have seven minutes

1090
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:50,069
left on the clock yes I think we started

1091
00:50:46,449 --> 00:50:57,489
about 10 minutes late platform mouse

1092
00:50:50,070 --> 00:51:00,400
button count mouse button index so what

1093
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:06,729
we want to do is say the mouse button

1094
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:10,510
new buttons you know I could just

1095
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:14,019
shorten that button index so we get to

1096
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:19,240
say that the button index copy the old

1097
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:23,250
one like so and then we can just say

1098
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:25,750
that the half transition capped equals 0

1099
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:29,739
and then we might as well go ahead and

1100
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:39,039
that on in there right and we can just

1101
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:44,769
have that BD word win button' ID and do

1102
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:55,380
that oh yeah and then we can just put

1103
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:55,380
these in here VK m button oops l ro x

1104
00:51:55,858 --> 00:52:11,920
yeah oh yeah when button' ID button

1105
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:13,750
index and button index now is all set so

1106
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,858
that looks a little better a little

1107
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:19,750
better not the world's best or anything

1108
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:21,788
but that looks a little better and as a

1109
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,650
bonus it also actually works which is

1110
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:25,930
nice so now we can come in here and

1111
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:28,660
actually you know sort of look at these

1112
00:52:25,929 --> 00:52:30,489
guys a little more carefully we could

1113
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:32,558
also make them a little larger if we

1114
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:35,439
wanted to so they weren't so hard to to

1115
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,880
pinpoint that would be nice as well but

1116
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,798
we're getting there right we're getting

1117
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,539
there so now we have the way to pause

1118
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:42,940
our debug input and to hover over our

1119
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:44,170
debug input as well and then pretty much

1120
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,059
the next thing that we should do

1121
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,710
tomorrow I'll probably wrap it up next

1122
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:52,390
don't want start a new thing quite yet

1123
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:54,010
is we should have some way of starting

1124
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:55,239
to click and inspect these guys which

1125
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,240
should be pretty easy and also we can

1126
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,709
clean up this output stuff as well

1127
00:52:57,239 --> 00:53:02,919
alright so we're getting there we're

1128
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:09,940
good shakes I'm pretty good shape it's

1129
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:11,769
true it is true alright folks let's do

1130
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,588
some Q&amp;A here if you have questions

1131
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:21,009
about what just happened before your

1132
00:53:14,588 --> 00:53:25,838
eyes it's what's coming at you what just

1133
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:29,170
came at you please feel free to ask it

1134
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:32,739
now put a cue colon in and I will answer

1135
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:34,690
the question put the pig hat on the owl

1136
00:53:32,739 --> 00:53:38,429
know that the owl of shame is not

1137
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:38,429
pigging at the moment i will not do that

1138
00:53:45,018 --> 00:53:52,368
I had a love Shaima what was my al of

1139
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:58,998
shame moment what was the where was the

1140
00:53:52,369 --> 00:54:00,469
AL of shame moment oh you think the the

1141
00:53:58,998 --> 00:54:02,178
mouse code being buggy friend 50 days

1142
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:04,759
trees on the ally that's not an atlas

1143
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:06,108
shame we never used the mouse code we

1144
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:08,119
just put it in there I mean we've never

1145
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:09,679
actually gone and tried to use it I'd I

1146
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,699
know that's not an al of shame and Alice

1147
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,189
shames when you do something like really

1148
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:14,688
stupid where it's just like oh you know

1149
00:54:13,188 --> 00:54:16,368
how did you how are you so dumb it's

1150
00:54:14,688 --> 00:54:17,538
like that was just like all right we

1151
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:20,419
choose the mouse go in there it wasn't

1152
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:21,349
good that's fine I'm that I don't

1153
00:54:20,418 --> 00:54:24,908
through that knowledge so that's that's

1154
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:24,909
just programming that happens every day

1155
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:34,028
well almond milk make you smarter I do

1156
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,028
not know

1157
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:46,420
shorten I three on behalf of all the

1158
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,630
people here we love you and you're

1159
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:52,269
awesome i love you guys too you are also

1160
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:55,510
awesome it is pretty darn nice that

1161
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:57,400
people show up every day to watch this

1162
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:00,430
stream because I'll be honest with you

1163
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:04,240
would be pretty lonely programming here

1164
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:07,509
by myself that would not be a fun way to

1165
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,919
spend an hour and a half so I thank

1166
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,510
everyone for showing up it's been pretty

1167
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,760
awesome that there's so many people and

1168
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:14,560
seeing the same faces come back multiple

1169
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,050
times and getting to know people is

1170
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:27,880
pretty pretty darn cool too so so thank

1171
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:29,560
you guys for being awesome epica an 00

1172
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,150
i'm new here why constrain yourself to

1173
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:34,840
one hour segments isn't ramp up time

1174
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:36,579
every day hard uh you know i think i

1175
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:42,280
think the reason for the one hour

1176
00:55:36,579 --> 00:55:44,049
segments is really because programming

1177
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,610
is easy to do for long periods of time

1178
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:48,280
you know i can program for eight hours

1179
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:50,410
and that's not a big deal but explaining

1180
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,900
programming for eight hours i would be

1181
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:56,049
really dead by the time i did that after

1182
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,639
you know a couple days of that right so

1183
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:59,590
keeping it 21 hours one way of just

1184
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:01,089
making sure that even on bad days i

1185
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:04,990
still have a little bit of explanatory

1186
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:06,370
ability because it is really hard to

1187
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:07,959
program and explain at the same time

1188
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:14,049
it's a lot harder than just programming

1189
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:16,240
and it takes it's tough to do so so I

1190
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:18,670
feel like keeping it constrained is it

1191
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,139
makes it into little like segments is a

1192
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:24,090
good way to make sure that I don't just

1193
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:24,089
totally fail to explain what I'm doing

1194
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:34,139
how would you go about optimizing the

1195
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:35,909
debug rendering I well first of all we

1196
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:37,710
could optimize a lot of the rectangle

1197
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:39,389
stuff and all that yeah and and you're

1198
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:40,679
right entity basis calculations could be

1199
00:56:39,389 --> 00:56:42,329
gotten rid of because we're going

1200
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:44,279
straight through on these guys they're

1201
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:46,139
not they don't need any 3d transforms or

1202
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,510
anything so but I don't think that's

1203
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:49,460
most draw rectangle probably optimizing

1204
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:51,660
that would be the way to go

1205
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,740
unfortunately right now well not

1206
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:54,599
unfortunately perhaps you can say

1207
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:58,079
fortunately the time is not spent there

1208
00:56:54,599 --> 00:57:00,750
right so take a look that stuff right

1209
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,480
there that's the debug render time those

1210
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:05,519
those those guys right there this is the

1211
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,559
debug collation time so it's really the

1212
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,719
collation time that's expensive not the

1213
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:11,639
rendering time and fortunately for us

1214
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:14,309
the collation time is easy to improve

1215
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:15,569
all we have to do right off the bat to

1216
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:18,509
make it eight times faster than it is

1217
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:20,580
right now is to just store collated

1218
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:25,140
frames and only collate new frames as

1219
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:26,909
they come as necessary basically so so

1220
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:29,639
we have a lot of options for making that

1221
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:31,559
faster but as even as it is if we just

1222
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:32,670
left it the way it is now we could leave

1223
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:34,049
it the way it is now and it wouldn't be

1224
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,909
the end of the world so that's fine

1225
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,650
because remember it's debug code this is

1226
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:40,469
a totally fine speed to play the game at

1227
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:42,750
in testing so you know I'd be okay with

1228
00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:44,279
that too and this isn't even an

1229
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,900
optimized build right you know like if

1230
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,090
you wanted to you could go in here and I

1231
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,460
know too that you could 0 to some of

1232
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:58,769
that up get a little 02 going on Yom

1233
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:59,849
same little oxygen little 02 oops of

1234
00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:02,190
course you should probably wait till the

1235
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:09,029
build actually finished finishes it's

1236
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:12,769
true so if we owe to tit then it's even

1237
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,769
smoother right

1238
00:58:15,018 --> 00:58:30,018
yeah wow so our frame wait our frame

1239
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:30,018
wait time is kind of looks just busted

1240
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:35,159
like I said but I've said many many

1241
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,450
times so far I think this is going to

1242
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:37,828
tell us a lot of stuff that we don't

1243
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:39,719
know about our code and I'm really

1244
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:41,190
excited about that like look at that

1245
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:46,649
frame wait time like what's going on

1246
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:47,818
there that is just not right so yeah

1247
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:49,889
we're going to learn we're going to

1248
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:52,159
learn good stuff from this I promise you

1249
00:58:49,889 --> 00:58:52,159
that

1250
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,269
James Woodman you've trained everyone to

1251
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:02,760
listen for whether you're pronounce the

1252
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:04,169
letter T or it's a lephone the glottal

1253
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,650
stop where you say the word button it's

1254
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:09,420
true I like saying button just fine in

1255
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,010
normal speech but sometimes especially

1256
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:14,430
on the stream I like saying button I

1257
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:26,039
like I like over pronouncing button I

1258
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:27,088
don't know why a chronal dragon should I

1259
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:28,170
wasn't paying attention and use the

1260
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:30,210
mouse button on the pyramid was broken

1261
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:32,400
about I just didn't clear itself from

1262
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,809
the new old input thing the mouse the

1263
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,010
actual way to read the mouse in Windows

1264
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:43,019
was totally fine it was just how we were

1265
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:44,250
updating our mouse info James would have

1266
00:59:43,018 --> 00:59:46,169
been at some point would it makes sense

1267
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:55,559
to pause and redisplay the frame that is

1268
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:57,028
currently moused over uh you know if we

1269
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:01,920
were going to sell this engine or

1270
00:59:57,028 --> 01:00:03,420
something yes because we can we have the

1271
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,039
really do that does it make sense to

1272
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:13,470
move them on the stream I don't know

1273
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:14,519
that would actually pay off to do so so

1274
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:15,750
I don't know if there's really any

1275
01:00:14,518 --> 01:00:18,389
reason to spend the stream time to make

1276
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:22,338
that happen but if you were just going

1277
01:00:18,389 --> 01:00:22,338
for the gust oh yeah you could do that

1278
01:00:27,739 --> 01:00:33,149
struck 93 by the way I'm from Iraq and

1279
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,559
it's 4am right now can you sometime do

1280
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:36,210
an earlier stream I don't mind not

1281
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,650
sleeping till 4am but in 2-3 week

1282
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:39,929
university start and be awesome if you

1283
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:41,369
bring back early hours this is the only

1284
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:44,009
time it really fits in my schedule most

1285
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:47,009
of the time at the moment I'm sorry

1286
01:00:44,009 --> 01:00:50,809
about that so that's why it is the time

1287
01:00:47,009 --> 01:00:52,949
that it is it's not because I don't

1288
01:00:50,809 --> 01:00:54,660
because I don't want it to be more

1289
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:57,828
accessible I you know I just I just

1290
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:57,828
can't I'm sorry

1291
01:00:59,349 --> 01:01:03,048
quarter on I think you only render top

1292
01:01:01,518 --> 01:01:04,968
level debug time functions i play on

1293
01:01:03,048 --> 01:01:05,748
drilling down yes that is like like I

1294
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:08,179
said the next we were doing and just

1295
01:01:05,748 --> 01:01:09,578
when we get left-click will implant a

1296
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:12,798
left lick where you can drill down

1297
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:14,179
that's what we'll be doing next fire

1298
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:15,288
Jack what is the other long bar some

1299
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:16,999
kind of frame wait should it be that

1300
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:19,910
long oh so if you probably asked that

1301
01:01:16,998 --> 01:01:23,988
before I myself ask that and complained

1302
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:25,428
about it disruptor are your name

1303
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:27,139
developer and or is this your

1304
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:31,009
professional job if not what is your day

1305
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:32,389
job yes I am well I most the time I

1306
01:01:31,009 --> 01:01:35,539
wasn't in the developer I was just a

1307
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:38,389
regular developer did game technology a

1308
01:01:35,539 --> 01:01:40,400
trad game tools that's that was what

1309
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:43,338
most of my professional career was at

1310
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:48,619
the moment I am doing an indie game but

1311
01:01:43,338 --> 01:01:51,498
that's a that's a new thing for me toms

1312
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:53,119
toms SAR i forget if the white line is

1313
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:54,798
33 minutes or 60 milliseconds could you

1314
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,380
add a green line for 60 hertz or inch or

1315
01:01:54,798 --> 01:02:00,219
30 red for 10 or something yeah well

1316
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:03,229
we're gonna make that graph a lot nicer

1317
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:05,150
in over the next few days now that we've

1318
01:02:03,228 --> 01:02:11,328
done like the underlying work so we

1319
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:13,400
should we should get that out XOXO

1320
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:14,869
dragon i noticed in task manager all my

1321
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,309
seen games or 34 processes is there a

1322
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:17,630
really good reason to compile game 2 30

1323
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:20,919
pitch Rather's before it's just

1324
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:24,159
compatibility microsoft because they

1325
01:02:20,918 --> 01:02:26,900
like extracting money out of people

1326
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:29,778
tries to make 64-bit windows an upsell

1327
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:33,108
so 32-bit windows is a cheaper sku than

1328
01:02:29,778 --> 01:02:35,208
64 windows so like I've said before

1329
01:02:33,108 --> 01:02:36,168
Microsoft just you know they don't care

1330
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:38,538
about developers they don't care about

1331
01:02:36,168 --> 01:02:40,278
the fact that it makes developers life

1332
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:42,769
hard to keep having to support 32-bit

1333
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:45,048
for no reason at all they're just like

1334
01:02:42,768 --> 01:02:47,328
don't worry about it we're just here for

1335
01:02:45,048 --> 01:02:48,829
the money and you guys can can go have

1336
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:50,749
another compatibility nightmare courtesy

1337
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:52,249
of Microsoft so that's the world we live

1338
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:54,198
in unfortunately and until they stop

1339
01:02:52,248 --> 01:02:56,598
doing that shipping 32 executables is

1340
01:02:54,199 --> 01:03:00,318
the best way to ensure maximum

1341
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:01,909
capability if you don't care you

1342
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,099
certainly could get away with shipping a

1343
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:05,209
64-bit only executable because it's true

1344
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:08,659
that it's only like ten percent of the

1345
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:10,728
market or something but again you know

1346
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:13,358
that's just just a game you gotta play

1347
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:13,358
unfortunately

1348
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:23,119
socialist kid the debugger displays for

1349
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,380
faster time we're good you any visuals

1350
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,069
to remember you said yeah I would like

1351
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:31,460
to after we finish with this ad the same

1352
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:32,870
kind of markup for the memory so so that

1353
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,260
that is something that I would like to

1354
01:03:32,869 --> 01:03:35,259
do yes

1355
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,630
you

1356
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:48,980
alright let's like that's the end of the

1357
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:48,980
questions

1358
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:14,889
would you be willing to do a 12 to our

1359
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:21,460
priests dream haha no I mean maybe once

1360
01:04:14,889 --> 01:04:22,779
in a while but but not every day no all

1361
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,190
right I'm going to wind it down since it

1362
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,859
looks like we're done with the the

1363
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:29,320
queues the queue oh dear I don't touch

1364
01:04:26,858 --> 01:04:33,009
the wacom tablet oh my god what happened

1365
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:45,180
I don't know what just happened my pipe

1366
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:52,090
my blackboard like went nuts help what

1367
01:04:45,179 --> 01:05:01,299
what happened oh there's all the there

1368
01:04:52,090 --> 01:05:04,960
it all is right ah miss chief not a

1369
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:07,060
scalable program apparently we have like

1370
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,300
come to the point where it's unable to

1371
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:17,679
let keep up with us look at all that oh

1372
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:20,080
my lord oh my my goodness look oh weird

1373
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:24,789
there's like a parallel it's like

1374
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:26,259
another trail of stuff over there I'm

1375
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:30,489
going to go right in the middle here I'm

1376
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:32,910
going to leave us right here that's what

1377
01:05:30,489 --> 01:05:32,909
I'm going to do

1378
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:55,539
all right file save minimize okay all

1379
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:58,510
right thank you everyone for joining me

1380
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:59,679
for another episode of handmade hero it

1381
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:01,210
has been a pleasure coding with you as

1382
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:04,750
always and I'm glad that we are now

1383
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:06,369
having a nicer debug view I'm looking

1384
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:08,079
forward to the next few days of just

1385
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:09,880
like implementing some UI stuff I think

1386
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,779
it's going to be kind of cool so we can

1387
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,990
kind of look at all that information

1388
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:17,670
that we're capturing I am into that I

1389
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:19,839
think it's going to be pretty nifty so

1390
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:22,090
hopefully you will continue to join me

1391
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,789

would love to see you here again for

1394
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:31,480
some more good UI upgrades to our debug

1395
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,980
system so that's going to be pretty fun

1396
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,420
hope see you here for that in the

1397
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,429
meantime if you want to follow along at

01:06:44,889 --> 01:06:48,489
learning from the source code we also

1405
01:06:47,019 --> 01:06:51,909
have a forum site you can go to ask

1406
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:53,589
questions and if you want to to look at

1407
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:55,179
annotated episode guide by some of the

1408
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:57,190
people who are on the chat actually

1409
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:58,599
community members do an anti episode

1410
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:00,789
guide up there it's pretty cool we have

1411
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:02,920
a patreon page you can support the video

1412
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:04,000
series on we have a tweet pipe between

1413
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,670
schedule you have to try to catch it

1414
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,519
live and so please check out those links

1415
