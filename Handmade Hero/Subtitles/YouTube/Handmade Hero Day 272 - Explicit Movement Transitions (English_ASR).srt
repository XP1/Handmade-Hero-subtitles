1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,099
start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,960
welcome to handmade Hero the show where

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:11,000
we code a complete game live on stream

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,888
before we get back to game coding today

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,579
we've got some announcements to make for

6
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:20,608
folks who you may be just just joining

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,799
or are not in the know first things

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,250
first the handmade Network site has

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,410
launched and it is not actually like a

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,420
kind of an official launch yet they are

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,099
sort of it's it's more like a public

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,559
beta they said they're not going to be

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,529
necessarily doing

14
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,359
I think they click on the soft launch so

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,160
they're still taking feedback and

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,439
collecting bug reports and that sort of

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,729
stuff but anyone it's accessible to the

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,640
public now so if you want to check it

19
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:51,619
out you can and that is just that

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,808
handmade network this is the site and e

21
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:56,549
there's a handmade hero page on it the

22
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:58,500
reason for the handmade hero page on it

23
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,738
is because it is now the place where the

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,920
forums are hosted and they're a lot

25
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,478
nicer than the old forums and by nicer I

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,930
mostly just mean that they are not

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,368
infinitely slow like the old forums I

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,430
don't know if you remember are just

29
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:18,000
incredibly incredibly slow to use and

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,860
they were in this nasty Joomla craziness

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,219
and so it's exactly the same forums that

32
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:26,879
you're used to there at hero handmade

33
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,469
Network and that's got like the the sort

34
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,969
of landing page and and that sort of

35
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,670
stuff and also the forum's page and

36
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,099
there's a specific subsection if you

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,710
just want the forum's the link on the

38
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:40,349
home page will now go here when you

39
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:42,989
click on forums your login should still

40
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:44,908
work so the old law you shouldn't have

41
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,310
to make a new account you should still

42
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,159
have you know whoever you are

43
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,750
username will still work here and when

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,430
you log in you can just put in your old

45
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,149
user name and credentials and it should

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,210
just work so you shouldn't have to do

47
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,978
really anything in particular you'll

48
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:04,408
just end up with new forums and by

49
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:06,780
default just a few things are listed on

50
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:11,219
the main page and then when you click on

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,689
the more you get the whole the full set

52
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:15,930
of stuff

53
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:18,180
again still it's it's not fully launched

54
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,189
yet they're still they said they didn't

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,930
want to publicize it too widely but they

56
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:23,908
did say it was okay to announce it and

57
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,349
the forums have been moved over to it so

58
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:26,848
people who want to use the forums have

59
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:30,179
to go here now the old forums are no

60
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:33,899
longer accessible in any way so check

61
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:38,340
that out and that yeah and that is that

62
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,500
is the news that is the news so that's

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,989
about it for business

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,789
I think other than that I did take the

65
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,250
opportunity to sort of clean up some of

66
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:49,348
these things the twitch page now has

67
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,509
some cleaned up stuff at the underneath

68
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:53,310
it the schedule bot and the past

69
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:55,318
episodes I sort of changed the schedule

70
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,878
about wording in the past episodes now

71
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,009
instead of going to the YouTube just

72
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,259
goes straight to the episode guide which

73
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,239
again is also it's exactly the same as

74
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:06,269
it was before it's just it's now hosted

75
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,640
under the handmade Network placement as

76
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,469
well so you know if you come in here

77
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,929
you'll get the exact same stuff you were

78
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:19,259
used to get but it's just hosted at the

79
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,129
at the new location so yeah so nobody

80
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,030
should really have to change anything

81
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,049
they're doing just hopefully

82
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,909
everything's a little bit better now

83
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,500
because it's out of the sort of janky

84
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:31,799
old way that was being done and it's now

85
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:33,479
on a server that's that's running much

86
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,650
more smoothly and gets rid of lot of the

87
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:39,179
cruft of the old forums so that's it if

88
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,139
anyone has any questions about that

89
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:47,040
stuff or feedback you can go I think

90
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,659
anywhere on here like I don't know I

91
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,539
don't know super much how to use the

92
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,639
site on handmade network but I think at

93
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:56,459
the bottom of every page I'm not really

94
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,139
sure yeah at the bottom of every page of

95
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,319
course it's behind my head there's a

96
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,680
contact thing here or you can just put

97
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:06,958
contact after the the URL if you look

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,780
here there's information about who to

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,269
contact if you have a problem with the

100
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,709
site that isn't working the way it used

101
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,250
to or something and you're trying to get

102
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,590
to something it's it's it comes in here

103
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,319
at the moment I have been told that

104
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,269
there is a holdup with as far as

105
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,680
handmade hero is concerned right now

106
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,990
there's only the Forbes if sub guide

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,480
there's a resources page that's missing

108
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,389
and a thanks page that are missing those

109
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,160
are supposed to be imported sometime

110
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,019
soon so hopefully by the end of the week

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,390
those way back those are not super

112
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:40,469
important pages at the moment like

113
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,870
they're not like the forums where they

114
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,760
get used every day but they are pretty

115
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,340
important so they'll be back they're not

116
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,420
they weren't deleted but they are

117
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:51,299
they're not here yet

118
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,250
I think that's everything if it's not

119
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,110
everything you can ask the guys in chat

120
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,430
most of the people responsible for this

121
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,319
site are on the chat right now so you

122
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,030
can ask them about it and/or

123
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,610
congratulate them for getting everything

124
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,719
working smoothly I already was playing

125
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,460
around with the forums and they're quite

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
a bit nicer like I said it's it's kind

127
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:13,019
of nice to just be able to click through

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,269
them and not have to wait at least on my

129
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,279
machines it was always you know you'd

130
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:20,060
click and you'd wait forever for it to

131
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,609
load up one of these responses and I

132
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,639
think that's just because joomla's is

133
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:30,930
real bad anyway that's all there is to

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,599
say about that so let's go ahead and get

135
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,000
started here today is day 272 if you

136
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,290
would like to follow along at home you

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,629
want to use day 271 source code and that

138
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,280
is the source the state of the source

139
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:49,500
code that I am going to be using today

140
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,989
so if we look at where we left off I had

141
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,350
just started programming some stuff for

142
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,780
the main character in the game because

143
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,419
we have most of the engine stuff that we

144
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,409
wanted to write written and so I was

145
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:04,259
starting to play around with the main

146
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,430
character and essentially what I want to

147
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,120
do for the main character is there's a

148
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:12,209
little bit of a kind of a strange aspect

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,389
to his motion it is not that similar to

150
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:17,009
the way most characters move in fact the

151
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,329
exact design that I have for it which we

152
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,300
were in the process of implementing now

153
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:23,728
is I don't think I've ever actually seen

154
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,860
a game used this this method of

155
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:28,469
controlling the character so it's going

156
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,310
to be a little unusual and it's going to

157
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,810
take us some tuning to get it to

158
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,399
feel right as well because it's kind of

159
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,139
a new sort of thing but that's okay

160
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:37,689
that's what game programming is about so

161
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,959
as you can see unlike before the head

162
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:42,550
and the body are now dissociated which

163
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,349
of course is very disturbing for this

164
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,319
this poor little fellow that is not the

165
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,520
intent in the long run that is just the

166
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,980
way that I was choosing to start

167
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:53,500
developing how he moved and the reason

168
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,410
for this is because the bottom like the

169
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,110
part of the of the person of the hero

170
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,810
that stands on the ground is going to

171
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,040
lock to a particular location on the

172
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,569
screen now it doesn't actually have to

173
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,610
be a grid we've created a grid here

174
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:10,810
because I think a lot of the screens

175
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:13,960
will want to be grid like so it is going

176
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,449
to be oftentimes grid like but we don't

177
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:20,019
actually require it to be grid like we

178
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:22,269
may use some very non grid or sort of

179
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,859
layouts of things in the future but what

180
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,919
they will all have in common and you can

181
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,330
see this based on the little squares the

182
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,180
little yellowish squares in the middle

183
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:34,240
there they're sort of orange squares

184
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,310
that the that the the body snaps to what

185
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,860
you will notice about these is that it

186
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,199
always has to go and be on one of those

187
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,810
points that's where the body has to be

188
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:46,149
and so what I want to have happen and

189
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,250
what we're trying to shoot for now is I

190
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:51,399
want the body to always be locked to one

191
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,370
of those and when I move the head what I

192
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,539
want to do is for him to just lean so

193
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,139
what we're going to try and do is make

194
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:02,550
it so the body part of the hero just

195
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:05,800
leans you know left or leans right and

196
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,530
then only when the head has sort of

197
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,520
gotten to the midpoint right so when I'm

198
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:15,669
here then the body actually sort of will

199
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:17,620
jump right and I mean that literally not

200
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,060
in the figurative sense of its

201
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,069
teleporting from one place to another in

202
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,870
code I mean literally jump like the

203
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:28,000
character will like push off the ground

204
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:30,490
and you know go towards the and go

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,399
towards the other one so it'll it'll

206
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,139
kind of hop and so you can move the head

207
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,529
around freely and the head will be

208
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,269
movable not maybe exactly like I'm

209
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,968
moving it now

210
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:43,620
kind of similar like it will feel mostly

211
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,180
like this to move the character around

212
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,299
the only difference will be if you let

213
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:52,729
go of the motion what if I'm not moving

214
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:55,469
it'll snap back to the to the neck right

215
00:08:52,730 --> 00:09:00,180
and so what we really need to do now is

216
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,019
I need to essentially take that what

217
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,289
will there's a couple things we need to

218
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,909
do now one is I have to actually write

219
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,490
some real code this was kind of just

220
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:11,309
makeshift code I need to write some real

221
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,250
code that tries to actually keep the the

222
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:18,269
body on a particular square so that has

223
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:20,399
to be done and I also need to write some

224
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:23,399
code that will stretch the body like do

225
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,440
that sort of rotation and scale so that

226
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,720
the body will attach to the head because

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,370
I don't want it to appear like the head

228
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,459
is floating at all I want it to feel

229
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,690
like the head is solidly attached to the

230
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:39,119
body so we need to do that and then I

231
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,220
need to start working on the code for

232
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,490
doing that animation of sort of jumping

233
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,089
between different locations so a lot of

234
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,370
work there and I think it'll take us

235
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,560
several days because we're only doing an

236
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:57,629
hour a day I think it'll take us several

237
00:09:52,559 --> 00:10:01,949
days to get this right and since this is

238
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:04,799
gonna be the main way that you interact

239
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,839
with the game is this kind of motion we

240
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,120
really want this to feel good and look

241
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,440
good so we want to get a good first pass

242
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,700
here it's probably not going to be the

243
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,200
final one because you know we'll

244
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,320
probably tweak it continuously

245
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,420
throughout the entire project but we

246
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,870
want something that we that feels good

247
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:24,000
to us now so that we know before going

248
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,459
any further with this design we know

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,940
that that part is stable you definitely

250
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:32,609
don't want to proceed further in the

251
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,279
code until you know that the actual act

252
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,050
of interacting with the character is you

253
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,939
know enjoyable right that that would be

254
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:40,889
bad if it felt lousy turned of the

255
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,100
character and I feel lousy of course I

256
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:45,149
mean to me because it's my game

257
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,769
obviously not everyone has the same

258
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,299
opinions about how character motion

259
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:50,458
should feel of course everyone thinks

260
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,689
that they have the only right opinion

261
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,539
about how character motion should feel

262
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,110
but those people are unfortunately

263
00:10:54,539 --> 00:11:02,579
misguided and probably products of a

264
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,110
broken childhood so it's okay you know

265
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,470
they can get therapy it's not the end of

266
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:10,000
the world and and the rest of us can

267
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,470
just acknowledge the fact that we have

268
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,960
different opinions about how character

269
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,879
motion should work so let's go in here

270
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:21,310
to handmade code and let's go take a

271
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,230
look at the sort of beginnings of the

272
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:26,379
code that I put in there it was in world

273
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,750
move dot CPP and we've got sort of the

274
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:32,049
two different things here we've got the

275
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,789
hero head and here you know you can kind

276
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:38,500
of see the code that I wrote here here

277
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:40,750
is dope sorry that's the motion code for

278
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,080
it I don't actually need that here we go

279
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:48,909
let's see here

280
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:51,930
zero body and here we go so what I was

281
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:54,519
doing here is again just sort of

282
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:56,769
prototyping out this code I essentially

283
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,720
made it so that the body just takes a

284
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:01,179
look at wherever the head is it searches

285
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,610
for the closest point that it could

286
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,009
stand on to the head and it moves

287
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,409
towards that now if it's already on that

288
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:10,539
point obviously it'll just kind of stay

289
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:13,719
on it but if it's a different point

290
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:15,789
it'll move toward it and it moves toward

291
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,370
it using the standard movement code that

292
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:22,659
we had worked on already so the problem

293
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,909
with this there's a number of problems

294
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:30,669
with this but the biggest problem with

295
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:33,549
this is it's a little - it's a little

296
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:36,939
too analog for my taste

297
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:39,909
in this circumstance right what's

298
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,580
happening right now is that body and I

299
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:44,679
can sort of draw this out for you what I

300
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,360
kind of what I'm what I'm a little

301
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:50,769
nervous about and what I will you know

302
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:54,190
sort of try to correct here so what I'm

303
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,259
a little nervous about is you know I've

304
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,990
got the the body here you know here's

305
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:02,500
the head here's the body and the body is

306
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,990
standing on a particular point now what

307
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,278
I want to do is I want to acknowledge

308
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,068
the fact that they

309
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:11,679
is essentially two phases here because

310
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:13,229
right now we only have one phase right

311
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,359
there's only movement

312
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:19,720
there's just where am I trying to go

313
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,568
right we just have a target and we have

314
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,220
a position and we're just always gonna

315
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,479
move towards that right I mean that's

316
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,009
the way this code we're gonna just read

317
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,139
this code you can see that that's what

318
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:31,058
it does it basically says like okay I'm

319
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,278
just trying to go here and the reason

320
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:35,620
why it sort of stops on a point is

321
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,600
because if that target happens to be

322
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,999
coincident with the point then there's

323
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,480
really no motion and so yeah you know we

324
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:46,749
get a situation like that where it comes

325
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,499
to basic rest on the thing but it's

326
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:53,050
sloppy and it overshoots and it's it

327
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:55,120
doesn't even really know the difference

328
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:56,948
at this point it doesn't it doesn't

329
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,600
really have a conception of being in

330
00:13:56,948 --> 00:14:00,429
those modes the only that could really

331
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,740
do is if I wanted to I could I could

332
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:04,958
check an epsilon and say how close to my

333
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,829
to the point if I'm close enough then

334
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,899
call it a day right so but but the code

335
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:14,019
you know is just not aware of that

336
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:16,448
aspect of it at the moment so I think

337
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:19,419
the first thing I would like to do is is

338
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:23,620
increase that sort of state space to

339
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:28,688
basically have stand and movement as two

340
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:30,399
separate modes and people asked to like

341
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:32,588
one person asked me the other day to

342
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,110
explain we didn't get to it

343
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:40,089
but in the questions they had asked me

344
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:41,680
to explain finite state machines and you

345
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:43,449
know we can try to explain it we can try

346
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:48,549
to do this at some point finance state

347
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:50,678
machines are are kind of they're one of

348
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:53,979
those sort of glorified terms that that

349
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:56,198
isn't really super useful because it

350
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,079
makes it sound like there's a formalism

351
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,578
when really there's oftentimes not a for

352
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,159
muslim and oftentimes you really don't

353
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:04,659
want a formalism if you go read

354
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,490
something like compiler literature

355
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,318
you'll see a very formal definition of

356
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:13,919
things such as a finite state machine

357
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:17,828
usually there's sort of these there's

358
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,599
there's two aspects of these again with

359
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:20,109
the foremost and maybe we'll explain

360
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,550
these someday

361
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,169
I'm not gonna really talk about today

362
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:25,778
there's deterministic and

363
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:28,389
non-deterministic ones and there's a lot

364
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:30,879
of there's a lot of stuff in here that

365
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:33,610
that gets formalized for purposes that

366
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,708
are probably quite useful in CS but are

367
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,028
really not very useful in programming

368
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,649
like if what you're actually trying to

369
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:40,179
do is get stuff accomplished I don't

370
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,610
find these are ever useful to really

371
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:45,669
think about and the reason for that is

372
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,310
because they approach the problem kind

373
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:50,469
of the reverse direction from what you

374
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:52,389
actually are trying to do I think of

375
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,940
FSMs a lot like object-oriented

376
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:58,088
programming they are basically a way of

377
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,820
trying to pretend that the notion of

378
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:05,079
like what state you're in is somehow

379
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,970
this like pure primal important thing

380
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:10,088
and everything else has to like come out

381
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,970
of this concept of the state that you

382
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:15,610
are in and that's just hogwash it's not

383
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,500
actually true and so again while finite

384
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,329
state machines as a formalism for

385
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,980
certain types of analysis and in

386
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:23,349
studying things and all the sort of

387
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,180
stuff is probably quite useful in actual

388
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,909
coding it tends to lead people down the

389
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:29,799
OOP trail I feel like the same sorts of

390
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:31,419
stuff that's problematic about thinking

391
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,708
that objects are primal and objects are

392
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,360
very important and you should start with

393
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,859
the objects same sort of thing happens

394
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,269
to people when they go down the finite

395
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,009
state machine route they start thinking

396
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,919
that states are this important thing and

397
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:44,828
somehow it's different really it doesn't

398
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,659
matter at all right conceptually

399
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:48,789
speaking you may want to start thinking

400
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:51,100
of things in terms of having some states

401
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:52,360
when the part when you're at the part of

402
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,339
your program when it's clear that there

403
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,899
are some concrete different states but

404
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,730
really there's a lot of fluidity between

405
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:58,958
these two things and oftentimes you

406
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,430
don't really want to think about things

407
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,409
being is entirely in one state or

408
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:04,899
another and so you want to let the

409
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:07,599
concept of States come out of the

410
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,809
natural coding process and you don't

411
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,208
want to like clamp this concept of a

412
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:15,039
finite state machine down on to the code

413
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,449
because it has all of those same

414
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,129
negative effects that object-oriented

415
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,500
programming does that doesn't mean you

416
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,720
won't get to something that has finite

417
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,230
state machine like elements in it and in

418
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,699
fact you would argue I think quite

419
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,440
convincingly that there's plenty of

420
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:31,390
parts of handmade hero that already look

421
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
finite state machine like and that's

422
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,100
because in the course of ordinary

423
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,799
you oftentimes will end up with an enum

424
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,599
that says what of a couple different

425
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,970
ways something could work it should be

426
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,679
working right now and inside the switch

427
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,930
statement that switches on those enums

428
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,880
will be what's the rule for

429
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,160
transitioning to it to setting the enum

430
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,110
to a different value that Eden of itself

431
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,120
is definitely a finite state machine and

432
00:17:52,109 --> 00:18:00,389
so again not a bad thing just a bad way

433
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,308
of approaching a problem you usually

434
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,200
want to come at it the other way round

435
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:05,759
and then you'll just find one day Oh

436
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,710
looks like there's some finite state

437
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,839
machines in here and pretty much any

438
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,750
program of any complexity will have some

439
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,509
finite some things in it that look like

440
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:18,420
or technically even are directly a

441
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:20,970
finite state machine it's what computing

442
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:25,110
it's how computing works so it's not

443
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:27,360
surprising so what I want to do is sort

444
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:30,299
of increase the state nough sub this and

445
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,428
saying that when I'm moving around the

446
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:35,190
body is gonna be in a particular state

447
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:37,080
which is stationary and when it is in a

448
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,420
state that's stationary no matter what I

449
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,460
do with the head the body is gonna stay

450
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,890
where it is and so to get this sort of

451
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,679
starting is very simple obviously you

452
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,370
know I can just go to the sim entity

453
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,559
oops sorry

454
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:51,509
it's not in sync entity it's in same

455
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:53,069
region will probably to start breaking

456
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:55,289
these files up a little bit as we sort

457
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:59,879
of get going with them but for the

458
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:03,509
moment fine so in here I'm just gonna do

459
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,920
like a sim movement mode or something

460
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:09,900
like this and I'm just gonna say okay

461
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,130
there's a there's a movement mode which

462
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:18,660
is like body standing or something like

463
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:21,570
this or you know planted and then

464
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,100
there's a sim movement hopping and I'm

465
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:25,829
just gonna have those two modes right

466
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,959
now and so when I am talking about the

467
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:29,579
body it can either be planted which

468
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,250
means it's like on the ground

469
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:34,019
specifically or it can be hopping which

470
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:38,130
means it's going to like move from one

471
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:42,029
place to another right so here's my

472
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:44,910
movement mode and then in here when we

473
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:46,649
get to something like Hiro body I can

474
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,710
switch on what the

475
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:53,430
mode is and I can do whatever I want so

476
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,950
if I say okay what's my movement mode I

477
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,980
can say all right if the movement mode

478
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,750
is similar you know that should probably

479
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:11,150
instead of it's similar subbing movement

480
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:11,150
mode so if my movement mode is planted

481
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:17,099
then I should not be able to do anything

482
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,509
at the moment and if my movement mode is

483
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:24,299
hopping then I I can you know have it

484
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:26,759
happen so I'm gonna go ahead and take

485
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:29,609
this code well I suppose I should also

486
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,250
say that you know probably you've got to

487
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,689
have the head if the head is gone none

488
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,309
of this is gonna happen but I'm gonna

489
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,799
take the exact same stuff I did before

490
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:39,359
I'm gonna say that in hopping mode for

491
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,460
now even though it's not what I actually

492
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:48,269
want for now what it will do when it

493
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:50,190
hops is it'll use this this sort of this

494
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,529
this chasing behavior that we already

495
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,380
implemented and when we're planted we

496
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:56,819
won't okay so now what should happen if

497
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,800
everything is working correctly that

498
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:00,960
movement mode is gonna be initialized to

499
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,470
zero when this thing is cleared and so

500
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,880
when I actually try to run this game

501
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,950
when I move the head nothing should

502
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,290
happen right it should be stationary and

503
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,140
the reason for that is because I can't

504
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,940
actually ever get out of that mode

505
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,180
there's no way to trigger a transition

506
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,070
to the to the hopping mode and so what I

507
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,560
want to do here is write some kind of an

508
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:25,829
if statement inside that planted mode

509
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,429
that's like well what has to happen to

510
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:32,909
make me start hopping right what will

511
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:35,070
make that hop start occurring and so I

512
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,930
may want to keep this code for example I

513
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:40,710
may want to say let's take a look at

514
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:43,350
what the closest thing is right and so

515
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:46,529
I'm gonna move that code outside will

516
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:48,750
say every time we'll take a look but we

517
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,309
just won't actually do any movement

518
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,299
unless we're in the hopping mode so in

519
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:57,389
here what I could say is well okay

520
00:21:53,299 --> 00:22:00,259
wherever the head is I'm gonna say that

521
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:03,980
if the if the closest point

522
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:06,859
um if the closest point to the head is

523
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,559
not the same as the closest point to the

524
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:12,289
body then that's when I would start

525
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:16,069
moving let's say right I guess the other

526
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,869
thing I could do is say well the the

527
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,879
distance of the point from where I am

528
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,549
has to be greater than something who

529
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,040
knows right but I can easily do that so

530
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:27,169
if I said here's my closest distance

531
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,579
squared I could say that the closest

532
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:33,259
distance squared well that's gonna be

533
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:35,000
the head so yeah I need that I need to

534
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:39,920
basically say how far is the point to me

535
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,269
so here's the closest P so I'm gonna say

536
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:46,820
all right the the body Delta I guess the

537
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:51,349
body Delta is if I was going to go from

538
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:53,599
where I am now to where I want to be

539
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:55,969
that's the Delta between you know that

540
00:22:53,599 --> 00:23:00,259
I'm gonna have to move and so how far is

541
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,569
that right so this is the body distance

542
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:08,960
and that's just going to be the length

543
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:09,980
squared again I'm just avoiding a square

544
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,710
root although they're not really that

545
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,839
expensive anymore I'm from I'm from I'm

546
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,700
old enough that I always think of square

547
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,409
roots is scary like oh my god don't take

548
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,059
a square root if they're not even scary

549
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:24,740
anymore you can go ahead and square root

550
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:27,279
stuff all day long sines and cosines

551
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,539
still aren't great but square root

552
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,990
nobody cares about square root at all

553
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,940
anymore

554
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,380
even sign the cosines aren't really a

555
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,570
big deal anymore compared to memory

556
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,720
accesses

557
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:41,179
nobody cares anyway body distance is

558
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,769
gonna be a length squared of the body

559
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,279
Delta and so what I want to do here is

560
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:50,029
say if that body distance is greater

561
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,799
than some amount that I'm gonna call my

562
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:54,619
tolerance so whatever my tolerance is

563
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:56,180
like let's say you know a hundredth of a

564
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:59,209
meter if it's if it's more than that

565
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,410
then I'm going to switch into the other

566
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,940
movement mode so I'm going to switch my

567
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:07,040
movement mode to two movement mode

568
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:09,680
hopping

569
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,490
and I'm going to do the exact same thing

570
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:17,299
here when I'm in movement mode hopping

571
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:20,690
I'm gonna say that my transition out of

572
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:23,029
hopping is just going to be when the

573
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:26,269
body distance is underneath that

574
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:28,369
tolerance again this is just for now

575
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:34,910
this is just to have something that does

576
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:39,219
whatever it's gonna do so that doesn't

577
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,220
look like it's stopping what did I do

578
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,740
it helps if you actually type the right

579
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:49,549
transition in so now what should happen

580
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:52,430
is when I move it should actually stop

581
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:58,639
or not and you know what I might do here

582
00:24:52,430 --> 00:25:05,380
actually I feel like I should be able to

583
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,380
take the body can I click on the body

584
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:12,529
wonder why I can't click on the body do

585
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:15,529
we know why I can't click on the body

586
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:17,000
because there it's it's not like I can

587
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:20,720
easily make it so that we wouldn't get

588
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,920
at it but I only I'm only getting like I

589
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,920
can never actually click on that

590
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:29,960
hmm we're gonna have to figure out at

591
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,190
some point how to make sure we can click

592
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,558
on all our entities because right now

593
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:38,420
we're not really able to to to view

594
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,099
stuff for entities that we can't

595
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,429
highlight and there's a lot of entities

596
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:45,189
we can't highlight right which is super

597
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:47,480
annoying like I can click on these guys

598
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,850
but I can't click on the one that I want

599
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:54,380
to click on that make sense so that's

600
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:59,539
unfortunate um what was I about to say

601
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:01,790
oh right so I want to see why this guy

602
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:04,700
never actually gets out of his hopping

603
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:06,558
mode right because you can see here when

604
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,690
I'm taking the body distance from

605
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,160
wherever the closest point is I would

606
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,799
have expected to be able to get my

607
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,390
movement mode back to planted at some

608
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,759
point right

609
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,490
and at the moment it does not seem to be

610
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:21,740
the case and I'm not sure why so I'm

611
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,779
gonna go ahead and take a look and see

612
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,400
what's happening there it may be that

613
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:27,049
our the way that we've written our

614
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,090
movement code is such that the drag is

615
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:30,409
insufficient for it and if so the stuff

616
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:33,019
we're gonna do in a minute will take

617
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,429
care of that entirely but yeah so I

618
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:38,650
guess it looks like we never we never

619
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,650
get here do we okay there we go

620
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:50,879
let's come back around

621
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:07,419
you know what I think I think I know

622
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:11,798
what it is or maybe I don't I don't know

623
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:18,730
we'll see uh do we know why this is

624
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:20,349
still happening here so this why is the

625
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,849
entity coalition getting set to null

626
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:28,599
collision do we know why that's

627
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:30,639
happening still I will say that I'm a

628
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:31,778
little surprised at that I don't know

629
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,110
what that's still doing there let's get

630
00:27:31,778 --> 00:27:37,599
rid of that just because that is not

631
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:40,778
supposed to be there okay

632
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,579
so I need to figure out again why I'm

633
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:46,839
not getting the stopping here when I

634
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:50,558
switch to the planted mode and what I

635
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,569
want to figure out is it what is causing

636
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,428
me to move out of it so let's let's

637
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:59,349
again go ahead here and say I'm going to

638
00:27:54,429 --> 00:28:02,730
set both breakpoints so if we get to

639
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:02,730
either of these now it will happen

640
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:09,278
so it looks like it's just because we

641
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,990
oscillate in between them and this is

642
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,720
probably because this is a bit sloppy

643
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,329
like I mean you could imagine you want

644
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,460
the collar ins for example of this guy

645
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:20,319
well okay here's another thing I could

646
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,259
do even with this type of tolerance I

647
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:26,439
could do something like this I could set

648
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:28,298
the velocity of the character to zero

649
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,460
immediately upon hitting it so he

650
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:32,200
doesn't carry forward because that now I

651
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,759
think about it I forgotten that we do

652
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,409
physical simulation on the movement of

653
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,778
the characters so probably what actually

654
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:39,250
happened there is hey we got close

655
00:28:37,778 --> 00:28:41,019
enough but we don't have any

656
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,390
acceleration anymore if we if we stop

657
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,298
accelerating we'll keep our velocity and

658
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:48,278
you know our drag will be set to nothing

659
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:49,778
because our drag will be zero which

660
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:51,369
means we'll just glide until we're

661
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:53,648
outside the point and we'll toggle back

662
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:57,668
so we need to if we're going to stop

663
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:59,019
actually stop if that makes sense so

664
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,419
actually now that I think about that was

665
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:04,058
probably yeah that was the entirety of

666
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:06,370
it so now you can see that we when we

667
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:07,808
actually get to it we do stop it's still

668
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:10,000
because of the way we send up it still

669
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:13,418
has the overshoot problem but there you

670
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,089
go so now that I have that what I want

671
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:19,870
to do is I want to move to a more

672
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:23,379
animation style movement of that because

673
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:27,699
this is a very discrete thing so I want

674
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,429
to make it so that it's I want to make

675
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:33,669
it so that the the control of it is not

676
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:35,980
just a chasing vector like that like I

677
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:39,070
think I don't really want to I don't

678
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,960
want to use acceleration velocity kinds

679
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:43,869
of stuff for it I think I want to use

680
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,630
something a little more procedural

681
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:49,388
potentially and that may be a mistake

682
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:52,690
I'm not sure but I think that's what I

683
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:57,609
want and the only reason that I think it

684
00:29:52,690 --> 00:30:00,159
might be a mistake and perhaps you might

685
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:03,129
also say the reason why I can't tell if

686
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,929
it's a mistake automatically is because

687
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,389
I'm not sure exactly what should be

688
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:09,820
happening fuel lies and I just kind of

689
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:11,408
have to play with it what I've got is a

690
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:13,148
situation where there are two places

691
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:15,669
where the player can be standing right

692
00:30:13,148 --> 00:30:17,949
as per the design of the game which

693
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:19,450
again perspective on the design of this

694
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,130
game is there is a design and we are

695
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,720
implementing it because this is a stream

696
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,010
about game programming and so the idea

697
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,089
is that if you were in a real

698
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:25,869
environment where you're actually

699
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,849
programming game

700
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:29,079
you aren't the game designer you have

701
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,308
been told that this is how I'm supposed

702
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,980
to implement you're supposed to

703
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:34,960
implement this thing but you need to be

704
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,669
able to polish and tune it properly

705
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,690
because obviously if you don't have

706
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:40,690
those skills you're not gonna be a very

707
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,950
good game programmer so what we want to

708
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,808
do is take that design which says that

709
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,630
okay you need to hop from one to the

710
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:48,190
other you know the head is here and the

711
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,299
player is moving the head so we have to

712
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,399
have something that feels good for the

713
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:53,259
head control and when it gets to you

714
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:56,979
know somewhere like here we want this

715
00:30:53,259 --> 00:31:00,220
this hop to occur now the problem with

716
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,500
this is I don't really know what I want

717
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,038
to have happen if the if the player when

718
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,440
they're playing

719
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:09,669
moves the head - like let's say here and

720
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,440
the hop begins right so I'm I come up

721
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,870
here and maybe I'm here and the head is

722
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,970
like here by then but then they like

723
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:18,849
wail on the left button and start to

724
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:21,159
move the head back so now as this thing

725
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:23,888
kind of comes up here the head is back

726
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,110
here now and so now it's clear that the

727
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:27,990
body should actually

728
00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:32,099
verse course in sort of in its arc and

729
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,808
come back to here right let's take an

730
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,649
even worse scenario and look from the

731
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:37,678
top down

732
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,700
so here's from the top down here's one

733
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,548
standpoint

734
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,650
here's another standpoint and here's

735
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:46,679
another standpoint okay

736
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,019
the player is standing here they move

737
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,700
the head to here you know what I should

738
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:53,190
do is I should draw a square for the

739
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,380
body they move the head to here so the

740
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,990
square this square starts moving and it

741
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:01,230
gets to like here but then they the head

742
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:03,839
sort of moves back over to here by the

743
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,329
time the head gets here and now what

744
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:10,079
does the head do and what does the body

745
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:12,619
do because there's two ways I can write

746
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,668
this code and they have fairly profound

747
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:18,509
implications for how the game's going to

748
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:21,720
feel one is sort of like almost like a

749
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:24,179
basketball style feel where it's like

750
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,558
once you commit to a move with with the

751
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:30,900
pelvis it has to complete so once you

752
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:34,200
get past there once the hop starts the

753
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,990
hop ends here so you can still move the

754
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,880
head and you can move the head back the

755
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,798
other way and you'll be duck it you know

756
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,740
you'll be like dodging this way

757
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,839
essentially but the body will move into

758
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,058
that square right whether you like it or

759
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,359
not that's one way to do it the other

760
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:54,149
way is you can air control out of the

761
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:57,329
hop and actually come back to either

762
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:59,700
here or potentially even to a different

763
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:01,889
one of these like maybe you can even air

764
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,080
control you know if this is a and this

765
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,480
is B and you're going from A to B maybe

766
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,418
you can even air control out to see in

767
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,450
in that case right and I don't know

768
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:15,630
which of those is the best thing for

769
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:18,600
this game to feel like certainly there's

770
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:22,350
more like consequence to the concept

771
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,089
that if you if you go in a direction you

772
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:26,189
have to commit and you will go that

773
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:28,709
whole direction and you can air control

774
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,600
the head and dodge or do other things

775
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,710
potentially but you're gonna touch that

776
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,049
other square and any gameplay

777
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,720
implications that that has you've you've

778
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:38,569
now committed to that's certainly you

779
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,569
know a perhaps a more interesting

780
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:44,388
thing but it may not feel good enough it

781
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:46,668
may feel too heavy weight and it may be

782
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:49,609
that the player really wants to have a

783
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:51,019
forgiving enough control that they want

784
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:54,199
to be able to sort of cancel out that

785
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:56,240
hop so that they can sort of onion Oh

786
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,399
undo the fact that they made a hop in

787
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,620
that direction before they actually pay

788
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,058
whatever the cost is of stepping on that

789
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:03,979
other square you know maybe there's no

790
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:05,808
cost but sometimes there might be like

791
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:10,280
you know if you imagine that's a pit or

792
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:12,409
a bomb or a trap and I going there and

793
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,359
then I sort of like emit air correct out

794
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,909
of it do I want to let them do that or

795
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:19,578
don't I right and I don't know the

796
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,710
answer to that question but it has

797
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:23,539
implications on how we implement it

798
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:28,159
because obviously they they're gonna

799
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:31,940
feel a little bit different so what I'm

800
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:36,710
going to do is I'm going to implement

801
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:38,929
this for now as a parabolic spline right

802
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,519
so because this is this is about

803
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,980
somebody who's jumping up in the air and

804
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,318
so when you jump up in the air you're

805
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,210
gonna be in a gravitational arc right

806
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:49,730
and at the risk of stating the

807
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,710
overwhelmingly obvious in case folks on

808
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:56,179
the stream have never been to a physics

809
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:57,260
class you know in high school or

810
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:01,039
something

811
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:04,520
gravity's arc is a parabola right and

812
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:07,190
you know so the the look of the arc that

813
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,889
you jump when you jump into the air is a

814
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:13,460
parabola and as you know a parabola is a

815
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:16,309
function of time that is proportional to

816
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,088
the square of the time right so it's

817
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:21,650
going to be something that looks like

818
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:25,190
this it's an equation that looks like

819
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,358
this and T is not necessarily even an

820
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,190
interpolation parameter in this case I'm

821
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:30,559
talking about actual time like the real

822
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,210
time in the real world this is what

823
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,730
something looks like when it is in

824
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,710
freefall and again this is in a vacuum

825
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,139
it's not subject to air drag or anything

826
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,608
like that so there's other terms in here

827
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:42,858
if we want to start talking about other

828
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:44,929
physical sort of aspects to it but in

829
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:47,719
general the arc is going to be parabolic

830
00:35:44,929 --> 00:35:48,858
now why is that true and we've already

831
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,149
covered enough on hand-made here

832
00:35:48,858 --> 00:35:52,058
actually for you to know why it's true

833
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,769
if you go back to the physics

834
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:56,140
stuff you can figure it out pretty

835
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:57,698
easily and so I'll just mention it here

836
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:59,858
and if you care go back to the physics

837
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:02,889
things and look on the episodes we did

838
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:04,239
on basic basic equations of motion and

839
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:07,838
the reason is because the second

840
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:11,228
derivative of what happens in time in

841
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:14,938
the real world you know under gravity is

842
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:18,338
a constant gravity is a acceleration

843
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:20,828
right gravity is something that happens

844
00:36:18,338 --> 00:36:22,688
in the second derivative right because

845
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:24,099
remember what our derivatives are zero

846
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:27,068
through a video first order you know

847
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,420
we've got we've got position which is

848
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:30,009
where we are in the world that its first

849
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,838
derivatives of velocity and second

850
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:32,978
derivatives acceleration right so the

851
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,469
second derivative of something

852
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:37,598
acceleration gravity is a constant in

853
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:39,670
the second derivative it's it's 9.8

854
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,588
meters per second squared and that is

855
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:45,699
what it is that is what your

856
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:49,449
acceleration will be under gravity so if

857
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:51,729
something is constant in the second

858
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:54,519
derivative when you integrate it up one

859
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:56,618
time right it is going to be to the

860
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:58,598
first power of the thing that your of

861
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:00,969
the of the independent variable right

862
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:04,179
and if you integrate it up one more time

863
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:07,298
you will get it squared so the reason

864
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:09,130
things are parabolic under gravity is

865
00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:11,739
specifically because gravity is a

866
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:14,318
constant acceleration and acceleration

867
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:17,108
is the second second derivative of

868
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:19,058
position integrated up twice to get that

869
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:21,338
position and you will have a function

870
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:23,259
proportional to the square and that is

871
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:25,389
why this is the kind of thing that we

872
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:28,809
see when we're talking about an

873
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:31,598
acceleration all constant accelerations

874
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:39,359
are parabolas in space that's just how

875
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:39,359
that works that's math so

876
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:46,630
given that I know this to be true what I

877
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:49,568
should be able to do is write directly

878
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:52,329
into the motion of the character a

879
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:54,009
parabolic parabolic arc that will move

880
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:57,189
him from one to the other when he goes

881
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:59,139
into his ballistic phase and I will make

882
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:01,989
it so that his hop time takes a certain

883
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:04,900
amount of time again this is part of the

884
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:08,739
design of the game I wanted to sort of

885
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:10,418
explore the concept at for lack of a

886
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:11,918
better term I'm not a game designer so

887
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:13,838
you know take it with a grain of salt

888
00:38:11,918 --> 00:38:16,478
but it is my game so I can do whatever I

889
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,969
want I wanted to explore the concept

890
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:20,528
that you don't move the character as a

891
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:23,798
unit you move the character as two

892
00:38:20,528 --> 00:38:25,630
pieces and one piece moves sort of in a

893
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:26,798
more typical gamey sort of fashion where

894
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,419
you just kind of move it and it's just

895
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:30,880
kind of a sloppy thing that was around

896
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:32,588
but the other one is very specific and

897
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,179
you don't get the opportunity to

898
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:36,880
directly control it and tell it where

899
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:39,369
it's going to be and so that is how this

900
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,019
character's motion works so what I want

901
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:42,699
to do is say well in the planted mode

902
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,889
then we obviously know that this that we

903
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:50,798
don't really have anything happening as

904
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:52,208
far as as any differently right the

905
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:55,659
planted mode will work exactly the same

906
00:38:52,208 --> 00:38:57,938
way no movement for now and then when we

907
00:38:55,659 --> 00:39:00,969
find that we need to go somewhere far

908
00:38:57,938 --> 00:39:04,449
away from us then we will we will move

909
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:06,579
to our hopping mode okay so it's really

910
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:08,769
the only the other mode that we care

911
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:10,619
about and this is going to be a team

912
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:13,238
movement variable that I have in here

913
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:16,630
and that team movement variable is going

914
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:18,099
to go from like say zero to one okay so

915
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,169
what I'm gonna do in here is I'm going

916
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:23,409
to say that when we come in here we know

917
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:27,400
what the DT per frame is so I'm going to

918
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:30,969
go ahead and use whatever that that DT

919
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,809
for frame is I assume we've got that

920
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:35,708
here somewhere

921
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:37,599
I don't know where it actually is up

922
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:39,998
here it's just DT okay so I don't even

923
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,429
need to do that I just need to say T T

924
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:43,808
so we have the delta time and what I'm

925
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:47,619
going to do is going to take that T

926
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:50,079
movement variable for the entity and I'm

927
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,730
gonna go ahead and add it so as time

928
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,420
goes forwards the T movement

929
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:57,338
increase when I start my jump I'm gonna

930
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,320
set my to movement variable to zero

931
00:39:57,338 --> 00:40:01,900
so I know that I'm at the beginning of

932
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:05,859
it and when I find that I have reached

933
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,960
the end right then I will transition out

934
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:10,000
so instead of this previous thing that

935
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,550
we had before instead I'm going to say

936
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,769
okay I'm gonna say that the T movement

937
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,050
variable if it is greater than or equal

938
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:18,190
to one so I've completed my whole

939
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,130
parabolic arc and I'm just gonna

940
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:22,630
parameterize it from 0 to 1 for now

941
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:26,500
because that's usually the easiest way

942
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,730
to parameterize stuff like this like you

943
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,699
know it's easiest to think about things

944
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,829
normalized to arrange then I will say

945
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:35,139
okay that's the end of it

946
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:38,349
so the movement mode switches back well

947
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:39,909
it's this code right here the movement

948
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:45,039
mode switches back to planted after

949
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:46,809
that's done so now this code no longer

950
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,259
exists and I'm not going to move the

951
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:52,358
player Vyra this at all instead what I'm

952
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,670
going to do is move them specifically to

953
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:56,889
the point that I suggested so this is

954
00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:01,000
the closest P and so what I'm going to

955
00:40:56,889 --> 00:41:02,618
do is make a movement target and I'm

956
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,539
going to tell the code during that

957
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:08,170
transition hey this is the movement

958
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:10,389
target this is where you're going ok and

959
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,130
so now the simplest thing I couldn't do

960
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:14,318
and this is very very easy so I'm just

961
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:18,220
going to start with it is since I know

962
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:21,838
the movement target I should be able to

963
00:41:18,219 --> 00:41:21,838
make it so I can

964
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:31,559
I should be able to make it so that I

965
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:33,900
can go directly to that movement target

966
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,579
over time using the T movement variable

967
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,690
without using any interceding movement

968
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:40,319
code so we're just gonna make a

969
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:43,289
programmatic parabolic arc that we can

970
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,960
use here now I'm gonna start by making

971
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:50,400
this well in effect I may actually keep

972
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,349
it this way I'm gonna I'm gonna change

973
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,440
it up I'm gonna say that we keep the

974
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:57,299
from as well because that actually is is

975
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,710
going to be the easiest way to do this

976
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,800
there's there's a different way to do it

977
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,510
that we probably will maybe want to do

978
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,530
and probably talk about later but for

979
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,980
now we'll actually start here because

980
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:09,600
it'll be easier to show what's going on

981
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,730
so movement from is always going to be

982
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,349
the place that I started movement to is

983
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,730
that point that I'm trying to get to and

984
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:16,139
then I've got this team movement

985
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,699
variable so if I know the team move in

986
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:19,650
variable we can go back and lean on the

987
00:42:17,699 --> 00:42:24,059
exact same thing I say we always can use

988
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:25,260
which is and you know I'll zero out the

989
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,210
velocity or two just because I don't

990
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:30,030
actually want any possibility of getting

991
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:32,429
velocity which is just leaning on that

992
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,200
linear blend right I've got a T value

993
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:36,179
that ranges from zero to one I know

994
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:39,659
where I'm coming from I know where I'm

995
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:42,899
going to and so I can just lurk between

996
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:44,879
those two and that will get me my motion

997
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,300
and that's a starting place for my

998
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,329
motion right so if I come in here and we

999
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,150
take a look at what that value is you

1000
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:56,489
can see now that when I when I do it it

1001
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,920
just linearly moves between those points

1002
00:42:56,489 --> 00:43:01,319
right and the answer to how fast it

1003
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,539
moves is just whatever I added here so

1004
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,070
in the T movement code if I wanted to

1005
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,480
make this faster which I do you could

1006
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,710
see how slow that was this would be kind

1007
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,269
of maddening although perhaps

1008
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,829
interesting for a mode in the game where

1009
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:13,710
you accidentally swallow a bad potion

1010
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:15,389
and you move really slowly you know if I

1011
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,740
want it to move four times faster than

1012
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:18,239
that then that's just an additional

1013
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:19,769
speed multiplier that gets added on

1014
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,089
there right and you can see that I'm

1015
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:22,440
just moving between these and maybe

1016
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,840
that's the speed I don't know what the

1017
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,539
speed is I probably you know maybe a

1018
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,940
little faster even than that so that's

1019
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:31,199
the the T movement again really really

1020
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,579
straightforward and you can kind of see

1021
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,639
in fact that looks actually pretty good

1022
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:37,289
already just even at linear so but

1023
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:39,239
that's not a hop right that and that's

1024
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,019
not a parabola that's just looping

1025
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:41,819
between the two

1026
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:45,300
and so what I want to do now is I want

1027
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:48,870
to sort of add the arc in right eye I

1028
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:52,170
want to add the the that sort of that

1029
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:54,359
hop that that's in there and so the

1030
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,090
question is well how do I you know how

1031
00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:00,990
do I make that hop happen how do i how

1032
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:04,079
do i get that sort of that that sort of

1033
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:07,109
combination there right and so what I'm

1034
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,799
gonna do is I'm just gonna say well what

1035
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:17,490
we need is we need the concept of you

1036
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:20,010
know of this arc I have this point and I

1037
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:22,109
have this point and that's enough to

1038
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:24,180
tell me the line that I should move

1039
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,970
between these but what I need to know

1040
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:30,179
right is I need at least one other piece

1041
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:33,389
of information which is how high right

1042
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:36,509
so there's like a height in here that

1043
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:42,679
would tell me how I was going to to hop

1044
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:45,870
now I couldn't use a quadratic spline a

1045
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:47,609
quadratic B spline for this and feed in

1046
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:49,349
this midpoint by construction or

1047
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,210
whatever right and that's a pretty

1048
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:52,440
interesting thing but and there's a I

1049
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,940
actually have a video up on

1050
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,159
interpolation where I kind of explain

1051
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,210
how splines work and how to derive them

1052
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:58,529
and all that stuff we could go through

1053
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,360
that I'm gonna show you a different way

1054
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,519
right now because I think the spline

1055
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,990
stuff will come up at other times as

1056
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:05,340
well and so since we're in a situation

1057
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:07,409
that's fairly straightforward here I'm

1058
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,940
just gonna show you one other way you

1059
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:10,769
could approach this problem when I'm

1060
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,340
like you've got some things you know and

1061
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:18,360
you want to you kind of want to have

1062
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,220
some way of of making these things you

1063
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,559
know cuz look breaking down a problem

1064
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:24,119
like this so I'm just gonna kind of show

1065
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,650
you how to approach it from another

1066
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,420
angle of like breaking it apart and just

1067
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,690
give you more tools in the way you think

1068
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,970
about these things so the first thing

1069
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:36,119
that I would point out about this is we

1070
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:39,119
kind of know right a bunch of things

1071
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:42,329
about it at T equals zero we know we're

1072
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,819
at that from point right and at T equals

1073
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:50,489
one we know we're at that destination

1074
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:52,350
point right so we know that whatever the

1075
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:53,229
function is that we're talking about

1076
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,358
we know that the

1077
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:59,320
function this magical thing that we want

1078
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:03,309
if we plug in well zero to it right

1079
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:05,500
I want the it to evaluate to whatever

1080
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:09,369
the from was right so I want it to

1081
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:12,969
evaluate to P from and if I'm at f1

1082
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:17,289
right when thing is over I want it to be

1083
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:20,079
p2 so I know these two things about my

1084
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:22,449
equation and I just said that I know

1085
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,239
it's a parabolic arc I want it to look

1086
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:27,608
like a parabolic arc so I know that the

1087
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:30,129
structure of the equation can only be

1088
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:37,960
one thing and that's a T squared plus T

1089
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:41,230
sorry plus BT plus C right so if I know

1090
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:45,820
those things and we look at this I've

1091
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:50,108
got an equation right and I've got I've

1092
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:52,059
got two things to plug into it I and so

1093
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:57,969
the question is can I solve it and the

1094
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:59,858
answer is well if you look at the at the

1095
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:02,739
the structure of it here there's

1096
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:07,719
actually three unknowns in it right

1097
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:09,399
there's a B and C and unfortunately from

1098
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:14,799
looking at what I've got for the

1099
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:17,829
information I only got to two things I

1100
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,810
know and so I've got two equations and

1101
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:22,960
three unknowns that's not enough to

1102
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:26,380
solve this system you know what I mean I

1103
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:31,650
don't I simply don't have the ability to

1104
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:31,650
solve the system with only that however

1105
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:39,070
we already know that there's a parameter

1106
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,480
missing which is the height so obviously

1107
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:43,000
I could write another equation for the

1108
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,280
height however what I'm gonna do first

1109
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,469
is just say well let's just take a look

1110
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,619
at this and see what happens when I plug

1111
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:53,108
these things in to this equation

1112
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:56,650
separately right so if I was to say I'm

1113
00:47:53,108 --> 00:48:00,449
doing f of zero equals P from and so

1114
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:05,050
what that would mean is well okay f of 0

1115
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:07,108
into this equation means that 80 0 right

1116
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:10,230
it's gonna be a zero squared

1117
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:13,558
plus B 0 plus C and I say that that

1118
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:15,838
equals P from okay

1119
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,278
well if you look at what happens these

1120
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,639
two terms cancel which means I

1121
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:23,969
immediately know that P from is my C

1122
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,949
term so really I'm not even talking

1123
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:28,848
about that part of the equation anymore

1124
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:31,649
I just know that C equals P from and

1125
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:32,999
this is so magical because this is why

1126
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:39,119
math is always so interesting is because

1127
00:48:32,998 --> 00:48:41,068
math just works Mateen when you actually

1128
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,079
investigate it and you don't have like a

1129
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:44,849
math teacher scribbling stuff on a

1130
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,099
chalkboard annoying you when you

1131
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,259
actually go and look at it it just works

1132
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:51,930
what is that saying it's saying that

1133
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:54,389
like the basis for my jump the thing

1134
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:56,788
that doesn't change at all on the jump

1135
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:59,278
is where I start from right it's like

1136
00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:02,190
it's it's routing the equation at my

1137
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:05,159
jump off point right which is exactly

1138
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,048
what you would think it is it's telling

1139
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:08,879
you exactly what you would have

1140
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:12,679
intuitively thought and that's just so

1141
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,329
satisfying right it's very very nice

1142
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:18,179
okay so then the question is well what

1143
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:21,839
about F equals 1 what happens there

1144
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:27,108
so at F equals 1 then I have hmm

1145
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:30,509
a times 1 squared right times B times 1

1146
00:49:27,108 --> 00:49:32,518
plus my P from because I know that

1147
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:35,940
that's what that is so now I've got this

1148
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:39,778
equation right and obviously 1 squared

1149
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:43,200
in 1 we know that you know F of 1 is is

1150
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:45,239
a squared plus B plus B from we know how

1151
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:52,078
to multiply by 1 right and we're saying

1152
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:54,480
that that equals the two okay so if we

1153
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:58,079
were to you know look at what we now

1154
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,818
know essentially what we could say in

1155
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,730
terms of what we're trying to solve here

1156
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:04,679
if we start moving things to one side we

1157
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:08,248
would get another thing that looks

1158
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:10,828
incredibly intuitive right and it's this

1159
00:50:08,248 --> 00:50:14,038
if I subtract P from from both sides

1160
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:16,068
look at that term right that's the Delta

1161
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,930
that's that's where I'm trying to go

1162
00:50:16,068 --> 00:50:23,139
right that's where I'm trying to go to

1163
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:25,480
and so exactly as we would expect it at

1164
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:29,500
the point where we have finished the

1165
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:33,099
jump the some of the other terms in our

1166
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:35,469
equation had better equal the Delta that

1167
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:37,750
we had to go because if they didn't we

1168
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:40,509
wouldn't have gotten there so we also

1169
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:45,280
know that a squared plus B squared is

1170
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:49,150
going to equal our Delta right that's

1171
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,610
what we know so you can kind of see that

1172
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,440
even I just kind of wanted to show you

1173
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:56,019
that before we even talk about what our

1174
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,579
final weight you know prescription for

1175
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,929
this is going to be I just kind of

1176
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:00,880
wanted to show you how interesting it is

1177
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:03,250
that when you start looking at the math

1178
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,930
you can start to see that the math is

1179
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:08,860
actually the terms in the math are

1180
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:11,679
actually about what the what the diagram

1181
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,059
is right it's not like it's some weird

1182
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,669
set of symbols that don't mean anything

1183
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:18,730
they're actually really very strongly

1184
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:23,230
rooted in the situation that you've

1185
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:27,280
created right okay

1186
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:30,340
so what do we do with with the rest of

1187
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,610
this situation right what do we actually

1188
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:38,800
do with oh that's great I don't know why

1189
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:40,510
the squared term is still there there we

1190
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,410
go that's what I actually meant to do

1191
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:47,320
it's not supposed to be there it's the

1192
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:51,309
one that's squared and yeah can you tell

1193
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,440
I'm not a good mathematician anyway so

1194
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:56,199
we do know that a plus B has to equal

1195
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,900
the Delta right and so what we need to

1196
00:51:56,199 --> 00:52:01,509
know at this point is we need to know

1197
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:06,340
you know if we solved for a we would get

1198
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:09,700
Delta Delta minus B if we solved for B

1199
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:11,769
we would get Delta minus a so we know

1200
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:14,289
that whatever part we put into the

1201
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:17,530
squared term the other part has to

1202
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:19,539
balance it out and vice versa right but

1203
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:22,660
what we know is we have essentially two

1204
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:27,579
completely independent vectors and as

1205
00:52:22,659 --> 00:52:31,359
long as their sum is the Delta we will

1206
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:32,929
have a proper parabolic arc that will go

1207
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,108
from where we want to go to

1208
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:37,940
where we want it to end up and so what I

1209
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:41,358
wanted to underscore by working this

1210
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:44,929
through is that you if you are tuning a

1211
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:47,480
game you don't really even have to solve

1212
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:49,848
equations what you have to do sometimes

1213
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,550
is just partially solve equations and

1214
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:55,010
once you now know that you can just

1215
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:57,349
freely make two vectors who have to sum

1216
00:52:55,010 --> 00:53:02,109
to the Delta well I can even just start

1217
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:04,369
tuning whatever that ask to D right I

1218
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:05,989
know it sounds a little strange and if

1219
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:09,140
you don't if you aren't used to doing

1220
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:10,608
this it might be kind of weird but let

1221
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:12,949
me show you what I mean in actual

1222
00:53:10,608 --> 00:53:16,358
practice here is our equation right I'm

1223
00:53:12,949 --> 00:53:16,358
just gonna type it in over here

1224
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:24,380
right here's hopping okay and previously

1225
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:26,240
I was computing it via lerp right now

1226
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,430
I'm going to do it I'm just gonna put in

1227
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,649
the equation as we had it right and so

1228
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:33,588
we've essentially got a plus B plus P

1229
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:36,050
from that's what we're doing right well

1230
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:41,000
you know more like it's a T squared plus

1231
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:43,130
BT plus P from okay so the resulting

1232
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,710
position here is going to be you know a

1233
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:48,260
whatever that means we don't know yet

1234
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:50,269
right here's our T and in fact I'll I'll

1235
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:54,200
go ahead and pull that out into an

1236
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:59,318
actual T value there's the T value a T

1237
00:53:54,199 --> 00:54:04,068
squared plus B times T plus that from

1238
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:05,449
parameter okay you can see I've

1239
00:54:04,068 --> 00:54:07,909
literally just typed in the equation

1240
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:10,779
it's just the equation and so the

1241
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:14,269
question now is what's a and what's B

1242
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:17,720
okay well we know we only have to put in

1243
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:20,239
one of them right because I just showed

1244
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:22,699
over here that we know that the other

1245
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:25,578
one has to be whatever it takes to make

1246
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:27,289
it equal Delta so if I want to I can say

1247
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:29,298
let's just tune the squared parameter

1248
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:31,219
for our game play tuning we'll just tune

1249
00:54:29,298 --> 00:54:33,858
the squared parameter and we'll leave

1250
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:35,750
the other parameter dependent on it so

1251
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:39,578
we know what the Delta is right the

1252
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:39,579
Delta is the entity

1253
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:52,299
- - entity movement from we know that

1254
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:56,210
that - whatever we put in here is B

1255
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:58,640
right that completes the equation so if

1256
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:01,670
I wanted to like it start out with that

1257
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:03,650
just being nothing right if I wanted to

1258
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,840
there's nothing there and then

1259
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:09,710
everything is in this this term over

1260
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:11,720
here this B term right that could that

1261
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:13,429
would just work right or at least it

1262
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:17,209
should work oh but you know what has to

1263
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:21,250
happen I have to actually did I just I

1264
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:21,250
deleted the equation why did I do that

1265
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,440
that's good I'm like hey let's run the

1266
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:31,969
equation maybe it would help if I didn't

1267
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:34,369
delete the equation first unbelievable

1268
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:38,779
all right so there we go

1269
00:55:34,369 --> 00:55:41,599
now I actually have it so as you can see

1270
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:44,360
or at least hopefully you can see that

1271
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:47,089
if I was to make everything be in the

1272
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:50,480
linear term so I set that T squared term

1273
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:53,870
to zero what do we get we get back lerp

1274
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,090
right because if you set the squared

1275
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:59,480
part of the equation to zero so there is

1276
00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:01,940
no right a times T times T if the a is

1277
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,039
zero and the T squared goes away there

1278
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:07,849
is no parabolic part of the equation

1279
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:11,000
anymore right it's gone parabolic part

1280
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:13,639
is gone so if the parabolic part of the

1281
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,929
equation is gone then everything goes

1282
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:17,869
into the linear part and we're back to

1283
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:19,940
lerp right and hey what does that look

1284
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:21,589
like the T parameter goes from zero to

1285
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:23,000
one the B parameter is just the

1286
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:25,450
subtraction of the two in the front

1287
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,099
that's literally gonna give us lerp back

1288
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:31,429
so now all we're gonna do is we're just

1289
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:33,589
gonna tune what part of the jump do we

1290
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:35,869
want to be parabolic well hey guess what

1291
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:38,210
I probably want the height to be

1292
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:42,259
parabolic right I want it to I want it

1293
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:45,230
to do that right um unfortunately I

1294
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,660
don't even know what we're doing with

1295
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:49,969
our Z we don't we don't use Z yet do we

1296
00:56:47,659 --> 00:56:51,679
yeah we still don't use Z that's we got

1297
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:54,419
to fix that at some point here I'll

1298
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:58,618
stick it in Y for now but

1299
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,190
yeah so you can kind of see now I guess

1300
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:04,588
that's right

1301
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:07,318
it goes up the screen so now you can see

1302
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:08,960
that what I've done is I've put you know

1303
00:57:07,318 --> 00:57:14,699
a certain amount of the hopping motion

1304
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:17,068
I've placed that into right I've placed

1305
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:21,558
that into the parabolic part and so now

1306
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:26,909
I'm hopping as on a prayer on a parabola

1307
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:30,210
I guess you better not leave we better

1308
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:30,389
not leave the legal zone sorry about

1309
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,528
that

1310
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:34,288
we're not doing any collision detection

1311
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:35,818
anymore I turned it off I think so we

1312
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:37,500
can hopster I think we can stop straight

1313
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:39,298
out of well no actually how do we hop

1314
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,699
straight out how am I getting out there

1315
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:43,139
I don't really know what we're doing

1316
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:44,308
we've turned off so many things and

1317
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:46,558
there's so many things weird now about

1318
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:50,490
that I don't even know what's going on

1319
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,559
there but so now I've just put the that

1320
00:57:50,489 --> 00:57:54,868
part in which means if you think about

1321
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,359
what what actually happens the other

1322
00:57:54,869 --> 00:58:02,759
parts of the equation right the other

1323
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:05,818
parts the the of what I'm doing those

1324
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:10,759
are not parabolic so the motion between

1325
00:58:05,818 --> 00:58:15,028
the two points is still linear right and

1326
00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:20,269
it's just that that vertical part that

1327
00:58:15,028 --> 00:58:20,268
becomes parabolic so there you go

1328
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:32,950
so yeah so there's a lot more to say

1329
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:36,820
about this but I'm kind of out of time

1330
00:58:32,949 --> 00:58:42,219
if that makes sense but I guess what I

1331
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:44,620
would say about this is there's just

1332
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:46,989
remember for now until tomorrow that

1333
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:48,369
concept that if you solve everything out

1334
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:50,859
first

1335
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:52,539
and then just instead of trying to get a

1336
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,650
solution to an equation that you're that

1337
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:55,779
you're going to know that you're going

1338
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:57,400
to tune think of it as just reducing it

1339
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,200
down to a smaller set of variables and

1340
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,730
then just tuning the variables you can

1341
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,079
actually start with stuff that you don't

1342
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:03,159
even have a solution to and then just

1343
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,829
play with the values that you get the

1344
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:09,849
thing that you want right which is what

1345
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:12,299
we did here so now I will go on to the Q

1346
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:12,299
and the a

1347
00:59:36,429 --> 00:59:45,480
oh my god Zen bought banned the hmd BOTS

1348
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:58,739
are you kidding me that's hilarious

1349
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:30,780
the hopping looks so cool can we see a

1350
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:32,910
little bit more of it well I don't think

1351
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:36,090
the hopping looks really very cool yet I

1352
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:41,639
mean the heads not even attached to the

1353
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:44,340
body so it ain't great yeah I don't know

1354
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:47,309
why we're able to to select that at the

1355
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:49,140
moment either I do not know I I feel

1356
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:50,250
like our selection we probably have to

1357
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:54,769
just go look at selection code it's

1358
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,769
probably all messed up right but

1359
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:27,190
how did you slip the head from the body

1360
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:29,108
well we just they're just two separate

1361
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:31,088
entities at the moment so right now we

1362
01:01:29,108 --> 01:01:32,469
just have one entity that's the head and

1363
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:36,219
wanted to be that's the body and it

1364
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:37,689
jumps around how interesting do you

1365
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:39,338
think it would be to solve for the force

1366
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:41,679
and direction required to reach a

1367
01:01:39,338 --> 01:01:43,929
certain height on each jump is it just

1368
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:50,919
more work than it's worth for no

1369
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:54,568
tangible gain yeah I think so I guess

1370
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,889
what I would say is it's not so much

1371
01:01:54,568 --> 01:02:00,518
it's not so much that there's no

1372
01:01:56,889 --> 01:02:04,058
tangible gain in general there is a

1373
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:05,558
tangible tangible gain in general and

1374
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:09,309
that would be that if we wanted to

1375
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:11,499
integrate it into a physic system where

1376
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:13,329
we were doing a lot of physics sim then

1377
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:14,858
we would need to do that because we need

1378
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:16,298
to figure out what the forces so that

1379
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:17,828
all that whole system works you can't

1380
01:02:16,298 --> 01:02:19,659
just go moving things around willy-nilly

1381
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:21,190
in a physics system because you need

1382
01:02:19,659 --> 01:02:23,679
them to like collide and be able to like

1383
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:26,108
push back and all that stuff right so in

1384
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,728
a game where I was anticipating doing

1385
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:32,998
that sort of stuff we might want to do

1386
01:02:27,728 --> 01:02:36,129
that that work right but in this game

1387
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:38,649
it's much more logic based it's not so

1388
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:40,690
much physics based so what we'd rather

1389
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:42,460
do in here is solve those sorts of

1390
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,499
things logically if that makes sense and

1391
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:48,009
that's why I'm not trying to feed it

1392
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:49,568
through the force part of things I am

1393
01:02:48,009 --> 01:02:51,429
guessing that both the familiar and the

1394
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:53,018
enemies will need to move similar to the

1395
01:02:51,429 --> 01:02:55,028
hero is there much more you need to do

1396
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:57,159
to make this work with them yes we will

1397
01:02:55,028 --> 01:02:58,778
have to we'll have to make some path

1398
01:02:57,159 --> 01:03:00,159
finding that knows that it can only go

1399
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:01,478
through the squares and that sort of

1400
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:03,368
stuff so there's going to be there's

1401
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:07,419
gonna be some things like this that

1402
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:08,349
happen can we clean up the extra head

1403
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,309
and body on the screen or they're going

1404
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:11,769
to be used later on

1405
01:03:09,309 --> 01:03:14,099
yeah actually those are still actual

1406
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:14,098
things

1407
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:27,400
in theory like you know that one will

1408
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,630
follow you around I don't know what this

1409
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,430
one is I think it has something to do

1410
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,750
like it was something that you could I

1411
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:33,129
don't know if it was like a target or

1412
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:36,940
something I'm not sure that one will

1413
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:38,349
probably go away eventually but yeah so

1414
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,000
will these weird little plates that I

1415
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:42,420
have that I can shoot out for no

1416
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,420
apparent reason

1417
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:52,630
why doesn't the head just stay on top of

1418
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:54,460
the body is that a bug

1419
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:56,410
no that's they're different to different

1420
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:59,800
entities and so they move independently

1421
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:01,869
now and the body just follows and I want

1422
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:05,140
them to actually I I don't necessarily

1423
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:06,819
need them to be separate entities so we

1424
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:08,949
could merge them into one entity we I

1425
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:10,930
think that will depend on how are in

1426
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:12,460
these systems aches out as we sort of

1427
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:16,690
actually build one because right now we

1428
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:18,369
don't really have one as we build out

1429
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,960
the entity system we'll make a decision

1430
01:04:18,369 --> 01:04:21,519
about whether they should be one entity

1431
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,710
a combined entity or whether they should

1432
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:26,769
be separate in these I suspect they

1433
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:28,389
should be separate entities but right

1434
01:04:26,769 --> 01:04:30,099
now they're separate entities and I want

1435
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:32,889
them to remain sort of separate like

1436
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:36,130
that and all I'm really gonna do is I'm

1437
01:04:32,889 --> 01:04:38,199
gonna make the body like track to where

1438
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:41,260
the head is so that it stretches between

1439
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:44,639
them but but they're gonna stay kind of

1440
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,640
independently controlled like that

1441
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:54,268
borrowed mode when writing in a

1442
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:56,430
procedural I'm a swing language I

1443
01:04:54,268 --> 01:04:58,528
sometimes end up with deeply nested code

1444
01:04:56,429 --> 01:05:03,719
should this be avoided and are there

1445
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:05,759
good ways to minimize this I mean the

1446
01:05:03,719 --> 01:05:08,578
only real problem with nested code is

1447
01:05:05,759 --> 01:05:10,228
that the is that editors don't handle it

1448
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:13,440
right you know they don't do a good job

1449
01:05:10,228 --> 01:05:16,259
letting you work with it as easily so

1450
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,749
that's kind of a little annoying but

1451
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:20,728
otherwise it's fine however if you do

1452
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:22,679
find that it's problematic for you yeah

1453
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:24,239
I mean if you want to miss I just take a

1454
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:29,929
chunk and move it out to a function you

1455
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:29,929
know it's not it's not a big deal right

1456
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,358
in Janeiro this is starting to look a

1457
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:42,340
lot like crypt of the necrodancer the

1458
01:05:40,358 --> 01:05:44,529
design isn't really anything like crypt

1459
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:47,680
of the necrodancer although I haven't

1460
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:49,570
played I I only like briefly played

1461
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:54,819
crypt of the necrodancer so I don't know

1462
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:58,230
that much about it but it's as far as I

1463
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:58,230
know really not at all related

1464
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:07,539
trap master missed a lot are you making

1465
01:06:05,739 --> 01:06:10,239
an engine for this game or is that stuff

1466
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:13,570
just there for purely for you us right

1467
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:18,189
now yeah we did we made all this engine

1468
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:19,900
from scratch on the stream including the

1469
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,130
renderer you can even render in software

1470
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:26,230
which is pretty cool

1471
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:28,440
I forget where that is it's in here

1472
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,440
somewhere

1473
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:35,380
yeah we it's we're not we're compiled in

1474
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,690
debug mode right now and of course for

1475
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:40,599
some reason we aren't clearing do we not

1476
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:44,829
clear in software or do we not clear at

1477
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:50,409
all does anyone know like what the deal

1478
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:52,329
is with that hand made so I noticed that

1479
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:54,849
before is that we don't clear instant

1480
01:06:52,329 --> 01:06:59,889
software I assume that in that that's

1481
01:06:54,849 --> 01:07:01,900
actually somewhat that's actually okay

1482
01:06:59,889 --> 01:07:08,349
because there shouldn't be any empty

1483
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:10,420
space anyway but I do wonder whether we

1484
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:12,699
thought we were clearing or not

1485
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:21,070
so in render dot cpp i'm i'm actually

1486
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:23,379
wondering clear so like this is the

1487
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:27,400
clear ah but it doesn't necessarily sort

1488
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:31,329
to the back is the thing so that might

1489
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,550
be that might be a problem the clear

1490
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:36,819
like I don't know oh but you know it

1491
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:42,010
should so I don't know why I don't know

1492
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:45,010
why that's why that's not working but

1493
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:48,480
it's but it's not let's let's let's take

1494
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:50,910
a quick look I'm just curious

1495
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:58,349
Brenda Krantz a bitmap render commands

1496
01:07:50,909 --> 01:08:05,808
to bitmap so intersect base clip writes

1497
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:10,890
with clip rect see what we got

1498
01:08:05,809 --> 01:08:12,480
can we please step into wait that's not

1499
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:18,960
where am i there it's not what I'm gonna

1500
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:21,630
be here there we go I don't want to

1501
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:27,838
watch every thread just want to watch

1502
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:34,650
one thread is that so wrong a visual

1503
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:36,298
studio fine you don't want to show me

1504
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:37,888
more thread I mean you want to show me

1505
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:39,569
all your threads I will kill those

1506
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:50,779
threads and then what are you gonna do

1507
01:08:39,569 --> 01:08:50,779
about it not much not much my friend

1508
01:08:55,170 --> 01:09:00,520
actually that'll probably still create

1509
01:08:57,009 --> 01:09:01,298
one extra thread wallet that's

1510
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,859
unfortunate

1511
01:09:01,298 --> 01:09:04,859
maybe I should have set that to zero

1512
01:09:07,828 --> 01:09:22,710
yeah so what I really should have done

1513
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:22,709
is this that work

1514
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:33,460
there we go so now why don't we clear on

1515
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:39,100
our screen here's the clear call we come

1516
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:46,180
in here doing some stuff we get our fill

1517
01:09:39,100 --> 01:10:01,210
wrecked out 480 by 720 that's certainly

1518
01:09:46,180 --> 01:10:08,800
a screen what's our color value where's

1519
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:15,460
the Alpha value what the what colors of

1520
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:20,800
e4 right so why is it only have there it

1521
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:23,619
is the Alpha value is zero well who put

1522
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,960
in a clear color of zero so is this just

1523
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:29,260
is this operator error did we put in the

1524
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,859
wrong clear color cuz that's that ain't

1525
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:34,420
no good that ain't no good at all I

1526
01:10:31,859 --> 01:10:37,659
would like to just point out to you how

1527
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:42,190
not good that is is there a clear look

1528
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:44,349
at that look at this so I guess that's

1529
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:47,349
technically okay because if you're doing

1530
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:49,210
it clear then the alpha value has you're

1531
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:51,310
trying to set the destination alpha

1532
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:53,260
value to be something so now that I

1533
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:55,870
think about that's actually right so

1534
01:10:53,260 --> 01:11:00,010
probably the way that we need to do this

1535
01:10:55,869 --> 01:11:08,890
is this should really set for set that

1536
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:11,020
color you know like this for now it's

1537
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:14,039
and that's not perfect but that's that's

1538
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,040
really the problem right

1539
01:11:19,868 --> 01:11:26,488
oops so now we should be okay yeah there

1540
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:26,488
we go

1541
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:32,889
so yeah and then of course you know if I

1542
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:34,598
actually did want to see how fast let's

1543
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:36,510
you know while we're here let's see how

1544
01:11:34,599 --> 01:11:45,010
fast it is let's just take a look

1545
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:47,110
alright so here's the hardware render

1546
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:51,360
that's running through OpenGL and here

1547
01:11:47,109 --> 01:11:55,809
is the software renderer so quite good

1548
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:58,299
right and I think if I remember

1549
01:11:55,810 --> 01:12:01,389
correctly in our profile a lot of that

1550
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:08,800
time is waiting for Windows to get off

1551
01:12:01,389 --> 01:12:11,230
its but yeah most of that time is we

1552
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,760
would actually be hitting 60 frames a

1553
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:15,519
second in the Safa render right now if

1554
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,969
Windows wasn't sitting around doing

1555
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,260
nothing

1556
01:12:15,969 --> 01:12:19,630
although you know part of that's

1557
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:21,520
probably we probably need to just use a

1558
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:23,920
P buffer to transfer the screen so we

1559
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,750
could probably fix our OpenGL submission

1560
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,199
the way that we're actually downloading

1561
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:34,149
the software rendered bitmap to it we

1562
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:37,019
can probably fix that so so that's I

1563
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:37,019
mean it's kind of our fault

1564
01:12:42,929 --> 01:12:46,219
let's see

1565
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:04,560
when CX is defined will up-down hopping

1566
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:07,139
look different I don't know how I mean

1567
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,820
it shouldn't probably look all that

1568
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,050
different but we we do need we need to

1569
01:13:08,819 --> 01:13:11,670
straighten out our Z it's it's always

1570
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:12,600
been a little wrong and now we kind of

1571
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:14,279
know what it should be

1572
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:19,130
we're gonna have to go in and fuss with

1573
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:21,119
that a little Lu minion what our

1574
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:25,409
limitations of game develop using C

1575
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:27,269
sharp I mean there's tons of them right

1576
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:29,159
it's a garbage collected language it's

1577
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:31,560
runs through an interpreter I mean it's

1578
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:33,750
like you know so you have to you don't

1579
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:35,190
really know what the it's got to be just

1580
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:38,100
in time compiled if it's gonna be

1581
01:13:35,189 --> 01:13:40,529
optimized like it's it's a pretty

1582
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:42,180
high-level language so there's

1583
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:43,409
limitations everywhere the limitation is

1584
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,000
you can never actually control what the

1585
01:13:43,409 --> 01:13:48,630
CPU is actually doing there's a huge

1586
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,210
stack of stuff in between you and it and

1587
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:53,970
so do I like it as overall language no I

1588
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:58,470
hate languages that that put a lot of

1589
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:59,880
stuff between me and the computer that's

1590
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:01,500
been booed what parts of CMOS are you're

1591
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,720
using if you are not programming an OOP

1592
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:05,729
style we we use function overloading

1593
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:07,260
operator overloading and sometimes

1594
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:12,319
constructor destructor pairs for like

1595
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:12,320
block scoping I think that's mostly it

1596
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:21,538
Clemens Val I'm currently using a

1597
01:14:20,099 --> 01:14:23,519
Microsoft natural working him up you're

1598
01:14:21,538 --> 01:14:25,050
gonna like 4000 thinking about replacing

1599
01:14:23,519 --> 01:14:28,170
it with an honor gonna check keyboard

1600
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:30,150
any thoughts I always have trouble with

1601
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:31,559
those those Berger no metric keyboards

1602
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:34,379
the Microsoft natural one especially the

1603
01:14:31,559 --> 01:14:37,529
spacebar drives me insane it's so hard

1604
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:39,510
to push so I prefer the non-organic

1605
01:14:37,529 --> 01:14:41,759
mechanical ones which is not to say that

1606
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:45,360
I wouldn't prefer it ergonomic whenif

1607
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:47,280
was actually made by a sane human but I

1608
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,889
swear the people who designed natural or

1609
01:14:47,279 --> 01:15:00,078
gonna occur keyboards don't type much at

1610
01:14:49,889 --> 01:15:00,078
least not from my experience let's see

1611
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:08,578
in Janeiro how many aids will this game

1612
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:12,658
have when it's done do you mean like

1613
01:15:08,578 --> 01:15:14,248
triple-a I don't know huber Caleb the

1614
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:16,138
trees in the bottom row look like they

1615
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:18,210
are being clipped at the top also

1616
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:22,199
c-sharp has compiled these days to some

1617
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:24,569
extent well I mean it's always jetted or

1618
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:29,248
can be jetted depending on the

1619
01:15:24,569 --> 01:15:33,029
circumstance but it is not compiled in

1620
01:15:29,248 --> 01:15:34,590
that in well it is not technically ever

1621
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,779
if you compiled to bytecode is still

1622
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:45,029
compiled it does not produce machine

1623
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:47,639
code right that is it does not produce

1624
01:15:45,029 --> 01:15:49,819
machine code you can control and the

1625
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:52,529
reason I say that is because you know

1626
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:54,359
there's a garbage collector you didn't

1627
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:55,920
write it you have no idea when it's even

1628
01:15:54,359 --> 01:16:01,589
running or how it's being built into

1629
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:03,599
your game you have no idea how the how

1630
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:07,139
most of that stuff actually is it's got

1631
01:16:03,599 --> 01:16:09,538
an entire like sort of layer there how

1632
01:16:07,139 --> 01:16:11,248
the dynamic code stuff is is done you

1633
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:13,349
have no idea you didn't write any of

1634
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:15,118
that so it's it's whatever they did you

1635
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:16,710
know and not only is it whatever they

1636
01:16:15,118 --> 01:16:19,828
did it can also be whatever that

1637
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:22,019
particular implementation of c-sharp is

1638
01:16:19,828 --> 01:16:25,018
because it's not you know like it's

1639
01:16:22,019 --> 01:16:26,280
always gonna be the same even is that a

1640
01:16:25,019 --> 01:16:28,530
real clicking keyboard as it just sound

1641
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:30,859
effects yet this is an old dos keyboard

1642
01:16:28,529 --> 01:16:30,859
3

1643
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:36,719
as for the trees being clipped off the

1644
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:41,429
top

1645
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:44,899
I thought we looked at that and I can't

1646
01:16:41,429 --> 01:16:49,649
remember I think it's just because we we

1647
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:51,689
we require one aprons worth of pixels

1648
01:16:49,649 --> 01:16:53,250
remember we these are assets aren't

1649
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:55,139
built with the way that we ended up

1650
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:57,300
design do the render they were just some

1651
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:01,110
stand and stuff that we used so I

1652
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:04,560
believe that that's part of it although

1653
01:17:01,109 --> 01:17:16,609
to be honest it may be also just part of

1654
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:16,610
the art asset and in here

1655
01:17:28,409 --> 01:17:32,779
and interval I have not seen Swift

1656
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:52,300
a cruel dragon how come I have to

1657
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:57,130
declare a political party in order to

1658
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:59,560
vote in the presidential primary so the

1659
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:01,150
reason that you have to I happen to know

1660
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,600
that Colonel dragon is in Washington

1661
01:18:01,149 --> 01:18:03,039
State

1662
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,210
so I can answer that question otherwise

1663
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:10,000
I wouldn't necessarily be able to have

1664
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:12,659
to ask where he lived the reason that

1665
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,770
you have to clear a political party to

1666
01:18:12,659 --> 01:18:17,649
vote in a presidential primary is

1667
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:20,410
because I believe the Washington State

1668
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:22,179
Supreme Court I believe it was the

1669
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:25,359
Washington State Supreme Court I don't

1670
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:26,740
know if it was federal court hold on one

1671
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:28,569
second let me answer this question yes

1672
01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:29,590
you can see so the reason it looks like

1673
01:18:28,569 --> 01:18:31,659
they're clipped is because it actually

1674
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:34,840
does end like that and this part right

1675
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:37,389
here is actually in the one pixel apron

1676
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:39,850
which we don't render so remember all

1677
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:41,710
art assets in the actual final game have

1678
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:44,470
to be packed with that one pixel apron

1679
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:46,270
and these are assets aren't packed so if

1680
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:49,180
we actually added the one pixel apron

1681
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:52,120
we'd be fine so hopefully that answers

1682
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:53,170
question so originally in Washington

1683
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:54,519
State you did not have to clear a

1684
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:55,569
political party to vote in the primary

1685
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,000
you could simply vote in whatever

1686
01:18:55,569 --> 01:19:02,739
primary you wanted to unfortunately that

1687
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,119
was ruled against by the court I don't

1688
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:06,609
remember the name of the case and sorry

1689
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:09,489
it's been a while and so after that

1690
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:14,079
court ruling they needed to they were

1691
01:19:09,489 --> 01:19:15,939
required to revise their primary system

1692
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:17,380
in Washington state and now you have to

1693
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:23,669
declare a political party in order to

1694
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:23,670
participate in that primary but you know

1695
01:19:25,939 --> 01:19:32,339
the Y in the grander sense then it was a

1696
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:34,200
court case I you know I mean I don't

1697
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:37,560
know the cosmic why but that's the

1698
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:41,069
procedural why if that makes sense

1699
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:43,680
and and if you want to look at the

1700
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:47,009
specifics of that court case you could

1701
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:49,890
find out for example what what the exact

1702
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:53,100
ruling was in terms of why the old

1703
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:55,650
system was not allowed to continue and

1704
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:58,530
get a little bit more insight into it I

1705
01:19:55,649 --> 01:20:00,689
I usually only pay attention to federal

1706
01:19:58,529 --> 01:20:03,059
Supreme Court cases state Supreme

1707
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:04,439
Court's cases if this even was one of

1708
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,580
those I don't even know if this case

1709
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:08,549
went to the Supreme Court it probably

1710
01:20:05,579 --> 01:20:13,439
did I I suspect it was a state Supreme

1711
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:16,770
Court case because primaries are would

1712
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:19,409
generally not be federal it would not be

1713
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:22,230
a federal thing so I'm assuming that

1714
01:20:19,409 --> 01:20:23,579
that that case opinion would give you

1715
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:27,259
the information you wanted and I don't

1716
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:27,260
read those opinions so I don't know oh

1717
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:34,079
and yeah this this this thing right here

1718
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:36,510
is blinking I agree with that

1719
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:38,250
I assume that's because this and this

1720
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:41,480
are like coincident and so they sort

1721
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,479
randomly in but I'm not sure

1722
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:24,309
all right I'm gonna wind down I'm gonna

1723
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:24,310
wind it on down and yeah

1724
01:21:32,729 --> 01:21:40,469
save that off thank you everyone for

1725
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,880
joining me for today's episode of

1726
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:44,489
handmade hair it's been a pleasure

1727
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,810
coding with you as always if you would

1728
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:47,099
like to follow along at home with the

1729
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:50,310
source code you can always go to

1730
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:51,930
handmade hair org and pre-order it the

1731
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:54,090
game rather and it comes with the source

1732
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:55,400
code so that as we develop the game you

1733
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:57,539
can play around that at home and

1734
01:21:55,399 --> 01:22:00,389
practice the sort of stuff that we cover

1735
01:21:57,539 --> 01:22:02,069
on the stream we also have a forum site

1736
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:03,930
which has now been upgraded thanks to

1737
01:22:02,069 --> 01:22:06,299
the folks at handmade Network so if you

1738
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:07,560
go to that site and this link they

1739
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,300
switch the link around on me so I'm

1740
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,860
going to go change it now so it'll point

1741
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:13,409
to the right place as I talked about

1742
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:14,849
earlier in the stream you can now go

1743
01:22:13,409 --> 01:22:17,220
there and the forums are a lot more

1744
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:18,360
pleasant to use we also have a patreon

1745
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,949
page if you want to support the video

1746
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:21,539
series a schedule bot who tweets the

1747
01:22:19,949 --> 01:22:24,960
schedule at you if you wanted to catch

1748
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:29,130
the series live and we have a episode

1749
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:32,970
guide which is maintained by our very

1750
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:35,190
own mid blow on the chat go there you

1751
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,810
can also and catch up on past episodes

1752
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:38,609
it's got great annotations and while

1753
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:41,880
you're there consider subscribing to his

1754
01:22:38,609 --> 01:22:43,829
patreon because he annotates those those

1755
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,480
episodes for the benefit of everyone

1756
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:49,890
just out of the goodness of his heart

1757
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:53,339
and so that is it for today tomorrow

1758
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:56,520
we'll be working on making that hop look

1759
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:59,610
a little bit more nicely animated and

1760
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,170
adding some more goodness to it and sort

1761
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:03,449
of attaching that head on there so we're

1762
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:05,550
just kind of building it up in parts the

1763
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:07,590
quality of that and as the quality

1764
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:09,989
improves the feel will get nicer and

1765
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:11,670
nicer so that's it I hope to see you

1766
01:23:09,988 --> 01:23:14,129
back here tomorrow 5 p.m. Pacific

1767
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:15,630
Daylight Time until then have fun

1768
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:16,170
programming and I'll see you guys on the

1769
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:18,210
Internet

1770
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:20,880
I'm gonna go to the chat and figure out

1771
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:24,149
why the Samba which I was supposed to

1772
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:26,279
use for twitch has kicked all of our

1773
01:23:24,149 --> 01:23:28,679
better BOTS off so I'm gonna go make it

1774
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:30,210
so it doesn't do that anymore those of

1775
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,980
you who happen to know how that's

1776
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:34,770
working please stay on the chat for a

1777
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:37,279
minute and I will come ask you okay take

1778
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,280
it easy everyone
