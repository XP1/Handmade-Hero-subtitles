00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,799
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,679
hero show where we code complete game

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,599
live on stream uh there is not much to

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,480
say today

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,839
uh we made a thing for ourselves uh last

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
two

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,198
weekends i guess not last weekend

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
because last weekend was a very special

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,920
episode

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:28,320
starring john blow um this week

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
is not starring anybody

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,679
but if you remember correctly we added a

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
little drawing thing and our drawing

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,640
thing uh tells us a bunch of information

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,520
about the collision stuff which honestly

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
sort of

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,079
kind of works pretty good um we have not

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,359
really had any problems with things

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,160
getting stuck

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:48,079
uh and so our goal of of the collision

21
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,199
system not producing sort of bad

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,039
outcomes

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
uh seems to have worked pretty well

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
although obviously we haven't stress

25
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,479
tested it much

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
however uh we we did want to do some

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,279
stuff so like for example this sort of

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
thing where you know when something hits

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,879
another

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,599
piece of geometry um it doesn't get

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,840
stuck like i can still move it just fine

32
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,719
but it doesn't really have like roll you

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
know what i mean so things can still uh

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,158
i mean well that doesn't really do it

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,880
but you know like uh like i just did

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
that where something is trying to move

37
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,359
straight

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
um

39
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,438
and so the target of the thing that it's

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,359
moving towards is straight ahead

41
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,758
but there's something in its way

42
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,759
uh we don't really have a good answer

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,478
right now for how to make sure that like

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,438
that they smoothly kind of roll around

45
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:39,039
which is what we would like

46
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,959
um and what you can see here is we

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,200
started drawing some things like these

48
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,839
here are vectors uh sphere collision

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
vectors from the place where the sphere

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
the thing the sphere is colliding with

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,799
uh and the center of the sphere so you

52
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,599
can see it was testing sphere positions

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759
um

54
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,280
in in a couple different places where

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,840
you know it felt like it could go and

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,640
you can see it testing them here

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,399
and

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,560
you know i

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,959
i do wonder a little bit based on

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
looking at it it actually looks fairly

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,360
uh clean

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
so

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,280
i'm not really sure we could add some

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,800
more drawing since we have drawing now

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,239
but you know

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,760
the drawing sort of suggests to me

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,159
almost that maybe the code is actually

68
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,878
just correct and there isn't much need

69
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,359
to

70
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,359
fix it

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
and so my

72
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,280
my thinking is

73
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,839
what we may actually want to do

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,120
to fix this particular problem

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
it may have nothing to do with the

76
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,800
collision detector it may simply be that

77
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,000
we don't search far enough around

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
right

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,080
so when we look here we only search the

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,680
voxels immediately neighboring to the

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,920
voxel that we want that we were picking

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
and you can see that because the voxels

83
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,639
themselves are kind of aligned with the

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,919
geometry fairly well

85
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,598
which is

86
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,318
you know maybe not a good idea like

87
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,238
maybe we should stagger those but no

88
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,318
matter what we do

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
you can always imagine

90
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:14,079
a piece of geometry getting aligned

91
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,238
fairly closely to the voxels because the

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
geometry moves around and we don't have

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,080
any real restrictions in this game about

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,479
where geometry could be

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,879
you know we have a grid that we put in

96
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,798
areas for gameplay reasons but that grid

97
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,318
doesn't have to be there right like we

98
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,400
could easily make a level where things

99
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,759
were smoothly moving around and maybe

100
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
we'll want to do that someday and our

101
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,280
engine does support it so we really

102
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,158
don't want to

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,239
force

104
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,639
uh any sort of like we don't want to

105
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,120
solve problems just by

106
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,119
using alignment

107
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,840
so when you look

108
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,919
at what's happening here i'm wondering

109
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
if our main problem is just that we need

110
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,759
to search

111
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,399
a little bit further so we need to go

112
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,079
like if if we don't find

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,719
uh a way to

114
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,599
accept a movement in the local space we

115
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,120
need to try at least one more

116
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,959
uh

117
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,639
square than we were trying you know what

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,879
i'm saying

119
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,359
uh so i wonder if that's the main

120
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,000
problem that we're having is we don't

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,120
really have any way to fix that

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
problem

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
um and i i really like i said i don't

124
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,439
know so i'm not suggesting that this is

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,680
the actual solution i'm just saying i

126
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,959
wonder if we fundamentally can't solve

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
the problem

128
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,279
uh the way it exists at the moment and

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
if we

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,079
okay

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,879
why did that not work i never know why

132
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,719
this doesn't work

133
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,680
we never really got

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,759
um

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,840
the four coder flurry thing sort of

136
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
really working um

137
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,159
at some point i'm gonna have to do more

138
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,679
of that but like we have a build thing

139
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
here but it doesn't seem to actually

140
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,759
build

141
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,519
i think because

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
i don't remember why

143
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,799
but like it doesn't seem to actually

144
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,439
work like you do this and then you say

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
like builds and like it just doesn't

146
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,600
build but i don't know why

147
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,039
because i mean there is a build.bat

148
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,439
right in that directory

149
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,439
it's right there

150
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,399
if i do it from the code directory it

151
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
works so if i'm in that directory

152
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,000
and that did load the project file i

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,120
have no idea is there a project file in

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,120
here

155
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,240
no i don't know oops that's a dir yeah

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,879
i don't know

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,759
hey it sort of works i guess that's good

158
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:50,839
so anyway uh if we take a look um

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,960
at the code for that which is in move

160
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,679
entity the thing that i'm basically

161
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,918
talking about is what we test so you can

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,800
see our vox alliterator

163
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:02,959
uh thing here which basically goes and

164
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,960
says let's try

165
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,959
um

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,639
these voxel locations

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,639
and

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,160
you can see it taking steps you can so

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
yeah

170
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,038
like

171
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,038
my thinking is just that

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,919
that if we change a little bit about how

173
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,478
we test these voxels that might be

174
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,478
sufficient

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
like you can see how this works right so

176
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,359
we do a foreign loop

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
you know

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,319
um and we go through here and we say

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,120
each time in the loop we're going to

180
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,400
test nearby voxels to see what happens

181
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
to them

182
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,000
um and then we're gonna select the best

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,240
move of the options that we have

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,439
uh and my assumption is just that like

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
yeah if we just change a little bit how

186
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,160
that

187
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,000
is lined up

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,479
uh that's really all we need so you can

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
see like the min corner here right we

190
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,240
start with one of those

191
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,079
um and we just move

192
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,079
through the mid corner like like so

193
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,560
and so

194
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
it would seem that if we broaden that a

195
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,639
little bit that might be all we would

196
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,478
need so this also like this seems cited

197
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,960
uh

198
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,959
as well like if you think about it

199
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,959
um

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,759
yeah like like it's literally just

201
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,038
testing just that one voxel

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
and

203
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:43,680
when it tests it like it can only move

204
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:46,560
like it won't try to move

205
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,519
anywhere where a side isn't open

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,918
right

207
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,918
um

208
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,800
let me

209
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,000
so one of the problems is this drawing

210
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
kind of

211
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
kind of

212
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:03,918
uh doesn't it doesn't really help right

213
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,639
um because i can't see

214
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,560
even though like we assume we know

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,800
because we would be like well okay like

216
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,120
this side is probably open right

217
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
um

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,560
yeah so okay so let me let me

219
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,560
let me say it this way

220
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,159
i do think it's correct to only check

221
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,800
voxels whose exit criteria is what we

222
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,038
think it should be right so we shouldn't

223
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,158
be checking voxels like

224
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:42,158
where like we're in an outside voxel and

225
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:44,080
then we like go into an inside voxel

226
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,319
like we should not be doing that check

227
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
right

228
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,599
but

229
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,120
the problem that we're gonna have here

230
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,159
as you can see

231
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,560
is we do a

232
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:00,559
a check

233
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:02,159
and we only accept the voxels

234
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,838
that are

235
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:08,480
that contain the new closest point

236
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,880
and so each time through

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,519
uh our system

238
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,080
when we hit a voxel

239
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,879
that is closer

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,080
which can contain a point

241
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,439
closer to the target than the vauxhall

242
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
in

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,519
we always take that move

244
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,159
but if that move actually won't end up

245
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,959
producing the closest point

246
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,958
to the target out of the voxels nearby

247
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,799
because you had to go through another

248
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,958
voxel first

249
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,199
we'll never find it

250
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,199
right

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,480
so that's mostly the problem

252
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,480
i want to say

253
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,480
um

254
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,800
i don't have really any other

255
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,559
ideas about what's going on there

256
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,439
um

257
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,119
we probably should draw lines between

258
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
these

259
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,839
so like in this thing where we do

260
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,078
um

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,560
these diagrams here right

262
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,000
so that that's what's drawing like

263
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,119
this stuff it would be nice if we could

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,720
see

265
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,519
um

266
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
which order these got done in

267
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,120
right

268
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,278
uh or like you know like it started in

269
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,879
one and it moved to another right um and

270
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,879
we can't really see that at the

271
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,639
immediate moment we just get

272
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,958
color uh

273
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,199
we get color-coded boxes but they don't

274
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,078
really tell us very much information

275
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,000
right

276
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,838
um i'd have to go look up what those

277
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
colors even mean but i believe the

278
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
yellows are ones that had

279
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,160
some in some out

280
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,880
uh and so we probably went from like

281
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,879
here to here looking for places or

282
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,039
something like that uh and we didn't

283
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:04,480
find one so like when it came to here it

284
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:06,319
was like there isn't anything closer

285
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,079
or you know something like that so i

286
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
again i'm not really sure which is why i

287
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,599
think we need to draw more stuff

288
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,120
i believe red boxes are ones that uh

289
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,759
that we can't

290
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,078
go into um but i don't know so let's

291
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,240
take a look

292
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,919
and just see what that drawing

293
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
um actually does so

294
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:28,879
[Music]

295
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,160
that would be where

296
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,480
here no that's refined voxel placement

297
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,480
um

298
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,399
so i assume it's this

299
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
and i assume it's these

300
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,278
so

301
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,600
it starts off green

302
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,000
if it's not occupied

303
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,040
it turns yellow

304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,039
um

305
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,838
i'm sorry it starts off red

306
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,519
so that's occupied if it's not occupied

307
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,320
it turns yellow

308
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,039
and if it ends up being one

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,000
that it actually accepts

310
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,399
as a move it turns green

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,839
so i guess that does tell us mostly what

312
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,679
we need to know from this because it's

313
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,720
such a simple set of boxes there are so

314
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,599
few

315
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,440
um like looking at it it is basically

316
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
what i said assuming there aren't any

317
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,440
bugs here

318
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,079
with producing those

319
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,800
ideas it looks like what happened is we

320
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:28,239
started in the interior cell so we

321
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,879
started like in here right

322
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,159
we tested this cell this cell and this

323
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,519
cell

324
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,679
uh and what we found was that this one

325
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
and this one both

326
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,479
could have contained

327
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
the point

328
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,159
meaning there were

329
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,600
points on these voxels that were

330
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,480
non-colliding so it is legal to place

331
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,839
the glove in these two squares but

332
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,480
there was like neither of them contained

333
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,079
a point that was closer to the target

334
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
point which is this

335
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,919
uh wobbly little fellow out here right

336
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,839
that's just randomly

337
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,000
frame rate dependently

338
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,360
and quite buggily actually but doesn't

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,879
matter because that's just that

340
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
controller code can be as buggy as it

341
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,919
wants

342
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,278
at the moment

343
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,120
the collision detection should not it

344
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,039
should not matter right and that's a

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,360
very important thing we don't

346
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,120
we don't want the collision code to fail

347
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,399
when something is buggy we just want it

348
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,320
to work

349
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,519
no matter how bad how sloppy the

350
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,079
gameplay code whatever throws in there

351
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,039
if it's wobbly or stupid or

352
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,039
shouldn't

353
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,958
be where it is or whatever anything else

354
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,559
that should still work

355
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,638
um to the best of its ability that's

356
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,439
what we want

357
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,759
and so you can see what happens here we

358
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
would probably like to put it in this

359
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,278
cell

360
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,120
right this diagonal cell

361
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,838
that would be right here

362
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,879
that's where we would like to put the

363
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,000
uh

364
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,759
the glove

365
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,360
but we never test that cell and the

366
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,879
reason we never test that cell is at the

367
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,879
moment

368
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,480
um i don't know that we are uh

369
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,039
ever trying

370
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,360
and so it may be the case that we just

371
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,039
need to update these to handle diagonal

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,000
motion and maybe that's enough so

373
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,919
diagonal across an edge right

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,919
um and i want to say that like that was

375
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,360
a question somebody asked like why don't

376
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,639
you do that yet

377
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
and i just said because we haven't

378
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
gotten there right

379
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,120
so it's not like we said we shouldn't do

380
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
that we just didn't

381
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,000
um

382
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,759
it looks like in this particular case

383
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
that would solve the problem whether

384
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,559
that means that that's a complete

385
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,198
solution this problem i'm not really

386
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,399
sure right oh in fact here you go

387
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,078
um

388
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,679
here's the a comment right that we

389
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,039
actually put in there

390
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,319
um and i think that was based on a

391
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,399
question somebody asked and the answer

392
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,399
is i don't have a reason for not doing

393
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,919
it i also don't have a reason for doing

394
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,120
it it's literally just because i haven't

395
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,039
thought it through yet and

396
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,278
i don't think there's any reason why you

397
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,599
couldn't allow that

398
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,838
um

399
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
the problem that i the only problem that

400
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,000
i see

401
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
is that i don't know if this is a

402
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,519
sufficient solution right like it may be

403
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,278
that the better solution is to look two

404
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,240
cells away always

405
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,000
right which would which would include

406
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,240
those cells that would be captured by

407
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,078
this diagonal motion but it would also

408
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,639
include other cells that are further

409
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,359
away and be more permissive

410
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,519
in the motion of the object

411
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,600
as far as getting around obstacles

412
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,198
so that's really the thing i'm not

413
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,199
entirely sure about

414
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,198
um

415
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,159
and so i really don't know i will start

416
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
by just trying that and seeing because i

417
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,000
guess we don't want our collision

418
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
detection to search harder than it needs

419
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,839
to

420
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
so

421
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,480
i because i can't really

422
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,079
come up with any real mental rubric for

423
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
deciding this

424
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,879
theoretically

425
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,240
i guess i'd just say we solve it

426
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,639
practically and go

427
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,639
let's try putting those two cases in

428
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,680
because only two right it's motion

429
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,159
through the corner

430
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,758
and motion through this to the through

431
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,278
the edge

432
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,879
um

433
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,559
although actually

434
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,879
motion through the corner

435
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,679
i guess is

436
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,679
handled here

437
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,679
maybe

438
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,399
because this is the corner

439
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,399
um

440
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,838
let's take a look

441
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,399
so motion

442
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,720
hmm

443
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,280
i'm a little confused because it seems

444
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,640
like motion through the corner actually

445
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,639
should be handled

446
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,640
i wonder do we not set this so what what

447
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,839
are those like dur inside things set to

448
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
because i don't remember what we set

449
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,519
them to

450
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,519
um

451
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,079
so you know like direction is definitely

452
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,079
set to go through the corner

453
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,679
whichever corner you're gonna move

454
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,039
through

455
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,240
right

456
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,400
um

457
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,759
and same here so like if it's less than

458
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
zero

459
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,319
then it stays on the

460
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,840
side otherwise it's one so if if the yet

461
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,839
all positives so i guess

462
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,279
so i guess what i would say is

463
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:20,600
actually this doesn't quite seem right

464
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,599
does it

465
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:34,038
you know a lot of this a lot of this

466
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,038
seems a little wrong

467
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,839
um

468
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,639
no i guess okay i can be comfortable

469
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,839
with that so yeah like this will check

470
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,759
the corner

471
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,759
right it will check whatever corner you

472
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,798
were going to leave through

473
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,558
won't it

474
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,200
and so what i'm a little confused about

475
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,839
is why we don't see a corner

476
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,798
test being drawn

477
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,678
um

478
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,119
looking up here so when we begin this

479
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
diagram

480
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,678
right and we start drawing

481
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,519
you can see here that we've got we set a

482
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,200
color to black

483
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:19,918
and we claim that we draw a best cell

484
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,200
and then we set a color to white

485
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,960
and we claim that we draw a

486
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,080
like smaller

487
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,400
like a smaller box right

488
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,678
at this position

489
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,919
and

490
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,320
it sure doesn't seem like that's getting

491
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,440
drawn which makes me wonder like is it

492
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,918
because this filtering system is buggy

493
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,440
like i mean we only just made it last

494
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,360
time we coded

495
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
is there a bug in it because why am i

496
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,279
not seeing any of this like where's the

497
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,558
black box

498
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,279
that says

499
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,240
where the best cell was

500
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,160
right

501
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,798
um at the start if that's the initial

502
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,120
position right and so if i look at this

503
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,639
you know it's like i don't know i'm not

504
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,000
seeing that

505
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,440
right i definitely don't see that

506
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,400
that white square there

507
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,400
looks like it might be

508
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,840
so the white square

509
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,158
is where we're starting out you know

510
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,558
and it

511
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,880
does look that does look correct

512
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,038
although it's got a little like cyan

513
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,679
plus in it which makes me wonder like

514
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,558
that probably isn't this code though

515
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,559
right

516
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,879
like it so i mean here's an easy way to

517
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:38,879
test

518
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,960
right

519
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,279
no that was it

520
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,798
so so i don't know like like it looks

521
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:03,359
like for some reason that the black box

522
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,319
best cell just doesn't draw

523
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,319
right

524
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:09,200
it's just not there

525
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,720
um because the white box is drawing

526
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,558
so is best cell like a garbage value or

527
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,558
something

528
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,558
i

529
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
like what's going on there do we have a

530
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
bug in our color routines where they

531
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,679
don't

532
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,000
zero zero zero color doesn't properly

533
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,120
extend

534
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,880
the alpha value or something like

535
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,798
what is happening

536
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,480
am i am i the only person who thinks

537
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,480
that's weird

538
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,480
um

539
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
uh

540
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,558
so here's one other thing i'll do just

541
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,720
real quick if i nerf the entire routine

542
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,678
so let's suppose it's just gone like we

543
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,798
don't

544
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,519
do anything else so it's not gonna it

545
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:15,679
doesn't happen right so the only thing

546
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,599
we draw is the white box in the black

547
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,840
box that's it

548
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,000
do i see them are they getting like

549
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,678
overdrawn with some other

550
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,720
thing right

551
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,320
um

552
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,319
that's i guess what i'm asking

553
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,240
so that black box never gets drawn the

554
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,558
white box does get drawn and

555
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,159
we have no idea why so let's test a

556
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,759
couple things because

557
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,280
we need the diagramming system to be

558
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,640
reliable if we're going to use anything

559
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,440
with it so the first thing i'm going to

560
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,679
do

561
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,919
is i'm going to change the color uh from

562
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,000
black to red to see if there's anything

563
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,280
weird about the fact that like the color

564
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
was black

565
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,200
i mean i don't know

566
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,760
um it there shouldn't be because i don't

567
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,679
see why like it's just passed through it

568
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,400
shouldn't matter and it doesn't appear

569
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,000
to

570
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,679
um so

571
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,400
now let's leave the color black and i'm

572
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,759
going to copy um

573
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,080
the

574
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,158
construction that's used here so that we

575
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,240
can just say well okay so suppose that

576
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,480
best cell we just forget about what best

577
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,038
cell is entirely and i just draw a

578
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,400
bigger box on top of the box that we

579
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,119
already have

580
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,759
um so we kind of know where it will be

581
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,839
it's just a slightly larger box do i see

582
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,839
that

583
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:41,119
right and i don't

584
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,639
um so now the next test i'm gonna do is

585
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,399
i'm just gonna reverse the order of

586
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,200
these two things to see if it's that the

587
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,919
first thing i draw with a diagram system

588
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,200
doesn't work because then that would

589
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,480
give us a clear indication of what's

590
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,038
going on

591
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,759
um so here we go

592
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,599
uh and that is apparently the case like

593
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,400
you can see that the you can see it

594
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,319
right there right there's the black

595
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,278
box now

596
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,439
so it seems like we just have a problem

597
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,230
where the first thing that we whatever

598
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,278
we say on the diagram

599
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,919
[Music]

600
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,558
when we first push like the box on there

601
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,080
or whatever that like doesn't get drawn

602
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,319
for some reason

603
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,399
and so we should be able to see that

604
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,079
pretty easily i'll take a quick look at

605
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,600
inspecting it

606
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,720
but

607
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,000
you know

608
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,200
assuming that i can't immediately see

609
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,720
the problem is we should be able to step

610
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,038
into the debugger really easily and

611
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,200
verify a doesn't get pushed

612
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,480
and b if it does get pushed

613
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,319
why doesn't get drawn when we actually

614
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,360
loop over it right like what happens in

615
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,558
here

616
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,719
uh we have like this um

617
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,798
we have like these attributes right

618
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,159
where we set the color uh we set the

619
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:51,599
thickness

620
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,720
and we kind of have these current and

621
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,639
sticky

622
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,798
uh things so you can kind of like set

623
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,720
permanent uh

624
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,200
color whatever you know nonsense like

625
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,880
that uh and you can see what happens

626
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,880
here is we have a current equal sticky

627
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,200
at the end of each of these

628
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,640
um and you can kind of see like we set

629
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,880
like when you do color we set like the

630
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,559
current color to be things and the

631
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,120
current thickness and all that nonsense

632
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,879
right

633
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,479
um so

634
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,060
there are a lot of ways you could

635
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,919
imagine this thing

636
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,918
[Music]

637
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,919
failing

638
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,599
in here there's a couple things we don't

639
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,960
do so when you hit a diagram begin and

640
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:41,439
end we probably wanted to keep a little

641
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,558
stack that says let's restore what the

642
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,159
color was inside of the diagram

643
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,879
so this part

644
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,840
probably wants to get fixed and it could

645
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,200
be

646
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:55,519
that something that is happening before

647
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,038
here is affecting it the reason i don't

648
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,319
think that's the case is because diagram

649
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:59,759
filters should be preventing any of

650
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,759
those things from actually ever getting

651
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,000
pushed right because if you look at what

652
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,798
happens in here everybody's predicated

653
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,720
on if entry

654
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,839
and so

655
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,839
i don't know

656
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,759
i don't know that anything would ever be

657
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,359
on the stack in that case right so it's

658
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,400
probably not that

659
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,240
um

660
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,840
if you look at how push cube is working

661
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,480
right it just does exactly what you

662
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,720
would expect it uses the color

663
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,720
um

664
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,278
like there's there's really nothing

665
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,798
weird about that it uses the thickness

666
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,640
as the radius

667
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:39,599
the white texture

668
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,799
um

669
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,000
for the fill

670
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,480
and you can see that this is a bit uh

671
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,480
suspicious

672
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
that part there i guess

673
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
um

674
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,399
and the only reason i say it's a bit

675
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,798
suspicious is because what happens

676
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,080
the first time you draw something

677
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:01,759
is you set current equal to sticky

678
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,319
right

679
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,400
and so if you've never drawn anything

680
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,319
that line hasn't happened

681
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,840
now i don't think that line should have

682
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:12,158
to happen

683
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,879
because this should have already done

684
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,720
that like this piece of code right here

685
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
should have already set current equal to

686
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
sticky

687
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,120
so this should be initialized to valid

688
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,960
values when we enter this loop for the

689
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,639
first time

690
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,798
it should encounter

691
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,759
a color line which is current.color

692
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,759
equals entry dot color

693
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,159
and i can't see like because that

694
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:42,159
uh does

695
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,398
push a one on

696
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,240
uh

697
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,919
[Music]

698
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,759
yeah i don't know so i don't see it by

699
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,080
inspection i'm thinking i'm just gonna

700
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,119
have to

701
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,038
i'm gonna have to step through this

702
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,599
because i don't really see

703
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,359
why it would be failing

704
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,759
uh to draw that i mean i guess i can

705
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,599
double check the box routine but you

706
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,480
know there's nothing really much going

707
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,839
on here it's it's pretty

708
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,679
simple there's there's really no

709
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,918
nothing interesting is happening there

710
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,600
right um and the diagram group

711
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,919
i don't suppose there's a place you can

712
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,558
over push this is this code wrong like

713
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,000
so when it does its linkage is this

714
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,000
wrong

715
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
um

716
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,879
it looks fine to me

717
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,158
so you know i don't see a lot of issues

718
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,839
there either so i'm i don't know

719
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,000
uh i don't see anything wrong with this

720
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,798
so we're gonna have to step through and

721
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,558
we'll

722
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,720
see what we see you know um i don't know

723
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,480
i'm i'm just hoping it'll just jump out

724
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,839
at me as something stupid when we step

725
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,200
through it but if it doesn't then i

726
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,959
guess we're just gonna have to put our

727
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,519
thinking caps on and uh figure out what

728
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,278
what the heck is is wrong here

729
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,879
uh so the first thing i'm gonna do is

730
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,398
i'm just going to try to check to see if

731
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,600
this thing gets pushed on properly it

732
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:32,479
should be the first thing that's pushed

733
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,480
on um

734
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,599
that passes this right

735
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,399
so the first time we push something on

736
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,439
um

737
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:46,239
that's we should hit this case

738
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,519
and that case should you know pass the

739
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,720
filter

740
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,798
and we should get an entry that is

741
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,278
whatever the entry is right this is the

742
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:58,960
new entry and we're gonna stick crap in

743
00:29:55,278 --> 00:30:00,720
it so there's the uh

744
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,079
the instruction which is the thickness

745
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,880
instruction

746
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,798
uh we can go see who's doing that uh

747
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,120
because i don't know

748
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:13,440
and okay so there's a diagram text call

749
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,678
that's happening here

750
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,120
um

751
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,120
that could have something to do with it

752
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,038
like maybe that code is buggy so here's

753
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,319
diagram text

754
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:27,119
okay yep that's our bug right there

755
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,720
so we go to push on one of these entries

756
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,278
and it's called a diagram thick but it

757
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,159
was actually diagram text

758
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,159
that's probably it

759
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
yep

760
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,640
if only we had a language that supported

761
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,879
discriminated unions you wouldn't be

762
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,480
able to have that bug

763
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,320
to be fair it's not a bug you have very

764
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,960
often and it doesn't take very long to

765
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,480
fix as you saw but still

766
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,600
it's not a bug that you really should

767
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,599
ever

768
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,599
have

769
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,480
um

770
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,960
does ji support discriminated unions

771
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,960
i don't know

772
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,678
john and ia's programs don't tend to

773
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,119
look similar so i i never really know if

774
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,480
he would

775
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,719
uh

776
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,038
care about a particular thing that i

777
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,399
would probably care about a lot right

778
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:25,679
um

779
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,398
so yeah

780
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,600
uh anyway so yeah like you can see what

781
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:32,319
was happening there is this would just

782
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,599
pas pushing on totally wrong thing and

783
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,200
of course the way that we wrote this

784
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,359
code it's almost impossible for it to

785
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,120
actually ever crash because of that

786
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,439
if you pushed on something that wasn't a

787
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,038
diagram text as a diagram text because

788
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,558
that doesn't involve a pointer that's

789
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,879
the one place you would see it but

790
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:49,200
pretty much anything else you do will

791
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,799
just work it just won't work correctly

792
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,519
right it's sort of like a javascript

793
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,960
program in that sense is that the bugs

794
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,480
are all still there they just don't

795
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,038
crash the code

796
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,640
which is somehow seen as a victory

797
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:05,278
uh anyway so in this particular case uh

798
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,000
i think that's probably all it was

799
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:10,240
um so now we should get the that little

800
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,558
black square there right

801
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,558
um

802
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,559
so uh let's see

803
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,080
perfect

804
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,278
okay so going back to move entity now um

805
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:35,678
we shouldn't have to nerf this routine

806
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:38,880
anymore we should be able to see

807
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,880
everything we expect to see

808
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,839
like so

809
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,558
and

810
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,839
um

811
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:49,759
looking at

812
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,639
this code now

813
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,240
and

814
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,080
you know just

815
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,079
looking at wherever the thing is uh

816
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,079
yeah so that that one is actually okay

817
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,240
so

818
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:11,038
that was crucial because now i can see

819
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,000
that it actually is testing

820
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:16,558
the diagonal right so it's not testing

821
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,960
that one right there is the only one it

822
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:21,918
doesn't test right uh oh well actually

823
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,720
those two too like there's three edges

824
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,399
that it doesn't test right so the

825
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,120
diagram verifies

826
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:32,558
that things are happening so that's good

827
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,759
let's go ahead and try adding those

828
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,759
uh

829
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:39,278
side motions i guess

830
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,558
so if we take a look at

831
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,599
this

832
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,240
uh code here what this would be is you

833
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,319
can see these testing flat faces right

834
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,278
for movement

835
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:54,000
and so a face because it has uh in this

836
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:56,720
case four corners they get tested to see

837
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,720
if they're all open

838
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,159
it's not clear to me that that's

839
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,158
actually correct

840
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,159
um

841
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,440
[Music]

842
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,440
because

843
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,838
you know maybe we should say that only

844
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,000
three

845
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,398
have to be i don't know

846
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,639
um but in fact let me go ahead and put

847
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,638
that in here

848
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,960
i don't know if that's you know better

849
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,119
or worse i really couldn't tell you what

850
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,440
you can see here is that if i go ahead

851
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,280
and produce an edge motion one then what

852
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,240
we're gonna see instead is rather than

853
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,639
checking

854
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,039
uh for four which is what a face is

855
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,039
we're just gonna check for three which

856
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,358
is what an edge is and it would be the

857
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,639
combination

858
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,719
of any

859
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,119
of the directions

860
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:58,000
so we would have something that looked

861
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,440
like you know a der x der y

862
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,559
you know what i'm saying

863
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,400
a uh der x der z

864
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:09,519
and then a der y der z would be which

865
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,000
sounds like a german word like you know

866
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,759
um we the

867
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,239
like like it seems like the dirt the

868
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,280
wider z sounds like a river in germany

869
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:21,759
um so once we have

870
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,920
you know uh these

871
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,520
update direction checks we need the

872
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,720
occupied flags

873
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,599
now we're really sounding like a river

874
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,959
in germany uh we need the occupied flags

875
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,460
to

876
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,400
uh be tested for those engines

877
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,280
[Laughter]

878
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,039
boy

879
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,519
okay uh so if we want to do dir y jersey

880
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,279
uh then what we're looking at here is

881
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,880
uh

882
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,480
in terms of these

883
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,000
if whichever one which whichever

884
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,159
uh

885
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,119
motion we're not doing is the one that

886
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:01,440
we need both edges on i believe right so

887
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,838
so we're going in the the der y dr z

888
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,440
direction but we have to check that edge

889
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,320
so i think the way this would work is

890
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,039
like the zero and one code goes with

891
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,200
which whichever one this is right

892
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,159
and then these are both going to be

893
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,719
just whatever their actual side is

894
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,719
in this case right so we're looking on

895
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,959
the side that we're going and then we're

896
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:25,118
just saying like the vertical edge in

897
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,039
that direction right which and that's

898
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,280
how we would move through

899
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:33,119
that side and so the same would go here

900
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,119
so this would be like you know

901
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,799
the same thing but where the edge is

902
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:41,039
along y so that's you know moving upward

903
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,880
way and then finally this

904
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,000
one here

905
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,720
which is along x right and i think

906
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,719
that's what those are

907
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,039
wait a second i have to check the stream

908
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,598
is somebody seriously talking about rust

909
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,599
again on the stream

910
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,000
you know what happens when someone talks

911
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,960
about rust in the chat

912
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,880
you know what happens

913
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,679
why would you do it

914
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,680
why would you do it

915
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,079
who is responsible for this

916
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,920
why is rust getting discussed in the

917
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,920
chat

918
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:08,679
the executions will continue until

919
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,679
morale improves

920
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,639
yes

921
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,000
it gets the hose again

922
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,000
it gets the hose again

923
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,199
all right i'm gonna look back at my

924
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,440
program now

925
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:41,879
and the next time i glance at chat i

926
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,880
better not see the r word on there

927
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,838
all right

928
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,400
maybe you can maybe if you want to you

929
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,119
can do just do r

930
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,639
star star star or something right

931
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,280
like like

932
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,239
if the if you if you if you write out

933
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,839
rust with a hard st at the end

934
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,719
that that's just like you're instantly

935
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,719
cancelled from the stream

936
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,960
um all right so let's take a look at

937
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,379
what this works out to be

938
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,469
um

939
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,469
[Music]

940
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,440
i'm just curious uh the goal here is to

941
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,440
have it check like the entire block

942
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,280
right and you can see that now we have

943
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,838
like a full cube of testing going on

944
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,839
there the full cube of testing

945
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:42,639
um and i'm just curious if that uh

946
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:46,400
changes what we see when we look at the

947
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:49,519
corner cases now um and

948
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,960
you know just take a look here

949
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:52,639
okay

950
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,199
uh so

951
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,639
okay so you can kind of also see this

952
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,919
let's this actually illuminates this

953
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,838
much more clearly now that we can see

954
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,760
what we're actually doing here um i'm

955
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,679
going to go out on a limb

956
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,640
i don't know i'm going to go on a limb

957
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:06,318
and say

958
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,199
that we now have a slightly different

959
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:11,440
bug the bug that we have is that this

960
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,919
won't work but the other side will i

961
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,440
that's just a total

962
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,200
totally random guess on my part um i

963
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,960
have no idea

964
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:24,318
but i'm just gonna say

965
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,318
maybe that's what happens

966
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,279
almost but not quite

967
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,239
uh

968
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,760
so we're still in that place where no

969
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:36,078
ev and i guess i don't know why that is

970
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,720
that's really weird so it switched

971
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,440
which direction it was testing depending

972
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:44,318
on which glove side it was

973
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,440
how did it do that

974
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,759
it seems like we have something that

975
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,440
uniquely picks the wrong side to test

976
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,440
which i don't know how i did that

977
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,559
can we instead change our code to

978
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,679
uniquely pick i was assuming that since

979
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,759
it picked

980
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,118
that way on this side it would also pick

981
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,720
that way on this side since they're both

982
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,119
trying to go forwards but that's

983
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,358
apparently not the case

984
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,358
um

985
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,079
i also am not sure why that

986
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:11,358
doesn't work it looks like that would

987
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,640
have enough clearance but i guess the

988
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:14,639
glove is a little bit too large

989
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,799
um so yeah to me it looks like i don't

990
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,598
know that doesn't look like it's wrong

991
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,280
um

992
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,000
it still looks correct

993
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,200
so my assumption is it's just look it's

994
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,440
not going to work

995
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,199
by just testing the local neighborhood

996
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,000
like if you want to actually have roll

997
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,480
off you're going to have to test like a

998
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,719
larger neighborhood right

999
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,400
um

1000
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:43,838
that seems like

1001
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,358
possibly right like yeah

1002
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,480
you know

1003
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,358
um

1004
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,280
so so that's my that's my guess

1005
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,480
uh

1006
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,839
i'm not sure

1007
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,079
i'm not sure

1008
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:56,078
um

1009
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,279
uh but but we'll see

1010
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:04,239
so i think

1011
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,920
you know i i think that's

1012
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,919
that's that's the entirety of it

1013
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,119
um

1014
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:24,239
so how do i want to do that though is

1015
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,239
the is the real question

1016
00:42:29,280 --> 01:25:02,159
and i'm um

1017
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,000
uh and i'm not sure about that um

1018
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,078
so i'm not sure how i want to test the

1019
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,439
one neighborhood

1020
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,200
or i guess i should say the two

1021
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,400
neighborhood in this case because it's

1022
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,318
sort of the

1023
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,240
of the initial point

1024
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,639
but you can see what i'm saying here so

1025
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,439
basically we end up in this situation

1026
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,838
the actual closest point is is probably

1027
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,760
in this square right here

1028
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,000
but we're never going to test that

1029
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,240
square from this square

1030
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,239
you know what i mean

1031
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,239
um

1032
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,519
so i really just don't know

1033
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
hmm

1034
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,679
so we're gonna have to think about this

1035
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,680
obviously it's trivial for us to just

1036
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,759
check

1037
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,759
more of these cubes because it's just a

1038
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,280
function call so we can you know we can

1039
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,960
construct the code that checks as many

1040
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,400
cubes as we want it's not like it's hard

1041
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,838
to construct the algorithm to do that

1042
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,318
the question is how do you construct an

1043
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,000
algorithm that intelligently tests

1044
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:37,838
only the cubes that it needs to and

1045
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,679
doesn't just test like tons of cubes

1046
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,119
unnecessarily

1047
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,159
randomly looking

1048
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:48,318
for the place to put the point and so

1049
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:51,679
i feel like that's sort of more

1050
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:54,679
the issue there i suppose

1051
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:54,679
um

1052
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,639
uh by the way uh

1053
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,640
no

1054
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,480
you're only not allowed to say

1055
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:24,000
the r star star star word rpg maker is

1056
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,119
fine so is game maker

1057
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,880
unity and unreal are also fine

1058
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,880
just not our star star star

1059
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,400
um

1060
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,440
i do have some serious reservations

1061
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,440
about unity now so i don't know that i

1062
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,559
would necessarily recommend anyone use

1063
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,519
it

1064
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,679
um

1065
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:49,440
instead of one of the alternatives like

1066
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,199
unreal engine or

1067
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,720
game maker or something

1068
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,879
but like

1069
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,639
you know if someone does want to use it

1070
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,599
i mean

1071
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,400
okay

1072
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,519
uh

1073
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,119
you know

1074
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,920
that's their choice i don't think

1075
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,920
there's anything like

1076
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,719
super wrong about it or something it's

1077
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,759
just it seems like i don't think it's

1078
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,838
i don't think it's got a lot of

1079
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,839
longevity as a game engine these days i

1080
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,199
i i mean just based on what you know if

1081
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:16,078
you listen to their corporate conference

1082
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,598
calls

1083
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,000
and you just see like basically what the

1084
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,000
track record is of the program i i mean

1085
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,679
i don't think it's the same thing to

1086
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,239
build a company or a project around

1087
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:30,559
anymore right so i would strongly advise

1088
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:32,318
against using it but you know um

1089
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,719
if for some reason you really think it's

1090
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,480
a good idea it's not like our star star

1091
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:37,838
star where i'm just like i really don't

1092
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,440
like the people and i don't like how

1093
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,960
they constantly

1094
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,200
antagonize people about it so i just

1095
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,079
don't like it on principle which is not

1096
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,879
true of unity nobody from unity has ever

1097
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,680
antagonized me about anything right

1098
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,838
um

1099
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,759
so i i have no reason to suspect that

1100
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,920
the people who work on unity are like

1101
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,760
bad or something right

1102
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,920
um so anyway

1103
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,040
uh if we take a look at

1104
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,639
um

1105
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,400
at this sort of

1106
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,078
part of the algorithm here by the way i

1107
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,039
don't really remember why these things

1108
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,240
are getting

1109
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:13,440
highlighted is that because they're

1110
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,838
getting checked for collisions i don't

1111
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,679
even remember right like i assume

1112
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,039
that that we highlight that because it's

1113
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,318
getting checked for collision but i

1114
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,719
don't even remember writing that piece

1115
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:24,239
of code uh apparently we did which is

1116
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:25,598
great i mean hey it's kind of a good

1117
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,639
piece of information

1118
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,318
um

1119
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:29,598
not that we're really using it much but

1120
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,159
still cool

1121
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,160
um so if we look at what's going on here

1122
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,318
we need a strategy for like widening the

1123
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:38,000
search space to some squares

1124
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:39,679
and what that means is like this kind of

1125
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,440
thing and you can sort of see why this

1126
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:42,639
is happening too because

1127
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,880
in general

1128
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,318
we we sort of don't really handle like a

1129
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,640
particular narrow band case like if you

1130
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,440
look at what's going on here you can see

1131
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,799
that

1132
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,720
we're sort of making the arbitrary

1133
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,400
distinction that if something is

1134
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:57,279
positive it goes one direction and if

1135
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,079
it's negative it goes the other

1136
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,760
direction we don't really talk about

1137
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,559
what happens if it's zero or close to

1138
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,559
zero right

1139
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:12,240
and for numbers that are close to zero

1140
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,960
like this one is right this is something

1141
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:17,358
that's moving directly down

1142
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,199
um the y-axis

1143
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,639
right the glove is moving straight

1144
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,799
forward

1145
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,598
on the screen which is directly down

1146
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,440
the y axis and so we arbitrarily

1147
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,960
classify that

1148
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,318
as like positive one maybe or if like

1149
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,599
the floating point value is just a

1150
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:35,599
little bit off

1151
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,680
you know then maybe we classify it as

1152
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,680
negative one but we're uh it's it the

1153
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:41,919
point is whichever one it ends up being

1154
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,799
classified as

1155
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,400
it was like totally arbitrary that we

1156
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,079
decided to classify it in that way we

1157
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,200
could just as easily have classified it

1158
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,000
the other way

1159
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,480
making this sort of like a bogus choice

1160
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,760
now if the thing is like solidly

1161
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:02,079
positive or solidly negative meaning

1162
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,599
we're clearly going to the left or we're

1163
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,599
clearly going to the right

1164
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,519
or something like this right so in this

1165
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,318
case right x is the thing we're talking

1166
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,119
about

1167
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:15,039
x is basically zero for this motion and

1168
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,920
so we're arbitrarily classifying as

1169
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:20,400
saying only search to the left or only

1170
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,559
search to the right for this thing and

1171
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,559
that's kind of wrong

1172
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,920
so we have that problem

1173
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,160
and then the other problem is apparently

1174
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,800
even that's not quite enough in other

1175
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:35,598
words making that distinction correctly

1176
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,640
um may not be enough it might fix that

1177
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,519
case

1178
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:42,719
uh but it wouldn't fix that kid did i

1179
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,719
get it right let me see

1180
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,318
yeah so you can see in this case uh it

1181
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,519
look well no no i thought we had one

1182
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,519
where we were checking the right

1183
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,800
direction maybe we don't

1184
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:57,800
maybe it would fix these cases

1185
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,800
um

1186
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,838
is that it yet oh well

1187
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,679
i can't quite tell

1188
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,318
if that case is happening

1189
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:14,639
um

1190
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:14,639
let me

1191
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,959
i guess it's i guess we ne somehow never

1192
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,760
get that case somehow no matter which

1193
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,599
side we're on we always pick the

1194
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,160
incorrect thing

1195
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,440
um which is impressive i'm not sure how

1196
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,358
we did that

1197
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,159
but apparently we did

1198
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,239
right

1199
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,519
um

1200
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,639
i don't know

1201
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,639
i don't know how we did that

1202
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,358
doesn't seem like that should have been

1203
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:47,039
possible so i guess i don't really know

1204
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:49,440
um maybe if it did pick this it would

1205
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,440
work

1206
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,719
uh

1207
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,039
hmm

1208
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,240
so i'm thinking of a couple things here

1209
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,399
and let me just say them out loud

1210
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:05,039
so one thing that occurs to me is that

1211
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,440
if we look at one of these squares

1212
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,039
what we could do is

1213
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,318
yeah and you know what i'm thinking

1214
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:13,279
about this this makes a lot more sense

1215
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:16,639
so it seems to me like this maybe is the

1216
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,640
wrong way to look at the problem

1217
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,119
what this does is it says

1218
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,920
let's classify the kind of motion that

1219
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,920
we're about to do

1220
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,440
statically

1221
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,639
for the actual movement between the

1222
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,358
place that we're starting in the place

1223
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:37,679
that we're ending and we use that

1224
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:40,799
as our voxel direction the entire time

1225
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:43,118
but it occurs to me that probably

1226
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,400
what we really should be doing

1227
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,480
is classifying which direction we would

1228
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,880
want to move

1229
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,559
or check

1230
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:57,160
dynamically as we march through the

1231
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,160
voxel probably right

1232
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,400
and i don't know like we obviously need

1233
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,720
a thing that prevents us from revisiting

1234
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,480
voxels we already visited though because

1235
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,159
otherwise unless we could come up with a

1236
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,760
perfect scheme

1237
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:18,399
which never produces the same voxels

1238
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,800
twice and that just to be clear that's

1239
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,680
why this is a slightly harder problem

1240
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:27,359
because as we currently have it because

1241
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,480
we're always searching along a a single

1242
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:30,719
direction

1243
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,760
we can never visit the same voxel twice

1244
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:36,159
because we can only move

1245
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,000
forward we can never like we can only

1246
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,920
only move

1247
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,280
in these directions

1248
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,039
uh

1249
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,480
that we've picked once

1250
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,480
we can only go in this direction so if

1251
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,800
if we pick negative

1252
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,318
negative one for an x step we can never

1253
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,880
move positive one in the next step right

1254
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:59,519
so it prevents us from ever getting back

1255
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,680
to somewhere that we already were

1256
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,159
and that's really the thing that

1257
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,679
currently keeps the algorithm from

1258
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,598
revisiting

1259
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,039
existing cells like cells that had

1260
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,720
already tried

1261
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:14,480
and we don't want to do that for two

1262
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:15,279
reasons one is we waste processing power

1263
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,599
uh

1264
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,040
in on this algorithm if it's testing

1265
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,200
voxels it already tested because it's

1266
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,279
going to produce you know a predictable

1267
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,159
result we already tested that box we

1268
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:28,559
know what the outcome should be

1269
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,078
and so what we really want to do here is

1270
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,119
oh oh and the second reason which is

1271
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,880
more important is it would get an

1272
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,318
infinite loop potentially like if you

1273
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,838
had two voxels that could go back and

1274
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:37,358
forth from each other we would have to

1275
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,960
start introducing something like a

1276
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,798
timeout period so we just like okay

1277
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,639
after 10 tests if you haven't found

1278
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,920
something then quit because otherwise

1279
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,598
you could just ping pong back and forth

1280
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,599
between two voxels and the routine would

1281
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,960
never terminate so right now we have the

1282
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,720
nice property of this routine will

1283
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,559
always terminate even if it has to test

1284
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:53,919
a thousand voxels to do it to move

1285
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,359
something a really long distance which

1286
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,358
we don't really want to do but you know

1287
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,000
it would still work right it doesn't

1288
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,440
produce anything buggy um and so that's

1289
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,318
a nice property of the algorithm we want

1290
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,798
to continue to have we want the

1291
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,920
algorithm to be

1292
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:11,920
don't actually test this thing

1293
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,358
this voxel if you've already tested it

1294
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,639
and having a way to produce that

1295
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:15,759
automatically is nice because it means

1296
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:16,798
you don't have to track anything we have

1297
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,240
to have a stack we have to have

1298
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,559
comparisons to see whether we've already

1299
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,399
tracked something all that stuff

1300
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,680
and so as we move away from that and we

1301
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,119
want to test a wider neighborhood of

1302
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:26,719
voxels the problem that i'm having in my

1303
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,480
head is like okay so what do i want to

1304
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,679
do there do i do i keep a stack of

1305
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,280
voxels

1306
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,399
and do i say

1307
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,920
like okay we

1308
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,838
don't

1309
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,079
we check to see if we've already tested

1310
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:41,279
them or do i try to have a flood filling

1311
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,318
rule

1312
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,480
that somehow makes sure that we wouldn't

1313
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:50,719
ever push

1314
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,719
voxels on that we shouldn't um

1315
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,760
uh ntk dev uh a line drawing algorithm

1316
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,440
is what we already have

1317
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,200
and what we need is something that's

1318
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,000
more than that right we need something

1319
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,759
that actually is more like a flood fill

1320
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,079
you know

1321
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:20,960
uh and so we need a way to sort of check

1322
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,839
a wider swath of things

1323
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,679
now maybe we could still use

1324
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:28,000
a line drawing algorithm which is sort

1325
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:30,000
of what we've got right now right we're

1326
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,559
basically this is basically a present

1327
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,920
resin ham's line drawing algorithm for

1328
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,240
the most part

1329
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,079
uh is what we're basically doing right

1330
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:42,879
um and maybe one thing we could consider

1331
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,680
is a wider line right so maybe we still

1332
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,079
draw a line but we test you know two

1333
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:50,159
voxels in either direction

1334
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,280
um or something like this

1335
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:53,838
so

1336
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,839
you know that could work

1337
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,838
um

1338
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,559
i just don't know if that's the right

1339
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,559
answer

1340
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:18,838
foreign

1341
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,400
it's tough decision

1342
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,079
so one thing we could do

1343
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,519
is

1344
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,680
yeah no even that doesn't really make

1345
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,159
much sense to me i i can't think of

1346
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,159
anything that doesn't track we maybe we

1347
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,159
just do need to track like we'll need to

1348
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,759
have

1349
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,159
some way of

1350
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,400
saying look we already tested

1351
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,960
these points we don't need to test them

1352
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,240
again because i i'm trying to think of

1353
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,639
an algorithm that wouldn't require that

1354
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,479
and i can't think of anything because as

1355
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,960
soon as you test

1356
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:00,798
as soon as you have the algorithm ever

1357
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:03,519
say we're going to test two directions

1358
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,440
right so we're gonna test x negative one

1359
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:07,679
and x positive one

1360
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,159
for a voxel motion

1361
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,719
as soon as you say that that can happen

1362
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:15,039
then the algorithm can pretty much

1363
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,078
oscillate you can you can right you can

1364
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,719
get in a position where you you

1365
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,440
ping-pong back and forth and so you

1366
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:24,719
would need a thing that says i already

1367
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,720
checked a previous cell

1368
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,559
so we don't need to check that cell

1369
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,559
again

1370
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,798
unless i'm just not thinking of it

1371
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,318
hmm

1372
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:25,358
it really would nice to be to be nice to

1373
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,318
be more clever right it would be nice to

1374
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,400
be more clever there

1375
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:32,719
but it's not coming to me

1376
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,720
um

1377
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,960
you can see right like so let's suppose

1378
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,000
that you were in this scenario here

1379
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,000
right

1380
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,559
and you could see just saying look what

1381
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,798
if we just widen this up so you know

1382
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,960
what if we basically did that

1383
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,079
and tested like a nine

1384
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,358
way

1385
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,559
test

1386
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:54,159
around

1387
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:58,400
uh

1388
01:00:54,159 --> 01:01:00,000
the voxel and so the the the min corner

1389
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,720
location

1390
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,679
we actually start off like one behind

1391
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:04,798
that

1392
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,318
and go

1393
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:07,759
forward right

1394
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:09,838
so we test

1395
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,680
you know something like a wider swath

1396
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:13,279
and then we pick you know which ones we

1397
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:14,318
want to go

1398
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,798
um

1399
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,480
in or whatever right like who knows the

1400
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,880
other thing we could do is like in here

1401
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:23,838
right we say instead of using these side

1402
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,559
coefficients we just actually

1403
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:30,239
don't we we actually have like all of

1404
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:33,760
the possible motion directions in here

1405
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,759
and we just use them right

1406
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:38,239
uh

1407
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:40,000
that's the obvious thing to try next and

1408
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:41,358
then you immediately run into the

1409
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,119
scenario that i was talking about which

1410
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:44,719
is as soon as you do that you can move

1411
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,000
back and forth between the same two

1412
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:47,759
voxels

1413
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,760
so what you need is then you would need

1414
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,960
a check that's like did i already visit

1415
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,119
this voxel

1416
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,280
now it's not that

1417
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:00,280
hard of a thing to check

1418
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,280
but

1419
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,318
it adds a lot of extra complexity right

1420
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:12,000
we've got to keep a stack of those

1421
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:12,960
things

1422
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,719
um

1423
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,639
unless i'm missing the way that you

1424
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:19,639
would avoid that

1425
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:19,639
um

1426
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:17,798
uh

1427
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,519
yeah

1428
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:25,519
i'm just not thinking of anything

1429
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,400
i suppose one thing we could do is try

1430
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,039
to think about is there a way that we

1431
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,039
can have

1432
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,839
some kind of like a

1433
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,159
additional value besides just the point

1434
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:45,279
that we're trying to get closest to

1435
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:47,598
that would allow us to navigate

1436
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,599
um

1437
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,680
like okay we you know we tried going in

1438
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,760
this direction and it didn't work so

1439
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:58,480
we'll try going in the other direction

1440
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,480
kind of a thing

1441
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,079
so yeah like i mean here's just a stupid

1442
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:16,419
idea

1443
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,960
um

1444
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:21,680
[Music]

1445
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,280
like like imagine if you took this loop

1446
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,199
right um

1447
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,599
and you know you're looping through here

1448
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,118
and you can see like okay you get down

1449
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,359
to here

1450
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,480
and you find out that you didn't like

1451
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:35,920
you went as far as you could using the

1452
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,199
direction that you thought that you

1453
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,200
should move

1454
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:40,199
right

1455
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,880
you know in theory you could add another

1456
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:49,358
thing here that was something like uh

1457
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,358
you know tried opposites or something

1458
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:55,679
uh and you could do

1459
01:04:52,480 --> 01:05:00,159
you know like okay like if tried

1460
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:00,159
opposites then break you know else

1461
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,318
try some other direction

1462
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,519
right

1463
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,558
um so you imagine like in here you would

1464
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:11,759
say

1465
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,760
you grab this crap

1466
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,480
and you do something else here so if

1467
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,318
tried opposites uh

1468
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,559
uh

1469
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:27,920
or whatever you know you you look and

1470
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,200
see

1471
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,119
if you can

1472
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:33,598
change one of these

1473
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,880
deltas somehow

1474
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,440
uh

1475
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,400
and

1476
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,679
you know you could imagine doing this

1477
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,680
um

1478
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:47,440
for each one so let's let's sketch a

1479
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:51,000
crappy one so a crappy one is

1480
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,000
is like

1481
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:01,920
this is not what we'll actually want to

1482
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:05,640
do if we actually try if we if this is

1483
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,639
turns out to be useful

1484
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,880
oh wait these are the wrong sorry this

1485
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,519
is

1486
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,519
der right

1487
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:29,960
it's just uh it's just dirt and side

1488
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,960
yeah

1489
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,960
so like you know that seems pretty oop

1490
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:42,960
that was bad

1491
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,679
um

1492
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,340
so that seems pretty reasonable

1493
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,458
um

1494
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,459
[Music]

1495
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,599
i don't

1496
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:55,119
you know and that's not what we would

1497
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:56,880
actually want to do because we're going

1498
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,519
to want to actually test

1499
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,358
more than that permutation

1500
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:04,480
um but like

1501
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:04,480
that would allow us to

1502
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:07,838
why is my camera not okay

1503
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:13,358
that would allow us to try more and yeah

1504
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,440
and there you can see right so

1505
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,440
so if we clean that up and actually test

1506
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,599
the forward ones i mean maybe it would

1507
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,519
work i don't know but

1508
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,599
that's a way of not actually having to

1509
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:26,599
do

1510
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,599
um

1511
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,000
yeah of not actually having to do it the

1512
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,838
problem is it'll still over yeah but

1513
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,400
that even that will over test right

1514
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:50,880
because you're still going to overlap

1515
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:54,559
it doesn't require the bounds check but

1516
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,160
it will still it would still overlap

1517
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,359
um and there's nothing you're really

1518
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:59,358
going to be able to do about that

1519
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,960
yes it's still not great um

1520
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,880
so like let's suppose we took this

1521
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:17,440
stupid thing

1522
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,600
uh and we just said like okay there's

1523
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:21,358
like an opposite flags

1524
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,199
stupid thing

1525
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:26,000
and we basically

1526
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:29,439
uh we you know we look at these and we

1527
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,238
say if we think that we need to

1528
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,000
uh

1529
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:37,000
test this so like the absolute value

1530
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
um

1531
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,678
of one of these deltas

1532
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,399
like if the absolute value of one of

1533
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,399
these deltas

1534
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:53,318
is less than like our

1535
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,318
opposite threshold or whatever

1536
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,480
oops

1537
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,640
which i don't know what that is

1538
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:05,358
but like if it's close to being

1539
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,279
something that could in theory work

1540
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,120
uh which we don't i don't know what that

1541
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,759
is but let's suppose it is

1542
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:11,759
something like that

1543
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,839
um

1544
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:18,559
and i guess you know even thinking about

1545
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,679
that i'm not sure that makes much sense

1546
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,759
we should just get rid of that let's

1547
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,158
just say we let's just do this

1548
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,560
um so if we're doing the opposite try

1549
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:28,879
thing it would just like loop through

1550
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,359
all the different directions to try like

1551
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,279
as it couldn't figure it out

1552
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,239
this seems crappy

1553
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,239
but you know

1554
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,679
so each time through you'd just like ink

1555
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:53,678
this thing and you'd you'd have like

1556
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,719
whichever one you were on you'd do it

1557
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,239
right

1558
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,840
there's probably a pattern here we could

1559
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,359
probably just make

1560
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,199
the pattern

1561
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:03,839
do something

1562
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:03,839
um

1563
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,399
in fact yeah

1564
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,239
so

1565
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:09,839
every time yeah

1566
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:13,000
you don't even need to do that you just

1567
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,000
do this

1568
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,198
so you'd do something like if tried

1569
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,319
opposites

1570
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:29,119
uh

1571
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:32,158
you know if this has all of the bits set

1572
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:34,319
so if it's got the one the two and the

1573
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,238
four bit set

1574
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:37,599
then you've tried like all the opposites

1575
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:39,039
that you're going to try

1576
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,039
right

1577
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:42,039
um

1578
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,840
something like that

1579
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,280
uh so i don't know if you want to reset

1580
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,360
this every time or not

1581
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:12,158
probably not so you go through and you

1582
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:13,920
say like okay if

1583
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:17,198
the tried opposites

1584
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,880
uh if we end with one that means it's

1585
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:24,079
like gonna loop up so every time we

1586
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,400
wanna try a new opposite we have to flip

1587
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,000
like side x right because we're flip you

1588
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:31,519
know we got to pick somebody who

1589
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,640
oscillates at the lowest frequency level

1590
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,760
um

1591
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,600
so if we already were on one of those

1592
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,199
then we

1593
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,719
have to switch

1594
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:45,279
side y right like if you inked that one

1595
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:47,198
um and at that point we would have to

1596
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:49,599
say like if we were already on one of

1597
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:51,198
these we have to uh

1598
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,840
also

1599
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:54,149
knock the other one

1600
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:56,079
right um

1601
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:58,559
[Music]

1602
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:00,800
something like that

1603
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,080
and so each time through here we just

1604
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,640
say like

1605
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,640
we flip aside

1606
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,960
and this code sucks and i don't think we

1607
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,399
should probably do this but you know

1608
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,920
sometimes you just have to explore

1609
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:21,799
something

1610
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,800
uh to see what it does

1611
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:29,279
um so here's that crappy code doing you

1612
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,480
know whatever it's doing

1613
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:31,840
um and i don't know if this will

1614
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,599
actually produce the correct results

1615
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,039
let's take a look

1616
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,440
yeah so it

1617
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:39,039
it actually does i mean it's it's not

1618
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:40,158
efficient so i don't think we want to

1619
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:41,679
use it

1620
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:43,759
uh but it actually does produce the

1621
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,319
correct results and so you can see now

1622
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,440
that you know it's checking in there

1623
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,198
so i guess

1624
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:51,359
what's a little bit weird about that is

1625
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,399
i'm kind of surprised

1626
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:53,519
to learn

1627
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,879
that

1628
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,230
it can't accept any of those

1629
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,319
motions

1630
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:02,479
[Music]

1631
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:03,599
which seems odd

1632
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:05,039
to me

1633
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,280
like

1634
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:07,279
uh

1635
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,279
but i guess that's actually true right

1636
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:15,280
like it would have to move so far out

1637
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:17,279
here before it could figure out that it

1638
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:20,639
could round that corner you know what i

1639
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,639
mean um

1640
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,840
that for whatever reason it just can't

1641
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:33,839
find a closer place to place it

1642
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,679
which seems kind of nuts right because

1643
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:44,719
if the current location for this thing

1644
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,719
is like in there

1645
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:50,399
you would think it might be able to find

1646
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:55,039
a closer place uh which i guess does

1647
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:55,039
mean maybe we want to check the um

1648
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,840
check the sphere collision a little bit

1649
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:01,439
more

1650
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,279
but yeah i don't know i mean in theory

1651
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:06,559
that could really be true i mean it

1652
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:08,399
could really be true that that

1653
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:12,199
uh

1654
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,198
collision is there

1655
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:19,039
maybe we should draw that diagram a

1656
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,440
little bit more

1657
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:22,880
like maybe we should try and put

1658
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:24,000
some

1659
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,679
clearer

1660
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,319
bounds on this so

1661
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,520
so one thing we could do is draw the

1662
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,319
sphere

1663
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,840
for the glove so we can see whether we

1664
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,359
think it should be able to be placed in

1665
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,880
there or not

1666
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,119
because right now you know

1667
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:42,119
it's kind of hard to tell

1668
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:42,119
um

1669
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,519
you know like i i can't tell

1670
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,360
i don't even know like how big this

1671
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,560
glove's collision sphere is supposed to

1672
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:52,639
be

1673
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,960
so without drawing that it's pretty hard

1674
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,239
for me to say like okay is there some

1675
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,079
kind of bug in the way that the sphere

1676
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,359
testing's happening

1677
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:00,719
that means like like really you should

1678
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:02,479
be able to place it in there and like

1679
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:05,119
the collision routine is just saying no

1680
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:08,000
even though that's not true

1681
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:10,880
um in which case that would be important

1682
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,238
uh so i don't know we've got draw sphere

1683
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,119
in here

1684
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:15,759
um

1685
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:18,079
and we don't really have any idea of how

1686
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,960
we would do that but

1687
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:21,519
uh

1688
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,600
we should be able to produce at least

1689
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,400
something like you know some kind of

1690
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:29,600
approximated like we'll put some points

1691
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:29,599
uh just you know

1692
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,158
randomly put some of these things down

1693
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,158
there

1694
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,800
we should be able to draw a few points

1695
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,300
and

1696
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,119
actually

1697
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:44,159
[Music]

1698
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:44,158
um you know

1699
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,039
outline the sphere roughly

1700
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:52,079
so

1701
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:54,000
if we did something like you know like a

1702
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,399
little like ring of points or something

1703
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,640
or do you know we do have line segments

1704
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:00,238
so we could draw like a ring with a line

1705
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,680
segment

1706
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:02,238
um

1707
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,000
[Music]

1708
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:06,238
that just you know you could imagine

1709
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,319
like an x ring a wiring and a z-ring or

1710
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:10,959
something like that which again is not

1711
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,880
going to be great but you know

1712
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,840
it would be fine

1713
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,039
so

1714
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,520
i don't know

1715
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:18,519
something like

1716
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:29,679
i don't know what uh

1717
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,238
we want to do here but like you know

1718
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:34,480
suppose we drew like basically octagons

1719
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:38,399
or something

1720
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:41,359
and we just say like okay yeah like

1721
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:41,359
whatever this is

1722
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:47,839
uh we'll produce some angle here

1723
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:50,479
that's gonna be the step index divided

1724
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:53,360
by the step count right

1725
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:55,119
um and we need it to like return to

1726
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:56,719
where it came from so we're probably

1727
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:58,158
going to want it to actually go like all

1728
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,480
the way up to step count because we want

1729
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:03,039
to go from 0 to 2 pi so that the ring

1730
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,319
like closes

1731
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:05,279
so we're going to have something like

1732
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,599
this

1733
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:09,279
where we produce an angle

1734
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,039
and because the sine and cosine routines

1735
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:13,279
are stupid

1736
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,679
we're going to have to do this

1737
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:19,599
arbitrary garbage here

1738
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:19,600
so uh we do like

1739
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:24,238
um

1740
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,559
you know like an x version

1741
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,959
which is the cosine of the angle

1742
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,560
uh and this is going to be like

1743
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,960
i don't remember what our pi value is a

1744
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,120
tau 32 something like that

1745
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,279
uh so this is going to be like tau 32

1746
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:39,920
times the angle uh and this is going to

1747
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:41,119
be tau 32 times the angle uh but with

1748
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,560
the sine

1749
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:45,119
and so then we'd have like the points

1750
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:47,600
going around the circle and we just need

1751
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:49,198
a radius value for these to make them

1752
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,679
into an actual

1753
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:53,198
point that we care about

1754
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,279
uh and so

1755
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:57,439
what i want to do is just draw these

1756
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:59,519
line segments you can see the line

1757
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:01,359
segment call here also we should

1758
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,920
follow the convention and reset sticky

1759
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:05,920
after we draw something

1760
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,279
so here what we would need is we'd need

1761
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,158
a p0

1762
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,119
right

1763
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:14,000
um and we'd need a p1

1764
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:16,479
uh but other than that it would be fine

1765
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,560
now since we're drawing a sphere

1766
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:19,599
uh we can just draw three of these at

1767
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,039
once

1768
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,159
right

1769
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:28,479
and what we could do is

1770
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:28,479
as we oh well you know what we could do

1771
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,039
is not do this

1772
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:36,399
and just always compute one forward

1773
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:40,000
right so so here what we would do

1774
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:42,238
is say that we've got um

1775
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,238
an x zero y zero

1776
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,718
and an angle zero and then we just do

1777
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:46,718
that again

1778
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:53,119
i wanna say that

1779
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:56,800
we have an arm two yeah we do so so we

1780
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:56,800
could actually just do this

1781
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:02,479
where we just say like hey

1782
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:05,279
uh can you produce

1783
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:07,759
the arm for this and that gives us the x

1784
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:10,238
and the y that we wanted uh which that

1785
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,280
way we just it's just less code to type

1786
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:12,718
oops

1787
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,119
because i didn't hit the

1788
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,000
copy button

1789
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:17,279
um

1790
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,880
and furthermore i guess we don't need

1791
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:21,679
this angle

1792
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,199
anymore then right so we could just say

1793
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,079
like okay

1794
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:26,238
you know

1795
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:27,519
you know produce it directly

1796
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:29,839
like that

1797
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:33,679
uh and then we have like an arm one

1798
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:35,039
or an arm the zero arm point and uh the

1799
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,560
one arm point

1800
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,079
and of course a little confusing because

1801
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,840
this is arm two which just means it's an

1802
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:42,238
arm v2 but you know all right

1803
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,520
nomenclature's never perfect

1804
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:45,599
uh and so all we're going to do here is

1805
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,080
say like look give us the two points the

1806
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,880
next one and the uh the one we're on and

1807
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:53,519
we're going to connect them and if we

1808
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,440
look at what we do here we can just draw

1809
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,440
all three rings with the same values

1810
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,119
because the x and y for the sine and

1811
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,960
cosine are the same no matter which ring

1812
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:04,119
we're drawing it doesn't matter you know

1813
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,119
what i'm saying

1814
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,159
uh yes there is plenty of noise uh you

1815
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:17,599
can thank obs is crappy everything for

1816
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:18,479
that

1817
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,320
um

1818
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:21,599
anyway

1819
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:24,319
uh if we

1820
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:26,480
go ahead and now produce the points for

1821
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:30,238
the different rings we know that we've

1822
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:31,839
got radial values that have been stuffed

1823
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,519
so like if you look at the sphere code

1824
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,760
when we push it

1825
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,239
you can see that like p0 and p1 are the

1826
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,440
two values so we we have like a center

1827
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:43,359
value

1828
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:45,919
um and that's this the entry p0 and we

1829
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:48,319
have a radius value and that's the entry

1830
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,920
p1 so we we have like the two pieces of

1831
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:52,158
information

1832
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,880
that we need to produce the sphere

1833
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:58,879
and so when we push this on we can

1834
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:01,279
produce the values for all the different

1835
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,319
rings uh

1836
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:03,519
by

1837
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,119
looking at

1838
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,400
these

1839
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:07,359
values

1840
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:10,158
and

1841
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:13,439
i guess the sphere

1842
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:13,439
technically this radius

1843
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,679
i guess we don't ever allow it to be

1844
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,840
specified as ellipsoidal so you can't

1845
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,199
actually specify different

1846
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,800
ones like it's not actually letting you

1847
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:24,319
do that here but we can support that

1848
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,600
here really easily there's no reason

1849
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:27,198
probably not to so i'm just going to go

1850
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,440
ahead and do that even though nobody

1851
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:31,678
asked us to

1852
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:31,678
um

1853
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:34,880
but

1854
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,039
um

1855
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:40,639
what we would like to do here is just

1856
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:43,359
say okay when we do a push line segments

1857
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:45,760
and we do these uh p zero p ones these

1858
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:48,719
are all just gonna be the center

1859
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,679
um plus the radius times the arm

1860
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:53,760
right

1861
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,760
uh they're all gonna look like this

1862
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,319
and so

1863
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,239
the only difference between which one

1864
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,198
we're drawing

1865
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:06,079
is

1866
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:08,839
what part of the radius value we

1867
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:12,559
actually multiply out

1868
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:15,119
so in in other words if you imagine this

1869
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,520
arm zero it's got an x and a y that are

1870
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:22,800
going around right

1871
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:25,120
and if we imagine a vec3 in here

1872
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,000
where we just say look there's a radius

1873
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:30,960
x value times an arm x value there's a

1874
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,920
radius y value times an arm y value and

1875
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,560
then

1876
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,000
there's just nothing for z

1877
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,440
right

1878
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,439
that's going to draw one ring of the

1879
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:43,279
sphere it's the ring

1880
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:45,919
that is in the like

1881
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:48,238
fl the plane of the world if you will so

1882
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,560
no height

1883
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:53,839
and if we just permute

1884
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:56,800
which values we're using

1885
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,800
uh for that purpose right so if we i'm

1886
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,440
just gonna align this a little bit to

1887
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,560
the extent that four coder will let me

1888
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:03,678
um

1889
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,440
and

1890
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:09,359
so you can see what i'm talking about

1891
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:12,638
in each case right we're just going to

1892
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:14,559
draw exactly this thing

1893
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:17,920
and we're just going to permute which

1894
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:20,320
one of those values we fill in

1895
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:23,840
and of course you may be wondering like

1896
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:25,840
how do i know whether it's arm x or arm

1897
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,920
y to multiply here and the answer is it

1898
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,880
doesn't matter at all

1899
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,679
right

1900
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,840
um

1901
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,719
because in this particular circumstance

1902
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,520
we're just drawing a ring anyway so if

1903
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:39,279
you draw drew the ring by using sine

1904
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,639
cosine or cosine sine it wouldn't

1905
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:41,679
actually matter

1906
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,000
right

1907
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,600
um so so i don't think we actually even

1908
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,639
care about that and we especially don't

1909
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,639
care about it uh because in this case

1910
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:52,319
our spheres always have the same radius

1911
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:54,000
value so it actually

1912
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:55,599
double doesn't matter

1913
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,439
because they're all going to be the same

1914
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,679
value anyway so the only thing that

1915
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:01,678
actually matters here is that we do the

1916
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,520
permutation right

1917
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,480
so we just need to do

1918
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,480
this permutation

1919
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:10,880
right

1920
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:12,559
but if we did want to

1921
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,560
keep our our

1922
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,360
winding proper

1923
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,480
then we would know that like okay x y

1924
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,839
winding

1925
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:24,238
x cross y is z so we know that this is

1926
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:26,239
going to go the right direction

1927
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:29,039
if we're in a plane

1928
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:31,839
uh where y is the normal to the plane so

1929
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,760
we're doing x z right

1930
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:36,480
if you imagine the three a right handed

1931
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,480
coordinate system where you have x

1932
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:39,279
excuse me

1933
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:41,439
x

1934
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:43,439
y and z uh

1935
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:45,759
right handed right

1936
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:47,839
so you have x plus y is z so you imagine

1937
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,079
like the screen having x and y and z

1938
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,880
would be coming out at you

1939
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:55,119
if you're doing x and z if you cross x

1940
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,639
and z it would actually be like

1941
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:57,920
negative y

1942
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,079
right it would actually be going the

1943
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,399
other way round

1944
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:05,600
so you can if you want to you could

1945
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:07,439
choose to like flip these right i mean i

1946
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,039
i don't know to what extent you would

1947
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,638
care but you know if you were actually

1948
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:13,840
trying to draw rings

1949
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,840
you could imagine drawing these

1950
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:17,679
you could you could imagine trying to

1951
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,199
get these correct if you wanted to i

1952
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,399
just don't know that it that it matters

1953
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,839
at all

1954
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,000
um

1955
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,400
in this particular case

1956
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,158
because who who cares which way around

1957
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:30,319
you're drawing it right i guess is what

1958
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:33,679
i'm trying to say but you could negate

1959
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:35,679
them so for example in this case uh if

1960
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,880
you wanted to you could have said all

1961
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:39,520
right we're going to draw it the other

1962
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,119
way around we want it to go you know you

1963
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,000
negate one of those

1964
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:43,198
um

1965
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,719
and you could choose which way you were

1966
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:46,479
negating it so like

1967
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:48,319
but i don't know i i'm just not

1968
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:49,839
motivated to do that because it does not

1969
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:51,439
matter which

1970
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,880
direction around we don't have to just

1971
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:55,359
go counterclockwise for any particular

1972
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:57,359
reason i don't think it would matter

1973
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:59,920
um

1974
01:25:57,359 --> 01:25:59,920
excuse me

1975
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,440
um so running this now you can see

1976
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,520
there's our spheres getting drawn that's

1977
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:09,839
every time it does a collision detection

1978
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,920
um on the sphere you can see it actually

1979
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:15,199
doing the check right

1980
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:17,440
and now you can also start to see why

1981
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:20,079
what i was saying originally um if you

1982
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:20,960
remember we made this thing

1983
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:22,559
right

1984
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,600
uh where we wanted to turn on the

1985
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:27,679
ability to single step through diagrams

1986
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,600
um you can see why because once you

1987
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:31,920
start actually drawing

1988
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,000
this stuff

1989
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,000
there's too much information getting

1990
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
splatted for you to actually see when we

1991
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,439
were only drawing

1992
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,639
just these

1993
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:42,960
squares

1994
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:45,119
they are non

1995
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,480
uh

1996
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:48,319
there's a few enough pieces of

1997
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:50,079
information that we could just see what

1998
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:51,679
it did and we didn't really have to to

1999
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:53,920
look but once you start looking at

2000
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:56,480
individual collision checks you can see

2001
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,520
that we draw too many things to actually

2002
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:59,359
know like

2003
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,880
is that sphere

2004
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:02,238
gonna be able to be placed on one of

2005
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,880
these corners

2006
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:10,839
i don't know because i can't even see

2007
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:10,840
uh the sphere being placed there right

2008
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:23,600
so that's why i think we're going to

2009
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:25,519
need to use

2010
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,800
we're going to have to implement this

2011
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,719
single step

2012
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,119
piece of things

2013
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:33,600
and the single step right

2014
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:37,760
will be what lets us see what's actually

2015
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:40,400
going on in in those um

2016
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,600
uh in those individual collision steps

2017
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:42,559
right

2018
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,239
um

2019
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,560
and you know without that i don't think

2020
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:47,919
we're gonna be able to figure it out

2021
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,000
that said

2022
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,119
uh even just from that piece of

2023
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,399
information

2024
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:54,319
i think

2025
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:56,079
it didn't look right

2026
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,840
so that there is that

2027
01:27:56,079 --> 01:28:00,639
um let's stop and see the the puss in

2028
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,079
the field real quick hello

2029
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,119
okay

2030
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:05,359
um

2031
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,359
so

2032
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:09,679
let me just show you the reason that i

2033
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,158
say that because i don't think like it

2034
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:15,760
wasn't reassuring what i saw there

2035
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:18,479
when we started so what i saw when we

2036
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,280
did this right and i went and i paused

2037
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:21,599
it

2038
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:22,880
well i didn't pause it i i took debug

2039
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,639
camera so i could kind of come in here

2040
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,840
and look

2041
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,119
so if you take a look at what's going on

2042
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,880
here right

2043
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,279
what i would expect what i would have

2044
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,840
expected to see at some point

2045
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:39,439
is i would have expected to see testing

2046
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:42,319
of like the sphere on like this corner

2047
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:44,799
but it obviously didn't do that because

2048
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:47,759
if you had placed the sphere on this

2049
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,440
corner you would have like a giant the

2050
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,119
sphere would come out like way further

2051
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:53,759
than that

2052
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:56,399
so i'm not really sure why i'm not

2053
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,119
seeing spheres further this way

2054
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:01,119
is something's up right

2055
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:04,479
because i

2056
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:07,760
like unless i'm misunderstanding or

2057
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:08,959
like i don't get when we draw spheres

2058
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,320
maybe

2059
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,920
um or something like that

2060
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:15,439
then my understanding of how this

2061
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,000
routine was supposed to be working when

2062
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:19,919
i wrote it which admittedly i never

2063
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,560
remember because i do this once a week

2064
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,800
at most but trying to recall what we

2065
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:27,039
were doing with this routine

2066
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,039
is each time through this voxel step

2067
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:31,519
this piece of code right here which is

2068
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:34,079
checking the corners of the voxel

2069
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,199
this collides at p

2070
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:38,000
right

2071
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:39,599
should be taking the entity and the test

2072
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,719
point

2073
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:46,639
and the test point is supposed to be the

2074
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:48,960
corners of the voxel that we drew

2075
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:48,960
right

2076
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,119
um so well

2077
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:56,880
so i guess the problem is we never take

2078
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,399
the steps so we only test them once the

2079
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,239
interior voxel when we go to update best

2080
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:03,599
how does update best

2081
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:05,519
determine it so okay so the problem is

2082
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,600
it's actually just failing the get

2083
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:11,520
closest point in box conservative

2084
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,520
right it's failing that check so it

2085
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,719
never actually places it never actually

2086
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:19,719
tests the corners of that voxel

2087
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,719
right

2088
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,399
so i think i'm seeing more clearly now

2089
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,359
what actually happens in this routine

2090
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:40,000
um

2091
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:40,000
and that's good

2092
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,320
so here's like the breakdown

2093
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,880
so the problem is

2094
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:50,319
and and you know this this makes sense

2095
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,319
right it's sort of what i said before

2096
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:53,920
but it's a little bit different now it's

2097
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:55,198
a little bit clearer

2098
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,800
so

2099
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:57,839
when we look

2100
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,960
we

2101
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,719
see these squares right so this yellow

2102
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,560
square here and this yellow square here

2103
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:06,800
the two furthest yellow squares that

2104
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,159
we've got

2105
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,760
those are actually never collision

2106
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,638
tested ever

2107
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:15,039
what's actually going on there is we're

2108
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:17,199
checking them to see if anywhere in that

2109
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:19,920
square would be a better location to

2110
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:21,678
place the entity than it already is

2111
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,760
and they fail

2112
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,119
that check why do they fail that check

2113
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,520
they failed that check because we are

2114
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:30,399
trying to move straight ahead in y and

2115
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,639
they are just x lateral motions so no

2116
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:34,479
matter how far you move it in x you will

2117
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:37,840
never get closer you'll only get further

2118
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:40,079
away so it doesn't bother to check those

2119
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,079
right

2120
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,119
currently

2121
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:47,439
similarly if we look at what happens

2122
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,079
here

2123
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:53,919
we're going to go and say all right

2124
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:57,039
this square up in the corner here

2125
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:59,840
um oh and by the way that yellow uh

2126
01:31:57,039 --> 01:31:59,840
so

2127
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:15,279
so that

2128
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,320
is

2129
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:21,319
confusing

2130
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:37,920
okay

2131
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:37,920
okay okay okay okay okay

2132
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,800
so i think there was something that i

2133
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,079
wasn't internalizing about how this

2134
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,719
works

2135
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:49,679
i was sort of taking a mental shortcut

2136
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:52,679
but that actually does

2137
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:52,679
okay

2138
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:59,198
so here's there actually is a problem

2139
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:02,000
that we were not discussing before

2140
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:04,638
and here's what it is

2141
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:08,000
red doesn't mean you can't place the

2142
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:11,119
player there red means you can't move

2143
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,880
directly through the current voxel to

2144
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:16,719
that voxel

2145
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:18,800
so the actual problem with this voxel is

2146
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,679
not that you couldn't place the player

2147
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,279
there

2148
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,440
and that i think is where the

2149
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:28,479
disconnect's coming from you probably

2150
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:30,638
can player entity you probably can't

2151
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:33,519
uh

2152
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:35,760
you can't place the entity into that

2153
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:40,000
cell

2154
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:41,920
only because the rule is you had to have

2155
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,279
been able to move through the corner to

2156
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:47,039
get there because that's the only way to

2157
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,039
get there from where we start

2158
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:51,359
what that means is that even though you

2159
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:53,439
easily could have moved into this voxel

2160
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,119
and then into this voxel and then placed

2161
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:57,839
the player there

2162
01:33:55,119 --> 01:34:00,639
we will never try that because since

2163
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:03,119
this voxel is marked as red due to this

2164
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:04,480
corner being colliding we'd never know

2165
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:05,920
that you could have placed the entity in

2166
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:07,919
here just fine

2167
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,319
so the visualization is telling us which

2168
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,719
squares we were allowed to move to

2169
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:14,960
um and really that's more of the problem

2170
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,000
we never tested putting the player in

2171
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,119
here

2172
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,639
and that's

2173
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:20,639
the important part right

2174
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,679
so

2175
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:52,159
i'm not sure what that means for our

2176
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,159
future

2177
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:57,119
but i do think it means we have to

2178
01:34:54,079 --> 01:35:00,118
revisit the way this

2179
01:34:57,118 --> 01:35:00,118
works

2180
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,679
yeah

2181
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,079
so

2182
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:42,000
how much time have i got because i'm not

2183
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:45,359
sure what i want to do there so i know

2184
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,679
exactly what the problem is now

2185
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:47,679
um

2186
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:54,319
i guess in this case i think we should

2187
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,319
probably

2188
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,679
do more of a flood fill search so you

2189
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:01,039
know like on the witness collision

2190
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,840
detector

2191
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:03,679
um

2192
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,560
you know i did more of a flood fill

2193
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:07,118
search

2194
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,199
basically you create a grid and then you

2195
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:10,719
walk through that grid remembering which

2196
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:13,279
ones you checked and which ones are

2197
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:13,279
connected

2198
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:19,079
i think we should just do that

2199
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:19,079
um

2200
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,840
uh i like i think we're just gonna have

2201
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,079
to do that

2202
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,079
uh

2203
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:36,480
so let's just do that uh because i like

2204
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,400
looking at that it seems pretty clear to

2205
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,599
me that that's what you actually want i

2206
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:40,879
don't know if i should start that now

2207
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,079
like like i don't know how much time

2208
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,760
i've got i started at like what 11 30.

2209
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:47,118
so i don't have much time left so maybe

2210
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,280
we'll just call it there so it's like

2211
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:51,519
next weekend that's what we're gonna do

2212
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,198
we'll create a grid

2213
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,080
and then we will literally just walk the

2214
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:55,759
grid

2215
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:57,279
using the rules remembering which ones

2216
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,600
we go to

2217
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:03,238
uh i think that's what we want

2218
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,239
so we're just gonna do it

2219
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,440
all right so any questions uh because

2220
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:14,880
i'll take q a now

2221
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:16,799
um and then we'll move on

2222
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:19,039
what are those what's that little

2223
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:22,159
what's that little like

2224
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:25,158
ghost ghost moves out from behind a

2225
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:25,158
triangle

2226
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,719
oh uh

2227
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,239
i just i need to go update the schedule

2228
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:47,840
it's the schedule thing that posts it

2229
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:51,039
not me and i think i just haven't

2230
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:53,199
updated the schedule recently

2231
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:56,079
i can update the schedule

2232
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:56,079
for next weekend

2233
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,960
instead of switching between o2 and od

2234
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:06,960
manually why not a different hotkey to

2235
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,679
build release versus debug

2236
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,800
laziness is really the answer

2237
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:13,600
um

2238
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,600
separately i guess what i would say

2239
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,600
um

2240
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:23,279
the way i usually do projects now is

2241
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:25,039
more like they're done in

2242
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:28,399
like if you look at a more recent like

2243
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:28,399
github of mine

2244
01:38:29,198 --> 01:38:32,559
uh like if you look at ref term or

2245
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:35,280
something the way i normally do things

2246
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:37,520
now is i just build multiple things in

2247
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:38,639
the bat so so this is an example of how

2248
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,199
i do things

2249
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:43,679
mostly nowadays right

2250
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:46,238
so i just do a cl

2251
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,480
with the debug flags and then i do a cl

2252
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:50,959
with the o2 flags and i just build them

2253
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:53,198
both so that i always have both

2254
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:55,198
that's actually what i do now

2255
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:56,879
um and i should probably do that for

2256
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:59,839
handmade here i just haven't gone in and

2257
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,960
updated its bat file to be like

2258
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,760
fancier

2259
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:05,520
and then i just put in two of them so i

2260
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:08,320
just have like this one be debug and

2261
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,920
then i use the little plus in remedy to

2262
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:11,679
just have it and then i just i just do

2263
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,960
that right i just switch which one i'm

2264
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:14,158
doing

2265
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,480
um

2266
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:19,479
that's what i do nowadays and it is

2267
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,479
better

2268
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:33,039
on day five six five you said that the

2269
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,639
multi-threading coding handmade hero was

2270
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:36,719
crappy and that you learned much more

2271
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,840
about it since then but what exactly is

2272
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:42,399
bad in that code

2273
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:44,480
um so i wouldn't necessarily say that

2274
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:47,599
the multi-threading code in handmade

2275
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:50,079
hero is crappy or not crappy uh

2276
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:53,840
because you know honestly i just haven't

2277
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:56,238
looked at it very carefully since then

2278
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,159
i would say is i almost certainly would

2279
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:00,158
whatever it is i do most things

2280
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:01,759
differently multi-threading wise now

2281
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:04,158
than i did when i when i did the

2282
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:06,159
multithreading code in handmade hero

2283
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:07,519
so i couldn't say exactly what would be

2284
01:40:06,158 --> 01:40:08,399
different but i would probably be

2285
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,679
different

2286
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,719
right

2287
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,719
that's that's all i can say

2288
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:20,399
can you explain what a discriminated

2289
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:22,799
union is sure a discriminated union

2290
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:25,599
is when you take a piece

2291
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:29,119
uh like a block of memory

2292
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:31,199
and you're going to use a fixed size

2293
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:33,599
effectively well

2294
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,519
let me be more specific a discriminated

2295
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,639
union can mean different things

2296
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,920
depending on what language you're

2297
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:39,600
talking about

2298
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,158
the theoretical definition of a

2299
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,920
discriminated union is just you have

2300
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:44,879
something

2301
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,679
like

2302
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,679
uh

2303
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,520
any kind of entity an object in an

2304
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:52,158
object-oriented programming language or

2305
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:55,199
struct in in your procedural or block of

2306
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,079
memory or whatever or just a conceptual

2307
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:58,879
thing

2308
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:01,519
in theory whatever it is

2309
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:02,880
and what you're going to do is say that

2310
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,520
thing

2311
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,118
can actually have any one of a number of

2312
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,239
types

2313
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:13,359
and the type is going to be indicated by

2314
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:15,279
a field stored in that type so it's got

2315
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:16,319
like a tag on it

2316
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:18,880
right

2317
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:20,158
and so the example uh in the diagram

2318
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,440
system

2319
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:23,039
that we just did

2320
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:23,919
is a pretty straightforward example of

2321
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:25,439
this

2322
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:29,359
it basically says

2323
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:30,839
here is a a thing right so you have this

2324
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:34,079
diagram

2325
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:36,319
entry and you can see that the diagram

2326
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:38,800
entry could mean many different things

2327
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:41,198
one of these entries can refer to

2328
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,239
a begin and end a color a thickness a

2329
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:44,479
text

2330
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:47,198
entry a stick instruction to stick the

2331
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:50,399
thing spheres lines boxes points or

2332
01:41:47,198 --> 01:41:53,279
overlays all of those things

2333
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:55,839
can be represented by this one structure

2334
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:59,039
and the difference is whether or not we

2335
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:01,279
set the type to one of these things

2336
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,960
so a discriminated union is basically a

2337
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:05,039
way of saying we are going to represent

2338
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:06,800
many things in one place hence the union

2339
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:09,519
part

2340
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,199
and we are going to discriminate like

2341
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,280
the discrimination between which one

2342
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:15,919
they are like the thing that tells you

2343
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:18,158
the indicator an indicated union might

2344
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,760
be a better term for it because

2345
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:23,118
it's it's less about discriminating

2346
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:25,280
between two things as it is a flag a

2347
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:26,719
signal that tells you which one it is so

2348
01:42:25,279 --> 01:42:30,000
maybe you could call it an indicated

2349
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:31,439
union the indicator is a field inside

2350
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,679
the type itself that says it's this

2351
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:35,919
thing

2352
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,920
right

2353
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:41,198
um yeah and tagged union

2354
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:43,279
is a good name for it too right

2355
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:45,279
now there's like a bunch of stuff like

2356
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:47,679
if you go read like category theory

2357
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:49,840
which i wouldn't recommend but you know

2358
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,440
some people like that kind of thing

2359
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:54,079
uh

2360
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:55,198
it's a theoretical thing as well

2361
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:57,679
so like

2362
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:59,279
there's there's theoretical

2363
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:01,118
discriminated union

2364
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:02,639
and you know in the theory realm what

2365
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:04,158
they try to try to what they would be

2366
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:05,760
doing with it like we're solving a very

2367
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:08,238
practical problem with it right like we

2368
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,600
just want to have this uniform piece of

2369
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:12,000
code that deals with all these different

2370
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,520
entries and then only once in a while do

2371
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,319
we want to actually

2372
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,840
discriminate right between the unions

2373
01:43:16,319 --> 01:43:19,118
and we use the type field for that but a

2374
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,800
lot of the time we wanted to handle them

2375
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:22,799
as all being the same and that's what a

2376
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,480
discriminated union is for in practical

2377
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,600
purposes it's being able to deal with

2378
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:27,279
everything as being the same and then

2379
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,600
only once in a while do you actually

2380
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:31,279
differentiate between them

2381
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,119
in category theory they're going to be

2382
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:35,359
more interested in things like proving

2383
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:37,359
that a particular thing will will be

2384
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:39,439
true or not true

2385
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,519
you know based on if the type of the

2386
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,439
thing is a discriminated union you know

2387
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,600
like like what does that mean in terms

2388
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:47,519
of being able to like analyze

2389
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:51,880
the correctness of this piece of code or

2390
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,880
this idea or algorithm or whatever

2391
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,159
for someone just starting filming him

2392
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,840
here would you recommend against using

2393
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:20,960
direct sound

2394
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:22,319
um i

2395
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,600
i guess what i would say is if that's

2396
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:24,719
the kind of thing that you're worried

2397
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,719
about you're probably worried about the

2398
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,480
wrong things it doesn't matter what

2399
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:30,000
sound api you use you should look at

2400
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,919
sound apis as just something you can

2401
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,439
change out whenever you want

2402
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,520
so like you should never care what sound

2403
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:37,439
api you use use whatever sound api you

2404
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,520
want make sure it's isolated in the code

2405
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:41,198
like it is in handmade hero

2406
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,639
uh and then if for some reason you have

2407
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:44,238
a problem with it at some point you can

2408
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:47,359
swap it out for something else but you

2409
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:49,039
should never really work like

2410
01:44:47,359 --> 01:44:51,599
thinking about things like what graphics

2411
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:52,880
api or sound api or whatever to use it

2412
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,079
usually if you're thinking too much

2413
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,400
about that that's probably just a bad

2414
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:58,559
sign just do it doesn't matter

2415
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,158
the code you write should not care about

2416
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,880
that because i guarantee you it will

2417
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:04,719
change all the time right and that's

2418
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,118
kind of the problem it changes all the

2419
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:08,880
time like the whatever stupid sound api

2420
01:45:07,118 --> 01:45:10,719
microsoft craps out tomorrow is the one

2421
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,880
they're gonna tell you to use you can't

2422
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,800
actually base your decisions on that

2423
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,560
just assume that there'll be some new

2424
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,079
stupid crap api

2425
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,440
that you'll have to use on some platform

2426
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:20,639
for some reason

2427
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:22,399
so the important thing to think about

2428
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,239
with audio is just make sure all of your

2429
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:25,118
audio code doesn't care what api is

2430
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:27,198
using

2431
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:29,198
and that you minimize the amount of code

2432
01:45:27,198 --> 01:45:30,479
you actually write that relies on it and

2433
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:32,000
that's what we did in handmade hero like

2434
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:34,718
in handmade hero

2435
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:37,198
before we ship this thing

2436
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:39,118
if direct sound sucks too bad we just

2437
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:40,638
rip out that i mean what is it like 300

2438
01:45:39,118 --> 01:45:42,399
lines of code 200 lines it goes almost

2439
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:43,760
nothing we just rip that out replace it

2440
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:44,638
with a different api and that's what you

2441
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,079
want

2442
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,118
right

2443
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:48,800
um

2444
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:50,479
so

2445
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,360
so so that's the most important thing to

2446
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:53,439
think about when you're thinking about

2447
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:54,799
sound apis is don't think about sound

2448
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:56,638
apis

2449
01:45:54,800 --> 01:46:00,320
assume they will change

2450
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:00,319
and definitely don't care

2451
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,399
does the order in which entities move

2452
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,719
change result of your collision section

2453
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:14,399
yes so this is not a simultaneous move

2454
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:15,359
collision detector

2455
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:16,799
um

2456
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:19,279
there are

2457
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,520
so there's different ways that you can

2458
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,238
do collision detection

2459
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,000
uh

2460
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:26,158
and some of them are try to do

2461
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
simultaneous move

2462
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:29,839
and what that means is that you try to

2463
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,920
move entities

2464
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,119
at the same time to see if they would

2465
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,679
overlap

2466
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:37,839
during the movement right

2467
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:40,000
uh we're not doing that and we don't

2468
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:42,159
have any really need for that there if

2469
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,439
you're doing like things with physics

2470
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:46,238
that are

2471
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:48,479
you may have issues with that right

2472
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:48,479
um

2473
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:55,559
but i think we'll probably try to avoid

2474
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:55,559
needing that

2475
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,800
uh do you think the cause of i am gooey

2476
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:19,039
is applicable the same way in 3d user

2477
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,880
interfaces uh yeah so just be clear

2478
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:22,479
about imgui when i

2479
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,639
invented that

2480
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:26,000
that was the actual reason

2481
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,239
believe it or not

2482
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,679
the reason for i that i originally did i

2483
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:33,599
am gooey was because i noticed i mean

2484
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:36,480
this is the reason i was working on the

2485
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:38,079
editor the viewer for granny back in the

2486
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:39,759
old days was the character animation

2487
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,198
viewer

2488
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,760
and

2489
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:46,158
i wanted a way to unify all of the ways

2490
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:49,199
in which you interacted with stuff

2491
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:51,679
in that thing so actually that is what

2492
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,599
iamguy is actually most designed for is

2493
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:55,359
the ability to not care

2494
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,320
what kind of thing

2495
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:57,198
you

2496
01:47:56,319 --> 01:48:00,719
are

2497
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,719
interacting with right

2498
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,840
you invented i'm yes i invented i am gui

2499
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:12,559
i am the person who me

2500
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:15,359
i i literally am the person who made the

2501
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:18,400
term i am gui

2502
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:19,118
nobody had ever said that until i said

2503
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:20,638
it

2504
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:21,960
in an email

2505
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,159
um in like

2506
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:27,399
2001 or something i don't even remember

2507
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:27,399
what it was

2508
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:44,238
mike acton recommends sometimes doing

2509
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,679
deliberate practice for programming as

2510
01:48:44,238 --> 01:48:47,118
opposed to working on projects have you

2511
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:47,920
done this yourself and do you recommend

2512
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:48,719
it

2513
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:52,239
um

2514
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:54,319
i guess i would say i

2515
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:57,439
i don't think that i would necessarily

2516
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:59,519
agree with the phrasing

2517
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:01,439
um

2518
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,320
i think like in terms of like

2519
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:07,279
conceptually i agree and would give the

2520
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:09,198
same advice as mike acton gives but i

2521
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:11,118
wouldn't necessarily give it the same

2522
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:12,839
way that he gives it because i don't i

2523
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:15,279
think it puts a little bit too much of a

2524
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:16,560
delineation between what is practice and

2525
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:18,238
what is not

2526
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:21,520
um

2527
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:23,839
to me the way i would phrase it is

2528
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,360
you should often take time to try

2529
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,719
something new

2530
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:28,399
right

2531
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:29,279
that that to me is the important part

2532
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:31,679
right

2533
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:33,118
so one way of doing that

2534
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,639
is to

2535
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:36,079
actually

2536
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,920
uh

2537
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:41,198
to

2538
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,199
demand that

2539
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:44,639
you are literally going to go off to a

2540
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,800
fresh

2541
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:47,599
code base with nothing in it

2542
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:51,119
and

2543
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,639
do some practice at something right

2544
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:54,639
and i think that's what mike acting is

2545
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:57,840
saying like like you know go literally

2546
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:57,840
do fresh practice

2547
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:03,198
the amount of times that i'd literally

2548
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:05,198
do that are actually very few

2549
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:06,638
the more important thing to me is that

2550
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:09,439
you

2551
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:11,520
you always try new things when you think

2552
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:13,118
of them or you forced yourself to like

2553
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:16,480
say how could i do this differently and

2554
01:50:13,118 --> 01:50:17,759
try it that's the important part of it

2555
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:20,319
and

2556
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,719
a structured practice session is a way

2557
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:24,559
to force yourself to do that if you

2558
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:26,399
don't normally do that in your own code

2559
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,679
bases all the time but i normally do

2560
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:28,799
that all the time

2561
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:30,000
right

2562
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,239
um

2563
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,079
so i don't i think it depends on what

2564
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:37,079
kind of programmer you are right

2565
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:45,920
wait wikipedia credits me

2566
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,679
for that

2567
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:51,800
that's like the first time wikipedia has

2568
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,800
ever been accurate about something

2569
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,840
wow

2570
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,039
all right um

2571
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,440
i didn't know that that was the case

2572
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:21,840
but uh hey thanks wikipedia for the

2573
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:21,840
credit i appreciate it

2574
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:36,560
were there i am doing interfaces before

2575
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:39,118
you coined the term or was the idea and

2576
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:42,080
term completely original um

2577
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:44,799
so i had never seen anything that did

2578
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:45,840
that at the time

2579
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,880
uh

2580
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:50,960
but i don't know i think it would be

2581
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:54,000
very hard to determine if anyone had

2582
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:56,000
ever done it my suspicion would be that

2583
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,158
people had either intentionally or

2584
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,039
accidentally done something similar

2585
01:51:58,158 --> 01:52:03,198
in the past and had never thought to

2586
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:05,840
actually like

2587
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:09,759
like i would have to imagine that at

2588
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:11,599
some point somebody accidentally did it

2589
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,800
because it's pretty easy to accidentally

2590
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:14,840
do

2591
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,560
right

2592
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:17,440
um so

2593
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:21,480
i'm

2594
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:21,479
guessing that's

2595
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:31,479
i i'm guessing that someone probably did

2596
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,480
and we just don't know

2597
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:55,678
uh no i wouldn't coin a different term i

2598
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,279
think immediate mode gui is exactly the

2599
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:59,840
right term

2600
01:52:57,279 --> 01:52:59,840
um

2601
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:15,598
did you also coin jiu-jitsu

2602
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:18,000
no

2603
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:20,239
gjk is the initials of the people who

2604
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,880
who invented it how could i have coined

2605
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:22,879
gjk

2606
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:28,399
it would be like

2607
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:31,599
like mgjk if i had invented it right it

2608
01:53:28,399 --> 01:53:32,960
would have a miratory in there gjk is is

2609
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,719
literally named after the p you don't

2610
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:38,639
have to wonder

2611
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:41,118
um it is literally named at

2612
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:43,279
what

2613
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:49,238
there we go um it's literally the

2614
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:49,238
initials of the people who invented it

2615
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:12,559
yes yes i definitely

2616
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:16,000
did you coin javascript yeah

2617
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,000
definitely yeah yeah

2618
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,560
yeah i don't have a wikipedia page but i

2619
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,839
mean you know

2620
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,639
uh

2621
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,039
i

2622
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:42,800
think that probably makes sense because

2623
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:44,719
in order to have a wikipedia page you

2624
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:45,520
have to have

2625
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:48,840
um

2626
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:51,360
public materials that can be

2627
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:53,760
referenced like that are historically

2628
01:54:51,359 --> 01:54:55,439
about you probably like like if you want

2629
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:58,480
to have a wikipedia page you have to

2630
01:54:55,439 --> 01:55:00,158
give like interviews and stuff right

2631
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:02,158
um

2632
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:04,559
so because they have to be able to cite

2633
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:07,039
things like like wikipedia can't just be

2634
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:09,599
like let me go like to this guy's blog

2635
01:55:07,039 --> 01:55:11,359
and like copy the crap in right

2636
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:13,039
like they have to be like third-party

2637
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:14,639
sources where it's like oh with this

2638
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:16,960
interview with casey or whatever he said

2639
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:16,960
blah

2640
01:55:17,039 --> 01:55:20,238
so i think you need to prob you have to

2641
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,158
be more of a public persona than i am

2642
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:23,839
like you have to go out and like create

2643
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:26,158
news about yourself if you want a

2644
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:30,319
wikipedia page and i so you i don't

2645
01:55:26,158 --> 01:55:30,319
think it's wikipedia's responsibility to

2646
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:34,159
uh change their rules

2647
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:35,279
you know what i mean

2648
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:36,719
you know someone may have made a

2649
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:37,840
wikipedia page for me at some point but

2650
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:40,560
it would get removed because it'd be

2651
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:43,279
like there's no ref like there's no

2652
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,719
references here right

2653
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:47,840
um

2654
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:49,439
and so i i think like that's really

2655
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,319
more important

2656
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:51,839
right

2657
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:54,079
uh so you do you want to do like

2658
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:56,159
interviews with journalists

2659
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:57,439
whatever that means these days

2660
01:55:56,158 --> 01:56:00,079
um

2661
01:55:57,439 --> 01:56:03,279
and and you know put more like

2662
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:05,439
third-party write-ups about you is what

2663
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:07,439
you're looking for there because i would

2664
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:10,399
imagine that you could do wikipedia

2665
01:56:07,439 --> 01:56:12,719
searches for people who are

2666
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:15,598
like extremely important

2667
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:16,719
let me just see here

2668
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,960
i

2669
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:20,960
and like it's probably pretty tough

2670
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,279
right so like

2671
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:25,279
you know

2672
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:28,399
i mean i guess this managed to have a

2673
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:30,719
wikipedia page but like

2674
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:32,879
it's pretty brief right and it's got

2675
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:34,239
some citations to actual like news

2676
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:35,599
articles

2677
01:56:34,238 --> 01:56:37,439
right

2678
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:38,719
um

2679
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:40,719
so you know

2680
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:42,158
i don't i don't know

2681
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:44,560
i don't know how many people actually

2682
01:56:42,158 --> 01:56:46,000
have these pages

2683
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:47,760
so

2684
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,279
in in terms of so i don't know all right

2685
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,280
that one's kind of like maybe

2686
01:56:49,279 --> 01:56:52,800
questionable right not much

2687
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:54,000
citation there

2688
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,000
so i don't know

2689
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,198
um

2690
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,719
i have no idea

2691
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:00,719
maybe there should be a wikipedia page

2692
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:02,560
but my point is just that like in

2693
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:05,118
general it's pretty hard to make a

2694
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,880
wikipedia page for somebody

2695
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:08,839
who doesn't do a lot of interviews with

2696
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:12,359
stuff

2697
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:14,960
right um because wikipedia is an

2698
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:18,000
encyclopedia it's not like a news source

2699
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:19,840
so it can't just like

2700
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,399
take your live streams or your youtube

2701
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:24,079
videos or your whatever and and say like

2702
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:25,679
well here's what it says on those

2703
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:27,479
because like one of the wikipedia things

2704
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:30,000
they try to do is not have

2705
01:57:27,479 --> 01:57:33,198
self-described stuff on the page so if

2706
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,279
the thing is coming just from you

2707
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:37,519
they tend not to use those like that's

2708
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,359
that's considered like poor referencing

2709
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:40,480
for wikipedia for better for worse i

2710
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:42,319
mean you could argue that nowadays that

2711
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:44,799
doesn't make any sense because most

2712
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:46,880
most of the things produced nowadays

2713
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:49,440
for informational purposes are produced

2714
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,118
by the person that's a major change in

2715
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:52,960
how information gets produced thanks to

2716
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:54,960
the internet and that's a good one so

2717
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:57,840
you could argue that wikipedia's

2718
01:57:54,960 --> 01:58:00,560
methodology is actually bad because

2719
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:02,639
why would we want third-party sources

2720
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,440
for something when we literally have

2721
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:06,480
like a complete record

2722
01:58:04,439 --> 01:58:09,198
right um

2723
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:10,718
of what happened from the actual people

2724
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:12,079
who were actually posting and you can

2725
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:13,840
literally see it all and you can just

2726
01:58:12,079 --> 01:58:16,319
say well here's what they said because

2727
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,520
they said it right there right

2728
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:18,960
um

2729
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,400
so one could argue that wikipedia is

2730
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,840
kind of at this point anachronistic and

2731
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:24,319
maybe wikipedia is probably just not

2732
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,599
that relevant anymore that could be

2733
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:26,559
um

2734
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:27,920
but

2735
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,679
that's the way it is so when you're

2736
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:31,599
wondering why there isn't a wikipedia

2737
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:33,279
page about something

2738
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:34,960
oftentimes that can be a very valid

2739
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:37,679
reason they're just following their own

2740
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,118
rules which you know they made and

2741
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:42,440
you know that's what that's what the

2742
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:42,439
page is

2743
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:55,199
microsoft is setting fairly strict

2744
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,800
hardware requirements for windows 11.

2745
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:58,079
basically chips older than two years

2746
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:00,320
will not work do you think that is a

2747
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:02,158
good thing or a bad thing seems like it

2748
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:03,840
will lead to a lot of waste of perfectly

2749
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:06,839
good hardware

2750
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,840
um

2751
01:59:21,118 --> 01:59:24,719
i don't know

2752
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:29,080
so let me say a couple things about that

2753
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:29,079
i don't have a strong opinion about it

2754
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:34,880
i guess what i would say is i would have

2755
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,880
to see what the requirements are which i

2756
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,679
haven't looked at

2757
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:41,520
and

2758
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,520
what they actually are designed to do

2759
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:45,679
right

2760
01:59:43,439 --> 01:59:47,439
so

2761
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:48,880
hardware requirements of the form we

2762
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:50,319
need a machine to be at least this

2763
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,400
powerful because otherwise i can't run

2764
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,639
windows 11 or garbage because windows 11

2765
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:57,679
is garbage as was windows 10 as was

2766
01:59:54,639 --> 02:00:00,159
windows 8 as was probably windows 7 and

2767
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:02,880
definitely windows vista

2768
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:04,479
so obviously all of every single version

2769
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:08,480
of windows including the latest one in

2770
02:00:04,479 --> 02:00:11,519
terms of actually hardware power wise

2771
02:00:08,479 --> 02:00:15,118
it's all garbage you could run the thing

2772
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:16,000
on a freaking you know pentium

2773
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:17,359
right

2774
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,359
if you actually

2775
02:00:17,359 --> 02:00:20,799
wrote it well

2776
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:22,639
so that's true

2777
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:24,800
but

2778
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:26,880
the windows kernel team has to make a

2779
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:29,279
kernel right

2780
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:31,760
and there are a lot of changes

2781
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:36,000
structural changes to processors that

2782
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:36,000
happen over that time period

2783
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:40,079
right

2784
02:00:38,158 --> 02:00:42,638
and so

2785
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:45,279
if the requirements are there because

2786
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:47,760
the windows kernel team was like look

2787
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:50,479
if we want to be able to do like high

2788
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:53,119
performance stuff here that doesn't have

2789
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:56,718
a bunch of weird like side cases for

2790
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:57,598
preventing spectre and meltdown problems

2791
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:00,000
and

2792
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:02,079
doesn't have a lot of weird side cases

2793
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,479
for like how do we deal with the fact

2794
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:06,399
that this thing only had one thread so

2795
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:09,759
it couldn't do multiple blah or whatever

2796
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:11,519
all that stuff is right

2797
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:13,760
if the requirements come

2798
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:16,960
more from the windows kernel team about

2799
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:18,960
features that are on a chip

2800
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:20,840
that i would be more

2801
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:25,158
okay with

2802
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:25,159
right um

2803
02:01:48,399 --> 02:01:54,158
a trusted platform module requirements

2804
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:57,118
are are ridiculous

2805
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:59,118
it any any trusted platform module is

2806
02:01:57,118 --> 02:02:00,960
just another way of saying i would like

2807
02:01:59,118 --> 02:02:03,598
this machine to be hacked trusted

2808
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,480
platform modules are should never have

2809
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:07,679
happened

2810
02:02:04,479 --> 02:02:10,479
ever they're they were are a absolutely

2811
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:12,000
ridiculously stupid idea i said that at

2812
02:02:10,479 --> 02:02:15,198
the time

2813
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:18,198
trusted platform modules are absolutely

2814
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:18,198
ridiculous

2815
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:27,760
i don't even think trusted platform

2816
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:30,719
modules should should exist

2817
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:33,440
the only use case i can ever see

2818
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:37,279
for trusted platform modules

2819
02:02:33,439 --> 02:02:40,158
is for unscrupulous large corporations

2820
02:02:37,279 --> 02:02:42,238
which is exactly what microsoft is

2821
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:43,519
using them to prevent you from doing

2822
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:45,118
things with the computer that they don't

2823
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:47,520
want you to do i

2824
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:51,238
not think of a single other use for a

2825
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:51,239
trusted platform module

2826
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,679
i like i literally have no idea what any

2827
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:05,359
other thing that a trusted platform

2828
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,118
module would do i have no i i can't

2829
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:08,639
think of a single other use case you

2830
02:03:07,118 --> 02:03:10,399
certainly can't use it to store

2831
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,840
important data because people already

2832
02:03:10,399 --> 02:03:12,839
know how to hack trusted platform

2833
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,760
modules

2834
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:18,239
right and more importantly

2835
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:20,000
the trusted platform module is the last

2836
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:22,559
place you would ever store important

2837
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:25,198
information because any hacker

2838
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:27,280
immediately knows to target the trusted

2839
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:30,000
platform module right

2840
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:33,759
like or like a state actor right when

2841
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,158
the nsa or whoever else you know china

2842
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:38,320
or yeah blah blah blah whenever they're

2843
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:39,598
manufacturing this stuff

2844
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:41,359
of course they're going to put in

2845
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:43,520
something that lets you hack the trusted

2846
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:44,799
platform module it's like it's obvious

2847
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:47,760
right

2848
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:49,440
so any important target can't trust

2849
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:51,599
their trusted platform module it would

2850
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:54,479
be a stupid idea to trust it it's

2851
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:57,279
basically a big red bullseye that says

2852
02:03:54,479 --> 02:03:59,039
hey compromise this unit

2853
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:00,319
it's ridiculous of course no one would

2854
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:01,840
ever trust a trusted platform module

2855
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:04,078
they had any idea what they're doing

2856
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:04,078
right

2857
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:09,118
the only trusted platform module you

2858
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:11,840
could trust is one you literally made

2859
02:04:09,118 --> 02:04:11,839
yourself

2860
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:41,238
have i ever used a physics engine like

2861
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:41,238
havoc physics or bullets no i haven't

2862
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:09,520
same opinion for trusted modern yeah my

2863
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:12,319
my opinion on trust modules is that they

2864
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:14,639
don't actually provide any i don't know

2865
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:16,639
what they supposedly provide

2866
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:18,639
right

2867
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:21,639
i i literally don't know

2868
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:21,639
because

2869
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:26,000
what

2870
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:28,800
makes you think that you can trust the

2871
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,279
trusted platform module i i don't know

2872
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,440
what there's nothing

2873
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:35,519
there's nothing inherently trustworthy

2874
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:37,039
about a trusted platform module it's

2875
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:38,800
just another piece of hardware that

2876
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:40,639
someone gave you that they claim you can

2877
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:43,440
store something on but why would you

2878
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:45,520
believe them right

2879
02:05:43,439 --> 02:05:47,678
they can have bugs in it that allow it

2880
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:49,040
to be bypassed they can have intentional

2881
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:50,319
back doors that they placed there so

2882
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:51,760
that they can or that someone else

2883
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:53,679
placed there so they can get information

2884
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:55,599
out of it

2885
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:57,039
it doesn't make any sense all you're

2886
02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:59,679
doing when you use a trusted platform

2887
02:05:57,039 --> 02:06:02,078
module is guaranteeing that the hacker

2888
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:03,679
knows where to get the stuff that you

2889
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:05,039
don't want them to get that's the only

2890
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:07,279
thing that a trusted platform module

2891
02:06:05,039 --> 02:06:08,719
does

2892
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:09,759
in terms of security that i can think

2893
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:12,760
about

2894
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:12,760
right

2895
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:47,039
all right i think it's about time to

2896
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:49,360
wrap it up

2897
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:50,960
hey do we have any here's a question

2898
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:54,479
sometimes we got people i don't know

2899
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,480
probably not what time is it

2900
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,840
so if i go to google and say

2901
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,719
no all right so we probably don't

2902
02:07:03,198 --> 02:07:06,559
i was wondering if we had any iranians

2903
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:08,319
watching

2904
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:09,440
sometimes we get people watching from

2905
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:10,559
from

2906
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:11,919
places

2907
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,760
around that region i don't know that

2908
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:14,719
i've ever actually had someone oh you

2909
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,639
know what i think i might have had

2910
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:19,599
someone write in who

2911
02:07:16,639 --> 02:07:19,599
who was from iran

2912
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:28,719
to switch working around well

2913
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,000
i mean a lot of people use stuff to

2914
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:32,880
bypass

2915
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,319
like you know

2916
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,239
it probably i don't know if twitch works

2917
02:07:34,319 --> 02:07:39,599
in china either but people

2918
02:07:36,238 --> 02:07:41,279
will buy will do bypassing right like

2919
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:43,840
um

2920
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:43,840
so i don't know

2921
02:07:45,039 --> 02:07:48,158
but i was gonna say like tonight i was

2922
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:49,759
gonna go

2923
02:07:48,158 --> 02:07:50,799
i was gonna go get

2924
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,199
some

2925
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,400
uh

2926
02:07:51,199 --> 02:07:55,519
[Music]

2927
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:57,519
some grilled meats at a place that does

2928
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:00,800
like really good

2929
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:03,679
uh persian style right

2930
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:05,119
uh grilled meats and i was wondering if

2931
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:08,880
anyone

2932
02:08:05,118 --> 02:08:10,799
who might be like more knowledgeable

2933
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:11,679
about like

2934
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,960
uh

2935
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:15,440
yes

2936
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:17,840
navid hg

2937
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:20,238
exactly

2938
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:22,000
exactly that is exactly what i'm talking

2939
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:24,238
about

2940
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,319
i wonder if anyone had any opinions it's

2941
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:28,319
one of my favorite dishes

2942
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:30,000
like i don't know

2943
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:30,960
um i guess

2944
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,198
like

2945
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,198
uh

2946
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:39,279
i guess technically like my ancestry

2947
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:41,360
would come from the mediterranean

2948
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:43,039
because they're all italian

2949
02:08:41,359 --> 02:08:45,519
and i believe they were sort of south

2950
02:08:43,039 --> 02:08:47,599
more southern italian

2951
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:49,599
um

2952
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,400
and i do tend to like mediterranean

2953
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:52,639
dishes

2954
02:08:50,399 --> 02:08:56,158
like everything from the mediterranean

2955
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:56,550
anywhere around i tend to like

2956
02:08:56,158 --> 02:08:57,679
um

2957
02:08:56,550 --> 02:09:00,639
[Music]

2958
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:03,520
and i pretty much like all

2959
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:04,800
mediterranean grilled meats

2960
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:07,679
uh

2961
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:09,920
and in there they're somewhat

2962
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:10,880
difficult to get

2963
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:12,800
right

2964
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:15,039
um in

2965
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,840
in this area in this area

2966
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:19,439
uh

2967
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:21,920
but there's

2968
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:24,158
two or three places that actually do it

2969
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:24,158
right

2970
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:28,238
um

2971
02:09:25,599 --> 02:09:30,239
and so you know like

2972
02:09:28,238 --> 02:09:31,439
i was just wondering you know i've

2973
02:09:30,238 --> 02:09:33,919
started to try and cook them like i do

2974
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:35,759
yogurt marinated chicken myself now

2975
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:38,639
um and i'm sort of getting i bought i

2976
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:41,039
bought i bought a thing of of saffron

2977
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:42,639
from the costco costco actually has like

2978
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:44,238
really high quality saffron that's not

2979
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,279
too expensive saffron is fantastic

2980
02:09:44,238 --> 02:09:47,279
expensive if you buy in the grocery

2981
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:48,639
store it's way too expensive way too

2982
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:50,158
expensive

2983
02:09:48,639 --> 02:09:52,319
um

2984
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:54,078
but

2985
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:56,399
you know you you can

2986
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:58,639
costco like all like everything costco

2987
02:09:56,399 --> 02:09:58,638

i'm getting better at the chicken

3006
02:10:42,399 --> 02:10:46,879
my main problem

3007
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:47,679
my main problem

3008
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,719
with

3009
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:50,000
uh

3010
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:51,279
doing the

3011
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,158
uh

3012
02:10:51,279 --> 02:10:55,519
with doing the grilled chicken though

3013
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:57,039
i think i've got the yogurt marinade

3014
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:59,119
down

3015
02:10:57,039 --> 02:11:00,238
um i think i've got the spicing pretty

3016
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:02,479
good

3017
02:11:00,238 --> 02:11:04,799
right like like i've got like the i do

3018
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:06,799
like the lemon saffron butter basting

3019
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,639
and all that stuff and it comes out

3020
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:11,199
really great

3021
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:12,239
the main problem i have with doing the

3022
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:14,000
chicken and what's the name of the

3023
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:15,919
chicken it's like

3024
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,238
juju or

3025
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:20,319
it's got a name the the the grilled

3026
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:22,000
skewer chicken

3027
02:11:20,319 --> 02:11:25,599
with butter based you know what i'm

3028
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:28,238
talking about juja yeah juju

3029
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:30,480
so the the juji kebab the main problem

3030
02:11:28,238 --> 02:11:33,598
that i have with it is i cannot figure

3031
02:11:30,479 --> 02:11:35,839
out how to get the doneness correct

3032
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:37,920
like

3033
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:39,279
the when you put it on a skewer you

3034
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:40,800
can't really it's really hard to like

3035
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:42,639
temperature probe

3036
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:45,679
so you kind of have to go by like some

3037
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:48,000
kind of like intuition or something

3038
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:48,000
um

3039
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:51,719
i

3040
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:57,519
and and that part is

3041
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:59,119
is tough i don't know how you do it

3042
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:00,719
virtue one so when you say touch like

3043
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:01,839
can you can you be more specific is that

3044
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:02,639
really true do you know how to make

3045
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:05,119
these

3046
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:08,800
it's a show i would like to know

3047
02:12:05,118 --> 02:12:08,799
how to know the doneness correctly

3048
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:16,480
if you want to get good middle east

3049
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:18,559

in lake city way okay

3057
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:53,719
is that the way you're talking about in

3058
02:12:50,319 --> 02:12:53,719
lake city way

3059
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:21,598
wow house made kebabs ready to cook

3060
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,840
that's great

3061
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:23,840
cool

3062
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,760
yeah all right so i hadn't thought of

3063
02:13:29,198 --> 02:13:33,439
touch maybe i'll try that um one thing

3064
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:36,560
that i messed up last time that i

3065
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:38,399
realized after the fact was that i so

3066
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:39,760
you marinate it you put it in like you

3067
02:13:38,399 --> 02:13:41,759
like when you marinate the chicken and

3068
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:43,039
yogurt you put it in like a bag

3069
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,960
right or something you have to put in

3070
02:13:43,039 --> 02:13:46,238
something

3071
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:48,078
and when i was letting it come up to

3072
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:49,439
room temperature i i actually had to

3073
02:13:48,078 --> 02:13:50,799
come to room temperature and then i put

3074
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:52,719
it on the skewers and i realized that

3075
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:54,159
was really stupid because i think like

3076
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:56,239
some of the chicken that was on the

3077
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:57,519
outside thawed more completely than some

3078
02:13:56,238 --> 02:13:58,718
of the chicken that was on the inside so

3079
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:02,239
then when i

3080
02:13:58,719 --> 02:14:03,439
uh flame you know when i when i uh grill

3081
02:14:02,238 --> 02:14:04,238
when i try

3082
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:06,559
uh

3083
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:08,959
grilled them

3084
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:11,280
some of the chicken i think didn't cook

3085
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:13,359
and others did so that was a big problem

3086
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:15,118
and so i can fix that one but i still

3087
02:14:13,359 --> 02:14:16,880
even after i fix that which i think you

3088
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:18,479
just you have to skewer them right from

3089
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:20,719
frozen and not from frozen right from

3090
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:22,319
refrigerator or you have to skewer them

3091
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:24,840
probably and then let them sit skewered

3092
02:14:22,319 --> 02:14:27,118
so they actually do uh it

3093
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,199
correctly um

3094
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:31,519
yeah i rotate the skewers manually i do

3095
02:14:29,198 --> 02:14:33,359
it just like i s so i saw like youtube

3096
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:34,239
videos of actual

3097
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:35,598
like

3098
02:14:34,238 --> 02:14:36,799
at least what appeared to be fairly

3099
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:40,000
hardcore

3100
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:41,599
uh persian meat folks doing their own

3101
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,279
grill

3102
02:14:41,599 --> 02:14:45,119
over the coals

3103
02:14:43,279 --> 02:14:47,759
uh and i try to do it like they do so i

3104
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:49,198
i hand rotate the skewers continuously

3105
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:50,800
and i swap them

3106
02:14:49,198 --> 02:14:52,719
their positions too to make sure that in

3107
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:54,960
case one part of the girl's a little

3108
02:14:52,719 --> 02:14:56,960
heavier whatever right so i do it and

3109
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,039
i've managed to get that pretty good but

3110
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:00,560
i think i've got some other problems

3111
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:01,599
however i think it fixed most problems

3112
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:03,440
the only one i wasn't sure is like how

3113
02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:05,840
do you know when the chicken is done by

3114
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:07,678
touch does sound like a pretty good idea

3115
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:09,039
um you know push on it a little bit see

3116
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:11,359
what the springiness so that's not a bad

3117
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:13,679
idea i wonder if that would work

3118
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:13,679
um

3119
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,560
that's that's a good idea

3120
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:45,679
i'm sorry to bring up all this good food

3121
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:46,960
and and i realize this isn't even a

3122
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:48,480
cooking channel

3123
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:52,960
yeah i'm i'm i'm

3124
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:52,959
i'm hungry too so sorry about that

3125
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:04,639
an infrared thermometer might not be a

3126
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:07,360
bad idea sir pinecone

3127
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:10,359
i i kind of agree with that

3128
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:10,359
um

3129
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:31,199
that's interesting hmm

3130
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:35,359
yeah you're right i guess i don't know

3131
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:37,280
that they always take the entire skewer

3132
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:38,479
off at once they might just take off

3133
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:40,800
some of it

3134
02:16:38,478 --> 02:16:42,239
yeah but again even if you did that so

3135
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:43,920
if you know

3136
02:16:42,239 --> 02:16:46,159
that you're going to take

3137
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,599
it off the skewer separately you that

3138
02:16:46,159 --> 02:16:49,679
makes it even more important to have a

3139
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:51,760
way of testing if it's done because then

3140
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:52,960
now you're saying i need to you know you

3141
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:54,000
need to be able to test it and say okay

3142
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:55,919
this part's done let's take it off the

3143
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,439
skewer right

3144
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:59,760
um

3145
02:16:57,439 --> 02:17:01,760
so that again is like a problem because

3146
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:02,880
like i don't really know how to do that

3147
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,960
test

3148
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:06,159
so i i guess i need to do is learn the

3149
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:08,879
touch

3150
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:10,718
right like learn what that touch is

3151
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:12,558
and then i could do it that that i never

3152
02:17:10,718 --> 02:17:15,119
thought about that

3153
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:17,679
um

3154
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:20,000
but yeah like like by touch or yeah in

3155
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:22,000
maybe learn what the infrared outside

3156
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,159
temperature would be when the inside's

3157
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,840
done just by testing and then remember

3158
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:30,478
that and then just go by that that that

3159
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:30,478
seems reasonable too i like that yeah

3160
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:37,200
yeah

3161
02:17:34,638 --> 02:17:39,119
yeah all right that's a good suggestion

3162
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:40,559
thanks folks

3163
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:42,559
thanks folks
