00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,639
hero show recode complete game live on

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,638
stream uh we did last weekend some

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,039
diagram collection code which basically

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,439
uh was designed to allow us to output

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,199
diagrams for debugging purposes it's not

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,800
ever meant to be something that

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,198
happens in the release version of the

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,519
game it's just for debugging purposes

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,400
and so we put uh some some collection

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,480
code that allows pieces of our

12
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,559
code that we want to

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,719
see visually like c augmented

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:35,439
information for

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,719
to dump those diagrams to a buffer

16
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,359
and what we need to do today is take

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,760
that buffer and display it on the screen

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,439
which you know it's not super hard but

19
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,719
remember we sort of have a very limited

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,679
rendering engine

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,719
uh in handmade here it's just only does

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,840
a very uh small amount of things it can

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,520
basically do

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
you know just the stuff that we expected

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
to have in the game and so we may have

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
to do more work you know it may be a

27
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,479
more complicated job than it would be if

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
you had

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,478
built a very complicated renderer that

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,799
did lots of things

31
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,079
uh so in order to do this we'll have to

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,439
see uh

33
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,438
you know specifically where we're at

34
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,879
oops that's the wrong directory all

35
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,639
right

36
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,959
i don't actually remember where we're

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,400
supposed to load this uh that looks like

38
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,759
the right place

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,759
okay uh so if we go in and take a look

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,400
you know the code's compiling and stuff

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,040
but it's not actually doing the drawing

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
right so in theory if handmade diagrams

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
is turned on which right now we have

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,359
forced it to be normally you know we

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,200
might turn it off or we might do

46
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,118
something like oh you know it's it's

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,200
only on if we set handmade internal

48
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,840
right to b1

49
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,840
something like that

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,239
uh

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,600
i mean i guess another way you could do

52
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,839
it is like if

53
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,679
uh not defined

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
you know

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
handmade

56
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,520
diagrams uh then handmade diagrams is

57
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
handmade internal so basically on

58
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,280
internal builds they're on by default

59
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,000
you know that kind of thing

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,680
so

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
assuming it's not turned off

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,560
what we do now is we create this there's

63
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,319
this thing called diagram group right

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,400
and what it does is it just like takes

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,399
and it fills up a buffer filled with uh

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
diagram

67
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,159
instructions

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,719
these are what the instructions look

69
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,199
like it's called diagram entry

70
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,199
uh and what we need to do now if we want

71
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,280
to see these on the screen is make some

72
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,679
way of actually drawing them

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,878
and we added a thing that was basically

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
like a filter because the code that you

75
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,719
know we actually are going to want to

76
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
diagram can sometimes get run you know

77
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,439
you know tens of thousands hundreds of

78
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,479
thousands depending on what we're trying

79
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,479
to diagram it may be code that runs way

80
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,399
too often per frame

81
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,119
and not only would we have a storage

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,800
issue if we did enough of them

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
but we would also face this problem of

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
the screen would just be like filled

85
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,598
with crap

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,878
that we don't want

87
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:01,119
so in addition to just being able to

88
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,799
record diagrams we also added the

89
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
ability to filter

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,760
what you are seeing

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,159
so that only diagrams that you actually

92
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,639
want will be drawn

93
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:15,519
and so what i thought we would do there

94
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,958
is it turned out uh let me launch remedy

95
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,400
here

96
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,920
let me also spell remedy correctly

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,000
uh so if we go ahead and run

98
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,000
handmade hero as it stands

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,519
uh what you can see is there's like

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
these you know there's these things i

101
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,480
can access with the f keys i'm hitting

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,158
the f keys right now

103
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,598
that are like little debug overlays

104
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,199
these are very common in games you see

105
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,039
them in basically every game there's you

106
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,039
know stuff like this

107
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:45,359
and if we look we had on f9 like i don't

108
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,280
remember exactly when we made this uh

109
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,599
but we made a thing that was like a time

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,919
step modifier in here and so what you

111
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:55,359
can see is like i can turn

112
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:59,280
the time step way down on the game for

113
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,720
looking like at things like the um

114
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
you can see like i can even turn it to

115
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,959
something where it doesn't get any times

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
at all but this way we can see like very

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,199
slow stuff right we did that um as

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,039
something

119
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,280
that we uh implemented a long time ago

120
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,878
so we can see you know stuff happening

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
in the collision detector you can see it

122
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,599
happening here uh

123
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
write stuff with the glove and all that

124
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
um and so

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
if we

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
just assume like okay we've got this

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,839
little uh

128
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,879
we've got this

129
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,319
little i don't know what you call this

130
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,159
uh panel

131
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,839
we have this little panel

132
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,439
uh what we could do is just say instead

133
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,719
of collision recorder which doesn't

134
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,079
really make any sense because we didn't

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
actually implement a collision recorder

136
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,359
we just kind of said maybe we should

137
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,599
uh instead what we could do is just make

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,040
this like the diagram panel so f9 which

139
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,199
is what this was

140
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
is like the diagram panel and it can

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,600
step through any diagrams right so we

142
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,520
don't need it to step through just uh

143
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,360
collision because we can make it so it

144
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,879
can step through any diagram and that

145
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,439
way we can go through here and do

146
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,560
something where we basically like record

147
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,719
or something what's happening on a frame

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
uh and then you know

149
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
i don't know how we'll capture it

150
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
exactly uh maybe we could use the loop

151
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,359
live code editing which i think still

152
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,959
exists i don't know if it does or not

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,919
let me see

154
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,839
yeah

155
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,399
so we still have looped live codeing and

156
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,319
all that stuff so we can do stuff like

157
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,439
this where we then um

158
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,759
uh

159
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,519
well yeah the problem is that just

160
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,800
re-records all of memory so

161
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,478
uh yeah i mean we could try to opt out

162
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,160
our diagram system from it but that

163
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,599
sounds complicated so i don't know maybe

164
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,479
loop live code i think won't help us

165
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,840
here

166
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,000
because it's really it's for

167
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,079
specifically that which is you know

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,038
editing code while you loop something in

169
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,038
the game

170
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,038
um so i don't know if that would really

171
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,159
help us i honestly can't quite see how

172
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,560
it would

173
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
um but you know at some point we need to

174
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,839
figure out a way

175
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,000
where we would figure out what diagram

176
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,079
to use now we have picking

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,918
right because you know if you remember

178
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,359
um

179
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,000
like this system

180
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,600
where we would uh pick stuff on the

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,560
screen right we can uh pick various

182
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,479
pieces of i don't know stuff like you

183
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,759
can see me picking it here

184
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,560
uh

185
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,800
right like sprites and stuff

186
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,280
when we have access to that we should be

187
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,918
able to do things like pick the hero and

188
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,478
have it know which sprite that was

189
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,000
and record diagrams for that

190
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,959
you know what i'm saying

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,720
um

192
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,560
so we should be able to do a thing where

193
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,639
we just go like okay

194
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,918
use that same picking system

195
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,960
uh pick a particular you know something

196
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,599
here

197
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,399
and have it show the diagrams like

198
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,520
filter the diagrams just to that

199
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,839
entity

200
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,359
or whatever we picked right

201
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,918
so i feel like what we could do

202
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,000
hopefully is is do that pick and i don't

203
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,439
know does the pic include the glove i'm

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
not sure if it does or doesn't but i

205
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,598
think it does so you know if we

206
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,959
are if we the glove's an easy thing to

207
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,319
test collision on because it just kind

208
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,799
of floats around and we can control

209
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,759
where it goes so if i pick the glove

210
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,759
right like that

211
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,360
uh i'm assuming that since it showed up

212
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,560
there it means that both those entities

213
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,400
are understood right by the system

214
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,759
um i like that

215
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,198
bug with the lighting we've gone green

216
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,800
apparently

217
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,800
nobody knows why we just have

218
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,918
one of these days we gotta

219
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,000
finish the lighting move it to the gpu

220
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,240
or whatever we're gonna do with it

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
um

222
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,478
yeah

223
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,919
uh but anyway so you know first steps

224
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,918
first i'm just going to go in here and

225
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,918
try to make this thing work so that i

226
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,758
can pick somebody to diagram and then

227
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,680
see the diagrams and there's a pretty

228
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,560
easy way to do that right now you can

229
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,439
see we just have it hard coded

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,199
that we see all these collision boxes

231
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,038
right uh like around the glove you can

232
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,038
see him going i don't know why this guy

233
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,959
doesn't have any he might actually have

234
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,560
them yeah so they're just behind him

235
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,478
right you can see him there

236
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,720
so everybody's drawing those collision

237
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,839
boxes that's just like everything that

238
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,560
is moving

239
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,239
uh is having those collision boxes uh

240
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
drawn oh sorry not everything's moving

241
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,038
everything that's floating like these

242
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,720
don't need them because they're just

243
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,918
using the occupancy like square

244
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
occupancy so they're not collision

245
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,079
detecting

246
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,918
uh on a free motion

247
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,199
but anything like these guys who are

248
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,799
free moving um or the hero who is i'm

249
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,919
sorry or the hero's glove that's free

250
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,199
moving

251
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,519
all of those things are going through

252
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,680
the collision detector uh and so they

253
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,679
have those little boxes drawn so what i

254
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,838
would suggest we do today to try and get

255
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,479
started on this problem of having a good

256
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,240
way to draw these uh things i love what

257
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,600
i love the frame rate independence of

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,799
that uh or dependence of that right

259
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
why you don't use proportional

260
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,599
derivative controllers

261
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,359
uh in production code that are uncapped

262
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,519
right if you want to fix that quickly

263
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,039
you can just cap its velocity but

264
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,480
in general you can try to make things

265
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,599
that are more frame rate independent but

266
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,278
it's pretty great because it'll just do

267
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
that forever basically

268
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,600
until the frame rate gets high enough

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,240
right so anytime the frame rate is low

270
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
uh you're going to get that right

271
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
anyway

272
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,440
um so what we want to do is just figure

273
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,000
out a way to make these like just those

274
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,880
diagrams uh pop up through the diagram

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
system

276
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,720
and you know we'll assume that this

277
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,958
panel here allows to pick

278
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,720
you know what i'm saying that that's it

279
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,399
so we want something very simple like

280
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
that

281
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
and so the first thing i'm going to do

282
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,560
is i'm going to try to move

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,278
those diagrams

284
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,719
into the diagram system

285
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,000
exclusively

286
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,080
right

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,360
that's the first thing we're going to do

288
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,278
so if we go to

289
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,278
uh wherever that was

290
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,360
like so

291
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,838
we can see

292
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,560
in here

293
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,120
that we set the filter to this entity

294
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:14,479
uh so that will work for us

295
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,440
uh and then i guess

296
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
uh

297
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,480
you know i don't really remember where

298
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
we were drawing this i guess

299
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,799
so

300
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,799
here's one of them

301
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,350
it looks like we do it

302
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
in

303
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,920
[Music]

304
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,199
four places right

305
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,479
uh so once inside the refinement

306
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,320
uh

307
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,839
once inside the best update so once per

308
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
iteration there

309
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
and then twice inside

310
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,879
uh

311
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
you know

312
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,078
the the move entity call on startup

313
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,759
basically

314
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,039
that i think just shows us like where

315
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,000
you're

316
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,958
uh

317
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
starting

318
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,319
and going kind of a thing

319
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,879
okay so if we take a look at what goes

320
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,319
on here you can see that there's like

321
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,559
some diagram stuff happening

322
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
in terms of control logic

323
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,000
you can see it here as well

324
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
and so

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,399
i don't know exactly how we want to do

326
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,519
this but we probably want something

327
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,200
like this maybe where we do

328
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,120
a move entity

329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
uh you know at the top of this

330
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,480
um we do a diagram begin and then like

331
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,479
somewhere over here we do a diagram and

332
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,879
so that these are all enclosed

333
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,519
and then you know there's basically sub

334
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,159
diagrams so here's the refinement step

335
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,039
um here's whatever the collision voxel

336
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,958
step

337
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,799
right these are just various

338
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,599
things that we add

339
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,000
uh

340
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
and now what we would do is just change

341
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
those those push volume calls because

342
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,240
they're all now enclosed

343
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
into basically a diagram box

344
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
right

345
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,679
so they're going to look like that

346
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,039
we wouldn't need this anymore which is

347
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,559
great because we didn't really want that

348
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,719
there that we just did that so that we

349
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,359
could have some drawing

350
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,839
um and you can see us passing the box

351
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,959
there now we wanted to set these up with

352
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,760
colors

353
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,199
so

354
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,200
uh we want to do like

355
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,559
that

356
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,760
right

357
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,199
um

358
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,360
and we could make

359
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,560
a version of this that in fact we

360
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,519
probably should

361
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,078
as well

362
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,519
that just takes three parameters

363
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:47,838
you know what i'm saying

364
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,839
uh so there's one that would be like

365
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,040
because it's just a little bit easier to

366
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,439
type and this is just supposed to be a

367
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,838
simple system to use right

368
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,959
so if we went ahead and

369
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,959
just changed these into that

370
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,958
format

371
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
oops

372
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,120
i guess it was just that

373
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,719
if we went ahead and changed it into

374
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
that format

375
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,360
um

376
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,839
i

377
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,278
think that's everything

378
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,920
yeah

379
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,720
so we're just drawing two boxes there

380
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,919
and off we would go

381
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,200
when we come into this part of the

382
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,360
system

383
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,560
um there really isn't anything that's in

384
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,879
this function

385
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,278
so all the drawing that was done in this

386
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,600
part is done inside one of the functions

387
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,519
that that part calls

388
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,959
uh and the same is true for the bottom

389
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,799
here like nothing

390
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,958
yeah so that's really the only thing

391
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,919
that this was drawing

392
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,159
so

393
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,159
again this simplifies our code a bunch

394
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,679
which is what we kind of wanted to like

395
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,360
if you look here this kind of had to

396
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,159
keep passing

397
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,360
this render group around for no reason

398
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:06,719
uh which you know is just makes the code

399
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,120
uglier um and harder to read

400
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,959
so it's nice to get rid of that because

401
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,879
this way we have this sort of sideband

402
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,078
that compiles out that does everything

403
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,838
for you

404
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,519
which is the goal of debug code like you

405
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,279
don't want people to architect around

406
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,679
the debug code you want just kind of

407
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,360
happen automatically

408
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,159
off to the side

409
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,399
um so same thing here we can do

410
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:33,039
a oops sorry not debug diagram box so

411
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,198
diagram box

412
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,198
and you can see here that the diagram

413
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,799
color is set

414
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:43,879
based on this like colliding

415
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,879
thing um

416
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,159
which we can do

417
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,159
exactly the same way

418
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,799
that we were doing it

419
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,480
and so that takes care of that one now

420
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,159
will go to the diagram system instead of

421
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
to the render group which is what we

422
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,039
wanted

423
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,639
and then finally

424
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,799
uh there was

425
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,680
one other one over here somewhere wasn't

426
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,679
there um

427
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,959
there it is i'm like i know we had

428
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,679
another one because we looked at it

429
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,679
so if we take

430
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:19,120
and we

431
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:23,638
turn this one into a diagram box as well

432
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,639
uh then that should be the end of it

433
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,919
right

434
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
and now you can see here too why i kind

435
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,159
of want to do the system this way so you

436
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,159
can see that this code is keeping track

437
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,879
of a cell color

438
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,480
which is again just more architecting

439
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,278
around debug

440
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,278
which we don't want

441
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,639
so that's kind of why i did the system

442
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,799
this way

443
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,519
because it means instead of doing that

444
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,519
we can now do

445
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,320
this

446
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,360
you know

447
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,000
so basically we can just like push uh

448
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,079
the colors on there and they will be

449
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,320
remembered and so that way we can get

450
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,479
rid of that variable which again is us

451
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,879
architecting it's inserting code for the

452
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,480
diagram thing rather than just calls to

453
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,720
the diagram system

454
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,079
uh that you know so you don't have these

455
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,519
extra variables lying around that are

456
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,879
confusing about what they might be doing

457
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,720
like are they required for the actual

458
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,480
operation or are they just there to draw

459
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,959
the diagram now you can see that we've

460
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,680
eliminated just a diagram specific calls

461
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,879
which is more what i wanted

462
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,198
so if we compile this in theory uh we

463
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,198
should be fine

464
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,758
just get rid of some typos here but it

465
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,479
should produce a system

466
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,759
that puts all this stuff uh into the

467
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,839
correct place

468
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,800
for drawing later

469
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,639
um

470
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,119
just get rid of all of them

471
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,640
stuff that was passing that

472
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,078
move entity down

473
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
and i think

474
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,879
that's all good we do have a sort of

475
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,760
call

476
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,559
here that we added for convenience

477
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,558
if we want to

478
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,359
do this the simplest possible way

479
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,519
we just make this effectively you know

480
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,519
for all intents and purposes of macro

481
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,679
that really just calls this existing

482
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,440
color thing with the bundle of the color

483
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,519
so it's it's really just typing it

484
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,519
doesn't do anything different it's just

485
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,679
changing the syntax

486
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:41,038
that is allowed to be used on the

487
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,600
outside of the code

488
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,519
so now if we run this

489
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,439
and remove that break point

490
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,918
uh we should have a situation where we

491
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,279
no longer see any of those like debug

492
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,679
diagrams you can see that they're not

493
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,119
here anymore the glove used to like you

494
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,120
know show

495
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,639
these little squares moving around

496
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,719
behind it right

497
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,880
and it doesn't anymore so

498
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,720
that's exactly what we would expect it

499
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,160
to have happen in this particular

500
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,079
circumstance um and so you know yeah

501
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,240
exactly what we would expect is exactly

502
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,720
what happened so everything's good

503
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,720
and so now we need to do is

504
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,279
loft those out of there so have a way of

505
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,000
getting those diagrams onto the screen

506
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:24,160
and the first thing i guess we'll do is

507
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
we can um

508
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,519
ignore the panel part

509
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,880
for now because that's like the picking

510
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,918
thing and you know we haven't looked at

511
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,240
that code in a while so we're going to

512
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,240
page that in

513
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,519
ignore that part and we'll just cold set

514
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,798
it so what we'll do is we'll just like

515
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,079
go into

516
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,599
the

517
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,399
part of the code

518
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,558
where we start up the world or whatever

519
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,640
um and we'll just like set it to the

520
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,839
hero or set it to the glove of the hero

521
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,520
or something

522
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,918
um

523
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,038
right in the code so you know

524
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,559
we've got

525
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,960
a uh

526
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,200
an ad player call

527
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,079
it's gonna know which one is the hero

528
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,759
because in here you can see it uh doing

529
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:09,119
this ad entity

530
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,720
so what i can do is just force it

531
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,959
in the middle of

532
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,960
doing all of the you know initialization

533
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,640
for a player joining the game

534
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,160
i can force it to set the filter

535
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,038
to the glove's actual id value

536
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,200
right

537
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,599
so that will mean that now

538
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,840
the glove is in theory

539
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,079
having all of its stuff recorded because

540
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,359
the filter that we check which happens

541
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,439
in here

542
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,639
uh the filter that we check

543
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,519
will uh be for the glove which will

544
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
re-enable its diagram collection

545
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,480
now if i run the code again

546
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,399
again purely in theory

547
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,798
nothing will actually happen because

548
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,880
we're still not drawing these

549
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,119
what you can see however is this is this

550
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,880
is unfortunate and i guess i don't know

551
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,479
um

552
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,480
this has caused us a lot of problems and

553
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,960
i don't know what we want to do about it

554
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,360
so because this system pushes on a lot

555
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,840
of small allocations what you can see

556
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,319
here is we've again had this problem of

557
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,720
the debug bug system that just records

558
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,720
allocations so that we can draw them

559
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,400
is not really capable of handling this

560
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,038
very well you can see it totally

561
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,038
screwing up here again right

562
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,279
uh and so i don't know what to do about

563
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,079
that exactly i mean one way to do it is

564
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,678
you can skip it with a flag i suppose uh

565
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,158
but the other question here is like is

566
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,919
that just evidence that we've got uh an

567
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,240
issue happening here because you would

568
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,919
think that it would clear this out

569
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,759
frequently enough

570
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,640
that you wouldn't have this problem

571
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,640
right um

572
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,599
just splashed myself in the face

573
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
uh

574
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,759
so we're calling that diagram filter

575
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,579
call

576
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,279
right

577
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:09,759
[Music]

578
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,759
in here

579
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,038
aren't we

580
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,200
yeah

581
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,158
so we're calling that diagram filter

582
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
call

583
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,840
and so in theory you know the first time

584
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
through move entity that you encounter

585
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,720
the glove it should record all the

586
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
things and the next time through it

587
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,558
should filter right that's what should

588
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,000
happen

589
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,000
and

590
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,798
you know i assume when we diagram end

591
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,319
uh

592
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,918
i guess i don't know like when this

593
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,960
should get turned off

594
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,799
because

595
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,679
that's hard to say

596
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,440
but

597
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,159
it should only really have recorded the

598
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
stuff that happens inside here

599
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,000
which shouldn't be that many things i

600
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,679
mean it's a lot of things but it's not

601
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,359
that many it's like 10 000 or something

602
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,880
because remember that we're not doing

603
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,000
any spatial partition so it's really

604
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
it's literally going to record

605
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,279
all of that stuff

606
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,798
so i guess one way that i can

607
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,879
uh test this

608
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,000
is to just if zero this part out so

609
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,200
we're only drawing the things we're

610
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,119
drawing before and we're not going to

611
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,038
draw all of this

612
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,639
and just see what happens

613
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,480
um because we know it couldn't have been

614
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,159
that many because it was you know

615
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,038
feeding it to the rendering system just

616
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,799
fine

617
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,240
so without all that stuff happening

618
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,839
inside the

619
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720
shape collide which is the n squared

620
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,079
part so you know it should work

621
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
um okay

622
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,918
so yeah it looks like that's okay i

623
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
guess um

624
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,600
at least for the moment so we'll we'll

625
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,678
address that a little bit later anyway

626
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,519
so nothing happens which is what we

627
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,798
would expect because we're not actually

628
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:48,240
drawing them but we because we hit that

629
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,599
uh assertion in the debug system

630
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,759
we now know

631
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:53,519
that this is at least working right it

632
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,440
did turn on and is collecting things

633
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,119
because the debug system wouldn't have

634
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
had an overflow condition if we weren't

635
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,879
dumping a ton of diagrams to it so we

636
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,319
know that it did turn on which it you

637
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,159
know is what we

638
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,000
wanted it to do right

639
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
um and so

640
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,440
i guess from hmm so i'm trying to think

641
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,519
now

642
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,200
uh oh sorry i want to reconnect

643
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,319
something down here that just got

644
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,840
unplugged

645
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,798
uh anyway

646
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,119
so what we would like to do is now start

647
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,359
drawing those those diagrams to restore

648
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,879
the same one that we had before and you

649
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,359
know the re render diagrams call

650
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,480
i don't know where we put it exactly i

651
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,399
don't remember

652
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,240
um but i imagine we would put it at the

653
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,120
bottom of this uh call right somewhere

654
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,159
you can see we put in diagram reset

655
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,839
i don't know that we ever actually put

656
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,039
in render though

657
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,720
um so that's a bit weird

658
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:51,240
it doesn't look like we did

659
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,240
so i'm assuming that if i did this

660
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,360
we would never actually hit it because i

661
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,199
don't think we ever put in the call it

662
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,199
looks like it doesn't look like we did

663
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,200
right

664
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,038
so

665
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
we put in the reset but we never put in

666
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,079
the render so i'm going to go ahead and

667
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,679
put in the render now

668
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,519
so in here

669
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,679
we would have the render

670
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,079
the render commands part is what we

671
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,320
would probably be passing actually not a

672
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:18,000
render group

673
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,359
although the diagrams want to be in that

674
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
render group so so actually i guess

675
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,119
that's not true

676
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,240
we would want to put this in some place

677
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:29,199
that had the same render group as

678
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,038
like the game so that the 3d transform

679
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,759
will be the same because the diagrams

680
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,158
are drawn in that transform you know

681
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,158
what i'm saying

682
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,039
so we would want to go probably to world

683
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,840
mode

684
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,679
where

685
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,519
you know this stuff is is all getting

686
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,440
drawn and you know

687
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,879
put it somewhere in here like you know

688
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
where we're gonna do

689
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,159
stuff

690
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,439
like whatever we're gonna do

691
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,919
so

692
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,120
yeah um

693
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,600
maybe there

694
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,798
right before we do it uh

695
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,199
the

696
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,839
the end of the right before we end

697
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,159
we would render the diagrams there

698
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,439
and so in here what we then need to do

699
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,760
is just write something that goes

700
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,759
through all of the diagrams that exist

701
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,158
and

702
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,158
show them so here's the diagram group

703
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,918
and in it

704
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:28,038
uh we have a first and a last so we can

705
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:32,080
in theory just do a diagram entry entry

706
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,079
equals group first

707
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,320
and off we go

708
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,079
so for each one of these they are typed

709
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,960
it's a discriminated union

710
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:46,079
and you can see in here we have uh all

711
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,640
of these functions

712
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,678
and so we we need to do a switch

713
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,360
on what type of thing we have

714
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,159
and each one of these

715
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:57,158
is going to be

716
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,600
its own case

717
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,359
and we're kind of assuming that this

718
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,558
code will not be particularly fast right

719
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,399
we're just assuming this is just going

720
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,480
to draw debug diagrams and we're going

721
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,038
to assume that we use filtering to

722
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,880
ensure that we never do too much right

723
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,440
so this is not supposed to be like a

724
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,440
hardcore system it's not supposed to be

725
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,360
particularly performance oriented it's

726
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,519
just supposed to be like flexible and

727
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,519
easy for you to dump diagrams to in a

728
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,679
way that you can see

729
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,918
right so we'll lean on the filtering

730
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,559
part quite a bit we'll try to make it so

731
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,600
that filtering um is the thing that

732
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,639
really

733
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:47,359
makes this work uh if that makes sense

734
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,679
and we can you know we can try to kind

735
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,439
of go from there

736
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,159
we can add more stuff to the filtering

737
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,038
part uh as we go

738
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,520
so in here where we have diagram begin

739
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,440
and end at the moment we don't really

740
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,639
need to do much for that but we will

741
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
because we're going to want to like

742
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,480
reset

743
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,839
colors and things like that uh

744
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,120
as we go in to like begins and ends

745
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,720
so we're probably going to want to keep

746
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,079
like a stack

747
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,400
and we're probably going to want to have

748
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,000
some opinion about how that works

749
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,600
for the moment i'm not really going to

750
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
worry about that stuff i'm just gonna

751
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,798
have a color

752
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,798
and a thickness

753
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:32,159
and i'm gonna assume that these are you

754
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,120
know some sensible values when you start

755
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,840
and

756
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:40,000
as you go through

757
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,678
every time you set something it's just

758
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,880
going to do exactly what you would

759
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
expect

760
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
so

761
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:48,398
for example in here

762
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,960
we would have the diagram attributes

763
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,479
right so this would be a trib dot color

764
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,319
we would just pull that out into the

765
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,519
sticky variable that we've got

766
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,398
right

767
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,319
um

768
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:02,879
and in here the same thing like we've

769
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:04,158
got the thickness and so on

770
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,559
yeah

771
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,880
and

772
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,519
in fact i guess so what we would kind of

773
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,520
want to do here is actually have these

774
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,918
default values be something that's set

775
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,720
right so so these are probably actually

776
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,720
going to look like this

777
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,319
right

778
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,079
so

779
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,079
we would do something like

780
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,079
this

781
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,200
right

782
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,399
yeah

783
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,558
so we would set up a sticky uh version

784
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,599
and then we set up a current version in

785
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,960
here we would set the current ones

786
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,000
like so

787
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,840
uh and the text would probably be also

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,839
part of that so

789
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,199
there would be like

790
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,439
that's never gonna be sticky so i guess

791
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,240
that's just a buffer

792
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,399
um

793
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,038
where we say you know what the current

794
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:15,119
text was or something

795
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,440
and it would start with nothing

796
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,599
all right uh so in here we would say all

797
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,360
right the text equals the text that

798
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,959
we're going to print

799
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,398
and then in stick we would just say well

800
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,000
whatever the current

801
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,158
is that becomes the new sticky one and

802
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
then here is our actual drawings our

803
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,159
various drawings

804
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,440
uh for the moment we can just do one

805
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,360
because we know we're only really

806
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,880
drawing the box right now

807
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,959
uh and so we'll just do the simplest

808
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,919
possible thing which is we'll draw the

809
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,038
box uh and we'll do that using the

810
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,038
parameters that we've got

811
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,360
i'm

812
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,360
i don't know

813
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,440
okay

814
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,640
uh so in here we would just pass the

815
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,159
render group which we need to get passed

816
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,919
in right so that's something that's just

817
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,240
like telling us uh

818
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,840
where we dump all of our actual

819
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,200
graphics to

820
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:08,720
so we're gonna push the volume outline

821
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,600
out and we're gonna push it out through

822
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,159
this rectangle here right

823
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,158
and uh

824
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,640
you know one interesting thing about

825
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,640
this

826
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,600
is it may be that we don't even really

827
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,600
have to buffer these

828
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,919
i wonder if it ends up such that if we

829
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:37,359
filter them properly it we can just have

830
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,840
this be immediate and you never needed

831
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,839
to buffer

832
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,640
yeah like it hmm

833
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,798
because if you think about it it's like

834
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,918
the reason i was buffering is i was like

835
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,879
well you know you want to be able to

836
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,880
like step through these things

837
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:09,678
i think i still want them recorded and

838
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,919
here's why

839
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,679
because i don't yet have a solution to

840
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,720
how i'm going to do the like okay how do

841
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,720
you capture one of these

842
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,319
we may need to implement something like

843
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
a buffer lock

844
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,319
so you know

845
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:27,439
when something collides

846
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,759
we capture that diagram and we lock that

847
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,558
diagram in and we don't record any new

848
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,158
diagrams right

849
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,000
because we're going to need some way of

850
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,679
capturing

851
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,679
things that happen

852
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,759
only like one time

853
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,519
on this particular frame

854
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,200
or whatever and then we want to look at

855
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,599
those right

856
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,480
and so just thinking it through i'm like

857
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,199
we may just need to say

858
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,278
look we're not gonna

859
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
we can't do this immediate mode

860
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,839
because we need to be able to store the

861
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,759
buffer

862
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:03,439
um i should say pure immediate mode the

863
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,398
interface is immediate mode regardless

864
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,880
right

865
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,918
but we're we're gonna store it and save

866
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,080
it

867
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,440
uh we can't just do it pure

868
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,678
because

869
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,519
uh we may need to just like remember

870
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,840
this for many frames

871
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,640
and draw it you know

872
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,639
several times

873
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:24,119
right

874
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,278
oh i'm tired

875
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,360
so i do think it's probably not a waste

876
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:37,440
of time to buffer them i was thinking

877
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,879
like you know is it is it not

878
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,120
uh

879
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,480
but i think it might not be

880
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,719
right i think it might not be

881
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
so i think we do you know i i can't say

882
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,319
for sure but i think we do

883
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,919
want the buffer there because the buffer

884
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:55,639
is kind of important

885
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,640
uh for other reasons

886
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,960
okay

887
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,840
um

888
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
what

889
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,359
oh okay

890
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,798
all right um so i think that's fine

891
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,159
since all of the renderer stuff is

892
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:42,879
actually going to take

893
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,000
a

894
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,320
uh v4 i do wonder if we want this to be

895
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
a v4

896
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:51,519
but we'll see

897
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,079
uh anyway

898
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,480
um so now we can go ahead and run this

899
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,158
and see if any of this stuff works uh

900
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,798
i'm not seeing

901
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,440
any of those boxes at the moment

902
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,278
so i don't think it did right

903
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,200
uh but i don't know so we're gonna have

904
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,119
to like step through that code uh and

905
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,280
see what's going on here

906
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,720
i assume there's nothing stupid going on

907
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,639
like like you know we're obviously doing

908
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:18,000
append here

909
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,440
uh and the box min and max does go into

910
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,440
zero and one

911
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,240
so you know it's what we would expect

912
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,519
here

913
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,719
um

914
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,719
so that all seems

915
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,760
like what you would expect

916
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,039
uh yeah

917
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,119
and at the end of every single one of

918
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,199
these drawing things we probably want to

919
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,200
do this as well um

920
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,800
so it resets each time

921
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,359
uh but i think that's basically it

922
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,800
right uh and and then we need some stuff

923
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,078
in here and you know put in the text and

924
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,599
points and lines and spheres and all

925
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,359
that stuff right so we're gonna have to

926
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,640
add more stuff but

927
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,639
seems about

928
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:09,598
about right

929
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,759
so let's find out why we're not seeing

930
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,559
those or you know what's going on there

931
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,400
so i'm going to go ahead and change this

932
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,039
to a debug build and i'm just going to

933
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,720
step through the diagramming

934
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,400
part of the code

935
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,759
to see what it's doing

936
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,358
and see if i can see what's the problem

937
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,040
you know what i mean

938
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,880
so

939
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,559
looks like we don't

940
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,720
have uh

941
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,838
that file open so i'll just

942
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:41,639
set a breakpoint at render diagrams

943
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,639
and let it take me there

944
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,400
so here we are uh stepping through

945
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,039
uh it looks like the problem here is we

946
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,440
didn't hit any of this

947
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,440
i guess

948
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,480
there we go so we've started recording

949
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,000
some now

950
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,480
uh and if i take a look

951
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,358
at this entry

952
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,159
we can see you know what the heck

953
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,159
uh we get in there

954
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,280
so here's an example of a box being

955
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,280
drawn

956
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,280
um

957
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,559
i mean

958
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,559
it looks fine

959
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:39,719
uh

960
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,039
that's not a thing

961
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:57,920
i mean that that seems fine to me

962
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,920
uh we've got

963
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,679
current color is like

964
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,838
pure green

965
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,960
seems fine thickness is 0.1 seems fine

966
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,559
so here's us

967
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,559
actually drawing

968
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,519
and again i mean

969
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,359
i don't see anything weird about those

970
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,358
numbers they they seem pretty good

971
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,320
that seems pretty good too

972
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,118
so i can't say off hand pun intended

973
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,559
uh

974
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,358
that

975
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:14,559
i know why that wouldn't draw

976
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,559
oh and it is drawing

977
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,959
so is it possible that we have handmade

978
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,719
internal turned off in release mode and

979
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,358
that was the only bug

980
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,358
was the build

981
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,800
no it's turned on

982
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,039
right i mean handmade internal the flags

983
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,719
are the same

984
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,719
even slow is turned on

985
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,598
right

986
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:44,598
so it's a bit weird

987
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,599
um

988
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,920
i

989
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:58,838
don't have an explanation of that did i

990
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,838
like not compile the code

991
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,599
so it seems to be working just fine now

992
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,440
the only thing that's a little odd is

993
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,680
the thickness looks wrong

994
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,800
so i'm guessing we actually were using o

995
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:13,759
point

996
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,280
like

997
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,880
a 0.01

998
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,359
for the thickness

999
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,358
on those so why didn't that work what

1000
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,400
did i do wrong there i'm not sure what i

1001
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,799
did

1002
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,838
why that didn't work that was weird

1003
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,079
um

1004
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,199
but there's the diagram system in action

1005
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,480
right so

1006
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,719
all good

1007
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,719
um

1008
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,240
right seems seems fine

1009
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,358
nothing uh nothing too

1010
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:43,919
too unexpected there

1011
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,519
and so now really i guess i just need to

1012
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,280
be able to pick

1013
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,679
this stuff better

1014
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,680
uh and then we implement the other

1015
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,199
aspects of the diagramming right we need

1016
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,719
a way to

1017
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,319
uh draw you know

1018
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,799
we need slightly better filtering

1019
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,240
because the the giant like 10 000

1020
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,440
dispatch thing

1021
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,479
uh is probably not gonna cut it but uh

1022
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,800
we could do some slightly better

1023
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,800
filtering and then we can do

1024
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,800
um

1025
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,118
drawing of things like the spheres and

1026
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:22,318
so on

1027
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,318
okay so lines

1028
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,200
we already have

1029
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,679
so it seems like that's something we

1030
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,519
should probably just

1031
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:36,159
do

1032
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:38,719
i don't know what this stuff actually uh

1033
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,000
refers to like

1034
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,118
cf

1035
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,119
what is cf

1036
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,280
it's just the color what does the f

1037
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:49,279
stand for

1038
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,559
from color

1039
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,680
function from color

1040
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,679
face

1041
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,679
fade

1042
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,159
i mean i'm the only one that types in

1043
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:12,639
this code base so i typed it in but

1044
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,960
i have no idea what the f stands for

1045
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,960
um

1046
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,839
flat f

1047
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,838
front

1048
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,960
you got me

1049
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:29,199
uh anyway so if we do a push line

1050
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,318
segment here we'll get lines

1051
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,078
right so that should be pretty

1052
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:33,679
straightforward

1053
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,640
so if we want to draw lines we can draw

1054
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,279
lines

1055
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:40,000
and to do that uh

1056
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,440
i guess the texture part

1057
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,679
maybe the texture part is occluded why

1058
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,039
there's an f

1059
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,318
i don't know we don't care what the

1060
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,440
texture is here so we're not going to

1061
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:48,960
use that

1062
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,358
um

1063
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,119
i don't know man

1064
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:56,000
so anyway uh the from is in the entry p

1065
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,079
the

1066
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,480
two is in the entry p1

1067
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,480
and then the colors right so

1068
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,519
uh in this case the color doesn't

1069
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,720
doesn't actually have

1070
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,599
there's there isn't one for either

1071
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:14,799
endpoint so it's just gonna be like uh

1072
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,720
current dot color

1073
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,000
and again you can see why i

1074
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,318
i think i'm going to go ahead and just

1075
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,280
change that to a v4

1076
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,159
uh

1077
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,640
just to make it a little bit more sane

1078
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:30,480
so what i'll probably do here's my

1079
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:32,719
suggestion there is this is not gonna be

1080
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,000
a thing on the entities we're just gonna

1081
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:38,239
do like v3 color

1082
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,239
uh

1083
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,759
maybe even v4 color

1084
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,599
thick right

1085
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,920
and then we'll just you know change this

1086
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,920
around

1087
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,680
and so now when we do this

1088
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,719
we'll extend it to the v4 in the actual

1089
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,679
call

1090
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,399
so

1091
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,719
you know it should just work

1092
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,720
and

1093
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,960
this

1094
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,280
will now get it directly out of here

1095
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,159
and then these

1096
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,000
uh

1097
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,639
just are larger now

1098
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,960
and that way we don't have to constantly

1099
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,799
mess with it uh

1100
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,960
it's just and and if someone does want

1101
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,880
to use alpha later we can allow we can

1102
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,800
have a call

1103
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,720
that would allow you to set the alpha

1104
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,640
which we might want and that way all of

1105
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,679
this code just works because it's

1106
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,598
passing through the alpha now

1107
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,039
which it might as well there's really no

1108
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,119
reason not to all right i did that in

1109
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,119
the wrong order oops

1110
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
so now i think we get line segments as

1111
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,079
well i don't think anyone's drawing them

1112
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,160
so i'm not sure that matters i don't

1113
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,800
know that we have points i think in

1114
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,078
general we just do

1115
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,960
uh

1116
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,800
tiny like cubes for the points

1117
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,199
is what we've done in the past

1118
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,119
so so i believe all we do here is we

1119
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,279
just do push cubes when we've wanted to

1120
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,838
draw those and i think like we did that

1121
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,839
for example

1122
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,240
when we wanted to draw a

1123
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,199
um

1124
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,719
like a lighting sphere

1125
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,679
i don't know if you remember but we kind

1126
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:23,598
of drew

1127
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:27,199
like yeah it's this thing

1128
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,119
where the samples were like in a sphere

1129
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:31,759
we just did it this way

1130
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,800
and that to me seems like a good idea so

1131
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,839
i'm just going to go ahead and say

1132
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,440
that's how we're going to draw points in

1133
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:41,599
here uh which is we just draw them

1134
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,800
as cubes of the size that you specified

1135
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,160
when you said what you wanted the

1136
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,839
thickness to be that way you can also

1137
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,679
control

1138
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,759
uh that thickness

1139
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,318
so in here we would do a radius

1140
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,319
the radius is going to be oops

1141
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,800
the current

1142
00:44:54,318 --> 00:45:00,358
thickness

1143
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,359
three times over

1144
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,480
the placement of the point comes from p0

1145
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,879
the color of the point comes from the

1146
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,880
color

1147
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,079
and that's it for points so we're down

1148
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,440
to just spheres and overlays and we've

1149
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,280
got the text

1150
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,679
uh part of this

1151
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,359
as well so we want to do a

1152
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:28,000
drawing of text and i

1153
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:31,279
don't really remember much about how we

1154
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,838
do text in this system unfortunately

1155
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,839
um

1156
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,598
you know i i just don't remember how any

1157
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:44,598
of that stuff works

1158
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,599
um

1159
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,280
we're gonna have to look

1160
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,559
so if we take a look

1161
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:06,000
in the code that draws text which is

1162
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:09,039
only really done for debugging um and

1163
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,159
like editor panels and stuff like that

1164
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:12,480
uh

1165
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,358
you know i have no idea how that stuff

1166
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,119
worked

1167
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,358
or how we were doing it

1168
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,358
but

1169
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,519
you can see here like

1170
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,720
here's us doing some stuff with that

1171
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,719
and

1172
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:46,000
it looks like text out at

1173
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,000
is the base call

1174
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,318
god like have a bigger stack this looks

1175
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:55,318
like a java program

1176
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,318
um

1177
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,480
so it looks like this is our text

1178
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,358
call

1179
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,960
right uh we've never implemented one

1180
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,318
so far

1181
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,920
uh

1182
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:16,239
i don't think that operates like in game

1183
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,240
uh

1184
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,800
i mean this is basically it

1185
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:34,079
so you you really just call

1186
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,880
uh get bitmap for glyph

1187
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,200
uh bitmap info and then you

1188
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:44,280
you do a um

1189
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:44,279
an alignment of the text here right

1190
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,079
so it'd be pretty easy to just redo this

1191
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,839
uh i'm just not sure

1192
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,839
i have to think about it

1193
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,680
so i'm not sure what we want to do here

1194
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,759
i really don't know

1195
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,318
um i guess we just have to play around

1196
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,559
with it and see what makes sense

1197
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:58,558
so

1198
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,159
i think we probably just want to make a

1199
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,280
little routine in the diagram system

1200
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,078
that's like

1201
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:10,839
takes the text and it puts it

1202
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,839
you know centered at a position right

1203
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,799
uh i mean i i don't really have

1204
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,920
much of an idea you know i just figured

1205
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,800
we probably want to be able to label

1206
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,880
things i maybe i don't know it's unclear

1207
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,200
whether we even really care about this

1208
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,599
but we'll see

1209
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,960
so i guess when it comes to spheres

1210
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,880
these are the only things where we don't

1211
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,480
really have a way to draw them right now

1212
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,240
there's a lot of ways i suppose we could

1213
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,679
draw them we could draw them using the

1214
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,279
same kind technique we did before where

1215
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,639
we just put points on the surface of the

1216
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,400
sphere

1217
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,920
we could add the ability to draw an

1218
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,838
actual sphere

1219
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,480
uh which would you know be something

1220
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:56,078
that actually puts quads in a pattern

1221
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,920
around the surface of a sphere i'm not

1222
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,680
sure we really want to go that far with

1223
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,680
it

1224
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,639
so it's kind of hard to say what we want

1225
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:07,039
to draw here uh we could put line

1226
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:09,440
segments around in like a ring that just

1227
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,838
sort of shows representationally where

1228
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,119
the sphere would

1229
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:15,440
be um

1230
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,480
so that's another option that we could

1231
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,000
do

1232
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,760
and so i don't know uh it's yeah it's

1233
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,960
really pretty

1234
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,599
tough to say

1235
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,358
what should happen here and i don't know

1236
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,000
uh so anyway

1237
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:34,920
moving forward with this slightly um

1238
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,920
let's go ahead and and see if we can

1239
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,639
the white texture thing

1240
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,680
we have a easy way of getting just plain

1241
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,679
white texture here right yeah

1242
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:58,000
so i don't know if there's a

1243
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,759
is there a like get white texture or

1244
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,400
plain yeah i don't know

1245
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,640
um so

1246
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,000
it's that uh so we don't really have to

1247
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:09,759
care about that

1248
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,239
anyway so i don't know what we want to

1249
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,559
do about text i'm really not sure maybe

1250
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,799
we'll save that until next weekend when

1251
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,040
we can have some time to think about it

1252
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,519
for right now i just want to

1253
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,039
uh go into the move entity stuff and see

1254
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,239
if we can now use some of this

1255
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:26,960
diagramming

1256
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,799
to get us some information right so

1257
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,400
let's let's see what we can do about

1258
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,119
that

1259
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,800
so

1260
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,358
and we'll see if we can maybe start to

1261
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,960
work on that panel right

1262
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,519
so in here one of the things we know is

1263
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,240
that if we turn this on we get problems

1264
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:45,119
and the reason that we get problems is

1265
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:47,279
because this is called so many times

1266
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,800
so one thing we could do is say look

1267
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,040
let's get this out of here uh and just

1268
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,039
say like all right let's just show only

1269
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,599
when they collide

1270
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:02,960
um so if they haven't collided then we

1271
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:05,200
won't draw this at all right we won't uh

1272
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,559
and i guess really we probably want

1273
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,439
the other way around

1274
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:12,000
um but yeah

1275
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,639
so what we'd like to do here is is say

1276
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,838
if they haven't collided uh then we

1277
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,799
don't right because that's what this is

1278
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,400
it's like shapes collide so it's true

1279
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,920
if they collide if they haven't collided

1280
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,079
we won't draw anything if they have

1281
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,559
collided then we will

1282
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,720
um and you know we can see whether that

1283
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,359
gives us some more of that information

1284
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,759
right so now when this thing collides

1285
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,039
like that we should be drawing more

1286
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,640
stuff

1287
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,400
and it's a little bit hard to tell

1288
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,318
because we're already drawing so much

1289
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,400
stuff with those like voxel occupancy

1290
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,880
things that's hard to tell if anything

1291
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,880
new got drawn in there now the fact that

1292
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,280
there's some white squares in there

1293
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,079
suggests that maybe we do

1294
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,000
um because it's hard to say but

1295
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,760
i

1296
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
in the interest of of being clearer

1297
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,040
about it

1298
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,318
let's just see what happens uh

1299
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:04,719
me

1300
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,639
maybe one thing we can do is

1301
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,959
start to put some of the filtering stuff

1302
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:08,960
into

1303
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,519
yeah like we can start to put some of

1304
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,039
the filtering stuff into this system

1305
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:20,400
so

1306
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:20,400
let me think about this for a second

1307
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,880
this is my giant stretch

1308
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,880
um

1309
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,838
so what i'd like to do here is i'd like

1310
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:11,439
to have a

1311
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:15,838
way like i said before i what i'd really

1312
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,838
like to do is have some way of

1313
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,838
of isolating these diagrams and that's

1314
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,280
the part that i'm not really thinking

1315
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:26,799
you know what's weird is i did this in

1316
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,319
the witness and i actually can't

1317
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,720
remember how i did that system

1318
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:35,719
but it was a pretty good system

1319
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,719
and

1320
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,599
i think what it might have done is

1321
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,199
capture many frames

1322
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,039
and then you just like step through to

1323
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:53,318
the frame you wanted

1324
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,318
i think that may have been how it worked

1325
00:54:54,639 --> 00:55:00,078
so it just like it like saved you know

1326
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,920
diagrams over multiple frames and then

1327
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,640
you could step back through so you'd you

1328
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,680
know you'd do something like you know

1329
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,400
that

1330
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,199
or or well this right

1331
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,240
well

1332
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,279
okay

1333
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,039
that

1334
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,200
so you do something like that and you

1335
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,798
just go like okay you know i'm gonna

1336
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,159
step through it now to see what happened

1337
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:19,280
i guess one of the things one of the

1338
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,039
nice things about this particular

1339
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,760
situation is that's held

1340
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:23,759
in a static

1341
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:28,798
configuration so really

1342
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,639
we can just you know that will just work

1343
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:31,679
in the sense that we can just actually

1344
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:32,879
see

1345
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:35,279
you can see that we are drawing some

1346
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:39,760
stuff there right those are lines

1347
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,760
uh i believe that are being drawn right

1348
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,720
so we are definitely drawing uh but yeah

1349
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,480
like we want to be able to now turn

1350
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:50,558
things on and off right we want to be

1351
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,719
able to say like oh don't draw certain

1352
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,240
certain pieces or you know turn on and

1353
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:57,439
off different kinds of

1354
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,719
of elements of this

1355
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,798
i think the way i did that part in the

1356
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,598
witness was i just had flag like i just

1357
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:05,280
had like an enum that was like any time

1358
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,798
you were doing a particular thing in a

1359
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,240
diagram you just like

1360
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:09,679
said which one it was you were doing and

1361
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,838
then you could like turn them on and off

1362
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,759
just by clicking on on like kind of like

1363
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,838
checkboxes right

1364
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,680
uh

1365
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:22,239
and my assumption here

1366
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,239
is

1367
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:32,318
is like that would work just fine

1368
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:34,639
probably uh i would suspect

1369
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:34,639
um

1370
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,639
i mean i think that would probably just

1371
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,400
be fine so maybe we should do that like

1372
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:50,558
we'll basically just have some enums and

1373
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,240
we basically say here's a bunch of enums

1374
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,839
that are like what parts of diagrams are

1375
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,118
being drawn and you can just turn them

1376
00:56:53,838 --> 00:57:01,440
on and off or something right

1377
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,440
now if i go and actually look

1378
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,680
at what's being drawn there

1379
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,119
um

1380
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,039
you can see

1381
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,039
putting in stuff like

1382
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,639
spheres or whatever

1383
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:15,039
um none of this stuff is being drawn in

1384
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,719
any colors so i also don't know which

1385
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,880
things are which

1386
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,399
uh but you can see here that the lines

1387
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,680
are actually only drawn in the sphere

1388
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,440
case anyway

1389
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:26,719
so we do at least know that the sphere

1390
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,720
collision stuff is operating right

1391
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,199
it's just not working very well like

1392
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:33,598
it's not actually doing anything

1393
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:33,598
um

1394
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,519
that we would want it to

1395
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,239
right

1396
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,318
so if we look right at what's happening

1397
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,239
there with the sphere you know the line

1398
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,920
is drawn from the center of the sphere

1399
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:47,118
so in the case that we expect we have

1400
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,559
which is this one

1401
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,280
the line is drawn from the center of the

1402
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,240
sphere to the center of the box

1403
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,599
right

1404
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,318
uh

1405
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,440
no sorry to the closest point on the box

1406
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,199
right

1407
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,720
so that's like the center of the sphere

1408
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:03,838
is out here and the closest point in the

1409
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,838
box is over there

1410
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,480
um

1411
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,838
and we have the problem where for

1412
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,838
whatever reason the

1413
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:29,519
the sphere doesn't think it can move

1414
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:34,960
closer to that

1415
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:36,399
right

1416
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,639
what it's doing is it's evaluating to

1417
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,880
see whether it can get closer to there

1418
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,879
uh from where it is

1419
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,920
you know

1420
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,240
and

1421
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,960
what's kind of weird about that is you

1422
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:48,959
would assume

1423
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:53,838
that it easily could just by moving out

1424
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,079
slightly and

1425
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,920
because it is a sphere

1426
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,640
uh

1427
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,039
you would think that it could

1428
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,960
get closer to that by moving around you

1429
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,679
know around

1430
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:12,679
but it's not doing that and so i'm not

1431
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,679
sure yeah i'm not sure what the actual

1432
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,399
i'm not sure what the actual best way is

1433
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:27,399
to look at

1434
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,400
that

1435
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,318
so i guess what we can do

1436
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:46,639
as a game plan is we can just have a

1437
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,719
button because like okay so at least for

1438
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,199
this

1439
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,959
we know we can get it into a situation

1440
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:55,439
like that wasn't hard to do

1441
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,119
we know we can get it into a situation

1442
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,440
where the glove gets

1443
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,680
you know caught on something

1444
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,240
so that it won't move

1445
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,838
from where it is you know until we ask

1446
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:07,358
it to do something different

1447
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:08,480
right

1448
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:12,078
and so

1449
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,358
my assumption there is that given that

1450
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,599
we should be able to just have a thing

1451
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:16,480
on here where we just hit like

1452
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,680
you know

1453
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,920
capture

1454
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:22,159
and then it just remembers one of those

1455
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:25,159
diagrams and never clears it

1456
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,159
right

1457
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,559
once we have it captured then we can

1458
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,200
step through the different parts of it

1459
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,798
right and so yeah i mean i think that's

1460
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,118
basically what we want i don't know how

1461
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,440
much time i have left let me see

1462
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,440
um

1463
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:56,358
14 minutes maybe

1464
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,358
let's say 14 minutes

1465
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,759
so

1466
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:06,118
maybe what we'll do

1467
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,119
so we'll do that next time

1468
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:18,318
maybe what we'll do this time is

1469
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:19,358
one of the problems we're going to have

1470
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:21,679
is we're going to want to be able to

1471
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:23,358
refer to these and step through them

1472
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:26,078
and at the moment they're just a linked

1473
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:28,239
list which might be annoying for that

1474
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,760
so one of the things we could do is just

1475
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:30,719
say like

1476
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,799
well

1477
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,000
maybe they're enumerated or something or

1478
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:36,239
have ids

1479
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,838
associated with them

1480
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,838
i suppose if you capture

1481
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:45,838
it's actually fine because you just

1482
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:48,558
store that pointer and like it matches

1483
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:50,798
something or it doesn't you don't care

1484
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,798
right

1485
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,640
so that might actually be fine i guess i

1486
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,798
don't know that that's true

1487
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:58,879
uh but you can kind of see like where

1488
01:01:56,798 --> 01:02:01,280
i'm going with this right so in the

1489
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,519
diagram system

1490
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,720
uh yeah we would need a thing where like

1491
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,280
diagram reset doesn't get called

1492
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:11,199
if you've done a capture so probably

1493
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,119
what we would need is something like in

1494
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:16,239
the diagram group we would have

1495
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:18,400
something like you know captured

1496
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,558
it's like a flag that gets set

1497
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,798
and so at some point you just do a thing

1498
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,640
that's like diagram capture

1499
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:25,519
uh

1500
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,480
and

1501
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:31,480
capture like turns that to on

1502
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,480
and

1503
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:40,559
you know it would need two things

1504
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:42,798
it would need to to basically have a

1505
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,798
uh

1506
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,798
a state where you said like it's on or

1507
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,798
it's off

1508
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:49,798
um

1509
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,400
so in here

1510
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:07,838
uh we would set the captured state

1511
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:07,838
of the diagram group

1512
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,200
like that

1513
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,118
uh and then what we do here is like

1514
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,199
diagram is on

1515
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,960
will always be off

1516
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:24,000
uh

1517
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,000
so if you're not captured then you can

1518
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,838
you can be on

1519
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,280
and then we see whether filter pass is a

1520
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:31,440
separate thing right

1521
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,280
so that way when we capture diagramming

1522
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,960
is off permanently so no one's going to

1523
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,920
do anything

1524
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:41,679
similarly the call to reset will fail so

1525
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:44,680
basically like if group captured

1526
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:44,679
um

1527
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,159
if if you haven't done a capture you can

1528
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,079
clear if you have in a capture you

1529
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,519
cannot clear right so once you lock in

1530
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,559
that capture

1531
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:57,679
uh it will not clear anymore

1532
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,559
so

1533
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:04,399
what we could then do is inside that

1534
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:05,200
panel so in here where we had uh you

1535
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,480
know

1536
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:10,639
this this thing right

1537
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,838
uh what we could have here is like a

1538
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:13,838
lock like a

1539
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:21,598
look like a toggle

1540
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,839
i'm trying to think of should be like

1541
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,960
two buttons or a toggle

1542
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:26,480
uh

1543
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,920
i don't really know

1544
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,519
but

1545
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,240
in here we could have a thing which

1546
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,280
which basically controls that

1547
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:36,318
right

1548
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,480
so there would be like a button thing

1549
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:39,440
whatever the heck this stuff is who

1550
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,599
knows

1551
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,079
um

1552
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:46,318
where we just say all right you've got a

1553
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,318
you know a button here

1554
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:49,318
um

1555
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:00,399
and you push this capture button and

1556
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,039
when you push the capture button maybe

1557
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,280
we actually have like a toggle

1558
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,160
on this or something

1559
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:11,280
right

1560
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:13,759
where we say like diagram uh is captured

1561
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:18,240
and we just say like look if it is

1562
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,240
captured then it's like um

1563
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:28,640
or something like that uh i don't know

1564
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,639
and then in here we just say like okay

1565
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:37,798
maybe remember whether the thing is

1566
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:37,798
captured or not

1567
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:42,719
and then in here we can set set it

1568
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,720
so

1569
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,400
what did i call that again

1570
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,400
and then that's just a toggle so in here

1571
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:04,239
we've got two of these we've got

1572
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,720
like is captured

1573
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:08,078
and these both have to also

1574
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,959
kind of

1575
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,720
have their compiled out versions so is

1576
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,318
captured will always be zero there's

1577
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,078
nothing you can do

1578
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,079
and set capture will just not do

1579
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,400
anything

1580
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,400
at all

1581
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,358
and that seems fine so then on here

1582
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:31,358
we would have

1583
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:31,358
the same thing we have

1584
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,318
is captured

1585
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:48,960
i don't know why these are not booleans

1586
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,920
too much ref term programming where we

1587
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,960
were just in c i guess

1588
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,200
and uh never made one

1589
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,199
but

1590
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:01,838
that that'll do it

1591
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:05,280
okay

1592
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,000
so

1593
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,000
i think that's good

1594
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,200
everything seems fine there

1595
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,960
and uh so now

1596
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,719
you know this might actually also work

1597
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,880
just because you know you don't really

1598
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,719
need much for that to be working

1599
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,920
so if i went in here and then i said

1600
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:26,078
like okay like capture that diagram

1601
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,200
um

1602
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,280
i don't know why single stepping is like

1603
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:33,439
that color but

1604
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,280
so it doesn't look like that worked for

1605
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:39,159
some reason and i don't know what the

1606
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,160
reason actually is

1607
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,838
like oh

1608
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,119
i do know what that reason is you can't

1609
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:53,838
change the camera

1610
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,079
uh i mean not the camera but the basis

1611
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,078
so you can't move out of the region so

1612
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,599
it did work just fine but if you moved

1613
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,440
out of the region right so it had a new

1614
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,119
center point you'd still draw the

1615
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,720
diagram it will just draw in a

1616
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,760
completely different place relative to

1617
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:06,959
the rest of the scene because the scene

1618
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,400
has slid

1619
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,838
that's fine

1620
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,720
i don't care about that at all we just

1621
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:12,719
won't do that right

1622
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,039
so there's our diagram frozen in place

1623
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:18,960
uh so that's great because that was easy

1624
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:21,359
i don't know what single stepping oh so

1625
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,158
that turns on and off

1626
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,039
um

1627
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:26,559
single stepping uh so so

1628
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:29,359
that's actually we actually already kind

1629
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,359
of had the button

1630
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,640
i guess

1631
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,719
uh so we don't really need this anymore

1632
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,759
because single stepping is not

1633
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,279
um

1634
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,880
really a thing

1635
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,880
in the world world mode

1636
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,319
those don't

1637
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,279
probably

1638
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,120
want to

1639
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:53,120
be there right uh

1640
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,318
i'm just going to remove those because

1641
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:57,679
those are going to go into the diagram

1642
01:08:54,319 --> 01:09:00,000
system now so i don't actually want

1643
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,000
um

1644
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:03,039
those to be there

1645
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,479
um

1646
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,399
so what does that do

1647
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,920
if anything

1648
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,719
suffering

1649
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:34,479
[Music]

1650
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,640
oh yeah

1651
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:40,399
what's going on bean

01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,400
what's going on toffee bean

1653

you just mousing around

1656
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,440
you just mousing around

1657
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,439
come on up

1658
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,840
come on up

1659
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:06,000

you wanna what do you wanna do you look

1665
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,000
like you do you wanna be brushed are you

1666
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:22,639
gonna do you need brushings

1667
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,640
what's going on

1668
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,640
tell me what's up

1669
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,159
it looks like you want brushings you

1670
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,079
want brushings right

1671
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:33,439
okay

1672
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,840
okay

1673
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,198
you want brushings

1674
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,719
you will get

1675
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:43,519
brushings for sorting

1676
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:46,880
it is important to maintain optimal coat

1677
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,880
health at all times

1678
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,039
and brushings is an important part of

1679
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:56,640
this as we know

1680
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,640
so we know as we all know

1681
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,840
there you go

1682
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:17,238
okay

1683
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:35,519
all right

1684
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,920
looking good

1685
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,920
looking sleek

1686
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,119
looking sleek

1687
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,120
wouldn't you say

1688
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:48,238
oh yeah

1689
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:49,119
okay

1690
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,919
um

1691
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:54,000
so i don't know maybe this is actually

1692
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,600
good i don't know uh maybe i should

1693
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,279
leave it in i didn't realize we'd

1694
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,280
actually done it um

1695
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:02,559
to be honest i thought that was just

1696
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,359
kind of some placeholder stuff but it

1697
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,520
looks like we actually put that in there

1698
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:10,158
and if that's the case

1699
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:13,280
i guess i won't take it out so so can we

1700
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:15,359
use this is this still a thing that we

1701
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:17,039
want what are you doing puss what are

1702
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,839
you doing

1703
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:19,519
um

1704
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,600
like if i do

1705
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,920
a

1706
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,239
single stepping here

1707
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,239
um

1708
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,480
okay so it kind of does interesting

1709
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,640
um so yeah i guess you know what i'll

1710
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:37,198
leave that in there because you know

1711
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,679
we we might maybe don't need the capture

1712
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,839
stuff as much if we have that because we

1713
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,199
can kind of step it uh maybe we'll have

1714
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,640
to

1715
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:46,399
cap the

1716
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,119
movement amount like i

1717
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,559
that didn't seem like a single step

1718
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:50,939
to me

1719
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,679
um

1720
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:55,678
[Music]

1721
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,359
i'm not sure

1722
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,800
what are you doing what are you doing

1723
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:00,960
booba

1724
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:04,440
what are you doing

1725
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,439
what are you doing

1726
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,800
uh

1727
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,079
so yeah i don't really know what we're

1728
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,079
gonna do with that um

1729
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,039
but i like it so i'm not gonna remove it

1730
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:20,399
i don't know why that step was able to

1731
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:22,079
move quite so far that's a bit odd uh so

1732
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,519
maybe i'll take a look at that it could

1733
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,119
be that we're not like clamping the

1734
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,239
total movement amount

1735
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:28,319
at all

1736
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:30,639
uh

1737
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,639
there

1738
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,719
which we probably should

1739
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:44,158
what are you doing booba

1740
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,158
what are you doing

1741
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:47,840
you just chilling

1742
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,279
i gotta finish up the show okay we're

1743
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,279
almost done

1744
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:55,599
okay

1745
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,199
okay

1746
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:03,119
okay

1747
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:05,519
all right

1748
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:06,719
okay

1749
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,679
come on

1750
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,640
go sit down for a little bit

1751
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,039
um

1752
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:16,079
so yeah like i don't know that might

1753
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:18,719
just be because we're not clamping those

1754
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:19,519
uh velocities at all right

1755
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,600
um

1756
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,199
but like if you look here in fact you

1757
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,239
can kind of see that it's allowed to

1758
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:28,719
just do like arbitrary stuff here which

1759
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:30,879
is kind of nuts uh

1760
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:32,480
so we must not be clamping the total

1761
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,079
distance

1762
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,238
or something

1763
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:38,158
so maybe that's what we do next time

1764
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,439
let's look at that and i didn't know

1765
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:41,359
we'd already implemented this this is

1766
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,359
great so we may not really need capture

1767
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:45,039
much we may be able to just like get

1768
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,639
away without really ever using it it's

1769
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,319
nice to have it there in case we do

1770
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,679
because it was you know free to add took

1771
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:53,279
like you know two seconds to put that in

1772
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,800
but now that we have the diagrams and

1773
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,238
the single stepping that actually seems

1774
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,840
pretty good because then i can just like

1775
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:01,359
step through and watch each one happen

1776
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,719
so maybe we just put a little diagram

1777
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,880
filtering in there next time and then

1778
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:07,760
hopefully you know we'd be okay

1779
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,440
um to debug uh what's happening with

1780
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:13,840
with some of that stuff

1781
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:13,839
so all right let's go ahead and do q a
