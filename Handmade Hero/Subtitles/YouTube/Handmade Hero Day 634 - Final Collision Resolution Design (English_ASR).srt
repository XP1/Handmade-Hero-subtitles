1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,199
and welcome to handmade hero sure we

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,040
code a complete game

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:09,359
live on stream we are going to do some

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,440
collision detection work today

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:17,920
um we're kind of exploring some options

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,920
uh that we could use with

7
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,599
uh sort of like

8
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,679
the same sort of stuff i did on the

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
witness only like trying to do a simpler

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,000
version

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
so still trying to approach it from the

12
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,280
standpoint

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
of something that we would consider

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
fairly stable

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,799
oops

16
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,038
so something that we're not going to

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
have a lot of concerns about um

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,079
which is usually the problem with

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
collision detection

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,759
and response code is that you end up in

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
situations where your game has all these

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,399
bugs in it

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,079
you see this all the time with unity and

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,480
unreal games

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,359
there's just so many bugs with objects

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,478
getting stuck

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
in things all the time or falling out of

28
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,438
the world

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,640
or doing all this other stuff so

30
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:18,478
the goal here um would be

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,359
to try to move towards a system that

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,679
doesn't have

33
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,920
very many of those problems so that's

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
what we're looking at doing

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,439
and given the limited you know on

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,519
handmade here everything is

37
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:30,399
very compressed you know normally if i

38
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,920
think about i'm going to make a

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
collision detector from scratch

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,439
i think about spending several months of

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,599
careful work

42
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:38,959
on something like that uh and we don't

43
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,759
get to do that on handmade here

44
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,118
obviously it's

45
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,319
you just gotta do some um fairly

46
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,159
straightforward stuff

47
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,000
so you know we don't have the luxury of

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,600
doing something extremely fancy

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,840
but um we can still try to do the best

50
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,839
we can

51
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
right

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,680
all right

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
so looking at the way that we're doing

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
this currently there's a couple things

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
uh that now if we want to start moving

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
this towards towards done

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,920
i think we should do uh

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,520
at the start right you can see i've got

59
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,280
this move entity locally thing and we

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
were subdividing this motion here

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,479
and i don't know that that's something

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,840
we actually want to do uh

63
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,518
yet so i was thinking about this

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,080
kind of just randomly in the back of my

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,200
head and i think we probably want to now

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,719
start just doing voxel by voxel stepping

67
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,399
um because there's really not much

68
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,840
reason of doing this two-pass thing we

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
were doing we might as well just start

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,719
in the voxelor in

71
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,719
and just move ourselves forward along

72
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,719
that voxel seems like a pretty

73
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,959
straightforward thing to do

74
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,239
so i think i might kind of change this

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,519
to doing

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,519
that right so when we do

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,519
this movement we'll just sort of do it

78
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,560
one voxel at a time

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,640
the way that i might uh do that first

80
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,759
is we just won't move multiple voxels

81
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,079
we'll only move

82
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:14,959
one um and

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,920
we'll we'll see what that looks like and

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,878
then we'll figure out whether we want

85
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,119
two routines

86
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,359
one routine that calls another routine

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
to move voxel by voxel or whether it's

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,760
all in kind of a loop we'll see i don't

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
know

90
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,239
but anyway um so the first thing i want

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,120
to do is take this

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,878
move entity locally thing here um and

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
and this from p2p

94
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,878
uh i just i'm gonna say look uh we're

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,639
not gonna do

96
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,239
so we're not gonna do any of this stuff

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,000
right uh we'll leave the motion

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
displacement size

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,759
in there and that'll basically be our

100
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:54,238
voxel size

101
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,239
so our voxel bounds are actually

102
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
before we were building a voxel

103
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,280
dynamically around the character

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
and because i want to move this to like

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
i said we're going to try and push

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,438
towards getting this stable now so it's

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,879
very solid and doesn't break and doesn't

108
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:11,039
have people getting stuck and that sort

109
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,518
of thing

110
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,719
so what i'd like to do is i'd like to

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,439
say okay

112
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,759
we're going to now say that in order for

113
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,959
our

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
so that our collision text will be more

115
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,839
stable we're going to always use the

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,519
same

117
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:28,478
voxel pattern so we're not

118
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,959
going to build voxels based on where you

119
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:30,879
are

120
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,719
we're going to categorize you into a

121
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,040
voxel

122
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
by saying the voxel's always the same

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
shape it's just

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,400
which cell you're in is what changes we

125
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,198
don't shift the voxel to align with

126
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,399
where you are

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,040
this was this shifts the voxel to a line

128
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,439
where you are um and we don't want to do

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,160
that

130
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:54,560
so instead what we'd like to do

131
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
um and i don't know what we've got for

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,160
math functions i never

133
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,000
remember what sorts of stuff we've

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,080
implemented on handmade hero

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,279
but basically if we have a floor

136
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,079
so you can see here we have a way to

137
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,839
floor

138
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,839
stuff and

139
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,159
you know it's it's not great um

140
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,559
you know i don't actually want it to

141
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,400
floor to an integer

142
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,918
um so this is less good

143
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:36,719
uh i i really would rather be doing this

144
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,719
probably so i might

145
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:43,038
say let's pretend that we have

146
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,120
that though so i might say like okay so

147
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,560
there's a floor

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,478
um function here and and it's going to

149
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:59,439
be like f32 to f32

150
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:59,439
and it's it's literally just this right

151
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,839
um

152
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,240
so i'm not sure how what the easiest way

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,800
to extract this is but i guess maybe

154
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,400
maybe we still just do it this way right

155
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,759
that's probably the most straightforward

156
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,959
way for the compiler to know what the

157
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
heck is going on

158
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,638
we don't ever want this to come out of

159
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
the cmd registers

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,038
so like it's not like it needs like this

161
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,199
is all just stupid syntactic

162
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:38,800
uh sugar that the compiler needs right

163
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,800
um so

164
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,839
i feel like

165
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,198
we need to tell it that we're just

166
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,879
extracting the float here but i don't

167
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,000
know i never remember

168
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:58,159
what these are right

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
i never remember what the heck the

170
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,560
actual name is

171
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,680
for that thing um

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,879
what's my syntax error here

173
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,680
just the quotes all right so let's see

174
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,560
uh we've got the convert we've got the

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,519
floor

176
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,519
we've got the set zero so it's probably

177
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:21,680
just the extra one there

178
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,680
so there we go um

179
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,839
so in order to do a floor

180
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,198
that's going to get us down to the

181
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,399
closest integer

182
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,319
boundary um

183
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,758
and so what i want to be able to do is

184
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,879
just

185
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
use that to re-center us around where

186
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,598
the

187
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,318
voxel is right and so the problem that

188
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,519
we have

189
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
if we do this floor is that it's not

190
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,279
going to be

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,000
at the right scale so

192
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,000
i want it to be based on the motion

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,519
displacement size

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,399
so i first want to uh

195
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,000
to sort of compress this space into

196
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,359
something where the integers are

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,879
along these boundaries right

198
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,598
so we want to do something that's sort

199
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,759
of like

200
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:19,918
you know uh vauxhall min corner

201
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:23,439
right we know that the from p

202
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,240
is where we are right that's where the

203
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,680
thing

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,560
starts and we know that if we floored

205
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,240
that

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,080
like so we would get um

207
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,200
the integer base so if we're at 4.5

208
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,360
or 4.7 or 4.3

209
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
we'll get four so if we wanted our

210
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
voxels to be

211
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,839
one unit long this would just be it

212
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
it would be like this right

213
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,518
where we just say hey um

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,240
let's just you know

215
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,879
uh build a voxel from the floored

216
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,759
version and

217
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:16,080
out so this would work if this were one

218
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,759
but the problem we have is it's not one

219
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
so before we do

220
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,360
the flooring we need to first compress

221
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
our space

222
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,120
into the shape where integers lie on the

223
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,959
boundary

224
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,919
right so in order to do that

225
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:34,000
i need to expand which is the opposite

226
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,399
like if i multiplied

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,120
by this right i would do the opposite

228
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,839
if i multiplied by this i would take and

229
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,159
i would

230
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,839
make it so that the integers were even

231
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,199
less correct

232
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,160
right but if i divide by

233
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,839
this then i am compressing that space

234
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,799
into the shape

235
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,600
uh that is and in this case it's an

236
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,439
expansion

237
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,800
right because this uh is 0.1

238
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,760
so by dividing i'm expanding it by 10

239
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,838
right which makes the integers fall on

240
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,039
the 0.1

241
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,240
lines so if i

242
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:19,439
do effectively the divide

243
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,759
versus multiply right if we do it like

244
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
this

245
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,200
um that will allow us

246
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:32,639
to produce a aligned version

247
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,680
of that you know uh

248
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:39,919
one one that is locked down to

249
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:48,879
the closest 0.1 right

250
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:48,879
and this is really just um we can even

251
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
you know we can treat this as a modulus

252
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,078
so another way

253
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:59,519
uh we don't have i guess a mod

254
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,000
function maybe um but that's another way

255
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,679
of doing

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,679
this like um

257
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,559
yeah so you know there's multiple ways

258
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,759
you can do it but there you go

259
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:15,039
so we floor it first we

260
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:18,000
um expand it back out

261
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,639
and off we go now in this particular

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
case

263
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,679
we want to do this for everything in the

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,839
vector

265
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,359
so we'd like to have a floor function

266
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,519
for the vector right because when we

267
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,560
compile this it should complain

268
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:36,639
because this is not actually

269
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:39,039
um mapped across vectors and you know

270
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,480
we're in c plus plus you know one of the

271
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,799
world's worst languages

272
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,680
so it it really doesn't know how to do

273
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:48,399
stuff like that and you have to get into

274
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,679
template disgusting land uh if you want

275
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,480
to try and do things like

276
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,359
automatically map floor over you know a

277
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,399
range of things

278
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,680
and so on so unlike a functional

279
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,639
programming language where this kind of

280
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,638
thing

281
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,919
is just kind of handled properly for you

282
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,720
most of the time

283
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,319
that's not you know where where we live

284
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,160
in sea land

285
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
uh so what i'd like to do is here i'll

286
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,078
just where i've got my sort of utility

287
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
functions of this form i'm just going to

288
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,359
go ahead and add that in there

289
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,040
so i'm just going to make a floor and

290
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,480
again this doesn't actually do anything

291
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,879
oh that's right i forgot we don't use

292
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,920
that

293
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,039
keyword here i changed to using function

294
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,519
one of the nice things

295
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,240
is if you change internal to function

296
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,078
then

297
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,759
the same parser can read where your

298
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,879
functions are in c

299
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,159
plus and in javascript

300
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,399
because javascript requires you to have

301
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,879
function in front of stuff so then

302
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
simple meta programming scanners will

303
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,838
find

304
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,159
either one your javascript front end

305
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,079
code or your cbs plus code

306
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,120
if you use function as a as a pound

307
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,120
defined for that but

308
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:59,360
anyway um so if we just say look

309
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,720
let's floor uh

310
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,240
the values in our vector

311
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,600
like so

312
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,519
um and off we go uh now this will know

313
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,320
like okay floor all of these

314
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,799
uh and we should have something that

315
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,879
knocks us down to the closest

316
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:24,319
uh one and then we can

317
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:28,879
expand it by that same amount here

318
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,879
and when we look um

319
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,119
at the remainder of the code it now

320
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:40,240
becomes a lot simpler

321
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,198
uh for us because we only have to test

322
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,320
the corners

323
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,319
for one like we don't have to do uh

324
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,159
we only have to test one voxel right

325
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,278
um we don't have to

326
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,719
worry about iterating over like a large

327
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,759
space or anything

328
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,000
so vox dim here right we now know

329
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:08,000
that the this will always be two

330
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,159
um we're just going to have like the min

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,078
and the max of each one

332
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:17,600
and we also know that the um

333
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:21,759
size of the cell is is

334
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,959
this uh here right

335
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,039
so we can just pre-define this as

336
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,159
and it's basically a constant it doesn't

337
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,240
change

338
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,360
uh so we don't need to compute it or

339
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,839
anything

340
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
uh and so we now have the cell

341
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,040
dimensions

342
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,320
uh the voxel dimension which is always

343
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,078
the same we have the

344
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,680
occupied uh corner codes

345
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:49,919
and that's it all right and

346
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:52,399
uh yeah so like if we look

347
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:55,439
um i don't know that we care about this

348
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,600
particularly much anymore but we might

349
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,560
um but you know there's a couple of

350
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,920
different ways

351
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,000
that we can look at this thing uh

352
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,159
we can make it significantly more

353
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,839
efficient than this

354
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:13,838
uh to say the least but

355
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,679
but i'm gonna kind of leave this in

356
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,440
place for now but we'll see what happens

357
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,799
anyway uh we'll start with the min

358
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,120
corner

359
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,078
um we'll expand that by the cell

360
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
dimension

361
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,758
that allows us to do this test is the

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,759
same as it was

363
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,199
uh and that gives us basically what the

364
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,480
occupied

365
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:41,838
um count is this is still correct

366
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,680
right um it basically tells us exactly

367
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,680
which one we want oh

368
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:54,719
that's no good um it basically tells us

369
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
uh whether or not there's any so one of

370
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,639
the things we can see very quickly here

371
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:04,079
is if the cell that we're on

372
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:08,320
is there anything in this cell um

373
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,278
that is there anything in the cell that

374
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,600
we can

375
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,799
actually consider a legal position or

376
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
not

377
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,479
and so when this any open comes back and

378
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
says

379
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,079
there's nowhere in the cell to be placed

380
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,879
that's like

381
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,239
a thing that the external so again we

382
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,679
don't know how we're this is going to

383
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,959
play out but at the moment

384
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,159
also you know what that goes away um

385
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:32,000
we don't know how this is going to play

386
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,319
out but basically what we need here is

387
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,360
to

388
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,360
that would be a clue to the external

389
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,399
part of this solver right

390
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,440
um to

391
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,078
to say you need to take some

392
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,720
action to get this object out of

393
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,599
whatever it's stuck in

394
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,079
and again to me this is again crucial to

395
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,759
build into the system because

396
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,679
we even if we assume that we do our job

397
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,558
correctly here

398
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,959
and our collision detector will never

399
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,038
place

400
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,640
two objects into a configuration where

401
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,000
they're stuck

402
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,199
the gameplay code might like we don't

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,599
want to have to

404
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,318
ensure that the gameplay code is smart

405
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,359
enough

406
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,720
to avoid that scenario we want the

407
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,438
gameplay code

408
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,360
to just be able to do whatever it does

409
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,640
and if things happen to get stuck in

410
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,399
each other

411
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,960
what we really want is we want this

412
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,519
collision detector to be so suave

413
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,798
that it will just try to figure out how

414
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,000
to get them unstuck

415
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,839
right so rather than trying to write the

416
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,359
whole game

417
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,038
thinking that we need to make sure

418
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,079
nothing ever sticks

419
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,558
what we're trying to do is make the

420
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,558
collision detector automatically unstick

421
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,678
things that get stuck in each other

422
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,279
right

423
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,759
and that's just part of making the thing

424
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,079
as robust as we can to eliminate the

425
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,839
as many possible ways that we can screw

426
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,720
the player we don't want to screw up the

427
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,240
player's

428
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,160
playthrough that's the worst possible

429
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,880
thing that technology can do in a game

430
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,720
engine

431
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,640
so we want to try to have it do the

432
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,440
opposite we want it to always be

433
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,240
trying to get the game into a playable

434
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
state

435
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,599
we don't want there to be failure states

436
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,600
where oh something got stuck

437
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,599
because the gameplay code did something

438
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,599
and now the game is ruined like we don't

439
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:26,079
want that right

440
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:28,240
so um

441
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,678
also inline we don't really inline

442
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,679
doesn't really exist anymore

443
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,600
so we've just been slowly replacing it

444
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,480
with internal like all these can be

445
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,279
inline

446
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,880
um it can be internal really i should

447
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,879
just change it to function

448
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
um because that's what i use these days

449
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,559
i i just put this in front of everything

450
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,640
it's just static is really what it is

451
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,000
inline doesn't really work anymore

452
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,280
compilers just ignore it

453
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,440
so it's kind of pointless i think

454
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,240
sometimes maybe gcc uses it a little bit

455
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,240
most compilers just ignore it

456
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,839
so yeah you know

457
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,240
it doesn't really matter anyway uh

458
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:13,759
so if we look here

459
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,960
at this any open um if

460
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,519
if the any open thing is like we can't

461
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,798
we can't find anything then i think we

462
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,519
just punt

463
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:24,160
so i think here we'll we say if any open

464
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,160
and otherwise

465
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,279
we just leave we don't try to do

466
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
anything

467
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:34,079
right um and so one thing we might do

468
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:38,160
also is not move uh the player also so

469
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:41,439
so what i kind of want here

470
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,960
is like a move result um

471
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,880
and there's like a uh found

472
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
like we found a place to put it and

473
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,520
here's the place

474
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,038
um so what i'd like to do is switch to

475
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,639
that kind of strategy

476
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,319
so the entity um itself we really aren't

477
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
using the entity

478
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,079
itself in any capacity other than we

479
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:02,639
need to look at like its collision

480
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,000
volumes

481
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,120
but we're not writing to it so

482
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,079
all we do is we say okay

483
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,558
we've got a move result we want to

484
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,558
produce

485
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,960
we start by assuming that it fails if we

486
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,279
actually get into the any open then

487
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,159
we're going to actually succeed

488
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,200
so we say yes we found a place and then

489
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,840
the question is

490
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,519
what is the place right so like what is

491
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,639
the actual

492
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,119
uh location that we're going to put the

493
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,520
player

494
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:41,439
in and so this is the part that we

495
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,359
actually have to think about

496
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,840
and we are probably going to return some

497
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:49,839
other stuff as well

498
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,359
all right so this gets kind of

499
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,280
complicated

500
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,879
uh now we have to start thinking about

501
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:02,079
this voxel in

502
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
in three different ways number one is

503
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,678
the

504
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,080
is the easy one which is can we place

505
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,320
the entity in this voxel at all are

506
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:14,000
there any legal corners

507
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:16,158
uh period right

508
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,679
and that's the way that we already did

509
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,039
like literally there's

510
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,120
many ways we can do that and we'll

511
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,279
probably change which way we use over

512
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,918
time here as we refine the routine but

513
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,119
certainly this way works if the occupied

514
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,480
count

515
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:34,239
is conclusive if if every corner

516
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,519
if all eight of the corners are occupied

517
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,720
um then we know that we cannot

518
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,240
place the entity in this cell it's

519
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,360
it's colliding so this part here is

520
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,319
saying all right if

521
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,558
if we could have placed it then it is

522
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,200
possible so that's the first way

523
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,918
we're reporting um information about the

524
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,159
voxel

525
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,600
right or about the collision that's

526
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,320
thing one

527
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:07,199
thing two uh is we need to figure out

528
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,798
if we were to place the player uh i keep

529
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
saying player but if we were to place

530
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,119
the entity because

531
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,919
this moves things that aren't the player

532
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,519
so i don't know why i keep saying that

533
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,038
if we are to place the entity in this

534
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,319
cell

535
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,599
where right so where would

536
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,038
it be placed and the problem that we're

537
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,079
going to have

538
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:32,158
right is if you look at

539
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,439
the if you look at the way we're doing

540
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,360
this

541
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,558
you can see like we do a get closest

542
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,158
point

543
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,279
in box for example and you can see like

544
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,679
we say

545
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,399
uh so you know if we produced the cell

546
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,840
and we said

547
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,960
we wanted to get the closest point to

548
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:52,879
um to the target point this would give

549
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,880
us that right

550
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,520
so you might assume well well use that

551
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,760
the reason that we can't exactly use

552
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,759
that

553
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:09,839
is

554
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:51,839
so i feel kind of stupid

555
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,399
because if i'm not mistaken

556
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,119
all you would have to do is start at the

557
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,879
start location

558
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:17,278
from p get the closest

559
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,400
point to the target point inside the

560
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,798
cell

561
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,798
and then just repeatedly bisect that

562
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,798
until you found a place you could stand

563
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,839
and that gives you actually the exact

564
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,839
answer

565
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,440
the reason that i feel really stupid is

566
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:52,000
because i feel like that would have just

567
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,000
worked in the witness solver

568
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,038
and would have saved like half the run

569
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:01,839
time of that solver

570
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,839
if i'd thought of that

571
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,759
then now granted

572
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,759
all of the stuff i did on the witness

573
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,679
was completely new

574
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,798
and so i was figuring all of that stuff

575
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,559
out and

576
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,000
that always is the case when you first

577
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,200
figure stuff out you don't have the

578
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
mental model for it

579
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,038
so you're not likely to make

580
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,960
realizations i don't blame myself for

581
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,278
that because the witness stuff was all

582
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,919
very new very difficult

583
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:43,839
and was surprising that it all came out

584
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:43,840
the way it did

585
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:51,519
so no you know what i think i think

586
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,960
that it's okay that it wouldn't have

587
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,119
worked on the witness one because the

588
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,960
witness one requires that the

589
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:01,278
person is standing on the ground

590
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,720
and that makes a big difference because

591
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,720
that means you have to move

592
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,558
along a manifold and you don't know what

593
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,960
the manifold is

594
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,000
because this is for floating objects

595
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,038
that's why this would

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,798
work it doesn't need to know it doesn't

597
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,798
need to move along a manifold

598
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:25,840
so i maybe give myself

599
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,879
i maybe give myself credit for that

600
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
so

601
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:39,199
so i wonder about the witnesses why does

602
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,558
the player not move on a nav mesh then

603
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,360
you wouldn't have needed the brute force

604
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,558
testing thing

605
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:47,678
um well so

606
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,079
there's a couple reasons for that one is

607
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,600
that

608
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,678
you still need the way to build the nav

609
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,839
mesh so the witness does have a nav mesh

610
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,720
for like the ipad version

611
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,119
and it uses my solver to build the nav

612
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,679
mesh

613
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,278
so you could think of the thing as

614
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,000
building the nav mesh but the reason

615
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,759
that

616
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
it doesn't use a nav mesh for the

617
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,640
movement

618
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,919
uh is is just literally be for accuracy

619
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,799
and efficiency

620
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,840
right if you build a nav mesh now you

621
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,400
have a

622
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,519
either a very coarse nav mesh that feels

623
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,960
crappy

624
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,200
right which is what you have in like

625
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,319
unity or something and that's why nobody

626
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,640
uses it for

627
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,639
movement they still use the collision

628
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,080
detector for movement

629
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,640
um or you

630
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,558
uh you have a nav mesh that's super

631
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,880
super detailed

632
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:37,839
and it's huge and creates a resource

633
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,840
loading problem

634
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,558
and it puts stress on the streamer and

635
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:45,839
all this sort of stuff right

636
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:48,398
so the beauty of the witness one is it

637
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,678
works in 100 real time it

638
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,959
it doesn't have to make a super coarse

639
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,640
version of anything

640
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:00,079
it can let you feel exact movement

641
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,640
um you know it's just better and there's

642
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,759
no

643
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,480
baking it's instant it's always live

644
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,079
for the people who are editing and

645
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,798
working on the game

646
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,199
so it's just better because the witness

647
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,158
one

648
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,759
can do either if you want a navmesh you

649
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,200
can just take the output of it and

650
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,480
there's your nav mesh

651
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,360
um you can reduce the density of it as

652
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,599
much as you

653
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,918
think you want to right um

654
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,678
or you just don't bother and you just

655
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,480
let it run on the exact geometry and it

656
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,720
works

657
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,120
right um so it's kind of just a superset

658
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,200
of nav mesh it's just like the better

659
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,239
version of navmesh if you want navmesh

660
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,360
you have it

661
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,200
if you know you can't or don't want to

662
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,398
do pre-computation pass or you want

663
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,480
things to be more detailed

664
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,759
or you have tons of dynamic things maybe

665
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
that's the other thing in the witness

666
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,440
there's lots of stuff that moves around

667
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,000
elevators platforms all this stuff

668
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,640
that makes nav meshes kind of difficult

669
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,960
because

670
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,000
what do you do at the boundaries between

671
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,600
those meshes

672
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,839
you need a solution for that that's

673
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,519
rigorous right

674
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,439
so nav meshes really aren't a solution

675
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,839
to anything to be completely honest

676
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,360
uh you kind of still need an answer for

677
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,678
how do you build the nav mesh what do

678
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,000
you do with all of your dynamic stuff

679
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,840
blah blah blah and so the witness thing

680
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,278
is just the superset solution it's like

681
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,720
look this just works

682
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:24,159
right and if you want the features of a

683
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,679
navmesh you can get them if you don't

684
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,200
want to deal with all the drawbacks of

685
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,159
nah meshes you just don't have to

686
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,360
you can just not do that and in the

687
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
witness we did both

688
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,519
so in the witness for click to move you

689
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,880
want a pathfinder so there's like a

690
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,798
rough thing that that's that

691
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,278
right me and john blair are on the same

692
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:46,480
team

693
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:51,599
spiritually we're not on the same team

694
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,599
physically all right

695
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,760
i wonder if what i just said actually

696
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,120
works which is

697
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,519
kind of nuts if it does so

698
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,519
um

699
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,839
i don't know

700
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,880
i don't know but it kind of feels like

701
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:14,879
it would

702
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,360
so uh i guess what i'm what i'm trying

703
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,158
to say is like suppose that you pulled

704
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,398
this

705
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,919
piece of junk out which is the part that

706
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,519
we want

707
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,278
after we're done making sure that this

708
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,798
routine works well

709
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:32,319
it's the part that we'll replace with

710
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,000
the spatial partition

711
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:38,879
because this this is the core cost

712
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,839
of this routine and this ain't gonna fly

713
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,679
right so

714
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,199
this will be a local lookup that just

715
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,038
gathers the things that are right next

716
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,399
to you for testing

717
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:50,960
um and so we want this to be isolated

718
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,959
probably for other reasons anyway but

719
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,200
assuming that we just do a thing that's

720
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,480
like uh

721
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,679
can place or collides

722
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,759
at p or i don't know what um

723
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,880
assuming that we have this and we put

724
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,200
pass in

725
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,039
the stuff that we need for uh

726
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,360
determining whether you can stand

727
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,398
somewhere right so you basically say

728
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,158
like

729
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,839
you know here's the thing this will be

730
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,120
you know a space partition thing it's at

731
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,319
some point or something or this will

732
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,518
just have the face participation

733
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,599
who cares the entity goes in here uh

734
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,000
the p that we're trying to test goes in

735
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,558
there and we literally just go

736
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,558
and say all right this is the

737
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,678
rectangular testing we would iterate

738
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,839
over the spatial partition

739
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,960
we see whether or not we're supposed to

740
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,240
have a collision here

741
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,278
we do that test uh and then we produce

742
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,359
the result here

743
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,880
so you know we would do a thing that's

744
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,918
like results

745
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,080
equals false it does not collide here

746
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,240
the result equals true

747
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:56,960
it does collide and that is the loop

748
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,960
so in here we would say uh rather than

749
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:04,079
all this stuff we just do

750
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:08,159
this part just this test

751
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:11,359
and we call out to collides at p

752
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,480
and we say sim region and the

753
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,038
test speed now i knew maybe why did we

754
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,319
do that

755
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:29,839
right well now i can call that

756
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:29,839
uh in a refinement loop right

757
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:34,879
um

758
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:56,879
what who who is biddle it's not like

759
00:32:43,759 --> 00:33:00,398
mike biddlecombe is it

760
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,399
no way really

761
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:11,839
you serious

762
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,079
no you don't need a code word well great

763
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,120
to see you

764
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:50,398
how's it going i think the last time i

765
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:54,119
saw you was at handmade con

766
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:57,759
uh 20 20 20

767
00:33:54,119 --> 00:34:00,079
19 would have been the one

768
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,079
uh

769
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,599
that was the last one that was like in

770
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,240
person right

771
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,239
how's it going

772
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,000
what are you up to

773
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:24,320
you in canada now

774
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,319
in the great the great northern expanse

775
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,000
or are you back in the states

776
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,599
mike biddlecon ladies and gentlemen he

777
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,760
is uh a

778
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,760
person i work with a long time ago he is

779
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,079
from canada

780
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,079
and but he was working in the states at

781
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,359
the time

782
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:55,839
and then he went back in vancouver yeah

783
00:34:51,358 --> 00:35:02,000
vancouver is a really nice nice place

784
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:05,519
um anyway thanks for stopping by mike

785
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,920
to see you um

786
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,880
so the the thing that mike biddlecombe

787
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,960
was amused to

788
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,960
to see me realize um

789
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:20,480
is

790
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:22,559
if we are moving in 3d it means that

791
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,480
fundamentally we don't have to move

792
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,880
across any particular manifold like

793
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,079
we're just moving this thing across

794
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,039
just across space so once we

795
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,200
know if we test the sides of the cell

796
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,400
and we just make that be our criteria

797
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,279
for are you allowed to

798
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,240
move in this cell we can then place the

799
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,519
person

800
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:46,239
uh the entity anywhere in the cell right

801
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,639
because we know we know that the rule

802
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,879
for

803
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,400
could you be in this cell is are any of

804
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,160
the eight

805
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,200
uh sides of the cell vacant or not right

806
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,000
so then we can just do hey if we know

807
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,279
that we can

808
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,358
place a person in this cell let's just

809
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,839
root find to find out where

810
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,279
right now there is one case that this

811
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:08,559
won't handle correctly

812
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,040
that we'll have to think about and

813
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:14,320
that's if the place that you're in

814
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:17,519
if you're already in

815
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,200
actually it would it'd probably handle

816
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:23,358
that too

817
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:26,799
so if you're already in then you just

818
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:30,880
look for the out position

819
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,160
this might actually be really awesome um

820
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,720
so here's what happens you now have the

821
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,679
cell

822
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,399
the cell doesn't this is stupid we don't

823
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,639
really need this

824
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,320
there's because there's only one cell

825
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,159
right i mean we we stopped

826
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,160
you've got a min and max corner so like

827
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:49,358
the cell is just

828
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:52,838
is just that

829
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:55,679
right because we're only doing one

830
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:58,799
now uh so

831
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:02,399
in here we we go into

832
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,240
the uh the routine we check to see

833
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,680
whether it's legal to place

834
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:08,000
anyone in this cell at all uh we can now

835
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,078
just

836
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,079
root find to see whether we can uh

837
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,599
whether they're where in the cell we can

838
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,599
place that's closest to where you were

839
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:23,838
trying to go

840
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,838
and my i don't know

841
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,280
i can talk a little bit about why i want

842
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,960
to do that two-level thing because you

843
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,720
might be like well why not just do that

844
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,480
root find in general

845
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,959
and there are reasons i don't want to do

846
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,440
the root find as the definitive thing

847
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,440
because

848
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,920
i'll talk a little bit more about why i

849
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,119
think we want

850
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,079
two different rules for how that would

851
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,400
work

852
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:55,599
is is all i'll say about that for now

853
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,440
okay so let's suppose that we

854
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,359
then go ahead and and want to do this

855
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,480
test so if we

856
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,639
do a uh

857
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,920
[Music]

858
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:08,559
a collides at p test to see about

859
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,519
where we're standing so the from the

860
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,279
from position

861
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:16,000
like where we are right

862
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,599
um if we look at at whether or not

863
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,880
that's in or out

864
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,160
so a starting state

865
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,000
is this so where we are standing

866
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:33,838
we know the starting state in the future

867
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,838
we can probably elide this so uh

868
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:40,079
so we probably know which one that is

869
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,919
because the last thing told us but for

870
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,440
now we'll just recheck it

871
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,320
so we look and we say are we colliding

872
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,880
and then we then binary search for a

873
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,280
place

874
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,760
where that's going to be uh

875
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,680
where we satisfy the other criteria

876
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,960
right

877
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:04,639
um and the only thing

878
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,358
that i the only thing that

879
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,159
i think we probably want to add is some

880
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,239
awareness

881
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:16,719
of the state of the voxel sides

882
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,719
so if all of the voxel sides

883
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,159
i

884
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,440
i'm not sure how i want to use that

885
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,079
information in this part so i don't know

886
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,200
yet

887
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,880
but point being um

888
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,879
in this case we know what our starting

889
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,320
state is and i want to do

890
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,720
um a refinement here uh

891
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,359
so there's just gonna be you know a few

892
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,439
steps

893
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,519
of refinement and i don't know how many

894
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,358
i want this is basically a tolerance

895
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,039
that can be like

896
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:57,838
cranked uh and

897
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,920
so what we can do is as we do our

898
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:03,039
refinement

899
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,480
uh we will bisect

900
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:09,679
the difference between our from p

901
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,079
and our 2p to get like a place where we

902
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,759
think

903
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,440
we can stand so the like

904
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,960
uh you know this would be like the

905
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,159
the test the t-test right

906
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,519
is gonna start at 0.5 let's say

907
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:30,639
so then to compute the test point

908
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:33,838
we're going to do a

909
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:33,838
linear interpolation

910
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,839
we still need this

911
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:46,879
so here's the the like local target p

912
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,318
like i mean i guess this is like the the

913
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,119
place we're trying to get to inside the

914
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,440
cell we can't leave the cell

915
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,318
um so we're going to say all right the

916
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
local

917
00:40:54,318 --> 00:41:00,079
uh 2p oh and there's so

918
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,039
there's one more thing about this too so

919
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,000
there's even

920
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:10,159
one more thing which is uh

921
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,800
do the refinement step only at the end

922
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,598
right so another aspect of this is

923
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,160
actually

924
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,039
this probably doesn't have to happen we

925
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,440
probably

926
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,559
can just do this at the end so the

927
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,280
refinement step

928
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,159
only happens in the final voxel cell

929
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,960
right

930
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:28,960
so to me i think um

931
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,078
it probably looks more like this where

932
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,358
we only

933
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,440
do we we first do the voxel to figure

934
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,239
out which voxel you're in and we let you

935
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,240
move through there

936
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:48,719
and then here we just say oh okay

937
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:52,079
at the end of all this

938
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:55,358
uh then we take and we do you know

939
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,240
we assume that you pass in um

940
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,000
the voxel that you're talking about so

941
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,318
this is the cell

942
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,838
uh we assume that you're gonna have the

943
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,318
stuff that you needed

944
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:09,039
uh which obviously you know you need you

945
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,039
need this stuff

946
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:19,519
so at the end after everything's done

947
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,199
when you are you have figured out what

948
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,759
voxel cell you have you have

949
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,719
determined that the player uh or the

950
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,520
entity i should say

951
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,159
will end up in then you call refined

952
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,639
voxel placement only on the final cell

953
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,318
and then what you do is you take that

954
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:35,358
target location you see where in the

955
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,400
cell

956
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:40,559
that would map to the closest point

957
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,680
and then you refine towards that to

958
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,159
place the entity

959
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,559
as close as possible to the correct

960
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,559
position

961
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
how do you like that that's a good

962
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:59,838
spelling there

963
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,838
doesn't matter um

964
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,240
okay so what we want to do

965
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:13,838
is we are trying to find

966
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:13,838
i guess

967
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,039
i'll show you why we need this um in a

968
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,759
second

969
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,480
but assuming that we started out in a

970
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,480
position

971
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,079
where we weren't right so so we could

972
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,400
just say like you know

973
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,680
a starting state equals you know it's

974
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,800
not colliding or whatever

975
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,039
right um but assuming that we started

976
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,280
out

977
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,079
colliding the reason that i need to know

978
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,400
that

979
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,560
is because if you think about the binary

980
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,838
search process that's about to happen

981
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,358
what we're doing is we're saying all

982
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,559
right there's a test point we're going

983
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,400
to start in the middle

984
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:55,838
we're going to take the local 2p right

985
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,838
and we're going to linear blend

986
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,519
do we not have a linear blend

987
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:12,719
okay it's called lerp for some reason

988
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,839
um so if we take a look uh we can call

989
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:18,959
lerp to uh use the t

990
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:22,078
value to say where from

991
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,760
you know the the starting location

992
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:29,039
to the local target right

993
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,240
we we take a half step

994
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:35,679
and then on each time we say

995
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:38,318
for that test p um

996
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,199
does it collide doesn't it collide you

997
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:41,519
know

998
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:41,519
oops

999
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,358
so we check to see whether it collides

1000
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:53,199
if it does collide um

1001
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,039
let's pretend that we are not going to

1002
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,239
use this yet we're pretending that we

1003
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,440
always start

1004
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:01,519
safe so we start uncolliding if it does

1005
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,920
collide it means we've gone too far

1006
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,280
right we've we've stepped into the

1007
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,280
colliding zone

1008
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,480
so we need to step back if if we

1009
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,680
don't collide it means we could

1010
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,119
potentially go further so we need to

1011
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,440
step forward

1012
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,280
so what we want to do is say like oh

1013
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:23,039
okay you know our t-test

1014
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,040
um is going to have a step to it

1015
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,279
uh that step is going to start out at

1016
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,799
whatever the half is

1017
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,640
and each time we're going to shrink it

1018
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,839
by half right

1019
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:37,440
so the t-test is going to take and

1020
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:41,679
we're going to um uh

1021
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,800
we're going to add or subtract

1022
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:48,239
one of those two things um

1023
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,240
and i don't

1024
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,838
i i think we probably want to do this

1025
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:01,838
uh

1026
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,960
so i think we probably want to do

1027
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,960
something like uh

1028
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:18,400
we want to take t-test

1029
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,519
and we want to say that like t-test

1030
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,960
equals

1031
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:26,318
t equals like um t-test

1032
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,960
plus collides um or you know

1033
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,239
you could do this like uh we make the

1034
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,280
two steps here

1035
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:36,399
so there's a t forward uh t

1036
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:41,440
backward right

1037
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:44,880
um or maybe like t collides

1038
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:48,000
t uh safe or something

1039
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,960
i don't know i and these are just

1040
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,599
t-test like if we collide it's like

1041
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,159
t-test

1042
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,599
minus t-step and if it's it's not it's

1043
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,399
it's plus t-step

1044
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,960
right so if we collide we come back if

1045
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,280
it's

1046
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,800
safe we go forward and so you can see

1047
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,040
now why i want this starting

1048
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,359
state because if i know that we're in

1049
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,519
collision begin with it's the opposite

1050
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,719
so i need to do a thing where at that

1051
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:12,719
point i say like oh

1052
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,800
um if the starting state

1053
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:24,159
actually was colliding then the t

1054
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:27,839
step is the negative right we

1055
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:29,118
flip it around so that when we add

1056
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,119
we're actually subtracting and we

1057
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,358
subtract we actually add

1058
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,039
so we assume that the starting state is

1059
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,039
clean in most cases

1060
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,239
it means that t step will be positive in

1061
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,000
most cases

1062
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,078
which means that when we look and we say

1063
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,559
we collided right

1064
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,680
we want to step back so it's a minus

1065
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,480
right

1066
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,279
okay so that also means this is

1067
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,039
branchless

1068
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,480
which doesn't matter because there's a

1069
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,679
ton of branches in the probably in the

1070
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,440
collision detection part of things but

1071
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:56,078
we can optimize that we can do whatever

1072
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,880
we want

1073
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,160
we've got lots of options um anyway so

1074
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,440
if it collides we will t

1075
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:05,838
collide if it doesn't we will t safe

1076
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,480
right um those are the options that we

1077
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:08,400
had and

1078
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,920
this will root find us to the best

1079
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,039
position to place

1080
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,079
uh this thing like the result right

1081
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,639
and so at the end we sort of have our

1082
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,960
last

1083
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:24,159
best position um that we didn't collide

1084
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,280
so we can save right

1085
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:29,598
like we can say that we have um

1086
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,960
a result p it's going to be equal to

1087
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,760
where we started

1088
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,318
each time here that there is a safe

1089
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,599
place

1090
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:40,960
to put this so if we say like

1091
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:44,640
you know if um

1092
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:48,240
we didn't collide then the result p

1093
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:50,000
equals the test p right um and so again

1094
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,519
we can also phrase that this way

1095
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,358
just in case we want to try and be

1096
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:57,039
squinky about it

1097
00:48:53,358 --> 00:49:00,400
um if you know if it doesn't collide

1098
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:02,960
uh or we can still say if it collides

1099
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,599
we take whatever the previous result was

1100
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,599
if um

1101
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:19,679
if not then we take the new one right

1102
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,960
all right so this is the iterative

1103
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,039
refinement step so

1104
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,800
again just to everyone i realize close

1105
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,239
detection is very difficult

1106
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,720
i realize all this stuff is really

1107
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:32,399
complicated

1108
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:36,078
so i apologize for that uh

1109
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,119
but you know

1110
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,480
what can you do let me explain briefly

1111
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,358
what's going on

1112
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,800
one more time for folks uh because like

1113
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,719
i said it's complicated

1114
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,839
so you know i've got it in my head and

1115
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,679
i'm working it out and

1116
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:53,279
i'm trying to explain it as i go but i

1117
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,558
realize that like i'm seeing pictures

1118
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,559
that you're not seeing

1119
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,760
in my head right uh and so that's why we

1120
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,319
go to the light board sometimes i don't

1121
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,119
really want to do that right now but

1122
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,239
if we do refine voxel placement what

1123
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,559
we're basically saying is we've

1124
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,519
determined that we can place the player

1125
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,519
in this cell and

1126
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:15,440
the reason for these uh two

1127
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:17,440
um the reason for these two things oh

1128
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,800
and we need we also need obviously to

1129
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,480
make this loop actually work

1130
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:25,359
uh we need to half it each time

1131
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,079
anyway um so we do refine voxel

1132
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,440
placement

1133
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,440
we come in here what we're saying is

1134
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,358
it's legal to be placed in the cell

1135
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,159
so we've determined that we can place

1136
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:38,078
the entity in this cell

1137
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:41,279
that means that that cell is traversable

1138
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:44,160
and so we're not gonna worry about mike

1139
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,680
about where in the cell you place the

1140
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,239
entities as being

1141
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,919
legal or illegal right we're saying you

1142
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:50,558
can place the entity anywhere in this

1143
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,720
cell

1144
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,519
because the rules of how you move things

1145
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,838
allowed that to occur

1146
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,599
so now all we're doing is trying to get

1147
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,759
a ballpark figure

1148
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,838
for where in the cell it probably should

1149
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,119
be we don't care

1150
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:08,719
if we overshoot or undershoot like if

1151
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,480
there really was something

1152
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,078
that you could have walked you know you

1153
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,960
could have moved around

1154
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,680
in the cell or if you allows you to

1155
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,559
tunnel through

1156
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:22,078
something that's fine because we're

1157
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:24,319
actually handling the legality of that

1158
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,000
at one layer up we're basically saying

1159
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:26,719
look the voxel pattern is what

1160
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,838
determines

1161
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:37,838
where you can place stuff right

1162
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:37,838
um if that makes sense right

1163
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,280
uh so that's how we're gonna do that

1164
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,960
that placement there and again that's

1165
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,200
because

1166
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,639
one of the things that i really think is

1167
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,159
important for

1168
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:57,358
collision detection work in games is

1169
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:00,558
accuracy is not at all what you want

1170
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:02,960
what you want is that things always can

1171
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,920
get out of being stuck

1172
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,920
so you pretty much don't ever want to be

1173
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,039
thinking about things like oh

1174
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,639
at a very small scale i need to find

1175
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,719
exactly where this can move and i need

1176
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:15,358
to prevent it from going through other

1177
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,639
things

1178
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,639
you're just setting yourself up for

1179
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:19,440
everything getting stuck what you want

1180
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,480
is

1181
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,000
coarsely can the thing be roughly in

1182
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,039
this area

1183
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,159
if it can place it reasonably

1184
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:32,480
and allow yourself a lot of freedom to

1185
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,558
place it anywhere there because you

1186
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,838
you need to give the collision detection

1187
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,319
response

1188
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,279
part of the code as much opportunity to

1189
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,880
get things

1190
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:46,640
unstuck as you can

1191
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,559
so focusing on accuracy of

1192
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:49,838
whether or not two things could have

1193
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,480
moved past each other

1194
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,679
or could have done this or that is never

1195
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,079
really a good idea

1196
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:56,799
in my opinion you want to focus instead

1197
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,599
on

1198
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,160
options giving the collision detection a

1199
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,359
lot of

1200
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:06,480
options to put things

1201
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,799
somewhere that works so that's mostly

1202
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,240
the

1203
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,079
the way in which we're approaching this

1204
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:14,719
this routine is just for iterative

1205
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,599
refinement it's to place something in a

1206
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,318
more plausible location to the viewer's

1207
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,359
eye

1208
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:23,279
is the way to think of it it does not we

1209
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,279
don't want it to control

1210
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,200
whether you could do something right

1211
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,240
it's just to try and give the most

1212
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,239
plausibly visually pleasant result so

1213
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,558
that root find is there for that

1214
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,919
and that alone we don't know what we

1215
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,280
want this to be

1216
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,039
um you could if you want it to be

1217
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,920
accurate to floating point precision you

1218
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:46,239
could do that right

1219
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,680
and now you're out of precision your

1220
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:51,679
floating point numbers can't

1221
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:53,440
really do any more than 24 bisections

1222
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:54,960
i don't know that we'll need that many

1223
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,880
i'm going to leave it at a low number

1224
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,838
for now we might crank it up higher

1225
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,358
once this is not once this has a spatial

1226
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,838
partition so it's fast

1227
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,239
right but right now this is going to be

1228
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,000
dog slow because each one of these calls

1229
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,078
is going to have to loop over all the

1230
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,079
entities right so we know it will be

1231
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,559
unbearably slow to start with so i'm not

1232
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,720
going to crank this up or try to find

1233
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,400
what this number should be right now

1234
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:20,000
we're going to

1235
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,800
do the space partition before we play

1236
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,039
with that all right

1237
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,280
so refined voxel placement

1238
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:29,279
um

1239
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,119
we now know that we can just call that

1240
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,039
at the end

1241
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,160
um and so we know that the end of this

1242
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,838
routine

1243
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:42,558
here is just going to look uh like this

1244
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,119
so the refined voxel placement part of

1245
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,400
this

1246
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:53,358
here is going to have

1247
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:56,160
all the stuff it needs um

1248
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:57,199
we assume we're sort of setting a target

1249
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,358
now

1250
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,798
for this by the time it gets into this

1251
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:01,519
routine it should have all of these

1252
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,519
things

1253
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:04,639
the cell in which we would like to place

1254
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,920
the entity

1255
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,960
the region uh which we know because

1256
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,798
that's already

1257
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,400
you know just a given the entity we're

1258
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,199
placing obviously also known

1259
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,838
and then if the 2p is always going to

1260
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,000
stay the same

1261
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:20,000
that's where we want this thing to end

1262
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,760
up so that's

1263
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,358
a separate issue we don't have to touch

1264
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,400
the from p

1265
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:29,598
may have translated it may have

1266
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:34,240
moved from cell to cell

1267
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:36,880
as we go right um so that part is also

1268
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:39,759
uh sort of a little bit uh different and

1269
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,720
i'm not sure how we want to handle it

1270
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,960
one way would be to map it into the cell

1271
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,679
at the beginning as well

1272
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,159
so it just teleports to there another

1273
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:50,719
way

1274
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,279
is it gets convected along in like the

1275
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,078
center

1276
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,599
of the voxel faces as we go and we

1277
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,079
assume you had to come around

1278
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,079
that way

1279
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:07,358
that's arguably the more accurate thing

1280
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,599
i just don't know if it would ever make

1281
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:09,358
an

1282
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,599
a practical difference so it might just

1283
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:14,480
be a lot of bookkeeping that's happening

1284
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,480
for no reason

1285
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,639
right

1286
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,159
and that's a really hard judgment call

1287
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:23,199
so i suspect

1288
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,920
what i'll do to start with is i'll just

1289
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:27,279
say look

1290
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,838
the first pass of this thing is going to

1291
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,839
be

1292
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:31,838
uh

1293
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:39,920
is we're gonna map in that and you know

1294
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:43,759
what the heck with it

1295
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,880
like let's do that both sides so the 2

1296
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,400
the 2p here we won't do a local it'll

1297
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,079
just be assumed

1298
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:55,200
right so we'll just say like note

1299
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:58,720
uh it is expected that from p

1300
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:02,000
to p have already been mapped

1301
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:03,838
into the cell right so

1302
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
so we're just not going to do that part

1303
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:12,000
that part has to have already happened

1304
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:15,039
so in here we have um

1305
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,760
both of these now will map the from and

1306
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,159
the two and we'll pass both of those in

1307
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,200
and

1308
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:23,920
that's just how we'll start and this

1309
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:25,679
one is probably just right like that is

1310
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:30,318
probably how the routine should work

1311
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,318
this one might not be so so

1312
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:43,679
right

1313
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:45,358
so hair studios i i study cinematography

1314
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,118
for rendering reasons

1315
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:50,318
so when it came time i said i'm gonna

1316
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:53,760
upgrade the actual look of the webcam

1317
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:57,119
i was like uh let me

1318
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,680
light this as if it was gonna be a pro

1319
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,880
grade

1320
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,399
thing and uh i

1321
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,720
uh don't want to give away too many

1322
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,119
secrets but let me just say that that

1323
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,959
i guarantee you that nobody else in the

1324
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,400
world

1325
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,400
did lighting the way i did it

1326
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,240
it is a a uh a technique i have never

1327
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,880
seen

1328
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,239
mentioned anywhere i was very proud of

1329
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,119
it uh

1330
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,519
when i came up with it because i was

1331
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,079
like

1332
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:33,280
that is really good uh

1333
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:36,559
and um and it worked

1334
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:40,400
very well i was i was i was uh

1335
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:43,519
inappropriately proud of of my lighting

1336
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,798
um my idea for lighting and i think i'm

1337
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:47,599
glad you liked it because i thought it

1338
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:47,599
came out really good

1339
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:55,759
all right um so

1340
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:58,078
yeah refined voxel placement

1341
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,079
um

1342
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,839
move entity locally so yeah i guess now

1343
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,640
we just need to do the pathfind part

1344
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:10,318
this part's fine this now just goes away

1345
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,879
right so we're not going to do

1346
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:12,880
any of this

1347
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,280
that goes away and so what we're gonna

1348
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,480
do here

1349
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:25,519
is uh you know th

1350
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:30,480
this is the most sensitive um part

1351
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:30,480
of the um

1352
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,920
this is the this is the most time

1353
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,920
like

1354
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:42,480
continuous stuff is usually better in

1355
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,798
when you're writing

1356
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,880
it you just do float computations and it

1357
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,960
works right

1358
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,640
the discrete part is always the part

1359
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,599
where things get

1360
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:54,558
hairy because it's bookkeeping and so

1361
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,920
what we need here

1362
00:59:54,559 --> 01:00:01,920
is we need to start inside of oxycel

1363
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:05,440
we need to figure out which direction

1364
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:09,200
in voxel cells to move

1365
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:13,119
and the really uh annoying

1366
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:15,838
thing is we need to figure out a way

1367
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,838
to

1368
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:21,759
we need to figure out a way to figure

1369
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:29,838
out when to terminate

1370
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:29,839
right so

1371
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:39,838
i mean maybe the answer is you terminate

1372
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,838
when the closest point

1373
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,119
would be uh

1374
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:50,239
i mean you so i think you're going to

1375
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,838
want to do something where you basically

1376
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,879
say look we look to see

1377
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:55,440
what corners are open we allow movement

1378
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,519
to this

1379
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,639
neighboring cells that have those open

1380
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:02,239
corners

1381
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:11,838
and the problem is just knowing

1382
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:11,838
knowing when to stop looking at cells

1383
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,440
i mean i think what you would do i guess

1384
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,039
is you say

1385
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:28,639
look i i move towards the cell that is

1386
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:31,679
the closest one to the target point

1387
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:35,838
on each step and i stop when

1388
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:37,759
there are no cells i can move to

1389
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:41,279
that would be closer than the cell that

1390
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,280
i'm in and then i refine

1391
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,559
yeah my glasses broke i talked about the

1392
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,920
beginning of the stream my glasses

1393
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:52,720
broke and

1394
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,240
i only need correction in one eye so i

1395
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,639
just kept the one

1396
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,318
and i ordered new glasses and i'm like

1397
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,400
now i'm a monocle

1398
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,239
i'm a i'm the super villain i always

1399
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:06,079
wanted to be

1400
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:09,439
but now i gotta wait

1401
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:12,640
for new glasses to come um

1402
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,880
and get delivered right

1403
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:16,318
i'll do a stream at some point i'll try

1404
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,920
to put up a video

1405
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,599
separately that like talks about how i

1406
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,960
did the lighting

1407
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:25,359
um i should probably do that um

1408
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,400
i should put up a video that's like you

1409
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,519
know

1410
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,720
that's like you all youtube and it's

1411
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,199
like

1412
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:34,000
how to make the perfect lighting for 50

1413
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,279
or whatever right

1414
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,480
and it's got like me like on

1415
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,798
like on the like as a little thing on it

1416
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,159
it just says fifty dollar lighting

1417
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,559
or whatever fifty dollar perfect

1418
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:51,038
lighting no way or would it write or

1419
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,039
you know like that stupid crap um

1420
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,559
that uh

1421
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,440
[Music]

1422
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,960
that that is that is like uh what we

1423
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,400
need and then there can be like real

1424
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,039
cinematographer

1425
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,760
reacts to casey's crazy lighting setup

1426
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:06,799
or whatever

1427
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,480
right like and then someone else makes

1428
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,318
money off the video and we all make

1429
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,240
money off of reacting to each other's

1430
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:16,159
stupid idea

1431
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:19,519
right um

1432
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,519
so you know

1433
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,960
i agree there needs to be arrows in the

1434
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,839
thumbnail

1435
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,838
for sure

1436
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,159
for sure

1437
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:41,598
get cinema quality lighting with this

1438
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,599
one weird trick

1439
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:50,480
all right uh so in the move entity call

1440
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:53,679
um i think what i wanna do right is say

1441
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,039
okay so this thing

1442
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:56,558
like i said i don't know what these

1443
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,000
routines are gonna look like but it's

1444
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,119
sort of starting to fall into place

1445
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:04,719
now right we kind of know that

1446
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:06,000
this is what it is that looks right

1447
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,759
it doesn't really need to be a separate

1448
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,039
routine it could be moving but it's it's

1449
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,240
well enough you know it's fine it's well

1450
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,920
enough like

1451
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:17,759
constrained um and contained

1452
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,680
there that that we can leave that way

1453
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,319
this is now probably just

1454
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,078
actually the routine so i don't think

1455
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:26,798
we're actually going to want to call

1456
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,599
quote unquote this or any of that stuff

1457
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:29,358
so i think

1458
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,119
we're probably going to want to just do

1459
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:33,038
it right in here

1460
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,880
so i'm going to weld these routines back

1461
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,480
together again like we had actually

1462
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,000
pulled that out and i'm going to stop

1463
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,760
doing that

1464
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,280
and i think we're now going to do the

1465
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,760
setup in here

1466
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:50,798
so the cell dim is always the same

1467
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:54,480
right uh that's the size of our voxel

1468
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:56,719
and and off it goes

1469
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,838
and then i'm going to have a for loop

1470
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,239
here right

1471
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,558
that's just going to loop until it can't

1472
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:05,679
move to a closer cell

1473
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:07,039
so we'll have some metric maybe from the

1474
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:11,838
center of the cell

1475
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,839
to the target destination or something

1476
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,838
and this is kind of the part that's a

1477
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,838
little bit tricky it's like

1478
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,559
we may the reason this is why i didn't

1479
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:31,519
immediately weld this routine

1480
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,119
in we may want to call this routine to

1481
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:35,280
get better answers by

1482
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,200
doing the refinement on more than one

1483
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,000
cell because if two cells

1484
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,519
are within a a certain we don't know how

1485
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,239
close we can do

1486
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:45,599
um in each one oh yes the tip

1487
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,038
professional cinematographers do not

1488
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,960
want you to know that is

1489
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:53,200
yes that is it

1490
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,199
right

1491
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:05,358
um all right so

1492
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:07,598
if we assume that we are

1493
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:07,598
uh

1494
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:15,519
if we assume that we're going to take

1495
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:17,519
this uh

1496
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:19,358
and and loop through and move really the

1497
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,798
only problem is is making that judgment

1498
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:22,078
call like i said because everything else

1499
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:25,440
now i think just sort of

1500
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:29,599
happens um so we kind of have this idea

1501
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:31,760
of a um like

1502
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,440
of a walk point like we're walking

1503
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:37,280
through this vauxhall

1504
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:41,200
and i i don't know what this is for

1505
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:44,000
um this is just stupid now uh

1506
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:45,279
that is true that's a true that to do is

1507
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,880
is not a joke

1508
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:50,240
um so that's there uh but we're gonna go

1509
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,920
ahead and start with the walk p

1510
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,759
thing and we're gonna say all right we

1511
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,200
have a walk p that's the point that

1512
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,640
we're testing

1513
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:02,318
um and maybe maybe

1514
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:04,719
uh that gets like re-centered in a way

1515
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:06,000
so you know maybe that just walks from

1516
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:10,159
cell to cell in fact

1517
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,599
in fact uh that's probably what we'd do

1518
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:17,358
so we start this way um

1519
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:19,119
and say yeah like

1520
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:21,199
we're going to start the voxelmen corner

1521
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:28,480
voxel max corner thing and the

1522
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:32,879
walk p would be like

1523
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:37,280
there and we're just going to move that

1524
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:41,680
by cell amounts

1525
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,079
right so depending on which direction we

1526
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,480
want to

1527
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,119
move this thing you know it's going to

1528
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,199
be

1529
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,480
something where we just take steps in

1530
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:51,679
that direction

1531
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:56,559
right so it's going to be like walk p

1532
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:59,759
you know um dot x plus equals you know

1533
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:03,119
sign uh

1534
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:05,760
times cell dim

1535
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,920
x right like it's gonna be this kind of

1536
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,839
thing

1537
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:15,039
where we're just stepping through uh

1538
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:18,000
and and the cell itself like this

1539
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,279
this thing is just gonna be like offset

1540
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,439
um

1541
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,400
in the exact same way right so we almost

1542
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,678
don't need the walk p

1543
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,238
right we're just that's just a way of

1544
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,920
getting center so so this

1545
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:30,158
you know could be in here or whatever so

1546
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,920
at some point we then say like okay

1547
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:36,559
like displacement or or like next

1548
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,279
you know step or whatever is just going

1549
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,719
to be

1550
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:44,239
a thing that we offset the cell by

1551
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:47,359
uh you know so we we step each time

1552
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:50,798
and the step itself is just

1553
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:54,159
determined by which direction we're

1554
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:57,198
going to go so we do like one of these

1555
01:08:54,158 --> 01:09:00,479
you know what i'm saying we'd step

1556
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:07,838
in one of these directions

1557
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:07,838
does that make sense

1558
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:17,359
no uh malicevixie what do you mean

1559
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:21,279
the divide outside the floor

1560
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,719
um oh yes man you guys are catching good

1561
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,120
stuff for me today thank you

1562
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,560
it's been a my brain's pretty slow today

1563
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,559
i think because i was up too late last

1564
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,159
night playing satisfactory

1565
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,120
on stream um

1566
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,559
but yeah yeah as i said you want the

1567
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,399
divide then the floor

1568
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:44,319
then the multiply is the goal

1569
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:49,838
right um okay

1570
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,839
so we can build the cell this

1571
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,440
uh is wrecked min dim actually so you

1572
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:56,158
know what this stuff

1573
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:58,158
can just we can do this that way we

1574
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:01,679
don't even have to do the offset part we

1575
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:03,920
just say voxel min corner

1576
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,800
plus equals step that's just better

1577
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,880
right

1578
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,400
um and furthermore we can actually just

1579
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,760
ignore the step part now

1580
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:11,359
and do what i wanted to do originally

1581
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,000
because if we just have a vector we can

1582
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:13,359
just do

1583
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,920
something where we're going to be

1584
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:17,679
stepping the min corner and then we just

1585
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,079
each time we build the cell

1586
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,600
by just stepping out by the dimension

1587
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:24,800
right

1588
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,800
so uh

1589
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:34,079
i think we're narrowing in so here

1590
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:37,279
we have the whole like occupied

1591
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:40,559
um unoccupied sort of thing

1592
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:44,800
um i don't think we want uh

1593
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:48,159
any of this now it's all just not there

1594
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:51,279
um we may want to continue drawing

1595
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:54,639
uh the outlines though

1596
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:58,000
uh so that part may want to be there um

1597
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:01,199
but yeah so then let's see

1598
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,479
what else we've got uh okay so we have

1599
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:04,719
our for loop

1600
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:05,519
uh we've got yeah that's all just kind

1601
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,640
of garbage

1602
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:12,480
um the cell

1603
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,960
here we do want to exit with it um so we

1604
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:17,119
can i suppose recreate it here by just

1605
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:20,640
saying okay the cell

1606
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:22,399
uh you know we we produce it by doing

1607
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:26,480
the

1608
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:30,238
min corner add the same way uh

1609
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:33,039
from p and 2p in this case

1610
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:34,238
this is just the entity's position this

1611
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:40,560
is just the target

1612
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:43,599
so i think that's just

1613
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,600
this here

1614
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,360
it's just that right it's just the delta

1615
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,520
p so

1616
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:50,559
so two we didn't actually record this

1617
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,960
anywhere

1618
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,239
um but we kind of just want to make that

1619
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,640
a thing

1620
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,238
that's where we were trying to get to

1621
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:02,079
you know

1622
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:04,959
um and so i think that's everything

1623
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:07,279
for the sketch of the routine and now we

1624
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,439
just need the actual way of knowing

1625
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:11,119
how we step through the voxel and that's

1626
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:13,599
like i said the tricky part

1627
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:15,039
so in here we would then say okay for

1628
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,719
and you can also see where we can save a

1629
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:22,880
lot of time here because we can also

1630
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:25,119
keep a bunch of our occupied stuff

1631
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,119
right

1632
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,439
if that makes sense oh uh yeah the

1633
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,800
returns to me it doesn't complain about

1634
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:34,319
the return statements till you

1635
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,679
actually get a compiling program that's

1636
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:36,559
just one of the things visual studio

1637
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,000
does

1638
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,920
it like doesn't get to that stage of

1639
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,600
compilation or something so it would

1640
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,480
have said hey you gotta

1641
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:46,640
it would have erred the reason it wasn't

1642
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:49,039
airing is visual studio just doesn't

1643
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,159
do that until you get the program

1644
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:55,198
linking

1645
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:55,198
like basically to the stage of linking

1646
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:04,000
uh so okay um

1647
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:08,000
let's go ahead and

1648
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,439
i and figure out how we're going to do

1649
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,079
this part because this is by far the

1650
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:13,519
hardest

1651
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:15,600
part i think so

1652
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:17,199
we figure out whether the thing is

1653
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,400
occupied

1654
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:20,399
right we

1655
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,760
we know that if there's nothing open

1656
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,280
um so so i i think we're probably gonna

1657
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,640
have to do

1658
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:39,759
something like this right

1659
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:43,360
um so there's gonna be like a best cell

1660
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,800
thing um and and honestly that's

1661
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:49,679
probably this to start with so we assume

1662
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,719
when we start that the best cell is just

1663
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,440
the one you started in

1664
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:54,079
and so if everything just fails you just

1665
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,599
end up back

1666
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:57,600
in that cell right

1667
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,399
and that's it um and we'll have to work

1668
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,839
on what happens

1669
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:07,599
in that case also uh because remember we

1670
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,960
have to handle

1671
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:14,960
the case where we're trying to get out

1672
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,319
of something um as well as the case

1673
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,158
where we're trying to get in

1674
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:23,519
like or to avoid getting into something

1675
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:24,639
so uh this is probably now going to just

1676
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,199
be like yeah whatever

1677
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,520
the interior part of the routine tells

1678
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:30,960
us is the best place

1679
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,120
that's what we actually need to work

1680
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,520
with right

1681
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:37,840
so inside here what we're going to be

1682
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:43,840
doing is trying to find that best place

1683
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:43,840
and so uh when we look

1684
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,279
at whether the thing is has any state

1685
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,158
occupied

1686
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:51,679
i think we probably need the same sort

1687
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:55,439
of idea

1688
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,800
here remember i said i have the to-do up

1689
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:58,000
at the top it's like this can probably

1690
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,840
be passed in

1691
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,039
the reason i said that is because i was

1692
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,400
pretty sure that we would

1693
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:05,119
need to do the check up here and so we

1694
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,039
would

1695
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:08,840
be keeping a running check of whether

1696
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:12,719
the from position

1697
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:16,400
um is actually in or out right

1698
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:18,719
so let's call the from p

1699
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:18,719
here

1700
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:27,679
uh let's actually call that

1701
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,679
from p to make it a little clearer

1702
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,079
uh i just feel like that's maybe a

1703
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:34,319
little bit better

1704
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:34,319
um

1705
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,279
so you can see what's going on but we're

1706
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,039
going to have that

1707
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:46,719
that uh start location

1708
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:49,119
and i want to know uh

1709
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,399
whether we're colliding whether we're

1710
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,880
whether we're talking about getting

1711
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,279
something

1712
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,640
unstuck or preventing something from

1713
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:57,359
something from getting stuck

1714
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,119
on its way to wherever the target is

1715
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:02,399
right

1716
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:07,840
so if we assume here that we've got a

1717
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:07,839
start collide rate of

1718
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,119
uh collides at p

1719
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,760
so in here we say yeah

1720
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:22,000
like hey man

1721
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:24,000
uh we inside or outside

1722
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,359
uh at the the start of this and this is

1723
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,238
going to mirror sort of

1724
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,839
what we were doing here so in exactly

1725
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:33,279
the same way that we basically

1726
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,440
flip the refinement in the same way that

1727
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:38,800
we flip the refinement

1728
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:39,759
in this version we're going to do the

1729
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,440
opposite thing

1730
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:47,039
we're going to flip the

1731
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:50,158
the rule about where we can go

1732
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:54,319
so what we want is

1733
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:54,319
from now on like in here

1734
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:56,718
um

1735
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,599
what i'm trying to say is like that one

1736
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:06,159
test are we inside or outside

1737
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,400
when like are we colliding or not at the

1738
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:12,319
start of the move

1739
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:15,679
effectively acts as like a giant knot

1740
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,840
right it's it's a it's gonna flip

1741
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:19,440
what we consider the place we can move

1742
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,880
to or not move to

1743
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:24,158
so if we assume um that we started

1744
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:29,520
colliding

1745
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:34,399
we're going to want to allow you to move

1746
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:34,400
out of any cell that you

1747
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,840
we want to allow you to move through a

1748
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:44,000
cell that's completely colliding

1749
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:47,119
so when we look and we see any open

1750
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,520
normally if any open is false if there's

1751
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:51,439
no where to place the player in this

1752
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,400
cell or the entity in the cell

1753
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,960
that means we can't consider that cell

1754
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,000
but

1755
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:00,239
the opposite will be true

1756
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,079
uh for any condition where we were

1757
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:04,079
colliding to begin with

1758
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:05,600
then we want to move we need to be able

1759
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,840
to tunnel through things

1760
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,199
to get ourselves out of stuck into

1761
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,560
something valid

1762
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:17,678
right um if that makes sense uh

1763
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,679
so yeah you know what i'm saying

1764
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,840
tired in here

1765
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:35,840
alright um so again

1766
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:37,600
the hardest part of the chain by far now

1767
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,679
coming up for sure

1768
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,360
this is going to be the tricky part

1769
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:44,480
let's start with the easy

1770
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:45,279
case which is um well this is the easy

1771
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,759
case

1772
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:48,719
neither i'm easy let's start with just

1773
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,840
handling

1774
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:53,119
one of the cases so although i know that

1775
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,719
i'm probably going to want

1776
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:57,279
to use that as a switch to change what

1777
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,840
happens

1778
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,800
in the selection path here we're just

1779
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,000
going to assume

1780
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,480
that this for now is always

1781
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,279
false so you're starting from a legal

1782
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:08,639
position

1783
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:10,639
and we don't have to handle the case

1784
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,079
where you're trying to get out of a

1785
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:15,119
place

1786
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:17,679
so at that point if you always assume

1787
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,158
temporarily we assume that we only move

1788
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:21,520
you

1789
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:23,839
to cells that are going to be closer

1790
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,400
and that the only thing let's just

1791
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,400
assume

1792
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,238
let's assume that we don't do let's

1793
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:36,319
let's assume that we

1794
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:39,678
don't ever care what the refinement

1795
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:41,599
will actually be able to do which is is

1796
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,279
possibly dicey that's why i say we may

1797
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,840
need to call that routine

1798
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:49,039
to check a couple different cells to see

1799
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,960
which one would be the best

1800
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:52,319
that can be like an upgrade version of

1801
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,198
this routine

1802
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,238
but at first let's just assume that each

1803
01:19:55,198 --> 01:20:00,158
cell

1804
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:01,678
just has a uh when we do get closest

1805
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:04,879
point in box

1806
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,039
right that the points

1807
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,480
we evaluate are just the closest point

1808
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:12,560
on the box and we never

1809
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:17,198
move you to a cell that is less close

1810
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:19,920
right so if we look at what happens

1811
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:21,839
there's for any point that we're looking

1812
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,319
at the vauxhall

1813
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,319
there's

1814
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,960
we never want to move you further away

1815
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:35,039
from the point right so there's only

1816
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:39,119
going to be three

1817
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:42,399
uh well let's say four

1818
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:44,559
cells you could move to um i mean we

1819
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,799
really could say one two three

1820
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,800
four

1821
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,960
so we could really say that there's

1822
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:59,279
seven

1823
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:02,239
cells you could move to right

1824
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:02,639
and so i'm kind of thinking look as we

1825
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:05,139
check

1826
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:08,189
to see whether you can move um

1827
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,189
[Music]

1828
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:12,719
whether uh you've got the option to go

1829
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,960
to

1830
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:17,039
different cells like maybe we just loop

1831
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:20,800
through those

1832
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:23,439
here and then consider those cells

1833
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,960
the best possible next cell just based

1834
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:29,839
on whichever one

1835
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,840
contains the uh

1836
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,679
yeah i'm sorry i just don't know i just

1837
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:48,879
don't know what the best way to write

1838
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:51,039
this is

1839
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,480
i'm going to have to experiment a little

1840
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:53,439
because like another way to say it would

1841
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:55,839
be like

1842
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:57,359
maybe you just want to look at the the

1843
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,960
look at the corner codes and

1844
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:03,519
move as many court as many

1845
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,800
of the axes you could move towards the

1846
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,560
destination

1847
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,719
if the corner codes would allow that

1848
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,679
move then you do that move

1849
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,639
you know so you move along x along y

1850
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:16,960
along z

1851
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,960
if if those are available you just do

1852
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,760
that

1853
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:29,119
so let's just let's just not over

1854
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:33,840
complicate it then

1855
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:38,399
um let's just let's just see

1856
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:41,600
so uh i'm gonna then say look

1857
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:44,399
uh let's let's say we look at what

1858
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,840
these codes are and and we had a thing

1859
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:46,479
we sort of did this before so we're

1860
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,880
doing

1861
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:56,000
kind of a slightly similar thing um

1862
01:22:50,880 --> 01:23:00,079
but we want to know like can we move

1863
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,319
in x or not can we move in y

1864
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:04,840
or not can we move in z or not right we

1865
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:07,439
just want to kind of know

1866
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:10,560
um which directions

1867
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:13,439
we would be allowed to move in

1868
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:16,480
and i guess we kind of also want to know

1869
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:20,719
if we can move diagonally

1870
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:22,479
and we could

1871
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,760
you know and i don't know like if we

1872
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:25,519
want to allow

1873
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,000
direct diagonal movements it seems like

1874
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:31,199
you probably do you would just say

1875
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,520
if the corner is open right like like

1876
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:35,839
you do

1877
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,840
um

1878
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:49,839
so like if

1879
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:57,920
if you can move through the corner

1880
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,920
uh

1881
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,120
you would look literally just at the

1882
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:06,399
corner and then

1883
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:09,198
for moving in the uh

1884
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:10,399
but for moving along just the cardinal

1885
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:14,839
directions

1886
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:17,839
you would look to see uh whether the

1887
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,840
um

1888
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,198
uh you would look to see whether or not

1889
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:28,839
anything on that side was

1890
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:31,839
so this is like a corner move right

1891
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,840
um

1892
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,800
that is a uh

1893
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,800
move in z so you're basically saying

1894
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,520
like is there any way i could get out of

1895
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,520
this cell

1896
01:24:51,520 --> 01:25:01,520
in the z direction of the target right

1897
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:01,520
um and you would do the same for each

1898
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:13,840
hopefully this makes some sense

1899
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:34,158
so um quarter move

1900
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:36,319
z move y move x move

1901
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:37,759
and you know that you're only ever going

1902
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:38,639
in one of those directions like you're

1903
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,800
never going to go

1904
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:45,039
away from the target point um

1905
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,560
because presumably whoever asked you to

1906
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,639
move in that direction

1907
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,920
doesn't want you to move in the opposite

1908
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,840
direction right

1909
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,279
like that's never something the gameplay

1910
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,319
code wanted to happen

1911
01:25:53,279 --> 01:26:00,000
right um so

1912
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:02,639
that's the idea uh and this

1913
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,079
would allow us to test each of these

1914
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:07,199
potential moves

1915
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:10,079
right so

1916
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:11,519
we can then actually do that like we can

1917
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:14,880
test each of these

1918
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,840
and see uh whether they are better or

1919
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,960
worse

1920
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,440
and then we just accept the cell that

1921
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,439
would

1922
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:25,279
give you the chance of getting closest

1923
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:25,279
and we don't actually check first

1924
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,198
we don't actually see how close you

1925
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:34,079
could really get

1926
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:35,039
inside that cell you know what i'm

1927
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:37,519
saying

1928
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:39,519
and so then we just accept that move if

1929
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,719
none of these moves would produce a

1930
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,159
better result

1931
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:47,760
so if we get down here

1932
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:51,359
um and we say there's nothing

1933
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:54,400
that would put us closer right

1934
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:59,039
that's the criteria for breaking so

1935
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:59,039
there's like if you know a move exists

1936
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:06,559
then great we do it if not then we stop

1937
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,280
you know what i'm saying um at that

1938
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,400
point like

1939
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:10,399
occupied count

1940
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:14,719
maybe just doesn't matter

1941
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:22,400
at that point

1942
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:26,560
so maybe i just don't care about that

1943
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:26,960
um that's a good question and i don't

1944
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,800
know

1945
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,079
so we'll see i'm not gonna promise

1946
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,119
anything

1947
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:34,639
that may come back right um and the

1948
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:36,319
answer here hopefully is yes because

1949
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:37,119
this is asking the question of can we

1950
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:38,479
implement the thing

1951
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:40,479
we are literally trying to type in right

1952
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:41,678
now so hopefully the answer is yes

1953
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:43,439
because the answer is no we're going to

1954
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,560
be very sad because it means we can't do

1955
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:49,519
what we're doing

1956
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:51,600
but you know uh and so

1957
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,880
let's put this down here because this is

1958
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,079
really just

1959
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:58,880
a little uh variable that now doesn't

1960
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:58,880
even have to be

1961
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:04,960
a pound define um

1962
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,920
so that can just kind of hang out there

1963
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,520
and we'll decide what to do with it

1964
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,279
later

1965
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,800
so that's all good and now we just have

1966
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:11,599
to write the code that actually checks

1967
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,719
for the movement

1968
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,679
if we look here at this stuff this is

1969
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:19,520
sort of

1970
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:23,359
yeah like what the step would be um

1971
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:27,199
so i don't know how we want to do this

1972
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:29,839
but it's probably something like

1973
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:29,839
this

1974
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:33,519
um

1975
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:42,390
so

1976
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:42,389
[Music]

1977
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:50,559
let me just call this direction

1978
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:54,559
right

1979
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:02,000
so if we end up with a movement um

1980
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:02,639
and and we could even just do like if

1981
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,479
dur x

1982
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:09,840
order y or z right

1983
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,638
um so if we end up being able to move

1984
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,360
this is not a

1985
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:16,159
great way to do this but if we end up

1986
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:19,359
being able to move

1987
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:22,799
then we move if we can't then

1988
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:22,799
we can't right

1989
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:30,800
so we've got

1990
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:30,800
something that looks sort of like this

1991
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:39,839
or whatever and and really

1992
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:48,800
i want to say that this is really just

1993
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:51,679
this

1994
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,119
so the same thing that we'd be setting

1995
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:56,158
here i mean we probably just don't want

1996
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:56,158
to do this but like

1997
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:02,399
right

1998
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:09,359
um it's just a sign it's just the same

1999
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:11,279
thing we would use we're using to make

2000
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:13,279
that variable it's kind of annoying

2001
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:16,319
right but whatever

2002
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:21,840
um so in each of these cases

2003
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:21,840
it would be like this sort of thing

2004
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,760
right so the

2005
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,439
the moves if they're allowed are these

2006
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,039
moves

2007
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:41,599
and like i said to me

2008
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:42,158
the problem that we now have here is we

2009
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,239
need

2010
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:45,679
a thing that actually tests to see which

2011
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:48,399
of these moves

2012
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:49,600
is actually better right in each of

2013
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:54,238
these cases

2014
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:56,719
we want to actually try to

2015
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:57,919
produce a better cell for the next time

2016
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:02,960
around

2017
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:05,760
so um

2018
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,719
we probably just want a function that

2019
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,520
kind of wraps this

2020
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:09,520
up for us

2021
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:16,560
and in fact maybe we would just

2022
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:18,639
do

2023
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,159
maybe we would do a thing for now

2024
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,719
because this is like i said it's kind of

2025
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:23,198
hard

2026
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:26,719
this routine so let's just kind of break

2027
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:26,719
it down and make it as simple as we can

2028
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:35,279
let's do a thing where we say okay we've

2029
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:35,279
got the um

2030
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:42,560
we we've got the min

2031
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:45,760
corner is here uh

2032
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:50,560
and the best

2033
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:50,560
distance squared is in there

2034
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:54,800
and then we just have a function we can

2035
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:59,840
call

2036
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,840
uh that will update this thing

2037
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:06,239
uh and furthermore maybe that has the

2038
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:07,839
moved in it so that way this thing

2039
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:10,079
doesn't have to do something nuts like

2040
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,079
that

2041
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,840
so

2042
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:26,559
that is sort of what i'm talking about

2043
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:32,079
each one of these would be

2044
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:34,560
like update best and it would be

2045
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:34,559
um

2046
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:45,359
that sort of thing so we just say

2047
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:49,279
hey update the best the besties

2048
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:51,599
here uh and each one of these

2049
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:54,079
just passes in the like vector that i

2050
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,079
was gonna try and use

2051
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:58,079
to update the thing and then we just

2052
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:02,319
kind of

2053
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:04,559
jam all the stuff into the best function

2054
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:05,679
and this allows us to like write this

2055
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,920
code that you know

2056
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,679
we probably need to do a better job on

2057
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,000
at some point because this is just a lot

2058
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:13,600
of stuff happening in a you know

2059
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,279
a thing we need to probably be somewhat

2060
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:20,480
fast

2061
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:20,479
but that is more or less what we need

2062
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:25,360
right

2063
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:26,238
um we then don't need this so we can

2064
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:29,920
probably make

2065
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:32,799
these look that way

2066
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,560
uh which means this can just pass dirt

2067
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:39,279
directly

2068
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:39,280
and this can pass der by component

2069
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,840
which looks a little better um and then

2070
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,719
here we just need the sign

2071
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,840
so you know this is just the sign for

2072
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:54,158
zero

2073
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,159
um

2074
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,480
yeah so this is just i think the sine or

2075
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:07,520
zero of

2076
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:12,000
[Music]

2077
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:16,840
the delta so the direction you're going

2078
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
or trying to go the sine or zero of that

2079
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:22,159
uh

2080
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,158
which i guess we don't really have

2081
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,840
here

2082
01:34:47,039 --> 01:35:01,840
so we don't really quite have that so um

2083
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,039
so i'm not sure exactly what we're going

2084
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,039
to do here

2085
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:16,158
we're gonna think about that

2086
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,840
separately

2087
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:36,559
i guess i don't care

2088
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:45,118
i guess we just probably don't care

2089
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,118
um

2090
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:53,759
because we're just testing

2091
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:55,839
these voxels for being closer if they're

2092
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,320
closer they're closer we don't care

2093
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:00,000
about the fact that if one of the we

2094
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:01,679
don't care about the optimization that

2095
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,639
one of those steps might not need to be

2096
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,560
tested because it's

2097
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,319
movement portion the movement vector was

2098
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:11,360
zero

2099
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:14,238
so i think maybe we can just skip that

2100
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,439
probably and be fine but there's other

2101
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:15,919
things we want to do here which is we

2102
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:17,839
need the

2103
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,279
we need the thing for this so we need

2104
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:22,960
the side

2105
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:26,960
part of it um

2106
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:31,520
so we need like the side part as well

2107
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,520
um and that's just like you know

2108
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,840
this

2109
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,158
actual testing uh and since we're gonna

2110
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:46,400
do that i suppose

2111
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:49,118
we can just go ahead and compute both of

2112
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:52,879
these so we can just say

2113
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:56,319
uh yeah like

2114
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:59,199
let's use delta p

2115
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,158
is the thing we actually need so maybe

2116
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:03,279
we just do der

2117
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:05,859
and side and we just go like look

2118
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:07,439
if der dot x is less than zero

2119
01:37:05,859 --> 01:37:10,158
[Music]

2120
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:11,359
i'm sorry if delta p to x less than zero

2121
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:14,879
then der dot x

2122
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:14,880
equals um

2123
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:23,359
negative one side dot x equals zero

2124
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:25,679
right um and the else clause

2125
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:25,679
is

2126
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,440
the opposite

2127
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:36,960
um so you know we can do that

2128
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:38,238
and if we wrote that out maybe more

2129
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:42,158
concisely

2130
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:49,839
uh it would look like this so

2131
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:49,839
uh negative 1 0 sorry negative 1 1.

2132
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:56,079
something like this and then this one

2133
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:59,039
just looks like

2134
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:59,039
the exact same thing

2135
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,480
um again just random

2136
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,840
i'm not sure what the easiest way to put

2137
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:09,359
in that information is there's a lot of

2138
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,039
ways we could encode that

2139
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:12,960
but basically that's what we need we

2140
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:14,880
need to know what direction we're going

2141
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,000
and we need to know where to look up in

2142
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,279
the uh

2143
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,960
voxel occupancy for testing right

2144
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:23,359
so then when this happens we would call

2145
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,600
update best with that best thing

2146
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:27,839
uh and here would be the update best

2147
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,840
part

2148
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:35,600
we need um the voxel move

2149
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:36,559
here uh we need like this to probably be

2150
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:40,960
initialized

2151
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:44,400
to f32 max right

2152
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:46,880
so when we actually start this nonsense

2153
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:48,799
we would say well the voxel move that

2154
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:51,039
we're going to try

2155
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,039
um

2156
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:58,479
the best distance squared is

2157
01:38:56,238 --> 01:38:59,919
maybe this is just distance squared is

2158
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:03,919
f32 max

2159
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:03,920
and everything else um

2160
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,920
we need to fill in here so we're going

2161
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,000
to need we're going to need the 2p

2162
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,920
like where we're trying to get to the

2163
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,279
min corner

2164
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,920
and the cell dim right and these are not

2165
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:17,279
actually going to

2166
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,719
cop they'll just be kind of filled in

2167
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:20,559
because hopefully this would all be like

2168
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,840
inlined away

2169
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,679
but again we're not really trying to

2170
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:27,760
make this fast yet

2171
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:32,000
so one step at a time

2172
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:36,079
all right so in here we have

2173
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:39,600
a voxel min corner

2174
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:40,000
we have i mean actually i guess we can

2175
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,320
just have

2176
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,319
a cell

2177
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:49,039
well no we don't need that um

2178
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:53,039
so i think that's what we need the

2179
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:55,118
distance squared thing

2180
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,319
is is just going to be distance squared

2181
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:56,619
there

2182
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:59,728
um

2183
01:39:56,619 --> 01:39:59,729
[Music]

2184
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:04,479
the following we're just doing a version

2185
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:07,679
of into real oh

2186
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:10,399
all right the question mark

2187
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,880
operator and c is so unsatisfying

2188
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:12,879
sometimes

2189
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:23,840
all right

2190
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:45,280
all right um so

2191
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:50,239
in update best we know we need

2192
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:54,238
um a direction

2193
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:55,919
we know that uh we need to set all this

2194
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:59,118
stuff up for it which i

2195
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:04,319
think it now would have so

2196
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:07,599
what it would do is it would go okay

2197
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:08,479
suppose we made the test cell and the

2198
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:13,679
test cell

2199
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:13,678
is going to be a rectum dim of the move

2200
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,840
[Music]

2201
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,840
um

2202
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:25,840
the movement corner plus the offset so

2203
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:29,359
that the new min corner

2204
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:32,560
um or the test min corner is

2205
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:33,920
the current min corner plus the

2206
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:38,000
direction

2207
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:40,719
times the dimension of the cell

2208
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,479
so that's where we would move the test

2209
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:46,079
cell therefore is that min

2210
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:49,599
corner plus the dimension

2211
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:52,639
and then we would say uh new

2212
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:56,800
or test p

2213
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:58,800
is the get closest point in box

2214
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:02,560
so if we said inside that cell we're

2215
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:05,920
testing what's the closest point

2216
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:09,119
to where we're trying to go and then the

2217
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:12,840
test dist squared

2218
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:15,839
is going to be the uh distance squared

2219
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,840
of

2220
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:22,559
the place we're trying to get to versus

2221
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:26,719
the closest that we actually got so

2222
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:28,480
the vector from where we could get to to

2223
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:29,520
where we'd like to go that's the test

2224
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:32,319
distance squared

2225
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:34,400
we then just accept it provisionally so

2226
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:37,840
if the distance

2227
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:43,839
that we had before is not as good

2228
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:43,840
then we accept it

2229
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,158
right now the problem is we need to

2230
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:50,319
accept the min

2231
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:52,000
corner we need the basement corner for

2232
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:55,118
the other people who are moving

2233
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:58,639
so this has to be aurigman corner

2234
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:59,039
and best min corner right because these

2235
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:03,440
are

2236
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:03,439
two different things um

2237
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:09,679
so we actually need best min corner

2238
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:11,760
because we don't want to up we don't

2239
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:13,760
want to check off of that we want to

2240
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:17,039
keep the best mid corner moving while

2241
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:19,840
the rigman corner stays where it is

2242
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:20,319
um so i think it looks like that and

2243
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,520
then in

2244
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:25,679
here we have to set these so

2245
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:27,920
the best min corner we don't really have

2246
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:30,880
to set but we might as well

2247
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,880
um and then this goes ahead and does the

2248
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:34,159
updates eventually it says okay if we

2249
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,480
got one

2250
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:37,198
it just takes the new move if we didn't

2251
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:40,238
get one

2252
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:43,439
then we just assume we can't keep going

2253
01:43:40,238 --> 01:43:45,839
um so we stop right

2254
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:45,839
um

2255
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,000
yeah so anyway oh and here's that return

2256
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,760
remember i was saying like once you

2257
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,800
actually get a linking program see there

2258
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,840
it's complaining because we didn't

2259
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:00,400
return

2260
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:00,400
result right so

2261
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:08,079
um so anyway that is my argument for

2262
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:11,359
roughly how this routine would work uh

2263
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:14,479
it's probably not very good yet but

2264
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:18,880
hey for one day's work that seems

2265
01:44:14,479 --> 01:44:21,678
okay right like it's okay

2266
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:23,039
um so now we have to start probably like

2267
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,600
stepping through this thing

2268
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:27,679
and cleaning up our bugs and whatever

2269
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:31,039
else

2270
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:31,920
uh has to happen there um but that's the

2271
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:35,679
idea

2272
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:39,118
right so uh

2273
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:42,158
what we want to do is we want to

2274
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:45,118
set a breakpoint in

2275
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:46,479
here uh and we want to step through this

2276
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:47,519
thing and we want to see like what the

2277
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:49,839
heck is going on

2278
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,840
right

2279
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:03,840
[Music]

2280
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,840
um

2281
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:21,359
yeah um so you know like we're doing

2282
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,719
this

2283
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:25,839
right and we we loop through here and we

2284
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:27,600
see

2285
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:31,039
you know i don't know what what this

2286
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:33,280
looks like but let's take a look

2287
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:34,479
so this direction is one negative one

2288
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:38,800
one right

2289
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:45,839
so oh we must be compiled in

2290
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:45,840
release mode that's not gonna go well

2291
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:58,000
seems like that happened an awful lot of

2292
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:59,679
times

2293
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,840
it should have only happened eight times

2294
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,840
but

2295
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:10,960
maybe it may have unrolled this loop

2296
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:13,360
so let me uh i want to step into this

2297
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,158
so i can watch what happens and clean up

2298
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:16,960
stuff

2299
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:16,960
uh as we go

2300
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:30,399
so here we go um so let's take a look

2301
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:33,840
like here's from p and 2p uh

2302
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:37,039
it's a very slight motion um

2303
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:40,079
slight motion in y uh

2304
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:43,198
we're going from two uh

2305
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:44,719
this looks right right that's negative

2306
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:48,238
one

2307
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:50,710
um and voxel min

2308
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:52,839
corner um

2309
01:46:50,710 --> 01:46:55,840
[Music]

2310
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:59,679
looks

2311
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:04,639
correct because we're on point ones

2312
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:04,639
you know point one is stupid uh

2313
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:09,599
before i go any further i i think i

2314
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:13,198
wanna

2315
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:14,000
not do that um you know you don't pick a

2316
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:17,118
decimal

2317
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:20,000
on a binary machine it's just dumb

2318
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:20,000
right um

2319
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:24,960
so so maybe we say like something that's

2320
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:27,520
an actual

2321
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,719
a close two power you know what i'm

2322
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,800
saying

2323
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:32,158
um so that it can be represented

2324
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,719
properly

2325
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:37,839
uh so that way it's the closest point

2326
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,840
like 2 5 or whatever

2327
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,199
um and now you can see like how much

2328
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,239
nicer these numbers are right they're

2329
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:48,559
exact

2330
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:49,839
because we picked a power of two instead

2331
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,960
of a thing that

2332
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:54,560
oops i don't know what i just did like

2333
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,800
cleared that number or something

2334
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,239
um so so that's just probably better

2335
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,360
right

2336
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:03,519
um so

2337
01:48:01,359 --> 01:48:04,639
all right uh so we pick a min corner

2338
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:09,199
that

2339
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:09,199
looks correct to me um

2340
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:14,599
yeah i mean that's that's the correct

2341
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:18,719
min

2342
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:22,239
coroner uh

2343
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:25,359
so i think we're good right

2344
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:28,238
um we look to see

2345
01:48:25,359 --> 01:48:28,559
we're we're trying to go one negative

2346
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:30,959
one

2347
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,080
one right we look to see whether those

2348
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:36,158
are not occupied

2349
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:36,158
i guess they're not um

2350
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:40,799
i mean we can see it looks like nobody

2351
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,880
there's no

2352
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,840
this is free movement right so you're

2353
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:47,760
just allowed to go

2354
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:49,520
wherever you want so we're saying that

2355
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:53,280
you can move

2356
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:55,760
diagonally right

2357
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:56,639
and you don't actually want to in this

2358
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:58,880
case

2359
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:00,560
you only want to move in y so this isn't

2360
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:04,159
a good move but it's

2361
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:08,800
allowed right so we then say

2362
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:08,799
well all right if this is the move

2363
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:19,679
um

2364
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:23,199
we take and we make a test min

2365
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:23,199
corner that is

2366
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:26,799
the original mid corner it should be

2367
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,118
point

2368
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,840
two in each direction it is right that's

2369
01:49:29,118 --> 01:49:33,198
exactly

2370
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:36,239
what it should be for the diagonal move

2371
01:49:33,198 --> 01:49:36,559
you create a test cell uh you get a test

2372
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:40,879
p

2373
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:43,360
out of that um and

2374
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,079
the the 2p i don't know we can't really

2375
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:46,158
do the subtract

2376
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:47,840
i'm gonna so just to make debugging

2377
01:49:46,158 --> 01:49:51,039
easier myself before i

2378
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:54,639
finish this uh i i'm gonna do

2379
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:57,760
like a delta p here

2380
01:49:54,639 --> 01:50:00,480
uh just so i can look inspect

2381
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,039
what the difference is between the two

2382
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:03,118
points

2383
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:04,319
that it's looking at uh without me

2384
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:05,439
having to go do that math in the

2385
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:07,118
debugger myself

2386
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:08,719
so i'm literally just replacing what was

2387
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:10,639
on the interior here with a variable

2388
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:13,920
that i can inspect

2389
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:15,199
um just hey because debuggers still

2390
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:16,960
really aren't what you'd like them to be

2391
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:19,439
so you have to like manually

2392
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,639
a lot of times move your code around to

2393
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:22,319
you know

2394
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:24,560
make it easier for you to watch what's

2395
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:27,359
happening so

2396
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,760
if i go ahead and step in to update best

2397
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:31,839
now

2398
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,840
i can look and see what that delta p is

2399
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:36,480
um and what you can see here is the

2400
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,840
separation

2401
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:39,839
is uh

2402
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:53,840
is a little nonsensical

2403
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,840
yes

2404
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,840
i'm not sure about this i want to verify

2405
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:22,400
that this is right

2406
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:24,800
so the test

2407
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:24,799
cell

2408
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,360
in this case

2409
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,840
you're trying to get here

2410
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,920
i just realized what this is doing

2411
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:04,079
okay uh what i said was totally false

2412
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:06,479
you don't want to start this with f32

2413
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:09,118
max you need to start this with

2414
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:09,759
whatever the closest thing you've ever

2415
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:13,279
seen

2416
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,280
was right

2417
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:19,439
um and you

2418
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:20,000
need to keep that through the entire

2419
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,279
time

2420
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:27,359
probably right

2421
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:29,519
so you're probably going to do something

2422
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:30,639
like this where you say the best

2423
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:34,000
distance squared

2424
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:34,880
is actually like the distance from the

2425
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,599
best point

2426
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:42,800
on this cell you know what i'm saying

2427
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,800
uh so we say

2428
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:45,839
you know

2429
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:55,519
the distance squared is the distance

2430
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:59,199
from the get closest point

2431
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:02,320
in box to the 2p

2432
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:04,079
right it's it's actually like from where

2433
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:08,079
you are right now

2434
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:11,359
so the starting cell

2435
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:14,479
um that you just

2436
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:17,029
initialize into

2437
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,799
you probably need um

2438
01:53:17,029 --> 01:53:22,319
[Music]

2439
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:25,279
that as your

2440
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,079
test because you don't want to move out

2441
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:29,679
of the best

2442
01:53:26,079 --> 01:53:33,198
cell that you had right

2443
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:36,079
um so i think

2444
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,919
let me just double check here i think

2445
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:41,118
that's what we actually want so

2446
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:43,199
let me just see if this now prevents a

2447
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:45,519
move

2448
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:46,399
what is happening did that not recompile

2449
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,400
or something

2450
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:50,399
why am i not stepping through actual

2451
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:55,839
locations in the code

2452
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:55,839
that's freaky

2453
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:03,359
what the heck is do what is that doing

2454
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:09,840
very nervous right now

2455
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:15,279
that does not look like a sane debug

2456
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:19,598
step

2457
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:22,158
um where am i at on four coder these

2458
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:25,119
days i i mean not for coder um

2459
01:54:22,158 --> 01:54:25,118
remedy bg

2460
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:37,840
what version

2461
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:46,159
so three five is the latest version and

2462
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:52,079
we are not anywhere near that

2463
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:52,079
um so that may be a mistake um

2464
01:54:52,158 --> 01:55:05,839
hold please

2465
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:19,840
uh

2466
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
oh please while i download this from hio

2467
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,840
which as we know from

2468
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:32,319
apple's lawyers in the epic trial

2469
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:36,239
is just i mean

2470
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:39,439
it's so risque the itch dot io store

2471
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:39,439
oh my goodness

2472
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:47,760
what even happens at the itch dot io

2473
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:52,239
store think of the children

2474
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:55,360
being corrupted at the the horrible

2475
01:55:52,238 --> 01:55:59,198
itch.io store that apple is so

2476
01:55:55,359 --> 01:56:03,279
valiantly and courageously protecting us

2477
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:03,279
from um

2478
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:10,158
you know without people like apple to

2479
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:11,599
to prevent you from getting stuff on

2480
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:13,759
your computer that you were trying to

2481
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:17,039
get i just don't know where we would be

2482
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:17,039
you know i mean

2483
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:25,279
thank god they don't leave decisions up

2484
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:28,719
to the people who bought the computer

2485
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:31,599
i mean that would be

2486
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:33,520
can you imagine allowing the person who

2487
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:35,279
bought the computer to decide what to

2488
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:37,119
install on the computer i don't even

2489
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:40,559
know

2490
01:56:37,118 --> 01:56:40,559
that's just ridiculous

2491
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:45,359
totally unacceptable and i'm just

2492
01:56:44,238 --> 01:56:47,439
thankful that we have

2493
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:49,279
people like apple to tell us what we're

2494
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:51,678
allowed to run because without that

2495
01:56:49,279 --> 01:56:54,399
i would just be i mean it's a big scary

2496
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:57,520
world out there

2497
01:56:54,399 --> 01:57:01,920
and i just don't know what i would do

2498
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:01,920
you know i mean i just don't know

2499
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:07,920
i would probably just i would just be a

2500
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,960
career criminal

2501
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:13,760
by now if apple hadn't

2502
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:15,279
protected me from the horrors of the

2503
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:20,320
things on itch.io

2504
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:24,158
like a debugger that i bought that i use

2505
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:28,079
i mean it's just

2506
01:57:24,158 --> 01:57:28,079
it's unspeakable really

2507
01:57:28,158 --> 01:57:36,158
so thank you apple for all your

2508
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:38,238
tireless hard work making sure that

2509
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:40,319
i don't ever get to make a decision

2510
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:44,079
about what happens

2511
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:48,559
on a computer that was is great

2512
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:50,639
it was really something the world needed

2513
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,800
was more centralized control over

2514
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:55,599
decision making that's that's the thing

2515
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:57,920
that everyone says is great

2516
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:57,920
um

2517
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,800
that's that's that's what people say you

2518
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,719
know it's what people have said

2519
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:07,360
throughout history if we just

2520
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:09,118
had a central authority that could tell

2521
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:11,039
us what to do

2522
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:13,118
and apple is helping to bring you that

2523
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:17,118
world right you know

2524
01:58:13,118 --> 01:58:17,118
so it's good it's great

2525
01:58:17,198 --> 01:58:20,638
really really pleased great company

2526
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:23,760
apple

2527
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,760
fantastic you know

2528
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:36,880
okay let's see if we can um

2529
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:38,159
get better stepping here um i know that

2530
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:40,239
like there was all these weird things

2531
01:58:38,158 --> 01:58:41,198
happening with visual studios like pdbs

2532
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:43,519
and stuff

2533
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:45,118
so we may just have needed nope it's

2534
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,000
just busted i so i don't know what's

2535
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:49,039
going on there

2536
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:52,639
maybe x13 pixels can tell us sometime

2537
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:56,238
um i have no idea why it is not able to

2538
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:58,239
step over those lines properly

2539
01:58:56,238 --> 01:59:00,238
um but at least now it's not picking

2540
01:58:58,238 --> 01:59:01,598
those moves which is what i wanted to

2541
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:04,079
make sure of

2542
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:06,319
um but we kind of need to actually still

2543
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:09,840
see what the heck is going on

2544
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:11,359
um because you know i i

2545
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,960
i still want to go step through this

2546
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:14,960
routine um

2547
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:19,409
and look for bugs and such

2548
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:22,470
right um

2549
01:59:19,409 --> 01:59:22,470
[Music]

2550
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:30,960
so so let me let me

2551
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:33,439
before i go any further let me run this

2552
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:35,679
in o2 and see what happened

2553
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:35,678
right

2554
01:59:40,238 --> 01:59:43,519
yeah i have ordered new glasses i hope

2555
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:45,598
they come

2556
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:48,080
sometime soon but i'm not going to hold

2557
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:51,360
my breath on that

2558
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:53,439
so you can see this is still in a bit of

2559
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:56,000
a in a bit of a bad state

2560
01:59:53,439 --> 01:59:59,598
um so we're not quite out of the woods

2561
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:03,279
yet we still got a pretty janky

2562
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:06,159
set of bugs in here uh but okay

2563
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:06,639
so let's see if we can't step through

2564
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:13,839
and

2565
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:13,840
clean this up

2566
02:00:33,279 --> 02:00:40,079
no i didn't i didn't buy the uh

2567
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:42,880
the glasses from apple

2568
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:44,399
um you know i i don't do too much

2569
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:46,639
politics on stream but

2570
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:49,519
i will simply tell you that like the

2571
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:51,279
arguments that people use for things

2572
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:53,440
are really interesting because you can

2573
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:55,759
tell that they're never

2574
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:57,359
argument that they're that they just

2575
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:00,880
want

2576
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:04,000
they just like apple and want that to be

2577
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:07,118
okay they're not arguing about it

2578
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:10,238
because they actually thought through

2579
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:12,479
all of the consequences or analogies to

2580
02:01:10,238 --> 02:01:15,519
what they're saying

2581
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:17,198
they just like an apple product or an

2582
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,960
apple operating system and they just

2583
02:01:17,198 --> 02:01:22,479
want that to be okay so they

2584
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:24,399
say something that they think

2585
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:26,158
is making an argument but it actually

2586
02:01:24,399 --> 02:01:30,000
isn't making an argument

2587
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:33,598
right because a lot of people are like

2588
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:36,719
well as long as you know up front

2589
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:38,159
what it is it's okay or it's a private

2590
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,279
company they should do what they want

2591
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:42,479
all things

2592
02:01:39,279 --> 02:01:43,359
and you would never accept any of those

2593
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:47,678
arguments

2594
02:01:43,359 --> 02:01:52,399
for anything else you know

2595
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:55,039
if somebody honestly said to you

2596
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:56,238
like you know looked you in the eye and

2597
02:01:55,039 --> 02:02:00,399
said

2598
02:01:56,238 --> 02:02:03,839
we don't need public accommodation law

2599
02:02:00,399 --> 02:02:05,118
consumer protection law lemon laws

2600
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,520
disclosure laws

2601
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:09,598
we don't need any of those things

2602
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:12,800
because

2603
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:17,599
as long as a company just says

2604
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:19,920
here is what we do up front right

2605
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:21,199
and some big long list of things that

2606
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:24,639
everyone would agreed

2607
02:02:21,198 --> 02:02:27,598
was horrible you pick everything

2608
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:29,359
you want that's horrible right every

2609
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,400
last little thing

2610
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:34,880
uh you know discriminatory like like

2611
02:02:32,399 --> 02:02:36,319
like we set which races are allowed to

2612
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:38,319
be by the computer

2613
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:40,000
we say whether men or women can buy the

2614
02:02:38,319 --> 02:02:42,479
computer exclusively

2615
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,439
we d if it's completely broken when it

2616
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:45,359
gets delivered to you

2617
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:47,279
tough tough we're not going to refund it

2618
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:50,679
right

2619
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:54,000
laws are there because a

2620
02:02:50,679 --> 02:02:56,960
transaction should only occur

2621
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,238
under circumstances where the person

2622
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,639
gives you the money

2623
02:02:58,238 --> 02:03:02,000
and you give them back a thing that is

2624
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:05,359
then theirs

2625
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:08,800
and we have spent so many

2626
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:12,158
decades cleaning up all

2627
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:14,639
the authoritarian crap that

2628
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:15,439
companies or governments or everyone

2629
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:18,960
else

2630
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:21,519
tried to do using all those same excuses

2631
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:22,639
it's just a private party it's they

2632
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:24,880
should you knew

2633
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:26,000
what it was at a time it's like no we

2634
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:31,359
don't want

2635
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,359
private parties doing these things

2636
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:36,079
being able to purchase things and then

2637
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,679
you own them

2638
02:03:36,079 --> 02:03:41,599
is something we fought for not allowing

2639
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:44,960
a company to discriminate

2640
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:48,319
to censor to decide what you can do

2641
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:51,760
to take back something you bought those

2642
02:03:48,319 --> 02:03:57,439
are things that were in the law

2643
02:03:51,760 --> 02:04:00,960
and people just forget this

2644
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:02,000
somehow in their mind none of those

2645
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:05,439
things existed

2646
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:08,880
the world just started and companies

2647
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:10,719
were these beautiful

2648
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:12,239
benefactors that that never

2649
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:14,078
discriminated against anybody

2650
02:04:12,238 --> 02:04:15,759
that never shipped defective products

2651
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:17,439
and didn't give you refunds

2652
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:18,880
that never treated their workers

2653
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:20,000
horribly that never did any of these

2654
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:23,039
things

2655
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,520
so if we just why are you getting so

2656
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:26,960
upset about this why are you so why do

2657
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:28,159
you want to tell this private company

2658
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,960
what to do

2659
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:32,879
have you read a book like i don't know

2660
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:36,239
what to tell you

2661
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:40,239
companies are horrible that's

2662
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:42,479
you want things like capitalism

2663
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:44,078
to have markets where consumers can make

2664
02:04:42,479 --> 02:04:45,519
choices so that we can allocate

2665
02:04:44,078 --> 02:04:48,559
resources properly

2666
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:49,840
that's it we don't want corporations

2667
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:53,119
competing over

2668
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:56,560
controlling their users that's

2669
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:57,118
absolutely ridiculous read a freaking

2670
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,880
book

2671
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:00,799
if you think that's a good idea it's

2672
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:03,199
it's nuts

2673
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,880
so none of those arguments to me hold

2674
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:07,598
any water at all

2675
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,920
it's obvious that you need strong

2676
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:13,279
consumer protection

2677
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:15,920
strong uh like

2678
02:05:13,279 --> 02:05:18,078
things that say that a consumer is a

2679
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:20,000
person who presents their money

2680
02:05:18,078 --> 02:05:21,279
and receives the product and that is the

2681
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,479
end of it and the company

2682
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:26,000
gets no say in who that consumer can be

2683
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:27,598
or what that consumer can do with the

2684
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
product after they purchase it

2685
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:30,639
that is up to the citizen and their

2686
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,439
government

2687
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:34,078
alone and as a corporation what you get

2688
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:38,158
to do

2689
02:05:34,078 --> 02:05:38,158
is hand me the freaking thing i bought

2690
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:47,118
yet competition is not what you think it

2691
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:48,559
is competition is a way of allocating

2692
02:05:47,118 --> 02:05:51,039
resources

2693
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,760
right and once those resources get

2694
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:55,439
allocated

2695
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:58,159
you end up with lock-in so competition

2696
02:05:55,439 --> 02:05:59,839
doesn't solve mistreatment if it did you

2697
02:05:58,158 --> 02:06:02,158
wouldn't need any of these other laws

2698
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:03,440
if competition worked the way that

2699
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:04,879
you're saying it does

2700
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:05,839
you wouldn't need any of these other

2701
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:07,279
laws you wouldn't need

2702
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,639
anti-discrimination laws

2703
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:10,319
you wouldn't need you wouldn't need

2704
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:12,400
title seven right

2705
02:06:10,319 --> 02:06:14,399
you wouldn't need consumer protection

2706
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:17,598
laws you wouldn't need

2707
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:20,479
courts at all you you would

2708
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:22,159
it would just be competition nobody

2709
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:24,479
believes that's true

2710
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:25,439
nobody people just say it because they

2711
02:06:24,479 --> 02:06:27,359
want

2712
02:06:25,439 --> 02:06:28,559
people like apple to be okay they just

2713
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:32,238
like apple

2714
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:35,440
competition all it does is at the outset

2715
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:36,319
it allocates resources somewhere that is

2716
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:38,799
all it does

2717
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:40,479
it can't do anything else it does not

2718
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:44,400
fix social problems

2719
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:46,158
period right

2720
02:06:44,399 --> 02:06:47,679
once you have resources allocated you

2721
02:06:46,158 --> 02:06:49,118
can't really change it very effectively

2722
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:51,039
competition doesn't do that

2723
02:06:49,118 --> 02:06:53,279
it's why you have anti-monopoly law it's

2724
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:55,279
how i have all this stuff

2725
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:57,118
i i don't know what to tell you like did

2726
02:06:55,279 --> 02:06:58,399
you if you've never heard of att like

2727
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:00,399
have you never heard

2728
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:01,839
of like what trusts were have you never

2729
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:04,158
heard of railroads i don't know what to

2730
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,159
tell you

2731
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,920
i love capitalism i think it's a great

2732
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:12,159
way to allocate resources it only works

2733
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:14,399
when you have already created the

2734
02:07:12,158 --> 02:07:16,399
circumstances under which you want that

2735
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:18,879
competition to occur optimally

2736
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:19,920
you simply cannot trust it to solve any

2737
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:23,760
other problems for you

2738
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:27,840
it's not what it does right

2739
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,840
it's not what it does

2740
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:41,840
all right let's do one more step through

2741
02:07:58,238 --> 02:08:02,399
so this test is pretty obvious that just

2742
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:03,919
does all eight corners

2743
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:05,759
i don't think there's much because that

2744
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:06,639
just got wholesale imported from the

2745
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:09,199
other thing

2746
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:10,639
no matter what that returns this should

2747
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:12,799
always terminate

2748
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:14,639
this loop should always terminate fairly

2749
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,000
so we shouldn't have to care about this

2750
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:17,359
we should just assume that whatever this

2751
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,479
returns it returns we never have to

2752
02:08:17,359 --> 02:08:20,479
think about it again

2753
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:21,678
right and then if there's bugs in this

2754
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:22,319
that's a separate thing that we would

2755
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:23,679
debug

2756
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:25,759
so it's this part here that we actually

2757
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:26,639
care about and it's the update best

2758
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:30,320
termination

2759
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:32,400
criteria that's the problem here

2760
02:08:30,319 --> 02:08:34,719
right this probably doesn't work right

2761
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:38,879
or something

2762
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:42,078
so we need to make sure that this um

2763
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:44,880
correctly always terminates you know it

2764
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:48,000
can't ever get into a loop

2765
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:49,039
where we're like constantly go where

2766
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,198
we're keep trying

2767
02:08:49,039 --> 02:08:53,519
new and new cells we need to terminate

2768
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:57,279
after a few simple steps

2769
02:08:53,520 --> 02:09:01,440
right um so let's go ahead

2770
02:08:57,279 --> 02:09:01,439
and see

2771
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:08,000
what we're doing here so we look at bess

2772
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:16,799
we look at best and we see that we have

2773
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:17,198
a distance squared of zero which means

2774
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,560
that

2775
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:22,559
uh this doesn't need to happen right

2776
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:24,800
um so this one's just gonna exit out

2777
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:27,599
immediately and we don't care

2778
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:29,039
uh so what we wanna do is get to a one

2779
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:31,119
of these that doesn't work

2780
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:32,639
near as well right so we want one yeah

2781
02:09:31,118 --> 02:09:34,319
like that where there actually is a

2782
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:35,440
distance so this means we're trying to

2783
02:09:34,319 --> 02:09:40,639
move from this cell to

2784
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:40,638
another cell right um

2785
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:46,719
if this makes sense uh and uh

2786
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:48,560
we just want to go ahead and uh someone

2787
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:50,239
said i love capitalism when it works for

2788
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:53,760
me screw other people yeah

2789
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:54,238
yes like that seems to be what people

2790
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:57,840
say

2791
02:09:54,238 --> 02:09:58,879
right they just they don't seem to want

2792
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,800
to

2793
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,719
they don't seem to want to engage with

2794
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:04,079
the fact that all these laws were made

2795
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:06,800
for a reason

2796
02:10:04,078 --> 02:10:07,679
you had to make these laws because

2797
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,639
competition

2798
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:10,639
didn't produce

2799
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:17,440
a fair marketplace

2800
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:20,638
for humans for citizens

2801
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:24,638
in the worst possible ways in horrific

2802
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:26,078
ways right and somehow they just

2803
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:27,679
throw that out the window because they

2804
02:10:26,078 --> 02:10:29,679
like apple or something

2805
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:31,840
it's not just apple it's other people

2806
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:34,800
they argue this for

2807
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:36,639
it's it's not okay right i am not a

2808
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:38,320
person who wants to throw out capitalism

2809
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:41,359
i think it does a great job

2810
02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:44,319
of optimization right

2811
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:45,198
but it has to be coupled with

2812
02:10:44,319 --> 02:10:48,479
restrictions

2813
02:10:45,198 --> 02:10:48,879
on what can be optimized because if you

2814
02:10:48,479 --> 02:10:51,198
just

2815
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:52,400
let capitalism optimize it will optimize

2816
02:10:51,198 --> 02:10:55,439
on everything

2817
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:58,799
including screwing the customer

2818
02:10:55,439 --> 02:11:00,638
right because as soon as a corporation

2819
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,239
can start to screw a customer because

2820
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:05,199
like they don't have

2821
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:06,718
enough other options or the the cost of

2822
02:11:05,198 --> 02:11:07,678
the barrier to entry to that market

2823
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:09,198
grows too high

2824
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:11,118
it will just straight up optimize

2825
02:11:09,198 --> 02:11:11,919
screwing the customer all the way down

2826
02:11:11,118 --> 02:11:16,319
to zero

2827
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:16,319
right and so

2828
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:21,920
history shows this unequivocally like

2829
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:23,599
there is no argument that that is what

2830
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:26,800
happens

2831
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:29,279
at all from anybody even people who are

2832
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:31,599
extremely pro-capitalism which i am

2833
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:33,118
right i think it's a great resource

2834
02:11:31,599 --> 02:11:35,360
allocation strategy

2835
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:36,238
there are no examples that i know of in

2836
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:39,598
history

2837
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:42,879
of allocation strategies that beat it

2838
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:46,078
but you can't just expect it to solve

2839
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:48,719
all problems it just optimizes

2840
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:51,439
that's all it does if you don't set up

2841
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:53,439
your optimization problem first

2842
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:55,919
it will optimize all sorts of things

2843
02:11:53,439 --> 02:11:57,359
that are horrible

2844
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:59,039
and that's exactly what you're seeing

2845
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:00,479
that's exactly what apple does and

2846
02:11:59,039 --> 02:12:02,158
facebook right now

2847
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:04,559
that's what you're seeing you're just

2848
02:12:02,158 --> 02:12:09,920
seeing them optimize variables

2849
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:09,920
that humans really shouldn't optimize

2850
02:12:11,439 --> 02:12:14,559
and you just need some laws you need

2851
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:16,800
some laws that say nope we're not going

2852
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:18,480
to do that

2853
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:20,560
you're not going to collect information

2854
02:12:18,479 --> 02:12:21,439
from customers you're not gonna get to

2855
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:23,679
decide

2856
02:12:21,439 --> 02:12:26,638
what software runs on what hardware we

2857
02:12:23,679 --> 02:12:30,319
don't want that to be optimized

2858
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:31,279
because we are going to let the citizens

2859
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:34,000
decide

2860
02:12:31,279 --> 02:12:35,039
what they do with what they purchase and

2861
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,078
be free

2862
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:40,238
from your intrusion right

2863
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:41,118
in my mind that is a very very valid

2864
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:44,238
argument

2865
02:12:41,118 --> 02:12:47,679
and you can have arguments against it

2866
02:12:44,238 --> 02:12:49,359
but one of them is not it's a private

2867
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:51,199
company or capitalism

2868
02:12:49,359 --> 02:12:53,039
always work like those are not real

2869
02:12:51,198 --> 02:12:54,719
arguments because it's so trivial to

2870
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:55,359
point to all the ways that that's not

2871
02:12:54,719 --> 02:12:57,118
true

2872
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:58,479
and you obviously disagree with that

2873
02:12:57,118 --> 02:12:58,960
because if you really thought that was

2874
02:12:58,479 --> 02:13:00,638
true

2875
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:02,239
you would argue for repealing all of

2876
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:03,199
this stuff you'd argue for appealing

2877
02:13:02,238 --> 02:13:06,000
title vii

2878
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:06,960
you'd argue for repealing um all public

2879
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,198
accommodation

2880
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,480
sections in all state laws you'd argue

2881
02:13:09,198 --> 02:13:12,399
for repealing

2882
02:13:10,479 --> 02:13:14,000
all workplace protection safety because

2883
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:15,279
if it was just competition

2884
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,520
that solved these problems you wouldn't

2885
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:19,039
need any of those things right

2886
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:22,639
so if you want to make that argument

2887
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:22,639
that we repeal all of that stuff

2888
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:28,158
make it but if you

2889
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:29,598
aren't willing to say that all of those

2890
02:13:28,158 --> 02:13:31,118
laws need to be repealed then your

2891
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:33,599
argument doesn't make sense so you need

2892
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:35,359
a different one

2893
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:37,119
you need a different argument for why

2894
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:38,559
you think it's okay for corporations to

2895
02:13:37,118 --> 02:13:40,799
do these things

2896
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:42,800
that they are a corporation is not a

2897
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,639
valid reason because there are so many

2898
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,039
examples of when you wouldn't

2899
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:47,760
have accepted that argument so you need

2900
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:51,679
a different one

2901
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:55,360
you need to explain why this thing

2902
02:13:51,679 --> 02:13:58,480
specifically benefits the public good

2903
02:13:55,359 --> 02:14:02,559
more than it hurts you need an actual

2904
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:05,439
carefully described argument for why

2905
02:14:02,560 --> 02:14:05,840
having a consumer not own a device they

2906
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:07,919
buy

2907
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:09,599
is better than having them actually own

2908
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:12,960
it right

2909
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:15,119
why why you think that allowing a

2910
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:17,760
corporation to control

2911
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:19,839
a customer's decisions after their

2912
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:24,000
purchase

2913
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:27,440
is a positive social human development

2914
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:31,920
that you support

2915
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:31,919
so that's what you gotta do right

2916
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:41,840
yeah the handmade political podcast

2917
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:47,440
no one's gonna go on that podcast

2918
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:54,960
that'd be a lonely podcast with me just

2919
02:14:52,719 --> 02:14:56,719
complaining about stuff that seems so

2920
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,480
obvious that i don't even know why i'm

2921
02:14:56,719 --> 02:14:59,039
explaining it because it's like i don't

2922
02:14:58,479 --> 02:15:00,638
understand

2923
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:02,319
i don't even understand how people get

2924
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:03,039
to the other conclusions other than

2925
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:06,319
simply

2926
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:08,000
this is what we wanted like i i i can't

2927
02:15:06,319 --> 02:15:12,479
even wrap my head around people who

2928
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:14,639
argue for apple's behavior

2929
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:16,559
like the only thing it sounds like to me

2930
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:17,199
is i just like apple products that's all

2931
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:19,440
i hear

2932
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:20,960
because i don't ever actually hear an

2933
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:22,638
argument

2934
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:24,000
all of the things that they say make no

2935
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:27,199
sense if you

2936
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,599
wanted a infantile storefront

2937
02:15:27,198 --> 02:15:30,719
you could just get one like nothing's

2938
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:33,520
stopping you

2939
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:35,679
like like on windows if you want you can

2940
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:36,719
just choose to only install games from

2941
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:38,960
steam

2942
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:41,039
nobody stops you from doing that if you

2943
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:41,520
think that valve is doing a better job

2944
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:44,639
of that

2945
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:46,880
you never have to go to itch.io

2946
02:15:44,639 --> 02:15:46,880
right

2947
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,119
i i don't know if your argument is like

2948
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:53,840
well grandma

2949
02:15:51,118 --> 02:15:55,279
and she doesn't know it's like okay are

2950
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:56,800
you actually saying that the world

2951
02:15:55,279 --> 02:15:59,840
should be governed

2952
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:01,440
in a in a way that is uh

2953
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:03,199
entirely determined on whether you think

2954
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:06,399
your grandmother can handle it

2955
02:16:03,198 --> 02:16:06,960
like i i what i mean in that case we

2956
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:09,279
wouldn't have

2957
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:10,639
cars right cause you know that grandma's

2958
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:12,319
gonna get in an accident that's why we

2959
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:16,159
took away her license i just

2960
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:18,880
it's so weirdly it's like an attic

2961
02:16:16,158 --> 02:16:20,000
filled with like cobwebs in the part of

2962
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,319
the brain that was supposed to come up

2963
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:23,439
with an

2964
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:27,118
actual argument right

2965
02:16:23,439 --> 02:16:27,519
um anyway uh so this is the part of the

2966
02:16:27,118 --> 02:16:29,598
code

2967
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:31,280
going back to here that i don't really

2968
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:32,478
know and it's hard for me to step

2969
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:33,599
through because it's doing like this

2970
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:35,039
weird thing

2971
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:37,280
i'm not sure if what's happening there

2972
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:39,120
is we're stepping over these

2973
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:41,120
because they're not triggering and let

2974
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,319
me just see if that's the case so that

2975
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:43,599
we at least know what we're looking at

2976
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:44,638
because the debugger is doing a weird

2977
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:46,478
thing there

2978
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:48,478
and and i just don't know why it's doing

2979
02:16:46,478 --> 02:16:50,799
that right

2980
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:50,799
um

2981
02:16:55,599 --> 02:17:01,840
oh well first of all these are backwards

2982
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,760
that should not have caused a problem

2983
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:08,960
though so that's a little scary

2984
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:16,800
um so we're still buggy but

2985
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:16,799
we forgot the knot forgot the not

2986
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:21,040
i can't even blame that on the politics

2987
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:24,398
because i wrote this before

2988
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:29,760
um the apple garbage

2989
02:17:24,398 --> 02:17:32,799
um so i think uh

2990
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:34,719
in here we've done the occupied we do

2991
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:36,478
the not occupied for all these

2992
02:17:34,718 --> 02:17:37,919
this is this is still buggy though

2993
02:17:36,478 --> 02:17:39,279
because it should have still always

2994
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:42,638
terminated

2995
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:45,840
so it's still not it's not right

2996
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:47,358
you know um we must still have a bug in

2997
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:51,040
how this works

2998
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:54,479
uh separately from that

2999
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:56,080
um oh and it steps right now though

3000
02:17:54,478 --> 02:17:59,119
it steps right now so we can actually

3001
02:17:56,079 --> 02:18:02,000
see it um

3002
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:03,359
okay so it picks up the bests if you can

3003
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,920
do it it's picking up the best this

3004
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:09,200
one's a distance squared of zero anyway

3005
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:13,519
um so we don't have to care uh

3006
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:15,040
about that and we want to look at one

3007
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:16,639
uh that actually has a distance squared

3008
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:18,479
like that one so that's good

3009
02:18:16,638 --> 02:18:20,159
uh when we produce the distance squared

3010
02:18:18,478 --> 02:18:21,760
you know let's go down here

3011
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:24,079
uh when you produce this squared we can

3012
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:26,159
look and see uh

3013
02:18:24,079 --> 02:18:28,000
how we do so we look here and we say

3014
02:18:26,159 --> 02:18:31,039
okay are we gonna update the best

3015
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,120
min corner um based on on

3016
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,479
a diagonal move let's see like let's

3017
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:36,639
just try to think it through and see

3018
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:38,318
what we would expect like like is this

3019
02:18:36,638 --> 02:18:38,879
is this thing we we think should be

3020
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:42,159
happening

3021
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:42,879
or not right so here's the place we're

3022
02:18:42,159 --> 02:18:45,679
trying to get to

3023
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:46,239
we're trying to get to this 2p here um

3024
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:49,280
and

3025
02:18:46,239 --> 02:18:51,920
we're starting off at this min corner

3026
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:52,319
so you can see that like the min corner

3027
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:54,000
that

3028
02:18:52,318 --> 02:18:55,679
we're trying to get to and the place

3029
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:58,959
that we are now are like

3030
02:18:55,679 --> 02:19:02,000
we're totally in the right location

3031
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:02,478
except for the y so what we want to do

3032
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,040
really

3033
02:19:02,478 --> 02:19:06,478
is just move backwards in y we just want

3034
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:09,760
to go negative y

3035
02:19:06,478 --> 02:19:10,799
right um so let's take a look at what

3036
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:12,559
happens

3037
02:19:10,799 --> 02:19:14,239
when we update best you can see that

3038
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:16,079
that would have got closer which may be

3039
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:18,558
true because it's a diagonal move

3040
02:19:16,079 --> 02:19:19,439
what we want to do here is that probably

3041
02:19:18,558 --> 02:19:22,159
won't trigger

3042
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:22,639
this should trigger hopefully and it did

3043
02:19:22,159 --> 02:19:24,318
so

3044
02:19:22,638 --> 02:19:26,079
that's hopefully the one we pick and it

3045
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:28,718
is so now we

3046
02:19:26,079 --> 02:19:30,478
accept this new min corner the best min

3047
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:34,000
corner here

3048
02:19:30,478 --> 02:19:34,298
which is a one y move right

3049
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,378
um

3050
02:19:34,299 --> 02:19:37,378
[Music]

3051
02:19:38,079 --> 02:19:43,760
although it's not

3052
02:19:42,159 --> 02:19:45,519
oh yes it is i'm sorry we're moving from

3053
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:48,478
oregon corner yes

3054
02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:49,520
so that should just move uh hopefully

3055
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:52,959
along that

3056
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:56,079
voxel now um and

3057
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:59,599
and that's it right hopefully

3058
02:19:56,079 --> 02:20:03,359
it will just go until it gets

3059
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:17,840
close enough to count

3060
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:17,840
and we'll see if it terminates

3061
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:26,550
[Laughter]

3062
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:32,719
okay

3063
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:36,239
when we move that out of the loop kinda

3064
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:39,279
gotta reset the move condition right

3065
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:39,760
yeah uh we could just check to see if

3066
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:44,640
the

3067
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:48,239
minimum distance decreased um

3068
02:20:44,639 --> 02:20:50,318
that might be better uh

3069
02:20:48,239 --> 02:20:52,959
but i think we're good now that was

3070
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:54,559
probably the only problem

3071
02:20:52,959 --> 02:20:56,398
um the routine probably still has tons

3072
02:20:54,559 --> 02:20:59,760
of bugs in it we'll look at them

3073
02:20:56,398 --> 02:21:00,000
next week uh let's see what the status

3074
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:02,559
is

3075
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,760
if we run it now um hey look it's

3076
02:21:02,559 --> 02:21:08,000
running

3077
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:09,840
um you can see that it's weirdly

3078
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,280
it's moving in the direction it should

3079
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:15,200
but it's only moving like

3080
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:17,520
one voxel step like that was weird

3081
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:18,720
it's like not do we not return the right

3082
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:22,640
oh

3083
02:21:18,719 --> 02:21:26,879
it's because we're never setting this so

3084
02:21:22,639 --> 02:21:30,000
when we leave this routine um best

3085
02:21:26,879 --> 02:21:33,839
needs to create that best cell so

3086
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,879
so this thing here um

3087
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:36,880
so so like

3088
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:41,039
this is probably not exactly the way you

3089
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:45,040
would want to do this

3090
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:45,040
but it would be like you know

3091
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:52,478
that we weren't actually using the

3092
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:55,680
result from that

3093
02:21:52,478 --> 02:21:58,879
uh and we we want to right so let's

3094
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:58,880
let's see what happens there

3095
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:02,319
so there's our like collision detector

3096
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:05,920
maybe

3097
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:05,920
collision detecting we don't really know

3098
02:22:07,439 --> 02:22:10,479
so it looks like that's able to

3099
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,560
penetrate into the wall

3100
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:13,599
in a weird way so we're not out of the

3101
02:22:12,559 --> 02:22:15,600
woods yet

3102
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:16,800
um i think we're in good shape but we're

3103
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:20,000
not out of the woods yet

3104
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:21,199
right we're getting there but but not

3105
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,840
yet

3106
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:23,840
um

3107
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:33,600
so i'm gonna leave it there and we'll go

3108
02:22:28,478 --> 02:22:33,599
uh we'll we'll go ahead and um

3109
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:37,840
and uh pick it up next time

3110
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:47,359
oh the j the the stream title is always

3111
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:51,840
a joke

3112
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:51,840
i just randomly said it

3113
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:28,159
oh hey x13 yeah it

3114
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,680
oddly enough changed when i set when i

3115
02:23:28,159 --> 02:23:31,200
switched to the not

3116
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:33,840
so it must have been something that

3117
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:36,000
visual studios pdb was outputting

3118
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:37,040
right like because when i changed when

3119
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,439
the code changed

3120
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:40,479
it stopped happening so it's it's some

3121
02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:43,040
kind of weird pdb

3122
02:23:40,478 --> 02:23:44,239
thing probably because of a multi-line

3123
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:48,080
the multi-line or

3124
02:23:44,239 --> 02:23:50,239
statement it was in debug mode

3125
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:53,200
it was a debug pdb and it was when you

3126
02:23:50,239 --> 02:23:54,799
do it without the not

3127
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:56,240
and and i don't know what was going on

3128
02:23:54,799 --> 02:24:00,159
there

3129
02:23:56,239 --> 02:24:04,879
uh right

3130
02:24:00,159 --> 02:24:05,359
so can you explain how that .125 thing

3131
02:24:04,879 --> 02:24:08,398
works

3132
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:08,399
um sure so

3133
02:24:08,959 --> 02:24:13,119
when you uh are using floating point

3134
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:16,559
numbers

3135
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:19,840
floating point numbers are

3136
02:24:16,559 --> 02:24:23,279
basically just if if you

3137
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:26,639
think about how you represent

3138
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:29,280
decimals like regular

3139
02:24:26,639 --> 02:24:30,559
numbers that we think of as humans if

3140
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:31,840
you think about how they're represented

3141
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:33,680
in binary

3142
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:35,600
you have bits that represent powers of

3143
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:38,079
two right

3144
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:40,720
so when you're trying to represent a

3145
02:24:38,079 --> 02:24:43,200
number that's not fractional

3146
02:24:40,719 --> 02:24:44,000
it's a little bit easier because you're

3147
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:46,560
just thinking

3148
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,760
oh i've got the digits if i want to

3149
02:24:46,559 --> 02:24:50,959
write something like

3150
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:53,120
9 right

3151
02:24:50,959 --> 02:24:54,639
then i just say well that's going to be

3152
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:58,160
like a 1

3153
02:24:54,639 --> 02:25:00,318
plus an 8 so i set the 1

3154
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:02,799
bit and i set the 8 bit and now i've got

3155
02:25:00,318 --> 02:25:05,519
9 right

3156
02:25:02,799 --> 02:25:06,879
when you're looking at fractional values

3157
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:09,280
that is not

3158
02:25:06,879 --> 02:25:10,959
how it actually works the way that

3159
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:14,239
fractional values work is

3160
02:25:10,959 --> 02:25:17,919
each one of the uh

3161
02:25:14,239 --> 02:25:21,600
bits divides by that power of two

3162
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:24,639
right so if you set the bit

3163
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:27,680
for divide by half

3164
02:25:24,639 --> 02:25:28,559
you get 0.5 if you set the bit for

3165
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:30,880
dividing

3166
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:34,318
again you know next place down you would

3167
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:37,438
get you know 0.25 or whatever right

3168
02:25:34,318 --> 02:25:39,039
so you can and this is not quite true

3169
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:41,840
because this is not fixed point

3170
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:43,920
there's also there's an exponent so what

3171
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:44,639
you're actually doing is locating around

3172
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:46,478
one of those

3173
02:25:44,639 --> 02:25:48,478
it's a little bit hard to explain but

3174
02:25:46,478 --> 02:25:50,318
the without a diagram and going into

3175
02:25:48,478 --> 02:25:53,039
floating point numbers more

3176
02:25:50,318 --> 02:25:54,959
but you're finding the power of two that

3177
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:58,720
divides to as close as where you

3178
02:25:54,959 --> 02:26:03,599
are and then right you're putting

3179
02:25:58,719 --> 02:26:05,039
in some mantissa on top of that right

3180
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:07,680
so no matter what you do when you're

3181
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:12,560
talking about dividing by powers of two

3182
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:14,880
you can never divide uh by like

3183
02:26:12,559 --> 02:26:16,079
you can never divide you can never get

3184
02:26:14,879 --> 02:26:19,279
an exact

3185
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:20,079
fraction if that fraction could not have

3186
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:23,200
been expressed

3187
02:26:20,079 --> 02:26:24,559
by dividing by powers of 2. you see what

3188
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:27,600
i'm saying

3189
02:26:24,559 --> 02:26:28,398
right so if you want to have something

3190
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:31,439
that has

3191
02:26:28,398 --> 02:26:34,799
a divide by a power of

3192
02:26:31,439 --> 02:26:38,000
5 in there which is what

3193
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:40,478
point 1 would be

3194
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,359
you're never going to get it because no

3195
02:26:40,478 --> 02:26:44,079
combination

3196
02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:46,000
of divides by powers of 2 it will ever

3197
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:49,280
get you a power of 5

3198
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,239
right one over five cannot be

3199
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:53,920
represented

3200
02:26:50,239 --> 02:26:55,359
by any combination of one over

3201
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:56,799
you know two to the something times two

3202
02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:57,840
to something times you know whatever

3203
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:02,559
kinds of things

3204
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:04,880
right you know what i'm saying so

3205
02:27:02,559 --> 02:27:06,799
if you are setting up something like a

3206
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:09,279
grid step

3207
02:27:06,799 --> 02:27:11,199
you can get your numbers to be exact by

3208
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:15,200
setting that grid's distance to be

3209
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:18,479
a power of two divide right

3210
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:20,159
um so the reason i picked 0.125 was i

3211
02:27:18,478 --> 02:27:22,478
wanted the numbers to not have all these

3212
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:25,920
trailing

3213
02:27:22,478 --> 02:27:27,920
uh fractional parts because if i pick

3214
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,840
like a decimal number they're going to

3215
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:31,840
because it's the computer just trying to

3216
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:32,639
represent it as close as possible and

3217
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:36,398
it's getting

3218
02:27:32,639 --> 02:27:39,519
really close like don't get me wrong

3219
02:27:36,398 --> 02:27:40,959
but it's not exact whereas if i just

3220
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:41,520
pick a power of something that's a

3221
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:44,559
straight up

3222
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:45,120
easy divide by a power of two of some

3223
02:27:44,559 --> 02:27:46,719
kind

3224
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:48,399
then that's just trivial for it to be

3225
02:27:46,719 --> 02:27:48,719
exact it just sets the exponent to that

3226
02:27:48,398 --> 02:27:52,799
and

3227
02:27:48,719 --> 02:27:53,840
that's it right and you've got it

3228
02:27:52,799 --> 02:27:55,519
doesn't matter how many bits of

3229
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:56,000
precision in the mantissa there are it

3230
02:27:55,520 --> 02:28:00,319
just

3231
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:13,840
works right um

3232
02:28:00,318 --> 02:28:13,840
that's that's really it uh

3233
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:24,840
um there's also like a standard

3234
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:27,840
reference for this stuff

3235
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:27,840
um

3236
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:58,478
that's the one but let's use a oops

3237
02:28:55,439 --> 02:28:58,479
i'm getting binge here

3238
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:08,559
so here you go um this is like the sort

3239
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:13,120
of standard reference

3240
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:13,119
right for this sort of stuff um

3241
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:23,840
which you can peruse

3242
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:37,120
oh and mike biddlecombe was saying that

3243
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:40,398
that bruce dawson has some posts on this

3244
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:44,160
um i have not read that but uh

3245
02:29:40,398 --> 02:29:47,119
presumably uh mike can post the link

3246
02:29:44,159 --> 02:29:51,840
to him it looks like someone else posted

3247
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:51,840
a floating point guide link as well

3248
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:00,800
how much of a difference can this minute

3249
02:29:58,959 --> 02:30:03,199
computation really make in real time

3250
02:30:00,799 --> 02:30:05,279
are you talking about the .125 versus

3251
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:06,800
point one thing

3252
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:09,040
is that is that what you're asking about

3253
02:30:06,799 --> 02:30:19,840
i'm not not sure what you're asking

3254
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:19,840
is that what you're asking about

3255
02:30:26,079 --> 02:30:31,920
um so uh i

3256
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:33,439
just in case it wasn't clear oh well i

3257
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:36,719
guess which it wasn't

3258
02:30:33,439 --> 02:30:37,840
i didn't change those because i was

3259
02:30:36,719 --> 02:30:41,039
afraid

3260
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:42,719
that the math would work poorly

3261
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:44,319
although maybe you get some benefit from

3262
02:30:42,719 --> 02:30:46,719
that as well but

3263
02:30:44,318 --> 02:30:47,840
i did it so i could read the numbers

3264
02:30:46,719 --> 02:30:51,519
easier

3265
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:55,520
right so what happens is

3266
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:56,960
when you when you look

3267
02:30:55,520 --> 02:31:00,479
in the debugger and you're trying to

3268
02:30:56,959 --> 02:31:03,759
read numbers if i set this thing right

3269
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:06,398
to point one you know

3270
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:08,239
and i i'm going through the debugger and

3271
02:31:06,398 --> 02:31:10,318
i'm trying to read it

3272
02:31:08,239 --> 02:31:11,840
then the debugger is just pulling values

3273
02:31:10,318 --> 02:31:14,239
out of the stack

3274
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:15,280
and showing them to me it doesn't know

3275
02:31:14,239 --> 02:31:17,680
where they came from

3276
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:19,200
or if they should be rounded or anything

3277
02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:19,920
like that it doesn't know what i'm

3278
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:22,960
writing

3279
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:24,079
right so it's just going to show me the

3280
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:26,639
value

3281
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:28,000
the floating point value and i'm going

3282
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:31,119
to see

3283
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,719
all of this crap right

3284
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:34,319
that's all you're gonna see is that kind

3285
02:31:32,719 --> 02:31:37,519
of thing

3286
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:40,799
and the reason is because it was trying

3287
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:44,079
there to say 0.7

3288
02:31:40,799 --> 02:31:45,920
but you can't represent 0.7

3289
02:31:44,079 --> 02:31:47,120
so the actual floating point value is

3290
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:49,120
not 0.7

3291
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:51,040
and if the debugger rounded it to 0.7

3292
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,920
you'd be pretty mad because it's lying

3293
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,160
to you

3294
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:55,200
you're like that's not what's in i know

3295
02:31:54,159 --> 02:31:57,039
0.7 is not

3296
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:58,720
in that floating point number because

3297
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:59,359
you can't make 0.7 in a floating point

3298
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:02,398
number

3299
02:31:59,359 --> 02:32:05,439
right so it's

3300
02:32:02,398 --> 02:32:06,879
it's all i was doing was just

3301
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:08,880
making it easier on us because i know

3302
02:32:06,879 --> 02:32:10,799
we're going to debug this next

3303
02:32:08,879 --> 02:32:12,159
i mean i wanna debug a little bit today

3304
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:13,920
and then i know that's what i'm gonna be

3305
02:32:12,159 --> 02:32:16,079
doing is reading through that and being

3306
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:17,280
like carefully like analyzing what's

3307
02:32:16,079 --> 02:32:20,398
going on i just

3308
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:24,000
if i set it to an easy divide power two

3309
02:32:20,398 --> 02:32:27,840
all i'm doing is buying myself a little

3310
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:31,359
uh convenience because now when we look

3311
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:39,840
um at the values well if it actually

3312
02:32:31,359 --> 02:32:39,840
that not actually compile there we go

3313
02:32:40,559 --> 02:32:43,840
there we go now uh when we look at the

3314
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:46,159
values

3315
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:47,920
what you can see is that well and this

3316
02:32:46,159 --> 02:32:49,600
is a bad example because the 2p

3317
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:51,120
i shouldn't have picked this the 2p is

3318
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:52,720
the thing that comes in from the engine

3319
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:54,880
which can be anywhere

3320
02:32:52,719 --> 02:32:56,159
um this is actually the part i was

3321
02:32:54,879 --> 02:32:58,239
talking about

3322
02:32:56,159 --> 02:33:00,639
i should reshow it to you because i had

3323
02:32:58,239 --> 02:33:03,920
the wrong thing open sorry about that

3324
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:03,920
so at point one

3325
02:33:04,799 --> 02:33:08,799
uh we look at what the corner is that it

3326
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:09,120
finds which is the thing that it's you

3327
02:33:08,799 --> 02:33:11,840
know

3328
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:13,200
aligning to and you can see you get all

3329
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:15,840
these like point two

3330
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:16,800
point two point two right kind of things

3331
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:19,680
in there

3332
02:33:16,799 --> 02:33:20,000
um and as i go through it right when i

3333
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:22,559
step

3334
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,920
through i get weird twelve point two

3335
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:27,519
nine nine nine nine nine

3336
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:30,398
right and so all i was doing the only

3337
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:33,760
thing i was trying to do is say look

3338
02:33:30,398 --> 02:33:35,519
let's just always use a step size that

3339
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:36,159
happens to be exactly representable and

3340
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:39,120
float

3341
02:33:36,159 --> 02:33:39,119
for legibility

3342
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:45,600
that's it no no point to it

3343
02:33:42,879 --> 02:33:46,159
whatsoever so now look at they're all

3344
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:49,680
nice

3345
02:33:46,159 --> 02:33:52,318
and clean right that was it

3346
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:53,840
um i don't expect the math to come out

3347
02:33:52,318 --> 02:33:56,799
particularly much better

3348
02:33:53,840 --> 02:34:00,079
or something although that can happen

3349
02:33:56,799 --> 02:34:03,239
depending on what you're doing

3350
02:34:00,079 --> 02:34:06,728
right um so

3351
02:34:03,239 --> 02:34:06,728
[Music]

3352
02:34:22,639 --> 02:34:26,639
how long have you worked on this project

3353
02:34:24,318 --> 02:34:29,840
i don't know how to add it up

3354
02:34:26,639 --> 02:34:30,559
so we only 100 of the programming

3355
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:33,280
happens on

3356
02:34:30,559 --> 02:34:34,159
on stream and we only program a few

3357
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:37,439
hours a week

3358
02:34:34,159 --> 02:34:40,559
on the stream but

3359
02:34:37,439 --> 02:34:42,840
uh probably at least a thousand a

3360
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:46,719
thousand hours

3361
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:48,079
maybe uh if you put that into work terms

3362
02:34:46,719 --> 02:34:48,879
like how long i've been working on the

3363
02:34:48,079 --> 02:34:59,600
project so

3364
02:34:48,879 --> 02:35:01,920
like uh where's the speed crunch thingy

3365
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:03,520
so i don't really know but maybe it's

3366
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:06,000
something like a thousand hours

3367
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:06,560
so if you worked you know i don't know

3368
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,559
30

3369
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:10,000
programming hours a week and the other

3370
02:35:08,559 --> 02:35:12,478
10 hours you were in

3371
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,520
really bad meetings where people said

3372
02:35:12,478 --> 02:35:17,679
stupid stuff to you

3373
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:21,840
it's about 30 weeks let's say

3374
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:21,840
so we were working on it you know

3375
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:27,840
oops

3376
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,719
about two-thirds of the year if it was

3377
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:37,200
real work

3378
02:35:32,719 --> 02:35:38,799
um so figure two-thirds of a year worth

3379
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:41,840
of work

3380
02:35:38,799 --> 02:35:44,398
has gone into this if you count

3381
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:45,520
how depending how you count it on-stream

3382
02:35:44,398 --> 02:35:49,039
programming is

3383
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:55,840
harder than off-stream programming so

3384
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:55,840
you know

3385
02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:07,600
new to this thank you for saying that it

3386
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:10,559
looks like a render

3387
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:11,439
um i i was i was proud of the lighting

3388
02:36:10,559 --> 02:36:12,799
i'm not gonna lie

3389
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:15,120
i was proud of getting the lighting set

3390
02:36:12,799 --> 02:36:16,159
up i went many years without ever having

3391
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:22,000
any lighting

3392
02:36:16,159 --> 02:36:24,478
and i was like we're gonna fix this

3393
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,639
yeah we we need at one of these streams

3394
02:36:24,478 --> 02:36:29,679
we gotta just have a meeting

3395
02:36:26,639 --> 02:36:30,079
just you know we'll we'll get some of

3396
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:32,010
you

3397
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:33,200
y'all on the chat will

3398
02:36:32,010 --> 02:36:36,159
[Music]

3399
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:36,640
like use a discord room to get like 10

3400
02:36:36,159 --> 02:36:39,920
people

3401
02:36:36,639 --> 02:36:43,439
in the thing and the only rule will be

3402
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:46,318
that for the entire time

3403
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:47,680
nobody can say anything provocative

3404
02:36:46,318 --> 02:36:50,079
interesting or useful

3405
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:52,318
like everyone just has to like say stuff

3406
02:36:50,079 --> 02:36:52,318
like

3407
02:36:52,559 --> 02:36:58,959
how are we going to factor in the

3408
02:36:55,840 --> 02:37:02,840
user experience to this piece of code or

3409
02:36:58,959 --> 02:37:05,519
like like just you just have to say like

3410
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:09,680
vague

3411
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:12,880
unproductive unprovocative comments

3412
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:13,840
for like an hour and make sure that

3413
02:37:12,879 --> 02:37:15,920
nothing is

3414
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:19,840
is achieved and then we can call that

3415
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:19,840
like our official handmade meeting

3416
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:28,159
uh

3417
02:37:28,959 --> 02:37:32,559
is i o auto rare revs i don't know how

3418
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:36,880
to pronounce that

3419
02:37:32,559 --> 02:37:36,879
um it's just mirrored

3420
02:37:44,879 --> 02:37:52,879
bulmanator totally

3421
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:52,879
totally galactus

3422
02:37:52,959 --> 02:38:05,679
it's galactus pain

3423
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:05,679
ezio auditora

3424
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:17,120
ezio auditora

3425
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:20,240
something like that all right

3426
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:20,800
uh yeah i agree dynamically should be

3427
02:38:20,239 --> 02:38:23,280
said

3428
02:38:20,799 --> 02:38:24,559
scale scale we should spend a lot of

3429
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:26,720
time worrying about if it's going to

3430
02:38:24,559 --> 02:38:28,799
scale

3431
02:38:26,719 --> 02:38:30,559
you know we should just say stuff about

3432
02:38:28,799 --> 02:38:32,079
is this going to scale i think this will

3433
02:38:30,559 --> 02:38:35,119
scale it will scale better

3434
02:38:32,079 --> 02:38:38,239
if we something

3435
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:39,120
you know we've got to be scared scales

3436
02:38:38,239 --> 02:38:43,119
got to be in there

3437
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:44,960
dynamic and scale very important

3438
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:46,319
maybe we can just dynamically scale

3439
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:48,159
everything will be

3440
02:38:46,318 --> 02:38:50,478
very dynamic and very scalable and very

3441
02:38:48,159 --> 02:38:57,840
dynamically scalable

3442
02:38:50,478 --> 02:38:57,840
i think

3443
02:39:00,879 --> 02:39:05,199
oh ezio auditore is the main character

3444
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:11,840
from assassin's creed

3445
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:11,840
ii okay

3446
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,478
all right

3447
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:20,399
i think i'm pretty happy with how that

3448
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:22,399
collision routine is coming i'm

3449
02:39:20,398 --> 02:39:24,159
i'm pretty comfortable that to say that

3450
02:39:22,398 --> 02:39:25,439
like maybe next weekend i think we'll be

3451
02:39:24,159 --> 02:39:28,879
able to to clean it up

3452
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:31,760
and have something sort of working um

3453
02:39:28,879 --> 02:39:33,920
but who knows that could be a lie we'll

3454
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:33,920
see

3455
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,000
all right uh thanks everyone for joining

3456
02:39:36,478 --> 02:39:39,519
me for an episode of handmade hero it's

3457
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:42,639
been a pleasure coding with you as

3458
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:44,640
always um if you do want to follow along

3459
02:39:42,639 --> 02:39:46,719
with the series at home and maybe you

3460
02:39:44,639 --> 02:39:48,959
want to go see if you can make sure that

3461
02:39:46,719 --> 02:39:50,000
routine works before i get to it

3462
02:39:48,959 --> 02:39:51,519
you can always pre-order the game on

3463
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,478
handmadeer.org and it comes with a

3464
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:53,600
source code

3465
02:39:52,478 --> 02:39:56,239
so you can play around with it if you

3466
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:58,000
want to and

3467
02:39:56,239 --> 02:40:00,079
yeah that collision detection routine i

3468
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:02,639
think is is in pretty good shape

3469
02:40:00,079 --> 02:40:04,318
it just needs it needs to be gone

3470
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:07,279
through with a fine-tooth comb

3471
02:40:04,318 --> 02:40:08,000
so uh when we get to that i think we'll

3472
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:10,960
be happy

3473
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,318
and then we can do some battle code

3474
02:40:10,959 --> 02:40:13,599
which we don't really know what we're

3475
02:40:12,318 --> 02:40:15,278
gonna do

3476
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:16,880
that's game design decision stuff which

3477
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:20,239
is not really what i do

3478
02:40:16,879 --> 02:40:22,398
but we'll make some decisions um

3479
02:40:20,239 --> 02:40:24,799
love galactus uh we'll push this out a

3480
02:40:22,398 --> 02:40:26,959
couple years

3481
02:40:24,799 --> 02:40:28,318
so until next week have fun program

3482
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:34,159
everyone and i'll see you on the

3483
02:40:28,318 --> 02:40:36,239
internet take it easy everybody

3484
02:40:34,159 --> 02:40:36,239
you
