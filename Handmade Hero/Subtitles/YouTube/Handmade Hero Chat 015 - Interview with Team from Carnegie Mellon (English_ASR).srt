1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,130
all right all right we should be live

2
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:17,759
now in theory and there yes the twitch

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,789
buffer has like you know finally catch

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:28,439
up with with however many seconds they

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:29,580
need yeah we're good all right so yeah I

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,469
guess we can start just kind of

7
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:34,320
introducing ourselves so we'll go around

8
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:37,049
the table I'm Jake I'm one of the

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,308
programmers on the team I haven't told

10
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,899
you I'm also a programmer

11
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:47,670
I'm PD I'm Jared I'm the producer I'm

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,739
sitting off screen taking notes okay the

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,129
fourth the off-screen programmer yes

14
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,599
okay and yeah just kind of give you a

15
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,420
little bit of a background about our

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,399
project so we're at school at Carnegie

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,698
Mellon at the entertainment Technology

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,349
Center and so part of that is after your

19
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:06,420
first semester you do semester long

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,609
projects where you just kind of focus on

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,590
doing one thing and so this semester

22
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:14,640
we're focusing on building a game engine

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,140
seeing how that goes so we kind of been

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,390
like doing our research in it of like

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,709
okay what before the semester starting

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,269
up like what goes into a game engine

27
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,728
there's a lot of things out there like

28
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,438
handmade hero and Jason Gregory's game

29
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:27,659
engine architecture book it kind of go

30
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,489
over all of it but we really didn't feel

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,430
like we know how to do it until we kind

32
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,798
of sat down and tried to do it ourselves

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,570
that's very true that's very true and so

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
we're going through that and then we're

35
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,919
the goal of the semester is to kind of

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,478
go through and when we were looking at

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,850
how other people did it we found a lot

38
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,890
of people who would wait till the end a

39
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:48,478
lot of like this other student projects

40
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,890
they wait till the end and then tell you

41
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,170
all about all the cool features they did

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,239
but no one really there wasn't many

43
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,829
others like your hand made here a series

44
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,118
that kind of went through like their

45
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:59,188
decisions and their thoughts throughout

46
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,228
the whole thing and so we kind of want

47
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,669
to go through the whole semester of like

48
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:04,920
documenting okay we made this decision

49
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,450
and this is why it's probably not the

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,890
right decision but we'll see where it

51
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,899
goes and then two months down the line

52
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,080
kind of say oh this is why it was the

53
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,080
wrong decision

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,289
and then talking to professionals like

55
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,939
yourself about okay we're doing this

56
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,400
project what what kind of advice do you

57
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,019
guys have and where you started and kind

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,150
of what other engine developers have to

59
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,280
say about the topic that sounds really

60
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,930
cool actually keeping track of why you

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,409
make decisions is definitely something

62
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,000
that I wish I did more often there are

63
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,739
certain projects where I've been like I

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,598
really want to make sure I get some of

65
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,430
these things correct and on those I

66
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,560
always take meticulous notes on them and

67
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,120
other ones I just don't for whatever

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,159
reason and you usually end up wishing

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,200
that you did because you're like why did

70
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,299
I think this was a good idea again and

71
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,879
like it helps to be able to go back and

72
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,319
know because sometimes it wasn't a good

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,568
decision and but it's interesting to

74
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,869
know why you thought so other times you

75
00:02:54,568 --> 00:03:00,149
forget why it was a good decision and

76
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,500
then you go to change it and only after

77
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,539
like a couple days of doing other stuff

78
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,568
do you run into something like oh that's

79
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:08,669
why I have a trite few you know future

80
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:11,039
self was dumber than past self in that

81
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:14,699
sense so yeah I do think that's a very

82
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,650
good good practice to try yeah we're

83
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:19,229
very curious kind of see how it works of

84
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,389
like being further down the line like

85
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,979
how much we learn over just doing

86
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:24,780
because we only have about three months

87
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,858
to build this game engine so it's very

88
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,019
simple in yeah we've just seeing how

89
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,099
much progressively I bet by the end of

90
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,719
the semester we'll kind of turn around

91
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:35,699
and like all that stuff we made at the

92
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,039
beginning was just almost garbage

93
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,009
compared to what we're doing yes yes

94
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,039
that's that's probably true but I mean I

95
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:45,739
guess the other thing I would say is

96
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,539
there's definitely a tendency to

97
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:51,120
undervalue code that you have written

98
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:53,039
that is working a lot of times those

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,329
programmers it's very tempting and and

100
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,858
you're not wrong

101
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:59,400
right when you look back at code and go

102
00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:00,659
wow I could do so much better but one of

103
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,789
the things interesting about that that I

104
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,650
find anyway is that a lot of times there

105
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:07,259
are a bunch of things you did in there

106
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:10,230
that you're forgetting are important and

107
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,000
that work and like it's almost like I

108
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,649
tend to look at code in a little bit of

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,930
more of a Darwinian sense these days

110
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,410
than I used to where it's like code that

111
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,870
can do something has a certain value to

112
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,939
it that code that's in your head that is

113
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,340
better doesn't have yet right and

114
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:28,959
depending on how complex the code that

115
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,529
your the problem that you're tackling is

116
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:35,229
sometimes you can drastically undervalue

117
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:36,699
those things that went right simply by

118
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,520
virtue the fact that the thing works you

119
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:41,469
know that they did and so I would also I

120
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,229
often try to encourage people especially

121
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:48,850
you sort of programmers with less

122
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,009
experience to sort of go don't be too

123
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,930
hard on your existing code if it works

124
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,719
because there's probably more to learn

125
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,550
there than you think there is or another

126
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,710
way to say it was you did better than

127
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,480
you think you did I think there's a lot

128
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,159
of talk about people you always say

129
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,230
clean code or is it elegant or is this

130
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,560
sort of thing and there's a tendency to

131
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:12,069
discount it worked as a really important

132
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,319
part so always be a little bit proud of

133
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:15,939
something that worked and and take more

134
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,889
time than you might otherwise to

135
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:19,839
appreciate why it worked because there's

136
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,819
often more there than people think there

137
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,459
is and then they go to like do some

138
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,800
high-minded redesign of it and it turns

139
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,149
out worse than the original version

140
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,980
because they didn't spend time

141
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:31,269
appreciating just like what went right

142
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,590
you know

143
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:37,569
so yeah separate thing but yeah this

144
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:39,459
whole whole stock we're just kind of

145
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,610
trying to get pull as much information

146
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:46,269
like that out of you so as much like

147
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,919
sure so how we're thinking of doing this

148
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:49,299
interview as you saw in like the

149
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,039
questions is a kind of like a

150
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,720
pre-interview where we kind of try to

151
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,970
get to know you a little bit better with

152
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,370
some kind of more basic questions and

153
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,230
then kind of go into an interview more

154
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,780
focused on the technical details of game

155
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,069
engines feel free don't feel free like

156
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,659
you need to hold back or anything we

157
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,659
might not necessarily understand but

158
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,000
that's kind of the point of this okay

159
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,800
yeah and so I guess first kind of

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,879
question simple question is a key tell

161
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,009
us a little bit about your background

162
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,290
your your schooling your hobbies and

163
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,269
stuff like that but you think find it

164
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:22,720
interesting that could be interesting

165
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:25,299
for game and development type of work so

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,290
I guess you know this this answer is

167
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,500
probably not going to be very

168
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,000
interesting so I'll try to keep it short

169
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,310
essentially I started programming very

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,910
very young compared to people probably

171
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,139
from my generation simply because a lot

172
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,879
of people wouldn't have had

173
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,499
access to very much that they could do

174
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,120
to program but my father happened to be

175
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:47,349
a programmer and that was somewhat more

176
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,269
rare in the 1970s I was born in 1976 so

177
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:51,009
the number of people whose fathers or

178
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:52,598
mothers didn't that in that day and age

179
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:53,949
actually it was more common for females

180
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:57,519
to be programmers as well actually I

181
00:06:53,949 --> 00:07:00,430
think percentage-wise there were just

182
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,490
very few programmers at all right yeah

183
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,400
and so the chances that you had a parent

184
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,728
or you know in relative or something who

185
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,228
is programmer or even a neighbor was low

186
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:13,478
and the chances that you had programming

187
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:15,399
materials like compiler or books that

188
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:17,649
were about it or someone you could ask

189
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,149
was also low so it was pretty rare to

190
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,038
learn as early as I did I learned when I

191
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:23,978
was about seven years old my my dad

192
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,978
taught me basic on deck rainbow computer

193
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:29,500
and I just loved programming from then

194
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:31,449
like forward and even before then I used

195
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,778
to love typing on a computer just the

196
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:37,389
act of typing so I really never did

197
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:39,189
anything else I think I maybe gravitated

198
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,960
towards programming game engines because

199
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:44,379
it's a really interesting technical

200
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,878
thing to do and kids love games so at an

201
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,740
early age you're attending that's like

202
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,449
what you see most I you know I I

203
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,680
wouldn't have been naturally drawn to

204
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,550
like the the simulation of you know

205
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,050
thermodynamics that someone was doing it

206
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,908
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory at that

207
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,649
time as interesting is a technical

208
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:01,889
problem that may have been a child is

209
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,209
not aware or thinking of these things

210
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,098
today with the internet that may be very

211
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,628
different people may be getting exposure

212
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:09,098
to lots of other things that a computer

213
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:12,669
can do and they might think more about

214
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:14,620
that but you know I wasn't so what ended

215
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:19,240
up happening is I just really I worked

216
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,310
on that sort of stuff just on my own at

217
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,550
home on various different computers that

218
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,228
we had and I literally just never

219
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,620
stopped I didn't go to a college or

220
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,149
anything

221
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,158
I just ended up going into the game

222
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:33,698
industry sort of right out of high

223
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,259
school and I never have really done

224
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:39,098
anything other than game engine

225
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:41,139
programming hobby wise I do think I've

226
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,820
I've always been interested in sort of

227
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:45,970
the artistic things that go along with

228
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,370
game development so hobby wise I do tend

229
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,889
to look into and practice other things

230
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,399
like I've learned to do 3d modeling and

231
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:55,028
texture

232
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,500
and I've learned to do sketching like

233
00:08:55,028 --> 00:09:00,039
concept sketching in that sort of stuff

234
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,659
and I and I learned to play piano I took

235
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,299
lessons as piano as a child and that was

236
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:05,528
very helpful to understand music stuff

237
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:07,240
so there's been a bunch of other things

238
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:09,278
that I've done that helped to understand

239
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,200
and allow me to communicate with other

240
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,580
people who work on other parts of the

241
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,490
project in ways that are much better

242
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:18,310
than I would have otherwise yeah but I

243
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:22,149
never really took seriously any other

244
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:23,799
profession or occupation oriented thing

245
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,569
I've never really had that experience

246
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:28,299
for all I know I would like some other

247
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,910
occupation better I have no idea what I

248
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:33,429
would say is that the only interesting

249
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:35,679
takeaway I think from any of that it's

250
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:39,129
just that I would say that learning to

251
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,528
do other things even if you don't intend

252
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:43,539
to do them is very useful from not only

253
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:45,129
the fact that you can communicate more

254
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,539
effectively with the other people who

255
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:48,730
are going to be doing those things so an

256
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:51,459
engine programmer who knows how to do 3d

257
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,379
modeling is kind of very valuable in a

258
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,700
lot of ways on a team because the

259
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,799
modelers have no way of communicating

260
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,110
with you other than in the language that

261
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,819
they understand and about the tools that

262
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,980
they understand and if you literally

263
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,600
just don't know all of like what goes

264
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,740
into making a 3d model if you if you

265
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,080
don't know how to paint something in

266
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,940
ZBrush or you don't know how to like

267
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,730
resurface something in 3d studio or

268
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,380
whatever um you don't have to be great

269
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,959
at it but just knowing what goes into

270
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:19,179
that can be very nice because it means

271
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,289
that you can then understand exactly

272
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:22,120
what they're going through on a daily

273
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,278
basis and be more effective at helping

274
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,259
them or understanding their complaints

275
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:28,299
when they have them or assisting them in

276
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,159
getting their tools into a state that is

277
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:33,099
better for them and I saw I feel like

278
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,350
those things are very useful for engine

279
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,909
programmers to have if you don't like

280
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,320
doing those things it's not a bad thing

281
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,730
there's plenty of room for engine

282
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,410
programmers who just want to focus on

283
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,539
optimization there's a whole suite of

284
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:45,039
people who just do that but if you do

285
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,870
find yourself being more I don't know if

286
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,120
polymath is the word for it but if you

287
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,429
do find yourself wanting to have a

288
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,009
broader experience those things are

289
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:57,159
helpful and you will find those valuable

290
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:58,899
as you as you sort of work on technology

291
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:02,049
even though you're not technically doing

292
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:04,059
any of those other things yeah question

293
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:05,049
follow-up question to that is do you

294
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,329
find artists

295
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:08,949
or like designers coming to engine

296
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,440
developers and asking those questions or

297
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,700
is it more you as an engine development

298
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,950
kind of need to go out and see what

299
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,209
other people are doing and communicate

300
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:23,579
with them that way it's both so one of

301
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:28,229
the things that you'll find is that

302
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:31,389
artists in particular I think are very

303
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:34,420
boxed in in their understanding of what

304
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:36,939
a computer could be doing oftentimes and

305
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:39,549
this is because they have been sort of

306
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,850
brutally treated by tools like Photoshop

307
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:46,479
or any Autodesk product you might care

308
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:50,230
to purchase and so you know they may

309
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,269
have gone into art or computer art with

310
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,700
sort of a more boundless imagination of

311
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:56,470
what was possible but they have been

312
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,570
beaten down I mean you can pretty much

313
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,540
expect that any artist has been beaten

314
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,278
down to the point where their ability to

315
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:04,958
imagine what a tool could be doing for

316
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:11,019
them is very limited because they've

317
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:13,028
constantly faced just I don't want say

318
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,429
rejection but they've been constantly

319
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:18,070
faced with barriers to them ever

320
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:21,399
realizing any thing in their head they

321
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,829
may have had right so anything inside

322
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,870
that boundary you can usually count on

323
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,849
them to communicate to you so if it's

324
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,289
just a case of like I think this thing

325
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,230
should be working in Photoshop but it's

326
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:33,849
not or we would like a way to be able to

327
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,769
use this Photoshop feature but your

328
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,000
engine isn't supporting it those are the

329
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,850
kinds of things that an artist might

330
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,309
bring up to you things that they have

331
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,220
sort of been taught that the computer

332
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:47,469
does not do they don't know programming

333
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,028
a lot of times and can't be expected to

334
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,790
realize that that's just because Adobe

335
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:54,778
doesn't do that right like it just yeah

336
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:57,929
that thing isn't exist so anytime that

337
00:12:54,778 --> 00:13:01,448
you can observe an artist working or

338
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:03,429
spend time just looking at how they have

339
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,409
to go about creating things or working

340
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:08,139
with with the tools that they use to

341
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,819
make things is very valuable because you

342
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:12,250
will see things that a programmer

343
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,370
obviously knows could be fixed but then

344
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,440
an artist just may not realize can be

345
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,450
fixed and again I think that's just

346
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,010
because

347
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,070
that you know they're an artist they

348
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,259
think in art terms and they have never

349
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,540
have the ability to change the tool in

350
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:30,210
any meaningful way a lot of times yeah

351
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:31,649
so they just they just think that what

352
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,290
they have is what they have to live with

353
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,879
and and they especially the older the

354
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:38,159
artist is or the longer that they've

355
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,409
worked in with computer stuff the more

356
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,750
they will just accept the reality of the

357
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:44,610
tools and you can no longer expect them

358
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,730
to bring you any kind of pie in the sky

359
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,720
idea even though that may have been

360
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,690
something they would have thought of

361
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,680
before they were sort of taught rigidly

362
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:57,180
what is available to them another way

363
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,949
let's say it would be artists are used

364
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,079
to adapting to their medium when someone

365
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,370
gets a charcoal Penn State have to use

366
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,680
charcoal and they learn to use that

367
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,659
medium so it's exactly the same

368
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,250
computers after they adapt to the medium

369
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,419
they can no longer tell you what they

370
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,100
wish they would have because they've

371
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,769
been trained out of it essentially most

372
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,620
the time all right yeah that's a really

373
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,659
interesting point of view on that guy

374
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,590
actually going back a little further to

375
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:20,759
when you were saying you started

376
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:22,740
programming at seven and you're

377
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,960
interested in games too

378
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,700
when when you were around seven were you

379
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,620
making your first games or were you just

380
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,379
kind of experimenting making like hello

381
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,629
world type programs yes so when I was

382
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:36,919
seven both of those things are accurate

383
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:40,289
statement so when I was seven in basic

384
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:41,610
basic the the the basic language was

385
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,049
very much what you might think of as on

386
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,879
like an Apple 2 or something if you've

387
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:49,859
ever seen one of those old form you know

388
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:53,070
in a history museum or something so I

389
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,750
wanted to make a game but not only was I

390
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,770
not really capable of understanding a

391
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,629
lot of the stuff that would have gone

392
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:59,909
into anything that you would think of as

393
00:14:57,629 --> 00:15:01,740
a game today but basic wasn't super

394
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:04,139
capable of doing anything at any speed

395
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,549
in those days anyway I mean even if you

396
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,110
just wrote a semi language you couldn't

397
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:09,899
do things at very high speeds in those

398
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,070
days for obvious reasons so all I made

399
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,079
for games were things that would

400
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,570
basically print out like some text like

401
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,370
imagine a text adventure where instead

402
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,470
of actually because I didn't know how to

403
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,330
implement the back of a text adventure

404
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,009
it's more just like a multiple choice

405
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,540
right so it would print out like a line

406
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:26,700
of text and like be like what do you

407
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:29,159
want to do and it would be like one or

408
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,890
two and I would just hard code the

409
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,698
results right so you can think of it

410
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,159
kind of

411
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:38,188
of games that are sort of on the level

412
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,828
of interactivity of you know a today's

413
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:42,990
game by say David cage do you want to

414
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:45,778
push the button to do the thing or not

415
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,230
right like and that's all you get right

416
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:52,169
so it was that without all of the fancy

417
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,149
graphics was all I could do for obvious

418
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:56,068
reasons a to my brain was just not

419
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:57,600
capable of understanding at all no

420
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,639
experience and then the fact that

421
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,959
computers are so slow to write so so

422
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:05,818
yeah they were games but yeah yeah I

423
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,128
think everyone's kind of first game

424
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:11,278
mm-hmm

425
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:13,050
so then going off off of that when about

426
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,799
would you say you started creating your

427
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:19,169
first engine like about how old / like

428
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:23,549
and water around what were you thinking

429
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:26,039
of building so the first engine that I

430
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:28,620
liked I would say that I attempted to

431
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:32,188
build I guess I would say that I did

432
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:36,299
build it is in eighth grade for a

433
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:40,469
science fair project I built this thing

434
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:43,049
that was essentially a I guess you could

435
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:46,860
call it King's Quest without animation

436
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:49,378
so - maybe a better example would be

437
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,688
like a magnetic scrolls kind of a thing

438
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:54,509
but from the old days where it had like

439
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:56,458
a picture and the picture could change

440
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,470
based on the state of the world so it

441
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,458
wasn't like it was completely static it

442
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,839
could show you different pictures

443
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,088
depending on like what room you would go

444
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,769
to or like if you open the door it would

445
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,019
change the door from a closed version to

446
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:11,939
an open version but there is no real

447
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:13,949
like animation in any real real time

448
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,808
sense like you didn't see characters

449
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,720
walking around and there was really no

450
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:22,019
spa animation so you know pretty pretty

451
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,788
back back pretty far in sort of the tech

452
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,288
center and what you do is you type in a

453
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:28,439
line of text and it would execute it so

454
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:28,769
opened or closed or North those sorts of

455
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,679
things

456
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:33,329
that's yeah you could do any you know

457
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,000
whether or not you want to call it a

458
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:37,168
game engine as opposed to just a game in

459
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,940
an engine that we're sort of together I

460
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:40,320
don't know but it was design started to

461
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,140
be an engine so there were like separate

462
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,839
pieces in a sense and that was the first

463
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:49,009
one that I really did

464
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:52,970
and you know obviously it wasn't good

465
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:57,808
but it was it existed something

466
00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:00,480
definitely so kind of moving a lot

467
00:17:57,808 --> 00:18:03,119
forward in time now to handmade hero

468
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,440
so we're as we're kind of building up

469
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,758
for this project we were checking on a

470
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,038
lot of your videos and you're at like

471
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,649
470 now I'm sorry something like so I'm

472
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,298
going on as long as this how do you do

473
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:17,758
you ever refer to any of your past

474
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:20,308
streams or how do you keep track of

475
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,579
things going on so like with such a long

476
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:25,878
project by yourself so I think there's a

477
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:29,099
couple things to appreciate about

478
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:30,689
handmade hero which is that the

479
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:33,748
development streams are very short

480
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,369
they're an hour to two hours there's

481
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,720
really there's only once or twice we've

482
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:41,009
done like a marathon where I did four

483
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,730
hours you know so 477 or whatever right

484
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:47,099
now let's say let's just say 500 500

485
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:50,190
hours or even a thousand hours of

486
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:53,878
development I is really not very long

487
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,889
for a 42 year-old programmer that's you

488
00:18:53,878 --> 00:19:01,319
know a couple months of development time

489
00:18:55,888 --> 00:19:05,849
if I was working full time and so I

490
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:09,028
think that the it's easy to think well

491
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:10,618
this is so many episodes because if you

492
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:11,849
were just coming at them to watch them

493
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:13,079
you know when you were gonna like I'm

494
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,519
gonna sit down and watch handmade hero

495
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:16,230
the whole thing it's like oh my god

496
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,419
right

497
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,089
but it's really not very much

498
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:22,860
programming like if you think about how

499
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:26,189
much programming each of you has already

500
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:29,008
done in your life it's probably pretty

501
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,600
similar I mean you spend a lot of time

502
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:32,249
programming if you're a programmer and

503
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,019
the amount of time it would take you to

504
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:36,749
get to five hundred or a thousand hours

505
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:38,700
of programming isn't really that much

506
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:40,558
you know and if you haven't already hit

507
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,440
that now you'll probably hit it before

508
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,118
you graduate from whatever program

509
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,409
you're in now but you know even if you

510
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,999
don't do that your first year of

511
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:50,129
full-time work you'll definitely hit it

512
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:52,319
right so I don't know how much program

513
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:55,709
guys have done but you've either already

514
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,689
done it or will soon do it and so it's

515
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,919
easy for people to overestimate the

516
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,749
difficulty of

517
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,460
of keeping track as I get that question

518
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:04,528
a lot and I think it's just because

519
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,358
people don't realize it's bigger

520
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:08,579
it sounds bigger than it is it's

521
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:10,918
actually a very small engine splendor a

522
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:13,230
hundred thousand lines of code every

523
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,090
time I'm programming I'm explaining at

524
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,069
the same time their entire episodes that

525
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,949
are nothing but whiteboard essentially

526
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:21,989
or a blackboard in this case discussions

527
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,340
and Sue the amount that I actually have

528
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:27,509
to keep in my head in handy here is very

529
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:29,878
small but if you watch some serious I'm

530
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:32,460
like I will say on a day I don't really

531
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:35,128
remember how we did X like you can find

532
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,340
episodes where I've said that and what

533
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:41,248
hopefully you can see is what I then do

534
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:49,108
is I just go into a very straightforward

535
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:53,069
process that I always I always just

536
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:55,618
assume that if I wrote code competently

537
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:58,918
in the first place a cursory inspection

538
00:20:55,618 --> 00:21:01,019
of it later should reveal to me how I

539
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,080
decided to do things it won't

540
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,519
necessarily reveal why because I may not

541
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,470
have encode anything I tend to not

542
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,970
comment code until it's done done cuz I

543
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,108
find that the comments end up being out

544
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,389
of date and end up being

545
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:14,398
counterproductive I write it's actually

546
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:16,229
describing the thing that was before the

547
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:20,459
latest one you know and it's actually

548
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:25,769
worse than having a no comment and so I

549
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:28,769
I think that part of developing a good

550
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:30,298
programming style it has a lot less to

551
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:32,339
do with things that people normally

552
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,200
focus on which are like these rules you

553
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:36,509
know did i overload operator equals to

554
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,159
prevent a copy big they focus on all of

555
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,659
these rules that they really have never

556
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,989
even really tested or proven in

557
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,820
production really save you any time and

558
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:47,340
they ignored like the most important

559
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:49,950
things which in my opinion are how easy

560
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:52,168
is it for me to read my own code later

561
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,519
and know exactly what it does right I

562
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:56,899
mean and that's like one of the most

563
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,669
important things you can do and so

564
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:01,858
that's really I think what keeps hand

565
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:04,049
made heroes so flexible and easy for me

566
00:22:01,858 --> 00:22:05,759
to not have to worry when I come back to

567
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:09,329
it on a weekend to start doing a stream

568
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:11,779
is I just know that's part of being a

569
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:14,359
competent programmer is writing

570
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:16,789
in a way that doesn't require me to keep

571
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:18,589
it all in my head I can easily go look

572
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:20,690
at the function names and I just know

573
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:23,569
what they do and this is doubly easy if

574
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,360
I'm the programmer because I know what

575
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:28,039
assumptions I make and if I just always

576
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,019
make those same assumptions then I know

577
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,329
I don't have to investigate those things

578
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,950
further you know I know I'm not gonna

579
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:37,220
call new in the middle of a thing

580
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:39,350
because I never do that right so a lot

581
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,610
of things like that if you develop a

582
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:42,919
programming style that you find is

583
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:45,109
effective simply leaning on that style

584
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,630
in your own code will allow you to keep

585
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:51,009
it flexible keep it easy to remember and

586
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:54,320
recall when you do forget so I think

587
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:56,930
those are the two aspects one of them is

588
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,059
about becoming a good programmer in a

589
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,549
sense which is is is making sure that

590
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:04,220
your style actually pays real benefits

591
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:07,039
and not hypothetical sort of textbook

592
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,140
unproven things but the other one is

593
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,940
just I think people overstate the

594
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,580
difficulty of the handmade hero thing

595
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,890
it's it's not that hard when the code is

596
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:18,799
that small you know try doing that on

597
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,990
the Unreal Engine codebase right I mean

598
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,339
I would not be coming back to it and

599
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,339
going like oh and I'll just do this I'd

600
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:26,659
be like what is going on here like let

601
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:28,369
me step through it in the debugger for

602
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:32,420
six hours before I really know you know

603
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:34,519
so yeah and you said like interesting

604
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,170
there where you're talking about your

605
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:39,259
own personal kind of standards and

606
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,930
conventions so when you're on the team

607
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:43,910
of people who have maybe have different

608
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,920
kind of things that they lean on do

609
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,660
suggest that everyone kind of you kind

610
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,970
of start recognizing people's styles or

611
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,500
do you try to force people and

612
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,769
conforming into one style which might

613
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,630
get them uncomfortable with something

614
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:58,690
yeah like I I know exactly what you're

615
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:03,800
asking and it's an excellent question

616
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:06,440
and I think that honestly I think there

617
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,059
is no good answer to it I'll I'll say a

618
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,660
few things about it but I guess what I

619
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:19,099
would say is that is probably one of the

620
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:21,920
biggest problems in programming today if

621
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:25,309
you imagine that programming in a sense

622
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,669
is a two-part process because I think it

623
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,798
is

624
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:30,288
one is and they're not separate

625
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:33,078
processes but there's two you know sort

626
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:36,709
of things that are going on anytime yeah

627
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:38,749
one is coming up with a language and the

628
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:40,459
other is speaking in that language so we

629
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:42,798
talk about having a programming language

630
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:45,019
but we really don't have the programming

631
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,398
language that we use what we have when

632
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:48,679
we talk about a programming language is

633
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:50,718
a building block for the language that

634
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,219
we will use it's more it should probably

635
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:55,070
be called a programming alphabet if

636
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:58,639
we're honest or a programming phonemes

637
00:24:55,069 --> 00:25:00,168
because usually what happens and in any

638
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:02,569
game engine this definitely happens is

639
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:05,570
that first you take the language that

640
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:08,928
you have like C++ and you build your own

641
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:11,479
language on top of it which is sort of a

642
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:13,309
functional language of core things that

643
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:14,989
everyone will talk about you know how is

644
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:17,450
the memory managed and how do we

645
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:19,548
implement sort of the render pipeline

646
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,558
and what how do we pass things back and

647
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:23,749
forth what is the job control story you

648
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:25,759
know all these arts things yeah those

649
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:27,229
things form a secondary language and

650
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:29,149
this is a it's in some sense a very

651
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:31,009
recursive process you could think of it

652
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:32,718
as making lots of languages on top of

653
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:35,808
each other and some perming languages

654
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:37,548
and some program projects are so poorly

655
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:39,348
thought through that there's like

656
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:42,739
languages on top of languages on top of

657
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:44,509
languages in some sense right and so if

658
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:46,999
you think of each programmer is sort of

659
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:48,858
having their own ideal language that is

660
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:50,778
what they would like to see that

661
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:52,218
substrate that's right on top of the

662
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:55,368
regular language that they all had to

663
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:58,999
conform to yeah they're all fluent in

664
00:25:55,368 --> 00:26:00,558
that presumably their own one so when

665
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:01,969
you bring two programmers together you

666
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,918
essentially have a problem where it's

667
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:05,808
like hey you and I should write this

668
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,570
book but you speak French and I speak

669
00:26:05,808 --> 00:26:11,328
Spanish right and it's like okay well

670
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:14,298
how do we come together to write this

671
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:17,868
book that's you know still in a Latin

672
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:21,499
style typography but it's neither of our

673
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:26,358
languages and we get right and so I

674
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:28,429
think that the jury is still out I might

675
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:30,288
even say that the appellees and the

676
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:33,349
plaintiffs and defendants are still out

677
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:34,908
on what on what the right way to do that

678
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:37,730
is there's certainly procrustean

679
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:40,940
approaches that are like here at

680
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,819
you know company X we demand everyone

681
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:46,070
have this many tabs and their thing and

682
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:47,779
every class looks like this and there's

683
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:49,549
a file for every block there's people

684
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,750
who specify everything right and it's

685
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:52,730
like everyone must have conformed

686
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,170
there's other places that are just like

687
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,880
do whatever you want and if that will

688
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:58,759
figure it out the boundary right will do

689
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,160
something and and everything in between

690
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,230
and I think that we don't know the

691
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,090
answers to what's right about that and I

692
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,730
would be absolutely lying if I said I

693
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:10,309
thought I had a good solution to it what

694
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,650
I can say is that there is no question

695
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:16,490
in my mind that there is a difference in

696
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,759
speed efficacy and quality of code that

697
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:22,490
comes from shifting from your native

698
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,289
language into another one so shifting

699
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:28,880
from your native programming style into

700
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:31,250
somebody else's costs you and you have

701
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,110
to balance that cost against the fact

702
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,000
that when we work together we can get

703
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:37,519
more done if we have more competent

704
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,839
programmers on a project assuming each

705
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,029
of them is capable of writing something

706
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,230
useful for this project we can get more

707
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:44,509
done you know up to a certain point

708
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,569
obviously there's communication costs

709
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:49,309
that might kill you at some point but

710
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:50,779
four or five people on a project should

711
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:53,779
be able to get more done than one person

712
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:56,029
on a project my experience with working

713
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:58,069
on the witness was definitely that I

714
00:27:56,029 --> 00:28:00,049
took a pretty massive productivity hit

715
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:02,059
working in that codebase compared to my

716
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:04,849
own and and there's nothing you can do

717
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:06,679
about that i I do build some of my own

718
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:10,009
language in there like I put some of my

719
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,840
own tools in there as overtime so that I

720
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:14,150
can be effective but it's on an

721
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:17,839
on-demand basis and there's an entire

722
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:21,080
article I wrote about a time when I had

723
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:23,029
a bug that I had only because I made a

724
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:26,389
wrong assumption about the math library

725
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:29,389
right and that's a perfect is like the

726
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:32,030
reason that me and John blow are both

727
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:34,280
able to write certain part types of code

728
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:36,680
quickly is because we both make

729
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,690
assumptions about what our math library

730
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,370
does and if you couldn't make those

731
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,960
songs we I had to literally read the

732
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:44,269
code for cross-product or something

733
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,190
every time to figure out whether it was

734
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:48,500
right-handed or left-handed I would be

735
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,360
much lower at having way more bugs right

736
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,028
blah blah blah and so

737
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:56,099
it's really hard to overstate just how

738
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:57,778
important that is and I think a lot of

739
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:00,388
people don't necessarily realize it

740
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:03,058
because if you've never programmed by

741
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:04,798
yourself on your own engine at a time

742
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:05,970
when you were a fairly mature programmer

743
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,558
if the only time you ever did that was

744
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,720
like in your basement or whatever right

745
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,009
and you've never done that after you've

746
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,690
had a lot of experience and are more

747
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:13,919
self-confident and have more of an

748
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,528
opinion about what should be going on

749
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,259
you may not realize how fast you

750
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:21,298
actually are when everything is done the

751
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,450
way you expect because you've only ever

752
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:25,528
done it at valve or something where

753
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,028
everything works maybe a little bit

754
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:29,638
differently than how you would want to

755
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:31,319
write or something yeah and so it's it

756
00:29:29,638 --> 00:29:33,569
is a very important thing to be aware of

757
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:37,378
I don't have an answer but it's

758
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:40,618
important to understand all right yeah

759
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:42,628
thank you so then I've kind of going off

760
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:44,939
of that you mentioned a little bit about

761
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:47,038
are you working on the witness and kind

762
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,038
of adding your own layer into there has

763
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,989
there been like a hat per se that you've

764
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,169
done recently or seen recently that you

765
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:58,858
thought was a either really unique or

766
00:29:54,169 --> 00:30:00,090
kind of interesting to to do or like way

767
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:03,418
around the code base or something like

768
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:06,959
that how can you be more specific what

769
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:09,269
does that mean a hack so kind of going

770
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,389
off of like not necessarily following

771
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:14,069
the rules that are kind of laid out by

772
00:30:11,388 --> 00:30:16,829
like the other person programming it or

773
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:18,839
so typically probably not like handmade

774
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:25,949
hero but maybe like when you're working

775
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:28,798
with someone else's code so I may not be

776
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:31,169
understanding the question correctly but

777
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,138
if I'll restate it to see if I am so

778
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:36,629
what you're saying is that if you are

779
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:40,048
programming in a code base that was not

780
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:41,788
that you did not yourself design yeah is

781
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:43,349
there anything that I can think of

782
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:45,538
that's a particularly interesting thing

783
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:48,089
that's done in that code base that goes

784
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:51,269
against the grain of the code base but

785
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:53,849
that was interesting is that yeah yes

786
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:58,679
that's what I mean so I guess what I

787
00:30:53,849 --> 00:31:03,418
would say is that I would really I would

788
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,920
probably never consider that to be a

789
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:09,600
particularly grad of

790
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:12,390
flying experience so know that to me is

791
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:15,029
just always a sign that there is a

792
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:20,790
problem with whatever the code base is

793
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:23,730
because generally speaking if I have to

794
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:26,369
do something that I feel is antithetical

795
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,769
to how the code base is architected or

796
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:31,319
works in order to get something to work

797
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:33,000
properly then fundamentally speaking

798
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,919
that's really just more of a statement

799
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,170
about the poor quality of the underlying

800
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:43,250
thing and not a statement about

801
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:43,250
something good about what I did so if I

802
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:48,750
you know to put it in other terms I

803
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:50,819
might say so you know have I ever felt

804
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,200
particularly psyched about something I

805
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:54,899
accomplished when programming on

806
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,549
Microsoft Windows and the answer is no

807
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,440
I've just been aggravated the entire

808
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:59,789
time that it was so annoying that I had

809
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,039
to go to these Herculean lengths and

810
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:04,200
maybe you know I could look back on it

811
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,470
and and warp it into a sense of pride

812
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,210
that I was good enough to make this

813
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:13,500
thing that worked around a really bad

814
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:16,440
system but I guess at this point anyway

815
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,869
in my life I don't have a pride about

816
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,360
that I just feel bad I just feel like

817
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:23,069
this is it was a waste of my time and

818
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,289
it's gonna be a waste of everyone else's

819
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:27,779
time and it's just a shame that stuff

820
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:31,259
like that's still around and never seems

821
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:35,879
to get fixed I'm sorry to answer that

822
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:37,109
question with a downer but yeah going

823
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,270
off of the kind of your answer of that

824
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:40,500
when you notice something that you're

825
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:43,500
like you feel like you're doing

826
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,460
something like that is there you do tip

827
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,140
and like you're working with other

828
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,019
people is it typically kind of go to

829
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,400
address address the person or do you

830
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,470
kind of try to dig down into what

831
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,660
they've done to figure out why it's like

832
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:58,289
this just kind of curious about your

833
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,910
thought on that yeah okay so that I that

834
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:03,329
I definitely I think I understand that

835
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:08,490
that question um so I guess what I would

836
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:10,470
say is I would not take my advice or

837
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,900
perspective on anything that has to do

838
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:18,750
with that so I don't like working with

839
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:20,430
people on code I like working with

840
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,670
people on other things I love working

841
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,950
with artists and so on I don't like

842
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,200
working with other people on code

843
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:30,420
because I don't care to do exactly what

844
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,390
you're saying I just want things to be

845
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:36,420
done well and if they are done well I

846
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:39,300
don't mind using whatever paradigm the

847
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,769
person who did them well has if they are

848
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,419
not done well that I'm just aggravated

849
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,980
and I don't really want to go have a

850
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,440
conversation with that person about it

851
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,299
that's not to say that I I'm not trying

852
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,700
to belittle that I think working on

853
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:52,139
teams and learning team communication

854
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,059
and how to work effectively on a team is

855
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,270
something that's a great thing for

856
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:59,669
people who want to work on teams but the

857
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,349
reality of programming is that you know

858
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,120
everyone has their own preference and

859
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:04,469
one of the reasons I like programming is

860
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,909
that there's a lot of things I can do

861
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,490
and I can earn a living

862
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,840
not having to communicate with people

863
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:12,689
about what I'm doing I can just do it

864
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,789
the way I want and get it right so I

865
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,619
would say most of the time my preference

866
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:18,329
for working on things is I work on my

867
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,849
thing you work on your thing we

868
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:23,340
communicate about those things but not

869
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:26,069
about the code and I don't care how you

870
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,350
did it and I don't want to butt in on

871
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,879
how you were doing it and to the extent

872
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:31,589
that I can

873
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:32,969
I just want those things walled off so

874
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:34,260
that your code doesn't affect mine and

875
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:38,329
mine doesn't affect yours so we really

876
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:42,810
just don't have to worry about it that

877
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:44,190
said I appreciate how it is not always

878
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:46,199
possible to put yourself in that

879
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,789
position especially if you're working a

880
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:51,000
larger company or on a very large

881
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:54,559
project and that is just why I don't

882
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,719
work on those things okay and so kind of

883
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:01,409
continuing off that so having like a

884
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,779
fans and like backers to hand-made arrow

885
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:05,159
have you felt like that's and the people

886
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,990
watching you as well do you feel like

887
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,969
that ever influences the way you do

888
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:10,829
things or kind of changes your thought

889
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:12,409
process about any of the things that

890
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:14,849
you're doing on the engine or is it more

891
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:17,909
they're just kind of there along with

892
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:21,089
the journey with you um it's the latter

893
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:23,069
in terms emotionally I guess I would say

894
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,320
meaning that I don't think of people who

895
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:27,120
buy handmade here as backers it's just a

896
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,370
pre-order for a game you get the source

897
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,469
code if you want it it's not a

898
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,099
Kickstarter I don't require a certain

899
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:34,079
amount of money to

900
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,299
do it I'm doing it whether no one ever

901
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,309
bought it or not so I don't really think

902
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,980
of them as backers if they were backers

903
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:42,989
in the traditional sense of the term

904
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,500
meaning I had promised some specific set

905
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:49,049
of deliberate deliverables or something

906
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,170
that they were funding to make happen

907
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,730
I might consider things in that way but

908
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,019
since it's not that I really don't think

909
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,650
it's that way I made here it's think I

910
00:35:55,019 --> 00:36:00,329
wanted to do I wanted to have video of a

911
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,940
programmer making an entire game from

912
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:05,429
scratch so we could go back and look and

913
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,470
see like what where do things get done

914
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,639
how do they happen right and all that

915
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,929
sort of thing and you could jump around

916
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:14,339
it and all that source I just wanted to

917
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:16,259
have that yeah that said it is

918
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,200
unquestionably true that having people

919
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,020
watch on the stream affects the series

920
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,239
and the reason for that is twofold one

921
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:26,610
is that there are a surprising number of

922
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:30,269
experts who show up to the stream from

923
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:32,940
time time and from time to time yeah and

924
00:36:30,269 --> 00:36:35,670
those experts know things I don't know

925
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,349
so for example you know someone might be

926
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:42,389
more of a platformer expert on a

927
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:45,059
particular aspect of OpenGL or something

928
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:47,489
than I am and they'll tell me on the

929
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:49,679
stream so I'm there's something that I

930
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:52,679
might have programmed worse and they'll

931
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,509
pop up and say oh you know you can do

932
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,579
this or that's not support on this card

933
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,830
but if you do this it is right those are

934
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:01,230
things that are just better now like the

935
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:03,630
it's like having a second it's like

936
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,920
having a free code review that I don't

937
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,630
have to really spend any time on right

938
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,789
it's just happening I don't even have to

939
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:12,119
wait it's just happening over the

940
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:13,710
internet with thousands of eyes waiting

941
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,670
to point out something that I could have

942
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,699
done better

943
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:19,530
and that's kind of a cool free resource

944
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,659
it definitely means that there's

945
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,250
sections of the Hammad hero code that

946
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:24,899
did things right that would have done

947
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,730
them wrong or you know if right and

948
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,349
wrongs may the wrong term but did things

949
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,900
better than the way I would have written

950
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:34,319
them or did write them and then

951
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,550
corrected yeah similarly like there's

952
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,200
been times when people have pointed out

953
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:42,630
resources I was unaware of I the last

954
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,269
time I had really done any x64

955
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,380
assembly language work well mattress

956
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:49,289
emulation

957
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,910
intrinsics work I didn't know about

958
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:56,309
Ayaka the the the Intel code analyzer

959
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:58,769
mm-hmm cuz didn't exist and so when I

960
00:37:56,309 --> 00:38:00,869
saw stream I was like I really wish that

961
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:03,420
I didn't have to count all the

962
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:05,400
instructions and that there is a way to

963
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,230
just you know compiler should just tell

964
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,550
me what they are and you know I think it

965
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:10,980
was Fabien who was just like there is

966
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:13,200
like go you can go download Ayaka and

967
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,599
use it and I was like oh my god and like

968
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,659
that tool is awesome like it's exactly

969
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,279
the tool I wanted and who knows how long

970
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:23,609
it would have taken me to find out that

971
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,170
that tool existed if he hadn't randomly

972
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:29,059
been watching the stream and told me you

973
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:32,760
know I mean yeah so it's definitely paid

974
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:34,889
dividends having a stream that I have

975
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,510
nothing to do with the original stated

976
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:39,059
purpose of the stream just having

977
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:44,520
experts in various domains especially

978
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,969
ones that I am NOT an expert in has been

979
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:47,610
helpful

980
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:50,879
even in my knowing Bayaka helps me in my

981
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:54,030
own programming dirt day job right like

982
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,269
so that's been great yeah been really

983
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:59,550
good I'm kind of going on the other side

984
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:01,050
of you of like the the people following

985
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,880
along kind of in the same boat

986
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:05,480
exhaustive like learning how to do

987
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,130
things with regard to handmade hero

988
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,900
do you think people can use handmade

989
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:13,349
hero is like a sole source of learning

990
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,389
kind of watching from the first to well

991
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:17,250
following you kind of through it or do

992
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:19,259
you think it's a really good use of like

993
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,579
watching this and doing some other

994
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,790
things and kind of doing your own thing

995
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:27,029
all at the same time because like you

996
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:28,550
said you have the zip files available at

997
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:34,080
the end of the days and stuff like that

998
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:35,970
that's a really tough question so I will

999
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,108
start by saying that the goal of

1000
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:42,779
handmade hero was to do it the way that

1001
00:39:40,108 --> 00:39:47,009
I'm doing it because I wanted to have

1002
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,990
that complete record and it was designed

1003
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,210
to be there because I thought there were

1004
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:53,118
things people would learn by watching an

1005
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,740
engine programmer just do what they do

1006
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,600
rather than them telling them the result

1007
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,368
they ended up with mm-hmm

1008
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,288
and I think it's been really good at

1009
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,990
that because I've had many people

1010
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:05,099
actually tell me that that was a big

1011
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:09,118
breakthrough for them they were like

1012
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:10,789
just seeing what you actually do totally

1013
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,490
makes me feel more comfortable about

1014
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:17,940
doing how to go about this right yeah

1015
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:19,409
and so that I think was the only thing I

1016
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,650
was trying to really do with handmade

1017
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:24,358
hero so that's the thing that I think is

1018
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,910
important to take away from the series

1019
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:29,308
and what I hope people get out of it

1020
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:31,318
everything else I have no idea because

1021
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:33,329
the goal wasn't to teach people 3d math

1022
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:35,369
I just do that as of course too serious

1023
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:37,829
as I wanted it to be I wanted people to

1024
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,539
see explanation of those things yeah I

1025
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:42,298
don't know if it's a good way to learn

1026
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:45,150
it um I don't know what other things

1027
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:47,940
would be valuable so I think I'm not

1028
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:51,329
really sure probably the answer is I

1029
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:54,150
mean one answer is if I was gonna make a

1030
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:56,009
course for people to learn 3d math for

1031
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,440
engines let's say it would look like

1032
00:40:56,009 --> 00:41:00,509
handmade here oh yeah right so that's

1033
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,130
definitely true whether that means

1034
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:03,449
there's other resources available right

1035
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,160
now that are better than Hanneman here

1036
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:06,748
oh I don't know but I know that handmade

1037
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:08,548
hero isn't the best we can do I could

1038
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:10,649
say that for sure because if I made one

1039
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:12,599
I wouldn't make it like this and I'm the

1040
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,700
one making handmade here I'm already

1041
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:19,680
saying it's not the best for that right

1042
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:20,909
yeah um so I I guess that's really all I

1043
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,190
can say about that part of it the other

1044
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:24,538
part that I would say is just to focus

1045
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,338
on the part you said about using as a

1046
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:29,970
sole resource I don't think you ever

1047
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:32,548
want to use any one programmers ideas or

1048
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:38,248
code as your sole resource and the

1049
00:41:32,548 --> 00:41:40,380
reason for that is because it's assuming

1050
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:43,858
everyone's brain works a little

1051
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,059
differently and that the most efficient

1052
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:46,798
way to think through a problem is not

1053
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:49,200
the same for everybody

1054
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:51,900
yeah then unless your brain literally

1055
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:53,338
works exactly the same way that mine

1056
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,539
does and there may be some people out

1057
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,298
there who it does right but it's only

1058
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:59,579
gonna be some people then the chances

1059
00:41:57,298 --> 00:42:00,869
that all the things you might want to

1060
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,509
know about programming are encompassed

1061
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:06,269
in what I have to say is zero there's

1062
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:08,849
going to be very valuable approaches and

1063
00:42:06,268 --> 00:42:10,649
things that I not only might not be

1064
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:12,260
aware of but even if I am aware of them

1065
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,720
might just not like and not think are

1066
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,330
good that you will think are good and

1067
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,489
that are effective for you so I think

1068
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:23,779
it's important to be exposed to multiple

1069
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:28,579
different programming styles so that you

1070
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,410
and and even more so than that I think

1071
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,960
it's important for our programmers brain

1072
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:36,440
to be able to distinguish between those

1073
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,210
styles in a concrete way because that's

1074
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,059
the way you can find the primary styles

1075
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:44,389
that work for you and I think like when

1076
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:47,509
I found myself I probably say when I was

1077
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:53,449
like 23 24 maybe I don't know how old I

1078
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:56,810
was at I'm about the same time as I

1079
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:58,969
found myself actually thinking how do I

1080
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:02,750
figure out what elements of programming

1081
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:05,149
style are good and bad for mice like I

1082
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,710
am NOT taking anyone's opinion you know

1083
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,720
I don't care what people write in these

1084
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,740
books I've realized that they don't

1085
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,279
really know what they're talking about

1086
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:14,659
all the time I want to come up with mech

1087
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,240
I want to come up with ways I can

1088
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:20,539
evaluate this stuff for real and I want

1089
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:22,039
to see how it works when I do it about

1090
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:24,380
that time was when I felt like I became

1091
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:25,789
a much better programmer like it was a

1092
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,800
you know you always feel like you're

1093
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:30,769
getting better but that was a really big

1094
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,450
divide and I think that it's important

1095
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:34,670
for programmers to try to cross that

1096
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:36,529
divide for themselves and it they're not

1097
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,119
gonna cross it by watching a series like

1098
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,519
mine and assuming that everything I do

1099
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,039
is right because even if everything I

1100
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:44,809
did was right for them they still

1101
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,179
haven't developed the critical faculties

1102
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:49,730
necessary to know why and that's a

1103
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:51,230
problem so not only is that a problem

1104
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,360
but I also suspect that for most

1105
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:55,280
programmers not everything I do in the

1106
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,050
way I do it will be the way that they

1107
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,870
should do it because they will find

1108
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:05,180
different techniques are better for them

1109
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:10,699
okay all right so we're gonna kind of

1110
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:13,489
now move on so we have a few questions

1111
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:14,929
that we so part of our project is also

1112
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:17,629
as we said to talk to professionals

1113
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:20,029
we're gonna edit and then transcribe

1114
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,400
these so that way other people can kind

1115
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,810
of learn from them because we found we

1116
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,250
think that blogs are a really good way

1117
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:25,759
to kind of learn process that's how

1118
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,650
we're doing

1119
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,700
of our learning and so as I was saying

1120
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:34,490
we're trying to help

1121
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:36,409
novice novice engine programmers and so

1122
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:38,719
when you first started programming like

1123
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:40,819
larger scale game engines what was like

1124
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:42,409
the most confusing part or maybe even

1125
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:44,059
not even large-scale but when you first

1126
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:46,159
start programming game engines well

1127
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:49,840
we've kind of the largest confusion that

1128
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,839
you might have had approaching those ah

1129
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:02,599
so this is a very intricate question and

1130
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,730
I'm not sure how I'm gonna answer it in

1131
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,079
a way that can be concisely transcribed

1132
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:10,400
and useful okay

1133
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,719
let me say a few things about the

1134
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,730
question and then maybe you could ask a

1135
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,009
follow-up question that will get at the

1136
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:22,309
heart of what you want to know and again

1137
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:29,780
I transcribe that all right perfect

1138
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:32,869
okay so there are two fundamental there

1139
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,910
are two fundamental problems that I

1140
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:37,670
think are involved in game engine

1141
00:45:34,909 --> 00:45:41,210
development that set it apart from a lot

1142
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:46,309
of other types of development the first

1143
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:52,039
one is that it is it is not a stable

1144
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:54,769
problem in any way 99% of everything

1145
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:57,500
that programming does in the past or

1146
00:45:54,769 --> 00:46:00,170
today looks a lot like standard in

1147
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,900
standard out right you can phrase it as

1148
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,829
here are set of inputs and here are the

1149
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,300
set of outputs that come out of it so

1150
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,829
most of the things that programmers are

1151
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,109
used to thinking about in the way that

1152
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:14,690
they're used to thinking about them is

1153
00:46:11,108 --> 00:46:17,840
I'm working on deep learning here's a

1154
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:21,200
set of input images and a set of output

1155
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:23,210
tuned neural net parameters how do I

1156
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,659
make the best translation between these

1157
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:29,210
two things right I'm a natural language

1158
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:31,849
processing person here's all the corpus

1159
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:34,190
I want in and here are the like noun

1160
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:37,819
tags I want out or the sentence tags I

1161
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,260
want right and so I think one of the

1162
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,440
core one of the

1163
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,660
biggest challenges for an early game

1164
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:48,740
engine programmer is making the leap

1165
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:52,789
from input-output thinking to this

1166
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:55,969
amorphous systemic tons of things in

1167
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:59,389
crazy states come together in this weird

1168
00:46:55,969 --> 00:47:02,239
way to produce an alternate reality that

1169
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:04,670
you can experience right and it's very

1170
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,349
confusing how that happens at first

1171
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:08,420
because even though you're not

1172
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:11,000
necessarily aware of it everything

1173
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,460
you've ever done prior to that looks a

1174
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,050
lot more like this input-output phrasing

1175
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:23,420
right yeah um so one of the really good

1176
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:27,740
things that you can do at first right is

1177
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:34,400
to try to figure out the the sort of

1178
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:37,250
what I want to call the the core loop

1179
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,280
the the golden loop the the the golden

1180
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:42,409
differentiator of a simulation which is

1181
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,710
like a flight simulator a game the

1182
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:49,339
things that have this right is they look

1183
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:52,550
like this real time loop of I have a set

1184
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:55,070
of entities States right I go through a

1185
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,890
simulation to change the states of these

1186
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:59,600
things that's a certain process I then

1187
00:47:57,889 --> 00:48:01,879
go through a way of presenting those

1188
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,719
things and then I return to the

1189
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:08,869
beginning right yeah just getting

1190
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:10,849
yourself comfortable with that and that

1191
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:14,869
everything that you build has to build

1192
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:17,750
out of that is just the first big step

1193
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:19,369
it's not input-output anymore it doesn't

1194
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,300
look like a web program it doesn't look

1195
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:22,009
at the neural network

1196
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,570
it doesn't look like a parser doesn't

1197
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,980
look like a server does look at any of

1198
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:28,940
these things it looks like that

1199
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:31,309
hopefully a lot of people are able to

1200
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,200
make that leap without too much trouble

1201
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:35,539
but it's just worth noting that's the

1202
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,789
first big thing you've got a kit so you

1203
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:39,320
figure out how to do that make a very

1204
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,960
simple thing that has those properties

1205
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,730
and get it working understand that

1206
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,490
everything from now on will have that

1207
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:51,740
structure not the other one right yeah

1208
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:52,849
okay the other thing is the complexity

1209
00:48:51,739 --> 00:48:55,489
explosion right

1210
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:57,019
so again because it's not input to

1211
00:48:55,489 --> 00:49:00,379
output where you have this very clean

1212
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:02,090
sort of thing you have all of these

1213
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,340
systems that are all happening the same

1214
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:06,019
time they all interact they all overlay

1215
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,519
on top of each other the physics and the

1216
00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:09,860
rendering and the blob is that the other

1217
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:13,849
thing game design entities scripting all

1218
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:18,559
this stuff comes together you really

1219
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:21,289
need to be able to do discoverable

1220
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,199
architecture in order to do these things

1221
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:26,809
correctly and most people are just not

1222
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:28,309
familiar with that process and what I

1223
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:30,170
mean by that is I called it compression

1224
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:33,710
oriented programming in the past what I

1225
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:37,159
mean is the technique of writing

1226
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:39,199
something in the simplest way possible I

1227
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:41,059
think this is Jonathan blows term that

1228
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,859
he uses often he says like write

1229
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:44,659
something the simplest way possible just

1230
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,980
whatever is obvious to you don't even

1231
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:48,440
think about the rest of the game engine

1232
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,820
I just need to do this one thing think

1233
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,769
about it more like the standard and

1234
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,480
standard out that we're all used to how

1235
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:55,610
do I just freeze it to just get the

1236
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,780
input and the output to do the thing I

1237
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,240
need to do just in isolation anything

1238
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,300
else no code design no cleanliness no

1239
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:05,929
nothing just no abstract thoughts just

1240
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,789
concrete you need to be able to do that

1241
00:50:05,929 --> 00:50:12,889
clear everything from your head and just

1242
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:14,779
do that and then pull that out into the

1243
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:18,559
architecture and one of the biggest

1244
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:20,690
mistakes that I think even experienced

1245
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,090
game programmers will often make is they

1246
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,860
go the other direction they try to start

1247
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:27,110
with the architecture and drill down to

1248
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:31,670
the thing they want to do and I have

1249
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:34,070
never ever in my entire life seen a good

1250
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,420
result from that it almost always has to

1251
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:38,660
be refactored

1252
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:40,309
at the end because when you start from a

1253
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:43,000
conception of how something will plug

1254
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:45,289
together you don't see all the details

1255
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,639
you don't know all the things that

1256
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:48,529
you're really gonna have to do when you

1257
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,809
go to solve the problem so you always

1258
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,210
forget some whereas if you just

1259
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:55,759
implement the real thing first and then

1260
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:59,119
pull it up into the architecture fit it

1261
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:03,530
in you almost always end up with better

1262
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,639
results so I like to think about those

1263
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,470
problems and this gets away from

1264
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,299
question a little bit so I apologize but

1265
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:09,709
I like to think about dough so much

1266
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:14,390
there's thing called boundary value

1267
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:15,619
problems in mathematics right yeah and

1268
00:51:14,389 --> 00:51:16,940
there's different ways of solving them

1269
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,320
there's like shooting methods I start

1270
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,789
here I see where I end up they're

1271
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:23,869
solving backwards where I try to see

1272
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:27,409
what I could different um building up a

1273
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:29,090
skillset of how you work on code that

1274
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:31,368
allows you to work from either side of

1275
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,950
the problem ends up being really

1276
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:35,358
valuable in this case because like I

1277
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:36,889
said you usually want to start with the

1278
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,699
solution loft it up into the

1279
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:42,949
architecture but in addition to part of

1280
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:45,710
that prop process when you get to a

1281
00:51:42,949 --> 00:51:48,019
certain level of that lofting you want

1282
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:51,170
to think from the other side down as

1283
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:53,150
well you want to go what should a good

1284
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:55,309
API for this look like what are some

1285
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,170
things I maybe didn't think about when I

1286
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:59,509
was implementing it that I should maybe

1287
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:02,030
change that wouldn't break the algorithm

1288
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:03,830
but that would let it work better with

1289
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:05,750
this integration so it's kind of like

1290
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:08,389
this you you almost want a ping-pong

1291
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:11,030
game process where you start at the

1292
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:13,279
solution work backwards a little go to

1293
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:16,369
the architecture side work forwards a

1294
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,930
little come back and it's that the best

1295
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,140
programmers at doing this sort of thing

1296
00:52:17,929 --> 00:52:23,809
are able to come at it and make it fit

1297
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:35,480
really nicely at the end so both sides

1298
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:37,190
can be happy yeah I'd like to give a

1299
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,980
shout out to Allen Webster for that by

1300
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:42,950
the way he's he works at rad game tools

1301
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:45,230
now but I've talked about those two

1302
00:52:42,949 --> 00:52:46,759
things separately and I never really

1303
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:48,440
talked about them together for some

1304
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,510
reason and he actually asked me a

1305
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,400
question he's like I've heard you say

1306
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,560
two totally separate things I've heard

1307
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,838
you say start from the solution and work

1308
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,820
backwards to integrate and I've heard

1309
00:52:56,838 --> 00:53:01,369
you say always write the usage code

1310
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:04,160
first well which one is it and I'm like

1311
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:07,608
you're totally right like it's like it's

1312
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:10,098
that you do the first thing I said until

1313
00:53:07,608 --> 00:53:12,469
you have the thing correct and working

1314
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:15,260
and integrated then you work forwards

1315
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:17,389
and go how should I talk to this thing

1316
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:19,200
what are the changes I need to make and

1317
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:21,900
why never connected those

1318
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,239
my brain no but I give him full credit

1319
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,500
for that realization that you should

1320
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,179
always talk about them together just

1321
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:30,389
talking about them separately doesn't

1322
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:32,190
help anybody yeah I can see talking

1323
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:34,078
about him separately cause like a little

1324
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,460
confusion after hearing the second even

1325
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,230
in my own brain it's it's it's clear

1326
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,970
that I was doing something intuitively

1327
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:41,429
that I'd never internalized and probably

1328
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:43,949
was therefore forgetting to do sometimes

1329
00:53:41,429 --> 00:53:45,389
when I should have done it so I'm I'm

1330
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:49,559
very thankful to him for having like

1331
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:50,549
identified that rather important gap all

1332
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,799
right

1333
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:55,200
so we've been reading through some of

1334
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,630
the handmade hero forums and we came

1335
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,989
across one where you were kind of like

1336
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:03,720
restating the the goal are talking about

1337
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:05,219
who this handmade hero was actually for

1338
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:07,409
and I think one of the lines you're

1339
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:10,409
saying is that it's not about making a

1340
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:12,539
game but it's about like I think you

1341
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:15,509
said inspiring engine programmers or

1342
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:17,460
something along those lines yes and you

1343
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,619
said there there's a shortage of people

1344
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,869
who are trying to be engine programs yes

1345
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:24,420
why do you think that there's a shortage

1346
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:25,769
of engine like people trying to get into

1347
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:32,460
the engine programming space versus

1348
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:34,829
versus like the other in spaces so you

1349
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,960
know I I don't really want to do too

1350
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:38,490
much data free analysis on this I guess

1351
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,030
is what I would say because it's

1352
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:43,379
attempting to provide answers well if

1353
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,599
you ever read the newspaper you will

1354
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,430
know that's very common for people to

1355
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,809
like to provide answers to things that

1356
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:50,129
they obviously just don't know what

1357
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:53,489
they're talking about right and have no

1358
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:56,818
data to support them so this is a

1359
00:54:53,489 --> 00:54:58,409
question that sort of demands if it

1360
00:54:56,818 --> 00:55:00,269
wants to be answered correctly demands a

1361
00:54:58,409 --> 00:55:02,909
data answer which is are there really a

1362
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:05,190
shortage of engine programmers and if

1363
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:07,108
there are why right what's the reason

1364
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,639
for it I don't pretend to know the

1365
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:12,960
answer to either of those questions what

1366
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:15,328
I can tell you is that if today you told

1367
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,250
me I needed to staff up a 10-person

1368
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:20,310
Engine team which is a modest engine

1369
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:22,949
team I would have almost no idea where

1370
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:25,588
to get eight of those people right and

1371
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:27,750
the two that I maybe do know where to

1372
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:29,818
get I'd have to hire from some other

1373
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,550
team right and now that team has to hire

1374
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:34,150
two engine /

1375
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:36,400
that's right yeah uh and so I'm strictly

1376
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:38,889
talking about this from a personal

1377
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,950
experience in the game industry it is an

1378
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:44,739
anecdote not a statistic where I say

1379
00:55:41,949 --> 00:55:48,569
that I just don't find that people know

1380
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:51,399
where to hire engine programmers and I

1381
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:53,140
mean I know so many people who I know

1382
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,059
plenty of people who have hired people

1383
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:57,069
who they really don't think are even

1384
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:58,389
that good at engine programming but who

1385
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:00,430
were definitely the best they could get

1386
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:01,989
I mean they could not have gotten better

1387
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:02,589
intrapreneurs but they wished they could

1388
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:04,869
have right

1389
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:07,030
and similarly I know plenty of people

1390
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:08,440
who would hire another engine programmer

1391
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,880
right now if they could find one but

1392
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,210
there's no one who meets their cutoff

1393
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:15,250
right and so some of that is just like

1394
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:17,440
well you know if especially on smaller

1395
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:19,389
teams you can't afford to hire lots of

1396
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,579
junior people maybe so maybe there's

1397
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:23,829
some raw talent out there it just needs

1398
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:25,750
to be developed you know and I can data

1399
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:28,059
wise I don't I don't want to make claims

1400
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:31,719
about this that I can't substantiate

1401
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:34,110
because I don't have the data but in

1402
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:38,289
terms of real experts on this it's just

1403
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:39,340
very hard to find and I can't offer you

1404
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:41,829
a reason for that

1405
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:44,530
but I just assume that the reason is

1406
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:46,989
that I even in today's day and age were

1407
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:49,450
a lot of people license engines the

1408
00:56:46,989 --> 00:56:52,269
bottom line is even something as simple

1409
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:54,460
as using unity kind of requires you to

1410
00:56:52,269 --> 00:56:56,739
understand 3d math at a pretty decent

1411
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,119
level if you're not gonna ship one of

1412
00:56:56,739 --> 00:57:02,019
these games with all these like obvious

1413
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:04,239
bugs in it right and so it's just it's a

1414
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:06,159
hard profession it demands that you know

1415
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,229
a lot of things it's not for the faint

1416
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:11,409
of heart it requires a lot of expertise

1417
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:14,079
a lot of time spent learning even to

1418
00:57:11,409 --> 00:57:16,839
just be a competent engine side

1419
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,099
programmer like I'm gonna modify Unreal

1420
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,510
Engine in a small way I'm going to

1421
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,949
modify a real in small way I'm gonna

1422
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,290
make a plugin that does something I need

1423
00:57:20,949 --> 00:57:25,659
to do or even I'm just gonna competently

1424
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:28,119
program a motion controller in unreal or

1425
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:30,279
something yeah these are just skills

1426
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:34,509
that people just don't seem to have in

1427
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,370
abundance and so you know even today

1428
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,990
when it's like well you can just go get

1429
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,849
an engine so you don't need to build it

1430
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:42,439
from scratch

1431
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:45,079
we still haven't it's just

1432
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,300
we have not gotten to the put to the

1433
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:50,119
point where we've we have enough talent

1434
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,490
verses and at a strong word expertise

1435
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:54,409
really we don't have enough expertise

1436
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:59,419
versus how much we could be using to

1437
00:57:54,409 --> 00:58:04,129
make games better yeah no sorry I wasn't

1438
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:05,690
trying to make you pull any any yes it's

1439
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:12,079
it's that's just a personal experience

1440
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:13,579
and you know it's I I suspect if you

1441
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,840
talked to other people in the game

1442
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:16,340
industry they would have similar

1443
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,430
opinions about how hard it is to find

1444
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:20,600
good engine programmers and I and you

1445
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:23,480
know I don't want to put words in their

1446
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:26,239
mouth so you should ask them but I just

1447
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:30,860
it's not the kind of thing that you can

1448
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:33,349
just go find someone to do and I think

1449
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:36,530
we're getting better at pipelines for

1450
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:38,299
finding artists it is much easier to

1451
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,710
find a highly qualified artist today

1452
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,650
than it was 10 years ago

1453
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:45,199
thanks to social media thanks to online

1454
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:47,539
tutorials education about what goes into

1455
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,399
making a game asset probably thanks to

1456
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:52,309
even school curricula that was not

1457
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,710
around in those days what I have not

1458
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:58,070
seen change is the number of of engine

1459
00:58:54,710 --> 00:59:00,829
programmers the last three engine

1460
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:03,559
programmer hires I know about or was in

1461
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:05,000
any way involved with all came from

1462
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:07,849
handmade hero if it wasn't for handmade

1463
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,869
hero never would have found him and who

1464
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:09,980
knows if they even would have done it

1465
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:13,460
maybe they would have something else I

1466
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:15,500
don't even know so you know that was

1467
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,570
really again the reason for handmade

1468
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,989
here was exactly what I just said it's

1469
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:23,360
in that that intro sort of fluffy video

1470
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:24,889
I did there it's right it's like it says

1471
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,690
I believe this way of life is worth

1472
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:29,629
preserving it's talking specifically

1473
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:32,030
about a practice and a discipline and a

1474
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:34,340
mental model it's not I want to show you

1475
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:36,769
how I make a game never said that right

1476
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:40,420
I said I this way of life specifically

1477
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:42,650
this and I meant that like I don't mean

1478
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,720
what's the easiest way to make a game

1479
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:47,119
what's the most cost-effective way I

1480
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,889
don't care at all about that and I feel

1481
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,710
like that's something that's covered

1482
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:53,969
well enough elsewhere right yeah yeah

1483
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:56,970
all right

1484
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:58,980
so then talking a little bit so you're

1485
00:59:56,969 --> 01:00:00,719
you're making handmade here and you've

1486
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,329
obviously made engines before handmade

1487
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:05,429
here it is there certain aspects when

1488
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:06,810
you I was listening to on your videos

1489
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:08,489
and you're saying you've made at the

1490
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:11,400
platform layer like 15 times and you

1491
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:13,679
kind of know how you like it but is

1492
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,300
there certain things like that that you

1493
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,009
kind of always just pull in from each

1494
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,900
project or do you ever try to like say

1495
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,760
oh I've done this ten times before I'm

1496
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,889
going to try it this new way to keep

1497
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,240
exploring or they're just tried and true

1498
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:30,389
systems that you kind of follow along

1499
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:33,959
with uh so I guess I can't really answer

1500
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:36,568
the question because I am only 42 years

1501
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:39,780
old and not wise enough to know yet

1502
01:00:36,568 --> 01:00:41,699
look maybe when I'm 80 I'll be able to

1503
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:46,380
tell you if I had a piece of code that

1504
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:50,338
was worth reusing here's a couple of

1505
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:54,329
things I can say along those lines for

1506
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:57,599
the very first time on 1935 which is the

1507
01:00:54,329 --> 01:01:01,710
main project I'm working on now for the

1508
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:04,470
very first time I decided that I never

1509
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:07,380
want to write a platform layer or

1510
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:09,118
standard library again I'm like I'm just

1511
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,710
gonna do this one final and I'm gonna

1512
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,420
move on I'm just gonna make that

1513
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:14,490
statement

1514
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:16,200
so I actually on this project and this

1515
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:18,239
is a very long project for me it's it's

1516
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:19,858
you know I'm I'm expecting honestly this

1517
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,259
project is probably a five year project

1518
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:23,670
which is a long time for one programmer

1519
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,130
it's not that much I mean five

1520
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:28,950
programmer you programmer years whatever

1521
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,780
want to call those yeah whatever the

1522
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:33,149
mythical man-month would want to call

1523
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,040
that in you know I know if you guys know

1524
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,490
the the Brooks book the mythical

1525
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,210
man-month

1526
01:01:35,489 --> 01:01:43,559
it was a classic of old yeah it's about

1527
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:51,659
IBM 360 don't worry know if you were

1528
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:54,809
alive so for the first time on this

1529
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:57,989
project I decided to do that I felt like

1530
01:01:54,809 --> 01:02:01,049
I was ready to do that and I tried very

1531
01:01:57,989 --> 01:02:02,818
hard to do that whether it succeeds or

1532
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,410
not I'm not sure but what I will say is

1533
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:06,239
I took an approach that was slightly

1534
01:02:04,409 --> 01:02:07,980
different from approaches I had taken

1535
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:12,059
before

1536
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:16,230
and I did to bring it back to the

1537
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:17,909
beginning of our session today I did

1538
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:22,349
exactly what you were saying so I have a

1539
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:24,149
file and in it every time there is a

1540
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:27,000
question about what I'm gonna do in the

1541
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:29,130
codebase I document exactly why I

1542
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,719
thought there was a question so why did

1543
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:33,660
I think that the answer to how this

1544
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:35,969
should work is not obvious I discussed

1545
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:39,029
the solutions that I've tried and I

1546
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:40,469
select one of them and say why I ended

1547
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:43,230
up selecting that one out of the ones

1548
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:45,000
that I tried so there is literally for

1549
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:49,079
the first time on any product that I've

1550
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,329
ever done a 100% complete documentation

1551
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:56,460
of why every last thing works exactly

1552
01:02:51,329 --> 01:03:00,210
the way it does right yeah and so I am

1553
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:02,309
trying to do that on this project and

1554
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:04,590
we'll see how it works out prior to this

1555
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:07,619
project I've never really felt like that

1556
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:10,490
was something that I wanted to do

1557
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:14,429
because I've always felt like there was

1558
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:16,829
probably room to grow each time yeah and

1559
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:19,109
that was usually because I never sat

1560
01:03:16,829 --> 01:03:20,309
down and said let me think all these

1561
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:22,430
things through because a lot of time to

1562
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:24,900
do a platform layer you just do it right

1563
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:27,839
and this time I approached it with the

1564
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:31,230
other the other angle so we'll see how

1565
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:35,490
that goes but that's definitely I think

1566
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:37,710
even for myself who who advocates a very

1567
01:03:35,489 --> 01:03:39,809
limber style of programming where I

1568
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,789
don't think you should really calcify or

1569
01:03:39,809 --> 01:03:44,849
do a lot of upfront design sorts of

1570
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:47,159
things even I if I want something to be

1571
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:52,889
the be-all end-all this is the one we're

1572
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:55,199
gonna use forever I do want to spend up

1573
01:03:52,889 --> 01:03:57,839
more time recording and justifying

1574
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,719
decisions I don't do them from the top

1575
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:02,309
down like a UML diagram disaster

1576
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:06,809
situation or anything like that

1577
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:09,029
but I do I do feel that a higher level

1578
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:12,509
of rigor is necessary and what I try to

1579
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:15,600
do in this situation is sort of play the

1580
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:17,520
devil's advocate as if I had more than

1581
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,099
one program the project come at it from

1582
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,338
different angles can I justify it from a

1583
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:22,838
speed perspective can I

1584
01:04:21,338 --> 01:04:25,259
to fight from ease-of-use perspective

1585
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:27,038
can I justify it from a future like

1586
01:04:25,259 --> 01:04:30,489
compatibility with possible hardware

1587
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:32,710
directions that sort of thing okay and

1588
01:04:30,489 --> 01:04:39,369
so we'll see ask me in ten years if it

1589
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:42,309
worked I so so kind of going off of the

1590
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:45,489
last question a little bit more of when

1591
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:47,548
let's when handmade hero is done or like

1592
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:49,778
your engines and the pastor done

1593
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:51,579
specifically actually specifically

1594
01:04:49,778 --> 01:04:54,039
talking about handmade hero when it's

1595
01:04:51,579 --> 01:04:56,619
done do you expect other people to kind

1596
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:59,109
of use handmade hero to make games or do

1597
01:04:56,619 --> 01:05:03,160
anything with or is it purely for the

1598
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:04,960
the kind of like that the process of

1599
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:08,078
watching it I know we kind of going over

1600
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:11,259
this a little bit but um the the latter

1601
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:13,960
it is designed to be a standalone

1602
01:05:11,259 --> 01:05:15,519
project that shows all of the parts that

1603
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,719
you would have to do to put together a

1604
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:18,879
game that you could release on Steam

1605
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:20,858
where you didn't use anyone elses code

1606
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,838
to make it that's the entire goal of it

1607
01:05:20,858 --> 01:05:24,818
doesn't have any any ancillary goal it's

1608
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:27,389
not designed for people to use for some

1609
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:32,768
other purpose or anything like this that

1610
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:35,949
said two things one I would like when

1611
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:38,248
the product is finished to essentially

1612
01:05:35,949 --> 01:05:42,098
do an audit if you will of the codebase

1613
01:05:38,248 --> 01:05:43,959
go through it all and I would like to

1614
01:05:42,099 --> 01:05:45,818
point out because I know there will be

1615
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,469
many because this is a very limited time

1616
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:48,759
project the total number of hours that

1617
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:50,979
we spent on handmade here is less than a

1618
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:53,920
year of programming time so lots of

1619
01:05:50,978 --> 01:05:56,228
stuff in it is very rough right yeah I

1620
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,729
like to do an audit find all of the

1621
01:05:56,228 --> 01:06:02,108
places where I think that roughness

1622
01:05:57,728 --> 01:06:04,298
really shows and write up exercises that

1623
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:06,639
programmers can go and take thing I'm a

1624
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:08,619
hero code base and fix something I

1625
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,478
didn't have time to do right and I just

1626
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:13,420
say like this piece of code should be

1627
01:06:10,478 --> 01:06:15,518
able to be better in these n ways pick

1628
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:17,798
one of those n ways and fix it that's

1629
01:06:15,518 --> 01:06:19,149
your homework assignment right yes I

1630
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:21,248
think that would be really good for

1631
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:23,440
engine programmers to start with in an

1632
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:24,578
engine that's made a bunch of decisions

1633
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,659
whether they're right or wrong you've

1634
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:27,640
got to live with them because that's

1635
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:29,710
gonna be your job when you're first

1636
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:31,690
starting out probably here's the Unreal

1637
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:33,909
Engine it does 50 different things wrong

1638
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:35,179
you can't change those they're baked in

1639
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:36,558
the architecture it would be

1640
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:38,509
massive change to fix them or whatever

1641
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,950
so you got to live with them how do you

1642
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:41,690
make these improvements or how do you

1643
01:06:39,949 --> 01:06:43,818
fix how do you make this one part better

1644
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:45,440
leaving with those constraints so the

1645
01:06:43,818 --> 01:06:46,849
hammer here will be no different

1646
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,800
here's a bunch of things that does wrong

1647
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:50,720
here's one thing we would like to

1648
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,329
improve you have to take it as a whole

1649
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:55,068
and just make that one improvement so I

1650
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:57,349
would like the codebase to serve as that

1651
01:06:55,068 --> 01:06:59,210
in the future yeah and I think it can

1652
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:01,550
serve is that pretty easily the second

1653
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:04,639
thing I'd say is in terms of expecting

1654
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:06,440
people to use it now I kind of do expect

1655
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,420
people used to make other games because

1656
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,190
I've had many people use it for other

1657
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:12,260
games already I've had multiple people

1658
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:14,389
write to me and ask is it okay if we use

1659
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:15,650
this for our game and I've always said

1660
01:07:14,389 --> 01:07:16,969
the same thing just make sure it doesn't

1661
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:17,990
conflict with handmade hero and you're

1662
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:19,669
fine

1663
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:21,289
I've had people already release games

1664
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,789
who did them for like game jams and

1665
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:24,739
stuff who use them at your codebase so

1666
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,659
there's games already shipping that are

1667
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:29,568
on the hammer hirako base so I guess if

1668
01:07:26,659 --> 01:07:31,670
that portends anything the answer is yes

1669
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:32,659
people will use it however that was

1670
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:39,619
never my intention

1671
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:41,088
gotcha so moving on to so we while we

1672
01:07:39,619 --> 01:07:43,400
were doing a little more research about

1673
01:07:41,088 --> 01:07:46,099
you we all read your piece on the walk

1674
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:48,500
monster thought it was a really

1675
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:50,930
interesting tool but towards the bottom

1676
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,309
we like where you talk about you're like

1677
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:54,078
still open questions while you're

1678
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:57,109
writing it of like oh you could add this

1679
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,818
feature this feature in this feature at

1680
01:07:57,108 --> 01:08:01,389
what point does investing into it like a

1681
01:07:58,818 --> 01:08:03,588
test system like this become a net loss

1682
01:08:01,389 --> 01:08:06,289
versus or like spending too much time

1683
01:08:03,588 --> 01:08:07,608
investing in a tool versus just using

1684
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:13,909
the tool for what it was originally made

1685
01:08:07,608 --> 01:08:18,429
to do I suppose what I would say about

1686
01:08:13,909 --> 01:08:22,460
that is that although as programmers

1687
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:26,298
gain more experience if they are a

1688
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:28,579
talented and hardworking programmer they

1689
01:08:26,298 --> 01:08:35,060
will gain a certain amount of what I

1690
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:37,068
would call taste I think I might want to

1691
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:38,750
attribute that term to Jeff Roberts the

1692
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:40,609
person who founded rad game tools and

1693
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,140
wrote the video codec that is used in

1694
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:44,679
every game that's ever shipped in the

1695
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:44,679
history of time

1696
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:52,490
he I think used that term taste and I

1697
01:08:49,489 --> 01:08:55,460
still use it which is to say the things

1698
01:08:52,489 --> 01:08:58,399
about decision-making that we probably

1699
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:01,220
cannot now possibly ever but at least

1700
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:03,739
not now boil down into a rigorous

1701
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,240
science or you know anything of that

1702
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:09,109
nature

1703
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:10,579
I suspect yeah as a parent gains more

1704
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:12,109
experience and if they are good and if

1705
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:14,239
their conscientious they can gain more

1706
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:17,119
taste about how to make a decision like

1707
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:20,300
the one you've stated okay I think it

1708
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:22,640
was probably completely implausible for

1709
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,320
anyone to be able to give advice on how

1710
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,360
to make that decision

1711
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:29,359
you either have enough experience to

1712
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:30,949
read the tea leaves to know and you're

1713
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,380
conscious of programmer to make a good

1714
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:35,300
decision or do or do the tests necessary

1715
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:36,710
to make that decision or you're not and

1716
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:40,039
I don't think someone can really help

1717
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:41,899
you gain that early not yet anyway maybe

1718
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:44,170
we'll learn so in the future what I

1719
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:47,329
would say is that people almost

1720
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:50,869
categorically undervalue visualization

1721
01:09:47,329 --> 01:09:52,970
so if you were going to err on the side

1722
01:09:50,869 --> 01:09:54,349
if you can't decide whether it's good or

1723
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:56,270
bad to make a visualization you're on

1724
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:58,400
the fence make the visualization that's

1725
01:09:56,270 --> 01:10:00,400
about the only advice I can give the

1726
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:03,199
chance is that it will be not useful

1727
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:05,329
compared to its cost are almost zero if

1728
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,439
you get to a point where you're pretty

1729
01:10:05,329 --> 01:10:08,180
sure that you don't need any more

1730
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:09,799
visualization then you can stop but if

1731
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,420
you're on that fence if you're like oh

1732
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,060
this could help us it might not I'm not

1733
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:16,039
sure go go visualization that's about

1734
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,880
the only piece of concrete advice I

1735
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:19,250
think I could give

1736
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,220
yeah I kind of going off that too so

1737
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:24,050
just a little I'm just curious of on how

1738
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:26,300
the tool so after you kind of did all

1739
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:28,070
the visualization did you have to kind

1740
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:30,110
of fly through the map and try to figure

1741
01:10:28,069 --> 01:10:32,029
out oh like there's this red circle here

1742
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:34,039
or because there's like a leftover

1743
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:35,509
collision box isn't even better did you

1744
01:10:34,039 --> 01:10:38,449
kind of have something that would pop up

1745
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:41,329
and like populated text file or

1746
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:45,019
something like that I'll answer that

1747
01:10:41,329 --> 01:10:48,170
question briefly because on

1748
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:51,400
I think it's Thursday I'm giving a talk

1749
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:54,859
at the Busan indie connect conference

1750
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:58,079
where I will show demos of all of the

1751
01:10:54,859 --> 01:11:00,149
tools we developed for walk

1752
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:01,380
checking and processing in the witness

1753
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:04,979
okay

1754
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:06,270
they are drastically more advanced than

1755
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:08,639
the ones that I wrote about in the walk

1756
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:11,280
monsterpiece and walk monster in fact

1757
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,500
was never used on the witness we

1758
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:16,609
replaced it with things that are many

1759
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:20,130
times better than it so it was more

1760
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:22,710
really more of an exercise walk monster

1761
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,119
was of determining that we had a problem

1762
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,649
and that we had a serious problem

1763
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:28,920
uh-huh but the solution to that problem

1764
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:34,439
was actually much more involved in went

1765
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:35,850
in a different direction so I guess what

1766
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:38,429
I would say is all of the problems that

1767
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:40,200
walk monster was designed to prevent

1768
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:42,180
we ended up either preventing

1769
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:45,510
systemically in ways that they literally

1770
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:47,760
could not happen or developed better

1771
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:49,590
visualization tools for that are much

1772
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,570
better than walk monster and you'll see

1773
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:52,800
those on Thursday they've told me that

1774
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:53,909
it will be recorded but it doesn't

1775
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,130
matter I'll post a recording of it

1776
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,960
either way so presumably they'll either

1777
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,779
be the official recording or I'll post

1778
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:03,630
one and you can that'll probably two

1779
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:05,309
weeks or something okay and you can link

1780
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:10,920
to that in the write-up if you want to

1781
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:15,150
get perfect so one of our kind of last

1782
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:17,550
questions about handmade hero is say you

1783
01:12:15,149 --> 01:12:19,769
lost everything and you had to start

1784
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:22,260
from square one again

1785
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:23,670
what would you is there anything that

1786
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:26,610
immediately comes to mind of like I do

1787
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:31,020
this section differently or approach

1788
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:34,019
things differently well I mean yeah

1789
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:36,870
obviously there are but that's because

1790
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:39,270
of the point of handmade hero which is

1791
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:41,729
to say that the whole reason for

1792
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:45,060
recording the process was I wanted to

1793
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:48,419
see I wanted people to see me go down a

1794
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:51,390
few avenues before picking the one I

1795
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:53,730
wanted or to see how a amorphous

1796
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:56,220
unstructured piece of code resolves into

1797
01:12:53,729 --> 01:12:58,409
a structured one so for example fairly

1798
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,750
recently one thing we did over the past

1799
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:03,180
three weeks in fact was we made the

1800
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:05,340
renderer standalone in a DLL that now

1801
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:06,570
anyone can use to make a renderer that

1802
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,000
does all the things that handmade heroes

1803
01:13:06,569 --> 01:13:10,489
does so the depth peeling and like stuff

1804
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,810
for sprites and the

1805
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:14,329
your coat all that stuff is kind of in a

1806
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:17,050
separate library now so if you wanted to

1807
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:20,659
just make a game that has an instant 3d

1808
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:25,520
hybrid sprite block renderer you just

1809
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:27,050
have one right yeah those are exactly

1810
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,070
what I wanted people to see in handmade

1811
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:32,390
hero so if I lost the whole thing I

1812
01:13:30,069 --> 01:13:35,750
almost would say I would start a

1813
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:37,280
different project because if I was going

1814
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:39,229
into handmade here with the knowledge of

1815
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:43,130
how everything worked out which I now

1816
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:45,919
know it would totally ruin the entire

1817
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:48,350
point of the series watching me type in

1818
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:51,020
code I already know how to do it get

1819
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:53,990
isn't worthless that's what a blogs for

1820
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:56,750
right or a github repo here's how to do

1821
01:13:53,989 --> 01:13:58,819
it we're done right so the whole point

1822
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:02,420
the series was to show that so I on

1823
01:13:58,819 --> 01:14:05,539
handmade hero it was critical that I not

1824
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:08,000
have a solution in mind when I started

1825
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:11,989
for at least some of the major parts of

1826
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,359
the project preferably all all right

1827
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:19,189
and then question about making builds so

1828
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:21,710
making a build of the game can be kind

1829
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:24,069
of a like a witness a build either like

1830
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:26,689
making the engine of dll or kind of

1831
01:14:24,069 --> 01:14:29,090
compiling the game with the engine kind

1832
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:30,949
of together kind of doing that process

1833
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:32,150
can be a little bit of a hurdle or kind

1834
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:34,760
of something unknown at least from our

1835
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:37,189
point of view and so when you're doing

1836
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,710
something like that is there any good

1837
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:42,769
advice that you have to start it like

1838
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:45,500
early and keep it going on or is it like

1839
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:47,330
kind of what advice you have on creating

1840
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:54,229
builds early and like keeping them going

1841
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:56,180
rather than breaking ideal sue I might

1842
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:59,269
understand the question but I might not

1843
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:03,680
so okay if I may ask some clarifying

1844
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:08,660
questions yeah so if you were to

1845
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:12,200
substitute into that question rather

1846
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:14,239
than game engine some other thing like

1847
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:16,579
what have you worked on in the past even

1848
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:20,380
a small project just give me anything

1849
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:20,380
that you've done for school work or

1850
01:15:20,408 --> 01:15:26,828
so we work we worked on like a like

1851
01:15:23,139 --> 01:15:30,279
unity games and do us everything well so

1852
01:15:26,828 --> 01:15:32,558
I can pin missile program um I worked on

1853
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:34,210
something with the had somewhat of a

1854
01:15:32,559 --> 01:15:36,190
bill that we make you simple with C

1855
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:38,288
maker is just like a really really

1856
01:15:36,189 --> 01:15:39,819
crappy version of Photoshop so

1857
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:41,889
essentially taking the different pieces

1858
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:44,439
we made it also something of like a

1859
01:15:41,889 --> 01:15:48,788
switch to make a utility for hospitals

1860
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:51,129
to use it with things so okay okay I I

1861
01:15:48,788 --> 01:15:52,809
think I had a question now so is it

1862
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:57,940
correct to restate the question as

1863
01:15:52,809 --> 01:16:01,869
follows we have not traditionally worked

1864
01:15:57,939 --> 01:16:04,629
on code where we actually built an

1865
01:16:01,868 --> 01:16:07,328
executable from scratch so we have not

1866
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:10,809
we have no experience really with that

1867
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:12,998
process how should it work is that yeah

1868
01:16:10,809 --> 01:16:14,769
okay okay so it's not yeah because I was

1869
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:16,420
not sure if you meant for a game engine

1870
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:18,219
specifically and I was like well what

1871
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,969
would be different about a game engine

1872
01:16:18,219 --> 01:16:22,510
but you're just talking about the

1873
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:25,960
process of working outside of someone

1874
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:32,710
else's build they've handed you yes it's

1875
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:35,139
okay gotcha so I think what I would say

1876
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:36,760
about that is that it's a lot simpler

1877
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:40,900
than you think

1878
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:43,900
one of the problems so so i'll veer into

1879
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:45,939
an anecdote here at the risk of eating

1880
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,049
up more of your time at know if you guys

1881
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:51,189
getting bored sitting in your chairs

1882
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:54,479
here so if you've ever used an email

1883
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:58,529
program which by this point we all have

1884
01:16:54,479 --> 01:17:04,389
you may have occasionally been kind of

1885
01:16:58,529 --> 01:17:05,889
amazed in a sense at how how they

1886
01:17:04,389 --> 01:17:07,748
managed to have so many bugs are so many

1887
01:17:05,889 --> 01:17:09,368
problems in something that all it really

1888
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:10,510
has to do is just send a piece of text

1889
01:17:09,368 --> 01:17:11,589
from one place to another right it's

1890
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:14,079
like it's like one of the simplest

1891
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:18,389
things you could do over a network and

1892
01:17:14,078 --> 01:17:22,899
it's been done for decades and it still

1893
01:17:18,389 --> 01:17:24,940
kind of somehow mysteriously impossible

1894
01:17:22,899 --> 01:17:28,058
for them to get it right

1895
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:30,069
so back in the old days at Bell Labs

1896
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:31,538
which was obviously one of the like

1897
01:17:30,069 --> 01:17:32,559
crucibles of software engineering of

1898
01:17:31,538 --> 01:17:35,859
place that created

1899
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:38,680
see and UNIX for example yeah they had a

1900
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:41,889
term for this and it was called mailer

1901
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,720
science and it was a joke that they

1902
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:45,670
threw around because nobody could ever

1903
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,140
understand how the people who always

1904
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:52,840
ended up working on the simplest

1905
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:54,850
problems made the biggest mess so it's

1906
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:56,949
like why is this meal program so broken

1907
01:17:54,850 --> 01:18:00,550
it's like mailer science man it's just

1908
01:17:56,949 --> 01:18:03,489
mailer science so I would offer the term

1909
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:06,220
build science as today's equivalent of

1910
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:08,909
that we currently have some kind of

1911
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:11,829
weird programming culture where people

1912
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:15,039
you you would there's a term called

1913
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:22,180
build engineer all I can say about that

1914
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:24,519
is what is going on right so the way to

1915
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:26,980
approach a build is to realize that

1916
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,660
computers today are so fast that almost

1917
01:18:26,979 --> 01:18:30,250
any game engine you care to make

1918
01:18:28,659 --> 01:18:34,269
especially on a team as small as yours

1919
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:38,079
can be built with a batch file in like

1920
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:40,210
ten seconds anything you do more

1921
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:45,210
complicated than that is a waste of your

1922
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:49,750
time people throw in integrated

1923
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:52,239
continuous build servers and see make

1924
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:54,880
and ninja and distributed builds and

1925
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:57,969
Python all these it's like no just

1926
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,940
forget all that get rid of it it's not

1927
01:18:57,970 --> 01:19:04,510
necessary all you need to do is just

1928
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:07,329
make a thing that says CL here are the

1929
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:09,940
files this is the exe I want build

1930
01:19:07,329 --> 01:19:12,189
that's it I'm hand made hero we show how

1931
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:14,559
to do this the first day yeah it's

1932
01:19:12,189 --> 01:19:15,879
trivial you don't need anything more

1933
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,950
complicated than that and I would

1934
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,279
encourage you to start there okay

1935
01:19:17,949 --> 01:19:23,079
eventually somewhere down the line there

1936
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:25,269
are some arguments to be made and

1937
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:28,630
programmers who I respect would make

1938
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:29,650
arguments for doing some of the slightly

1939
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:32,350
more complicated things like a

1940
01:19:29,649 --> 01:19:36,369
continuous integration server when you

1941
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:38,590
have multiple platforms so once you get

1942
01:19:36,369 --> 01:19:41,739
to like oh we're shipping the switch the

1943
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:45,489
PlayStation 4 the Mac the Linux the PC

1944
01:19:41,739 --> 01:19:45,880
build the Xbox one bill the ps4 build of

1945
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:49,269
this

1946
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:51,489
right uh-huh it can be hard for an

1947
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:54,310
individual programmer to have everything

1948
01:19:51,488 --> 01:19:56,529
installed on their machines to keep

1949
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:58,539
those builds up to date and to know if

1950
01:19:56,529 --> 01:20:01,238
they've broken some totally other build

1951
01:19:58,539 --> 01:20:05,260
that they don't even have the SDK for at

1952
01:20:01,238 --> 01:20:07,658
that point sometimes sometimes it

1953
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:10,659
becomes valuable to take that step if

1954
01:20:07,658 --> 01:20:13,629
you do it sensibly and make sure that it

1955
01:20:10,658 --> 01:20:17,559
doesn't interfere with the quick fast

1956
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:19,409
simple build that you use day to day so

1957
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,070
I would put that up but otherwise

1958
01:20:19,408 --> 01:20:25,089
especially if you're only on a single

1959
01:20:21,069 --> 01:20:27,340
platform a single line build is the

1960
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:29,800
build you want it shouldn't be more

1961
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:31,779
complicated than that single lines with

1962
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:36,190
a single batch file couple lines is

1963
01:20:31,779 --> 01:20:37,899
plenty and I would also say that there's

1964
01:20:36,189 --> 01:20:41,229
really no excuse for build times to get

1965
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:42,879
above 10 seconds there's a utility that

1966
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:45,189
I put out called C time that times

1967
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,389
builds and keeps a record over time you

1968
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:48,579
look at that graph if it's crawling

1969
01:20:46,389 --> 01:20:51,880
upwards figure out how your builds are

1970
01:20:48,579 --> 01:20:53,408
slow and fix them okay so that's the

1971
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,909
advice I would have and if you have any

1972
01:20:53,408 --> 01:20:56,738
practical problems with that like I said

1973
01:20:54,908 --> 01:20:59,259
handmade heroes first day just shows how

1974
01:20:56,738 --> 01:21:01,329
to do that or just look at the code I

1975
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:02,800
can send you our batch file after this

1976
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:05,829
and you can look at it it's super simple

1977
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:08,440
I advocate using what's called a unity

1978
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:09,969
build not related to the tool but what

1979
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:13,388
that is is essentially just saying look

1980
01:21:09,969 --> 01:21:16,420
make a C file that just includes all the

1981
01:21:13,389 --> 01:21:20,529
CPP files you want build that one CPP

1982
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:22,480
file that's your build ok that's that's

1983
01:21:20,529 --> 01:21:24,130
super useful information now it also

1984
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:27,399
speeds up the build quite a bit because

1985
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:29,020
the fewer CPP files that the the fewer

1986
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:30,698
translation units the compiler

1987
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:32,290
translates the faster it typically goes

1988
01:21:30,698 --> 01:21:34,509
because every time you split into

1989
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:36,369
multiple translation units those

1990
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:38,889
translation units usually include some

1991
01:21:36,369 --> 01:21:40,869
of the same H files which increases the

1992
01:21:38,889 --> 01:21:43,029
processing load so by merging them all

1993
01:21:40,869 --> 01:21:45,670
together you process every H file only

1994
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:47,289
once which can drastically speed up some

1995
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:50,069
builds like by orders of magnitude

1996
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:51,979
sometimes if those H files are complex

1997
01:21:50,069 --> 01:21:55,069
ok

1998
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:56,659
birthday so we are actually done with

1999
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:59,630
all of our questions that we have for

2000
01:21:56,658 --> 01:22:02,029
you the last thing we have would be so

2001
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:04,639
as we said we'd like to do like a

2002
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:06,828
company with like the kind of edit about

2003
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,809
a five minute story that you have on

2004
01:22:06,828 --> 01:22:10,849
game engine development but you think

2005
01:22:08,809 --> 01:22:14,150
it's interesting so it can be anything

2006
01:22:10,849 --> 01:22:16,099
of your choosing so if you have any

2007
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:19,939
story that you'd be willing to tell and

2008
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:21,170
I'm not totally okay as well yeah I mean

2009
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:23,238
that's sort of the problem with that is

2010
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:28,519
there's lots of I suppose stories but

2011
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:36,498
I'm not sure which one are really all

2012
01:22:28,519 --> 01:22:38,989
that interesting or or useful so oh go

2013
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:40,158
ahead yeah or just gonna say it doesn't

2014
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,779
necessarily need to be useful at this

2015
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:44,299
point this is one thing that we want to

2016
01:22:41,779 --> 01:22:46,099
show people for the sake of programmers

2017
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,869
and maybe even other people who get into

2018
01:22:46,099 --> 01:22:49,400
the space and see maybe the work we've

2019
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:51,889
done but they don't really care about

2020
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:53,478
that but they might be interested in

2021
01:22:51,889 --> 01:22:55,309
seeing just something short that could

2022
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:56,749
introduce them and then hearing

2023
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:58,458
something interesting about space like

2024
01:22:56,748 --> 01:23:00,319
oh wow I didn't realize dealing with

2025
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:02,868
that or like that just sounded really

2026
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,488
like a really funny problem that it's

2027
01:23:02,868 --> 01:23:06,170
more or less of that so you don't need

2028
01:23:04,488 --> 01:23:08,029
to necessarily have it be super useful

2029
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:12,889
with anybody as one unit five minute

2030
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:13,518
video you'd have to give me a second no

2031
01:23:12,889 --> 01:23:15,969
take your time

2032
01:23:13,519 --> 01:23:15,969
yeah absolutely

2033
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:55,829
yeah I really just don't know I mean one

2034
01:23:54,119 --> 01:24:00,840
of the things that's true about game

2035
01:23:55,829 --> 01:24:04,890
development is that the things that are

2036
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:15,739
interesting to you are not interesting

2037
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:15,740
to other people and so you know I mean I

2038
01:24:17,149 --> 01:24:27,779
guess what I would say is that all of

2039
01:24:25,289 --> 01:24:29,909
the things that I that come to mind when

2040
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:31,619
I think of them I can't imagine them

2041
01:24:29,909 --> 01:24:35,069
being particularly interesting anecdotes

2042
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:38,399
to anybody most of the time you know I

2043
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:40,529
think when I think back about what were

2044
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:43,979
sort of the most interesting game

2045
01:24:40,529 --> 01:24:50,269
development times they were almost

2046
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:53,489
always in sort of circumstances where I

2047
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:56,160
had been looking at something the wrong

2048
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:58,739
way and then you know after doing quite

2049
01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:00,510
a bit of work on it or something

2050
01:24:58,739 --> 01:25:02,880
realized there was sort of this other

2051
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:07,440
way to do it and that insight is kind of

2052
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:11,130
really really fun for for the person

2053
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,539
who's been working at it but I just

2054
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:16,050
don't know how to turn most of those

2055
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:18,539
into into an anecdote sometimes in

2056
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:21,210
lectures you know I've sort of told like

2057
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:22,920
I've had a lecture there's a at the

2058
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:26,670
papers we love conference where I talked

2059
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:28,199
about figuring out that you could blend

2060
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:30,510
quaternions using linear interpolation

2061
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:32,819
instead of spherical interpolation and

2062
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:34,320
how that discovery came about and like

2063
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:35,969
some of those things we're really

2064
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:38,689
exciting at the time and they just

2065
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:42,150
there's not much you can really anecdote

2066
01:25:38,689 --> 01:25:44,219
anecdote eyes about them although you

2067
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:50,009
know I could I could sort of stretch one

2068
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:53,310
out I think if I had to pick something

2069
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:54,960
to say that would go into a compendium

2070
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:57,690
of the kind that you're talking about I

2071
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:00,029
think probably what I would say is that

2072
01:25:57,689 --> 01:26:01,829
when I was little

2073
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:03,750
because I've always been a programmer

2074
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:07,260
like like I said since I was very very

2075
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:09,179
young I always wanted to program and in

2076
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:12,000
those days there was really no internet

2077
01:26:09,179 --> 01:26:14,699
and no communication with anybody so I

2078
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,469
didn't know any game developers and I

2079
01:26:14,698 --> 01:26:20,638
didn't know anything about game

2080
01:26:16,469 --> 01:26:22,770
developers right I just had computers

2081
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:24,569
that I could program at home and I tried

2082
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:25,889
to learn to program them and make games

2083
01:26:24,569 --> 01:26:30,689
on them as best I could and that was

2084
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:32,969
really all I had to go on and my father

2085
01:26:30,689 --> 01:26:35,839
who was a programmer was not a game

2086
01:26:32,969 --> 01:26:38,760
programmer he worked on traditional like

2087
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:41,069
tools for Digital Equipment Corporation

2088
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:44,400
which is a now-defunct hardware company

2089
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:46,079
right and so most of the things that I

2090
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,399
might have wanted to know he didn't

2091
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:50,250
necessarily know like he didn't know

2092
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:51,689
hardly any 3d math or anything like that

2093
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,729
that you would use for game development

2094
01:26:51,689 --> 01:26:59,519
because it's just not that's not common

2095
01:26:53,729 --> 01:27:01,589
knowledge among programmers right so one

2096
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,199
of the things that was really exciting

2097
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:08,400
for me as a young programmer was when I

2098
01:27:04,198 --> 01:27:12,299
was still in high school I had met over

2099
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:15,420
this previous summer some programmers

2100
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:17,100
from Microsoft and they were going to

2101
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:19,469
lookingglass which is a company that

2102
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,590
again doesn't exist today but they made

2103
01:27:19,469 --> 01:27:23,908
a bunch of games that a lot of people

2104
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:26,909
consider seminal like Ultima Underworld

2105
01:27:23,908 --> 01:27:29,609
and System Shock and theif the dark

2106
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:31,618
project and flight unlimited just a lot

2107
01:27:29,609 --> 01:27:33,479
of very important games in the pantheon

2108
01:27:31,618 --> 01:27:39,439
of games when people are talking about

2109
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:42,689
history they were going there to port

2110
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:45,238
flight unlimited to Windows because this

2111
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:46,888
was at the very early time when Windows

2112
01:27:45,238 --> 01:27:48,809
didn't really run real-time games for

2113
01:27:46,889 --> 01:27:50,819
the most part because it didn't have a

2114
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:54,030
way of actually writing graphics to a

2115
01:27:50,819 --> 01:27:56,819
back buffer like you would in das and so

2116
01:27:54,029 --> 01:28:00,329
they were going to go do that and they

2117
01:27:56,819 --> 01:28:03,769
asked me if I wanted to come and my mom

2118
01:28:00,329 --> 01:28:06,569
let me take a few days off from school

2119
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:11,880
so instead of going to school I went

2120
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:12,670
into Cambridge and I like got to go work

2121
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,340
on the

2122
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:17,560
windows port of flight unlimited and

2123
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:23,619
it's the first time I'd ever really set

2124
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:26,830
foot in a game company and I think about

2125
01:28:23,619 --> 01:28:31,000
that time often these days especially

2126
01:28:26,829 --> 01:28:34,539
because as you get older you definitely

2127
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,359
become more sort of cynical about

2128
01:28:34,539 --> 01:28:39,189
everything about development about

2129
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:41,619
companies about everything you know

2130
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:43,809
everything you do and it's easy to lose

2131
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:46,059
sight of what you love about things or

2132
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:48,520
what was important to you but I think

2133
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:52,660
back about those those days now and like

2134
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:55,420
it was like the most magical experience

2135
01:28:52,659 --> 01:28:58,059
I imagine it was probably similar to if

2136
01:28:55,420 --> 01:29:01,060
as a you know a lot of children grow up

2137
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:04,210
maybe dreaming of playing in the NBA or

2138
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:06,610
something and it's like you know some of

2139
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:09,579
those children probably get to randomly

2140
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:11,439
get to go out and shoot a free-throw you

2141
01:29:09,579 --> 01:29:13,840
know with their favorite team you know

2142
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:16,269
or something like this and it was

2143
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:19,179
exactly that experience for me I you

2144
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:21,880
know just even seeing what it looked

2145
01:29:19,179 --> 01:29:23,890
like to walk into a game development

2146
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:26,770
studio and see what the people there

2147
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:29,619
were doing and like meet the people

2148
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:31,540
behind it and I remember literally like

2149
01:29:29,619 --> 01:29:34,000
everything about that experience like I

2150
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:36,340
remember we went to a grocery store next

2151
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,380
door called bread and circus and we

2152
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:39,909
bought like some bread and cheese and

2153
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:42,069
apples and stuff and brought them back

2154
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:44,800
and like ate them around a lunch table

2155
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:46,869
things that are inconsequential I'm sure

2156
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:50,529
to everyone else who work there still

2157
01:29:46,869 --> 01:29:51,909
like stick in my memory as like I don't

2158
01:29:50,529 --> 01:29:53,559
know if you can call it a formative

2159
01:29:51,909 --> 01:29:55,359
experience because that's a sort of

2160
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:58,060
different thing I suppose but it's

2161
01:29:55,359 --> 01:30:03,099
definitely like it just shows me how

2162
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:07,150
much of an innate draw towards this I

2163
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:10,060
had and I expect that other people who

2164
01:30:07,149 --> 01:30:12,219
you know if if you want to know whether

2165
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:15,610
this is the kind of thing you might want

2166
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:17,739
to be doing with your life if that's

2167
01:30:15,609 --> 01:30:19,750
kind of the way you feel about it if you

2168
01:30:17,738 --> 01:30:23,678
have those kinds of feelings then you're

2169
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:27,000
probably right um but if you don't

2170
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:30,100
maybe not right I mean it's a hard job

2171
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:34,779
it's not like playing games it has

2172
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:37,090
nothing to do with that and so I feel

2173
01:30:34,779 --> 01:30:38,948
like you have to almost approach it from

2174
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:40,929
that same thing and maybe the NBA

2175
01:30:38,948 --> 01:30:43,178
examples pretty good if you like

2176
01:30:40,929 --> 01:30:44,920
watching people play basketball that's

2177
01:30:43,179 --> 01:30:47,170
not the same as liking playing

2178
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:49,420
basketball and it's good to know which

2179
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:52,179
of the two you want to do because if you

2180
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:53,890
just like watching basketball then

2181
01:30:52,179 --> 01:30:56,859
there's no harm in having an ancillary

2182
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:59,800
job you could work on the communications

2183
01:30:56,859 --> 01:31:01,929
team for your favorite sports team just

2184
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:04,390
like you might work in the production

2185
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:06,819
department of your favorite game company

2186
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:10,390
but engine programmer is the on the

2187
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:12,579
court job that's really demanding and

2188
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:15,550
demands the kind of dedication I think

2189
01:31:12,579 --> 01:31:18,189
in a lot of ways that an athlete has to

2190
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:19,480
have you're expected to know a lot more

2191
01:31:18,189 --> 01:31:23,019
you're expected to work a lot harder

2192
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:25,178
you're expected to know such a to have

2193
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:29,380
trained your brain in such a demanding

2194
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:31,029
way at some level that I think you kind

2195
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:33,489
of have to have a certain love for it to

2196
01:31:31,029 --> 01:31:34,899
really want to do it and and to get back

2197
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:37,029
to maybe one of the questions you asked

2198
01:31:34,899 --> 01:31:39,369
me earlier that might be why I think

2199
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:41,170
it's so important to try and expose more

2200
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:43,869
people to it because I think there's a

2201
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:47,679
very limited number of people who really

2202
01:31:43,869 --> 01:31:49,960
have the desire to do it and finding

2203
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:52,270
those people is important to me and I

2204
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:54,100
think that it's worth doing and there's

2205
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:56,560
so many other jobs out there for a

2206
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:58,630
programmer to have that are not as hard

2207
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:00,489
as this and that aren't as demanding is

2208
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:02,170
this that I think that there's plenty of

2209
01:32:00,488 --> 01:32:03,968
other jobs for people to go to and I

2210
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:06,250
think they will go to them if their

2211
01:32:03,969 --> 01:32:09,489
heart's not really in it so finding out

2212
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:10,719
if your heart is in it is good and and I

2213
01:32:09,488 --> 01:32:12,488
would encourage people do that as early

2214
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,350
as possible I don't know if that's the

2215
01:32:12,488 --> 01:32:16,689
kind of anecdote you wanted but but

2216
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:19,810
there you have it yeah that was pretty

2217
01:32:16,689 --> 01:32:21,759
spot-on it okay so we're actually done

2218
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:23,469
with any of our all of our questions I

2219
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,619
don't know if you have any questions for

2220
01:32:23,469 --> 01:32:27,939
us regarding things but if if not we

2221
01:32:26,619 --> 01:32:29,738
really thank you for all the time we've

2222
01:32:27,939 --> 01:32:31,299
taken and we really appreciate all the

2223
01:32:29,738 --> 01:32:34,419
questions you were able to answer for us

2224
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:36,219
and oh we got my pleasure those were

2225
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,019
excellent questions and I

2226
01:32:36,219 --> 01:32:40,389
wish you guys the best of luck on your

2227
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:43,869
programming project making gay mention

2228
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:45,309
is very difficult the only piece of

2229
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:48,210
advice I would have is don't be too

2230
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:50,440
ambitious with what I've accomplished

2231
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:53,380
you know I always tell people make

2232
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:55,299
asteroids first and it's something to be

2233
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:57,429
proud of if you can even do that from

2234
01:32:55,300 --> 01:33:01,269
scratch because most people can't most

2235
01:32:57,429 --> 01:33:02,199
programmers can't so best of luck

2236
01:33:01,269 --> 01:33:04,360
everybody

2237
01:33:02,198 --> 01:33:06,069
thank you so much have a great day you

2238
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:08,618
know we'll definitely be trying to watch

2239
01:33:06,069 --> 01:33:10,238
the view same comfort okay yeah if you

2240
01:33:08,618 --> 01:33:12,518
want more information on waka monster

2241
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:14,379
it's got everything because it's not

2242
01:33:12,519 --> 01:33:16,809
walk monster the talks actually called

2243
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:20,319
killing the walk monster because we got

2244
01:33:16,809 --> 01:33:24,119
rid of it and and I will explain how and

2245
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:24,118
why so good

2246
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,630
[Music]

2247
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:39,469
uh so I'm still live here I didn't look

2248
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:40,880
to see what was going on

2249
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:42,619
chat I don't know how many people whoa

2250
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,340
we've got a lot of people watching

2251
01:33:42,619 --> 01:33:45,340
actually I suppose

2252
01:33:53,149 --> 01:34:00,429
I don't know if anyone has any questions

2253
01:33:57,939 --> 01:34:09,019
SF gardener says that was fun

2254
01:34:00,429 --> 01:34:12,560
cool what was that

2255
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:15,679
that was just there there is a team I

2256
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:19,520
believe that Carnegie Mellon they said

2257
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:23,929
so there they're in University who is

2258
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:28,699
working on a game engine development

2259
01:34:23,929 --> 01:34:33,590
project and they were sort of saying

2260
01:34:28,698 --> 01:34:35,178
that they wanted to an email to me they

2261
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:37,250
were saying they wanted to get some

2262
01:34:35,179 --> 01:34:40,340
people's perspectives on just engine

2263
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:42,710
things as part of their project and that

2264
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:47,989
seemed like a really smart thing to do

2265
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:51,350
and so I just you know said sure

2266
01:34:47,988 --> 01:34:53,029
anything I can do to help so these this

2267
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:55,760
interview was just the questions that

2268
01:34:53,029 --> 01:34:59,139
they had I don't know how helpful my

2269
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:01,190
answers are gonna be but you know I I

2270
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:02,750
just tried to provide as much

2271
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:04,579
information as I could that me you know

2272
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,390
maybe is useful to the project they're

2273
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:06,679
trying to put together because they're

2274
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:08,449
kind of putting together some learning

2275
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:11,949
materials to it's well I guess for their

2276
01:35:08,448 --> 01:35:11,948
own use and for other people's I suppose

2277
01:35:14,979 --> 01:35:22,839
what is the killing the walk monster

2278
01:35:17,238 --> 01:35:22,839
thing is talking about so it's it's

2279
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,450
there's this thing called the Busan Indy

2280
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:31,599
connect

2281
01:35:30,449 --> 01:35:33,929
[Music]

2282
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:39,060
[Applause]

2283
01:35:33,929 --> 01:35:42,449
there we go it's a festival in in South

2284
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:47,550
Korea I believe this is the shop from

2285
01:35:42,448 --> 01:35:50,488
last year it's a combination event one

2286
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:52,110
of the parts of the event is that there

2287
01:35:50,488 --> 01:35:54,569
are indie games that are going to be

2288
01:35:52,109 --> 01:35:58,469
shown kind of like in the mega booth or

2289
01:35:54,569 --> 01:36:00,809
you know like a look in a festival

2290
01:35:58,469 --> 01:36:02,429
setting I think there's some judging to

2291
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:04,050
see what gets into what doesn't but I

2292
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:05,520
could be wrong about that I'm not sure

2293
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:08,010
how that part of process goes I wasn't

2294
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,380
involved in that but then there's also a

2295
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:12,570
small conference where a couple

2296
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:16,319
different speakers are speaking and

2297
01:36:12,569 --> 01:36:19,738
Chris Hecker is I believe going to speak

2298
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:22,889
on spy party stuff I believe this is a

2299
01:36:19,738 --> 01:36:25,439
spy party design lecture they for some

2300
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:27,510
reason haven't put the talk descriptions

2301
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:30,119
up i believe chris has sent them when I

2302
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:32,699
just don't it's just not up do I think

2303
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:34,649
it's a spy party design lecture that

2304
01:36:32,698 --> 01:36:36,689
chris is gonna do I don't know what

2305
01:36:34,649 --> 01:36:39,210
Tyrone is talking about but I'm assuming

2306
01:36:36,689 --> 01:36:42,389
he's talking about publishing work they

2307
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:45,960
do it Nicholas I don't know I don't know

2308
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:48,900
what this blockchain one is about mine

2309
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:52,260
is about the wok system that I

2310
01:36:48,899 --> 01:36:56,969
implemented for the witness and so it

2311
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:59,159
it's talking about the taking from the

2312
01:36:56,969 --> 01:37:05,840
point that I wrote the article original

2313
01:36:59,158 --> 01:37:11,698
article on wok monster let me see oh man

2314
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:12,900
this is okay let's try more specific

2315
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:16,469
guess there's another thing called one

2316
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:19,738
monster it's it starts with this article

2317
01:37:16,469 --> 01:37:22,609
where I talk about what a thing I did on

2318
01:37:19,738 --> 01:37:25,709
the witness and shows some of the

2319
01:37:22,609 --> 01:37:29,069
techniques that we were using early on

2320
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:32,750
in the project or not necessarily early

2321
01:37:29,069 --> 01:37:35,759
in the project but early on in the

2322
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:37,500
testing of the wok system and it starts

2323
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:43,020
there and goes through to discuss the

2324
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:45,000
final system that we developed for for

2325
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:46,800
doing all of the walk movement and

2326
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:52,680
everything and then

2327
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:55,110
I believe so I think these are sponsored

2328
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:58,740
sessions from various different

2329
01:37:55,109 --> 01:38:00,859
companies like Amazon I think Nick

2330
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:04,170
Sutton er is another invited talk though

2331
01:38:00,859 --> 01:38:05,849
and again I don't know I don't know what

2332
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:07,170
it's on because the things aren't up

2333
01:38:05,850 --> 01:38:10,789
here but I believe this was also an

2334
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:14,640
invited talk it's not a sponsored talk I

2335
01:38:10,789 --> 01:38:17,340
think like this one this one and these

2336
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,260
are sponsored maybe but I don't really

2337
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:20,489
know like I said once they put up the

2338
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,690
descriptions will be a little clearer I

2339
01:38:20,489 --> 01:38:23,670
don't know why they're not up yet but

2340
01:38:21,689 --> 01:38:26,369
you know they're not up yet anyway so

2341
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:27,750
that's happening and it's it's going to

2342
01:38:26,369 --> 01:38:31,289
be recorded apparently so it will be

2343
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:33,659
available afterwards if you have a

2344
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:37,949
chance to come to Busan definitely come

2345
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:50,010
come say hi I will be there giving that

2346
01:38:37,949 --> 01:38:52,529
lecture how do you find the source of

2347
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:54,539
excessive memory consumption when all

2348
01:38:52,529 --> 01:38:55,979
you have to work with is a core dump as

2349
01:38:54,539 --> 01:38:57,619
a further restriction it's not feasible

2350
01:38:55,979 --> 01:39:00,000
to reproduce on your local workstation

2351
01:38:57,619 --> 01:39:01,619
because the program is an online game

2352
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,569
server and the conditions only arise

2353
01:39:01,619 --> 01:39:06,659
under certain circumstances with a lot

2354
01:39:03,569 --> 01:39:09,840
of active players well I mean don't you

2355
01:39:06,659 --> 01:39:11,909
have a memory tracking system in this

2356
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:15,650
thing I mean I wouldn't ship a game

2357
01:39:11,909 --> 01:39:15,649
server without a memory tracking system

2358
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:21,210
I'm not sure what to say other than that

2359
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:23,489
all of my systems are we even handmade

2360
01:39:21,210 --> 01:39:27,449
hero has the ability to track the memory

2361
01:39:23,489 --> 01:39:28,859
if you want to and you know we could go

2362
01:39:27,449 --> 01:39:30,630
further down that road we probably will

2363
01:39:28,859 --> 01:39:32,250
at ship time to add individual

2364
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:36,750
allocation tagging which we don't do

2365
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:38,189
right now easily could so I mean that's

2366
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:42,180
the way you that's the way you track it

2367
01:39:38,189 --> 01:39:44,579
down is you just look at for example

2368
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:46,530
let's suppose that the two ways that

2369
01:39:44,579 --> 01:39:48,359
your thing interactions memory is malloc

2370
01:39:46,529 --> 01:39:50,099
and free you know I mean I don't know

2371
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:52,229
what ways your programming interacts

2372
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:54,390
with it but you isolate those two points

2373
01:39:52,229 --> 01:39:57,000
you overload them with macros to pass

2374
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:59,610
the file and line number then on every

2375
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,300
memory allocation you do a hash lookup

2376
01:39:59,609 --> 01:40:01,828
of the

2377
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:05,489
line number and you increment or

2378
01:40:01,828 --> 01:40:07,828
decrement that line numbers total memory

2379
01:40:05,488 --> 01:40:10,259
allocation and then that way when

2380
01:40:07,828 --> 01:40:13,408
something crashes you can just have it

2381
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:14,849
dump that and you can see exactly which

2382
01:40:13,408 --> 01:40:23,009
line of your program is accounting for

2383
01:40:14,849 --> 01:40:24,510
all of the memory right so salute all

2384
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:26,369
ski do you think a networked

2385
01:40:24,510 --> 01:40:27,780
multi-threaded 3d engine is too

2386
01:40:26,368 --> 01:40:31,979
ambitious for a three months dead period

2387
01:40:27,779 --> 01:40:34,078
yes absolutely I would never try to do a

2388
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:35,609
multi-threaded 3d engine as my first

2389
01:40:34,078 --> 01:40:36,630
engine and I certainly wouldn't do one

2390
01:40:35,609 --> 01:40:38,839
if I was only going to spend three

2391
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:44,099
months multi-threading is is

2392
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:45,510
extraordinarily hard and and I don't

2393
01:40:44,099 --> 01:40:47,969
think it was something you should do on

2394
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:49,860
your first time out now that said some

2395
01:40:47,969 --> 01:40:52,289
people's idea of multi-threading is not

2396
01:40:49,859 --> 01:40:53,578
really multi-threading so if you're

2397
01:40:52,289 --> 01:40:55,439
going to do something more like a very

2398
01:40:53,578 --> 01:40:57,689
weak multi-threaded thing then maybe

2399
01:40:55,439 --> 01:41:00,779
that's fine but assuming you're actually

2400
01:40:57,689 --> 01:41:02,789
trying to get multi thread performance

2401
01:41:00,779 --> 01:41:04,349
meaning you're trying to use

2402
01:41:02,789 --> 01:41:08,219
multi-threading to actually be faster

2403
01:41:04,349 --> 01:41:10,710
than single threaded that is something

2404
01:41:08,219 --> 01:41:13,550
that is not easy to do a lot of people

2405
01:41:10,710 --> 01:41:16,109
multi thread things and getting slower

2406
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:18,690
so I certainly wouldn't recommend doing

2407
01:41:16,109 --> 01:41:19,828
that like I would recommend if you do

2408
01:41:18,689 --> 01:41:21,419
want to do multi-threading on your first

2409
01:41:19,828 --> 01:41:24,029
product it'd be more like handmade hero

2410
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:26,760
where it's single threaded for the most

2411
01:41:24,029 --> 01:41:29,219
part and it just lot launches worker

2412
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:31,380
threads that wait for workloads that are

2413
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:33,719
small and localized because that's

2414
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:38,819
something that it's not harder to think

2415
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:41,368
through that that'd be my recommendation

2416
01:41:38,819 --> 01:41:42,630
on that I really enjoy the hard jobs and

2417
01:41:41,368 --> 01:41:44,250
games but don't think I have the innate

2418
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:46,289
drive that you do do you have any advice

2419
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:50,309
or experience with other domains that

2420
01:41:46,289 --> 01:41:51,809
may be just as challenging I don't know

2421
01:41:50,309 --> 01:41:54,059
any other domains that are challenging

2422
01:41:51,809 --> 01:41:56,670
in breadth so game development has a

2423
01:41:54,059 --> 01:41:58,500
breadth challenge to it that I don't

2424
01:41:56,670 --> 01:42:00,989
know any other domains that that really

2425
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:03,710
come close because games kind of

2426
01:42:00,988 --> 01:42:06,089
intersects everything it's like

2427
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:08,340
photorealistic rendering and high

2428
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:11,849
performance optimization and servers and

2429
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:13,260
clients and real-time input processing

2430
01:42:11,849 --> 01:42:15,869
and

2431
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:17,579
game design and all that like everything

2432
01:42:15,869 --> 01:42:19,699
comes together for games everything that

2433
01:42:17,579 --> 01:42:22,140
humans know how to do is in a game right

2434
01:42:19,699 --> 01:42:24,510
so I don't know anything in breath but

2435
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:27,900
in terms of just finding hard problems

2436
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:30,060
oh I mean there's tons of things go work

2437
01:42:27,899 --> 01:42:36,269
on molecular modeling for a protein

2438
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:40,680
synthesis I mean go work on figuring out

2439
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:45,480
how to how to better synthesize x-ray

2440
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:46,320
imaging or how to do 3d visualization of

2441
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:48,479
cat-scans

2442
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:49,949
you know like there's tons of things in

2443
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:53,699
the medical field you could be doing or

2444
01:42:49,949 --> 01:42:56,119
biology you could go into security

2445
01:42:53,699 --> 01:42:59,909
research right like how do how do we

2446
01:42:56,119 --> 01:43:02,010
secure the power grid how do we prevent

2447
01:42:59,909 --> 01:43:03,539
cyber warfare things how do we harden

2448
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:05,520
routers like all of these sorts of

2449
01:43:03,539 --> 01:43:07,019
things you go into operating system

2450
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,970
development right hard real-time

2451
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:11,310
operating systems tons of stuff to work

2452
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:13,409
on there there's so many fields that

2453
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:15,200
have hard problems in them so you can

2454
01:43:13,409 --> 01:43:20,399
easily find other hard problems

2455
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:22,559
in programming and and game development

2456
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:24,389
is is unique I think more not because it

2457
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:26,520
has our problems there Harper's Eric

2458
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:27,690
it's the breath it's the breath of the

2459
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,950
problems that's interesting game

2460
01:43:27,689 --> 01:43:34,409
development that's what really sets it

2461
01:43:28,949 --> 01:43:36,539
apart you know you know not the depth I

2462
01:43:34,409 --> 01:43:38,849
think I think every programming

2463
01:43:36,539 --> 01:43:42,319
discipline has the depth it's the breath

2464
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:42,320
that's different about game development

2465
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:56,920
there's anything else on here

2466
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:02,579
fubar count been programming for about

2467
01:44:00,779 --> 01:44:04,469
six years hobbyist and currently

2468
01:44:02,579 --> 01:44:06,988
university always struggled to push a

2469
01:44:04,469 --> 01:44:08,908
game project to completion do you have

2470
01:44:06,988 --> 01:44:14,009
any advice on how to see any product to

2471
01:44:08,908 --> 01:44:15,750
its end no I'm bad at that I just like

2472
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:17,579
working on technology so I'm not really

2473
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:19,500
good at pushing game projects to

2474
01:44:17,579 --> 01:44:21,238
completion pushing tech projects of

2475
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:22,920
completion I might have better advice

2476
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:25,678
for game products I don't

2477
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,090
I would ask John blow I would really

2478
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,300
seriously try to like get on his dream

2479
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:33,600
and ask John blow because he is someone

2480
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:36,449
who has both had trouble pushing game

2481
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,800
projects to completion and not had

2482
01:44:36,448 --> 01:44:40,259
trouble pushing game projects to

2483
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:42,449
completion and I think he would be the

2484
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:44,820
perfect person to talk about that

2485
01:44:42,448 --> 01:44:47,729
difference and the things you can do to

2486
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:50,359
try to get over that difference as fast

2487
01:44:47,729 --> 01:44:50,359
as possible

2488
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:59,929
and and I don't have the necessary

2489
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:59,929
experience to offer advice you know

2490
01:45:31,128 --> 01:45:34,578
kind of go haphazard through these

2491
01:45:32,628 --> 01:45:37,010
questions here I don't guarantee that

2492
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:39,078
I'm going to answer all of these are you

2493
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:40,789
into isometrics how would you approach

2494
01:45:39,078 --> 01:45:44,828
creating game in isometrics that using

2495
01:45:40,788 --> 01:45:48,618
3d well isometrics are a lot easier

2496
01:45:44,828 --> 01:45:52,429
because there's everything has a

2497
01:45:48,618 --> 01:45:54,318
universal sort order so you can usually

2498
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:56,929
just draw up front to back and be done

2499
01:45:54,319 --> 01:46:01,699
with isometrics because there's no

2500
01:45:56,929 --> 01:46:06,668
perspective happening there so I think

2501
01:46:01,698 --> 01:46:06,668
that you probably okay but maybe not I

2502
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:11,298
guess now that I say that I it's not

2503
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:16,929
really true like I don't know if you

2504
01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:16,929
read Andrew Russell's post about this

2505
01:46:19,519 --> 01:46:24,619
I always spell his name wrong I'm sorry

2506
01:46:21,738 --> 01:46:27,218
Andrew yeah we spell it more like

2507
01:46:24,618 --> 01:46:31,188
Russell I think the first name but um

2508
01:46:27,219 --> 01:46:35,679
this is kind of a good post about how

2509
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:35,679
it's not actually that easy isometrics

2510
01:46:36,038 --> 01:46:45,128
this is kind of an interesting way to

2511
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:48,889
talk about how excuse another one right

2512
01:46:45,128 --> 01:46:50,298
I might refer you to that because I

2513
01:46:48,889 --> 01:46:52,958
guess I guess now think about snot it's

2514
01:46:50,298 --> 01:46:52,958
not really that straightforward

2515
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,170
this year at a big database conference

2516
01:47:02,789 --> 01:47:05,908
there were two papers about avoiding the

2517
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:07,408
penalties of cache misses by prefetching

2518
01:47:05,908 --> 01:47:09,689
and then using KO routine to do work

2519
01:47:07,408 --> 01:47:13,519
while the cache is being fetched do you

2520
01:47:09,689 --> 01:47:13,519
see any applications for this in games

2521
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:40,149
it sounds a little weird

2522
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:51,369
I mean it's not the weirdest idea so

2523
01:47:48,369 --> 01:47:53,619
first of all a cache miss is not that

2524
01:47:51,369 --> 01:47:56,019
expensive right so a cache miss is going

2525
01:47:53,619 --> 01:48:01,930
to be like what like 300 cycles 400

2526
01:47:56,020 --> 01:48:03,550
cycles usually in game development we're

2527
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:05,680
pretty good when we start getting down

2528
01:48:03,550 --> 01:48:07,570
to that part of the project of figuring

2529
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:09,789
out how to interleave things we want to

2530
01:48:07,569 --> 01:48:12,639
do so that we always have something we

2531
01:48:09,789 --> 01:48:18,310
can do math on while we're fetching you

2532
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:21,730
know so like do I think I would want an

2533
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:24,789
entire system for doing a KO routine in

2534
01:48:21,729 --> 01:48:27,189
a 300 cycle window especially given that

2535
01:48:24,789 --> 01:48:29,229
hyper threading does that automatically

2536
01:48:27,189 --> 01:48:32,529
so if I just have two threads that are

2537
01:48:29,229 --> 01:48:36,489
doing stuff for my game on the same core

2538
01:48:32,529 --> 01:48:40,029
when I hit the 300 millisecond bubble

2539
01:48:36,489 --> 01:48:41,500
the other thread will take over I mean

2540
01:48:40,029 --> 01:48:43,389
that's not literally what happens but

2541
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:48,789
the other thread is issue it can issue

2542
01:48:43,390 --> 01:48:52,630
instructions into the AL use into the

2543
01:48:48,789 --> 01:48:54,609
execution ports right it doesn't sound

2544
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:58,480
that useful but you know I haven't read

2545
01:48:54,609 --> 01:49:00,789
the papers it sounds like something

2546
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:02,679
we've already kind of know how to work

2547
01:49:00,789 --> 01:49:08,560
around or are usually good enough at

2548
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:10,000
doing that I can't say it excites me

2549
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,650
like I'm not itching to go read that

2550
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,539
paper it doesn't sound like one that's

2551
01:49:11,649 --> 01:49:15,609
gonna be high in my list I guess I'd say

2552
01:49:13,539 --> 01:49:16,420
but you know until I actually read it

2553
01:49:15,609 --> 01:49:18,569
I'm not gonna

2554
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:21,010
I won't dismiss it because you know

2555
01:49:18,569 --> 01:49:26,039
maybe it's more maybe there's more to it

2556
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:26,039
there you know so

2557
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:33,840
and he's good at six weeks I know I will

2558
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:35,520
be posting a schedule when I get back

2559
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:38,010
from do song is uh I'll be in South

2560
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,320
Korea for a week so until I get back I'm

2561
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:47,460
not gonna post schedule and I won't be

2562
01:49:40,319 --> 01:49:48,719
streaming from there do you think John's

2563
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:50,159
language will make game program easier

2564
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:51,810
in a significant way as opposed to just

2565
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:57,269
the million list of annoyances yeah I

2566
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:59,880
mean hardly say I haven't looked at it

2567
01:49:57,270 --> 01:50:04,110
in depth but the meta programming

2568
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:07,409
features that are in it are far so much

2569
01:50:04,109 --> 01:50:10,109
better than the ones in C++ that you

2570
01:50:07,409 --> 01:50:14,309
could really dramatically improve your

2571
01:50:10,109 --> 01:50:16,319
programming by using them it is not as

2572
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:17,580
simple as eliminating an annoyance now

2573
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,049
how good those meta program features

2574
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:21,300
actually are in practice at the end of

2575
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:23,310
the day I don't know until I actually a

2576
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:27,960
chance to play with them

2577
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:30,260
boy I I mean the difference between C++

2578
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:35,480
and jii in terms of the ability to like

2579
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:37,579
really leverage code is going to be I

2580
01:50:35,479 --> 01:50:40,709
mean it's not even gonna be close

2581
01:50:37,579 --> 01:50:42,930
you know C++ offers no meaningful meta

2582
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:44,130
programming at all it's it's almost

2583
01:50:42,930 --> 01:50:50,630
completely useless for meta programming

2584
01:50:44,130 --> 01:50:53,869
so you know that's gonna be a pretty

2585
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:53,869
pretty huge

2586
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:10,770
chris fehn a bit about AZ do um I mean I

2587
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,210
can explain a little bit about it but

2588
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:13,620
I'm not sure what I'm gonna say that's

2589
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:17,189
not gonna be the same as what you know

2590
01:51:13,619 --> 01:51:21,449
if you just read just go read it like an

2591
01:51:17,189 --> 01:51:24,689
nvidia tutorial or something but the

2592
01:51:21,449 --> 01:51:26,789
idea a CD o stands for approaching zero

2593
01:51:24,689 --> 01:51:29,250
driver overhead for those of you who

2594
01:51:26,789 --> 01:51:30,449
don't know and I'm sorry if I've got one

2595
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:32,039
of those terms wrong I apologize the

2596
01:51:30,449 --> 01:51:41,960
acronyms fly all over the place in this

2597
01:51:32,039 --> 01:51:44,819
industry but AZ do is is basically

2598
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:48,239
acknowledging the fact that a modern 3d

2599
01:51:44,819 --> 01:51:51,539
graphics card like an Nvidia 1080 like

2600
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:53,639
the one in this machine is a processor

2601
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:55,560
in its own right I mean it could run a

2602
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:58,500
whole game over there right like it's

2603
01:51:55,560 --> 01:52:00,539
it's not made for that so there's a

2604
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:02,159
bunch of things it does inefficiently if

2605
01:52:00,539 --> 01:52:04,500
you were to try and run an entire game

2606
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:08,099
over there but it's a full processor

2607
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:10,949
right and so the extent to which it

2608
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:14,910
needs the main processor to hand hold

2609
01:52:10,949 --> 01:52:17,429
its execution is pretty minimal so what

2610
01:52:14,909 --> 01:52:24,269
a video attempts to do is say look if we

2611
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:25,560
just prepare buffers in memory so when

2612
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:27,510
we're in the game we just prepare

2613
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:31,320
buffers that are formatted appropriate

2614
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:33,659
for the cards consumption we should be

2615
01:52:31,319 --> 01:52:36,389
able to have the driver do almost

2616
01:52:33,659 --> 01:52:39,210
nothing it should be able to just kind

2617
01:52:36,390 --> 01:52:43,380
of you know knock on the cards door and

2618
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:47,250
say hey I've got a new set of data and

2619
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:50,069
code for you to execute do it and that's

2620
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:52,649
it so rather than the driver sitting

2621
01:52:50,069 --> 01:52:54,929
there like manhandling when the GPU is

2622
01:52:52,649 --> 01:52:56,460
gonna do this and do that and checking

2623
01:52:54,930 --> 01:52:58,800
for states and changing the states and

2624
01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:01,680
recompile shaders ad do is just about

2625
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:04,619
saying look let's just prepare actually

2626
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:06,329
correct execution buffers for the GPU

2627
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:09,210
that have all the stuff in them it needs

2628
01:53:06,329 --> 01:53:10,590
that it can just read and then what

2629
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:14,408
we're going to do is just tell the GPU

2630
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:17,710
read it go and so the driver becomes

2631
01:53:14,408 --> 01:53:20,908
much less involved and frees up a bunch

2632
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:24,789
of CPU time for you to use for your game

2633
01:53:20,908 --> 01:53:27,779
that's all it is really you know Devils

2634
01:53:24,789 --> 01:53:27,779
in the details but that's the concept

2635
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:47,219
I think that's all the questions

2636
01:54:01,368 --> 01:54:06,789
all right I'm gonna close it down here

2637
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:10,570
you
