00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,770
start groaning hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,099
welcome to handmade Hero the show where

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:10,500
we code a complete game live on stream

4
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:12,990
we are doing some animation coding

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,809
basically showing how to do some some

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,469
handmade animation code and it's really

7
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:21,089
good you know learning to do handmade

8
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,969
animation code is really a pretty good

9
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:26,189
idea to do before you ever implement a

10
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,778
general animation system like loading

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,129
and playing back animations is a fine

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,359
thing to do and you typically want to do

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,039
it if you're on a team that's got a

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,539
bunch of artists who have tools they can

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,119
use to make animations you obviously

16
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,909
want that but it's always a good idea to

17
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,468
first cut your teeth on some hand coded

18
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,578
animation and the reason for that is

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,129
because it will get you familiar with

20
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,500
the concepts and how to do sort of the

21
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,899
sets of things you might want to do in

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,390
animation code and it allows you to make

23
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,039
much more dynamic stuff and so then in

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,390
the future when you do use an animation

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,309
system or however you're doing it where

26
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,320
they're externally authored you can

27
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:00,448
still jump in and times when it's it's

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,340
the right thing to do to have something

29
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,500
procedural kick in you're not like I

30
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,090
don't know what to do right so it's kind

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
of nice it's a good thing I think that

32
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,060
most programmers should know how to do

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,978
now like I said we're kind of right in

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,200
the middle of it today's day 275 so if

35
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,629
you want to follow along day 274 our

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,100
source code is the one that you want to

37
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:24,899
work with I'm gonna load up for coder

38
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:33,030
here and and made Raj let's go get this

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:35,939
going on and run it all right

40
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,890
so essentially what I was working on was

41
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,109
I was making this sort of code here

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,359
where I could I could make the dude hop

43
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,640
along and we're sort of getting to a

44
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:46,438
nice place on it but we have a big to-do

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,739
left which as you can obviously see at

46
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,328
the moment the the head we just worked

47
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,640
on the body animation and we let the

48
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,109
head go wherever it wants now that would

49
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,359
be fine if this was some kind of ghost

50
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,789
child and you know the head of the child

51
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,500
is supposed to be able to float around

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,329
just like a separate thing but that is

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,560
not at all what the game is the game is

54
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:10,500
actually supposed to have a child who's

55
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,530
head is attached to his body so we need

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,199
to

57
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:20,560
figure out you know some way of of

58
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:23,199
starting to make the body part stretch

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,960
up towards the head so even when it's a

60
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,250
bit far away it can sort of reach you

61
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,409
know what I mean

62
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,020
and so how exactly we're gonna do that

63
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:33,759
I'm not sure because obviously there are

64
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,980
some considerations with how it's going

65
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,509
to look but we don't have a whole lot of

66
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:39,280
options one of the things that you have

67
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:40,629
to remember about games in general and

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,479
it's kind of just unfortunate but it's

69
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,669
the truth is that responsiveness is very

70
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,319
important and so when you're coding the

71
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:49,089
interface you know you're gonna code if

72
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,530
you're a responsible game developer

73
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,420
you're gonna code it so it feels good

74
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:57,969
right and you're not going to sacrifice

75
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:00,250
that feel just so the animation looks

76
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:02,919
better because that's just a bad idea

77
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,719
now if you want to know what that feels

78
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,509
like go back to the very original say

79
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,699
Prince of Persia or Cara TECA

80
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:12,159
for example the original Jordan Mechner

81
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,169
games there those were examples of games

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,370
that decided to just let animation

83
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,679
determine entirely what was going to

84
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,439
happen and the controls feel absolutely

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,569
100% awful as a result you basically

86
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,579
like you know you hit jump and your guy

87
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,229
like runs for a while and then jumps

88
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,880
because that's what the animation did or

89
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,399
whatever right and it just feels awful

90
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,199
to play and so that's the kind of thing

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,689
you want to steer clear of in my opinion

92
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,819
when you're programming the game you

93
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:40,629
want to do the opposite you want to let

94
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:42,819
the design or the designer make whatever

95
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,620
is what to feel good and then you do

96
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,709
whatever you can to make the animations

97
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,629
not look bad as a result but you don't

98
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,269
ever go well this animation kind of look

99
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,340
bad because of this you know the player

100
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,650
could turn too quickly so I'm gonna like

101
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,780
force them to turn more slowly

102
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,239
that's just rarely a good idea at least

103
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,180
the games that feel sluggish and the

104
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,860
controls don't feel responsive or so you

105
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,090
know if your designer tells you to do

106
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,730
that that's one thing but as a

107
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,049
programmer if your responsibility to not

108
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:12,310
get in the way of the design like that

109
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,469
so figure out how to write your

110
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,168
animation systems so that they respond

111
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:18,819
to what the player must do not so that

112
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:19,930
they force the player to do things that

113
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,788
they didn't want to do in the first

114
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,000
place I feel pretty strongly about that

115
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:27,459
and I think most players probably do too

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,139
so that's what we're gonna do here we're

117
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:30,519
gonna go ahead and say well you know if

118
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,680
it looks kind of weird and stretchy

119
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,139
that's okay we'll just say that's part

120
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,900
of the style and we're not gonna try and

121
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:40,349
fix that by forcing the head to not move

122
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:43,689
too far or anything like that all right

123
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,160
so as this hops along what I'm gonna try

124
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:46,509
to do first well there's a couple things

125
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,920
I want you first I want to do a little

126
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:49,480
bit of cleanup first and maybe I don't

127
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,770
know if we'll get to the body stretching

128
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,650
thing today that's our next major to do

129
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:56,529
but I've got some smaller - duze mm-hmm

130
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:57,669
that I need to work on as well and one

131
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,129
of the big to-do is that I need to work

132
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,840
on is already the head doesn't I'm sorry

133
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,600
it's not only big to use one of the

134
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,279
primary minor things is it feels a

135
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,810
little bit I don't like the feel right

136
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:09,789
now and the reason for that is that

137
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,120
spring that we added on that brings you

138
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,660
back to the body that spring should not

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,389
be springing to where the body is it

140
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,010
should be springing well two things

141
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,189
first of all it should be only springing

142
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,269
if I'm not using if I'm not actively

143
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,790
trying to move in direction obviously

144
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:30,459
which i think is okay at the moment like

145
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,520
I think that's we turn that off but when

146
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:36,339
I do let go I don't want it to suck back

147
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,319
towards the body I want it to suck to

148
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:41,259
wherever the body's gonna end up right

149
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,899
so I essentially want the head just like

150
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,300
to snap to a point whatever the closest

151
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,439
point is to the head regardless of

152
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,240
whether the body's gotten there yet

153
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:54,129
right so all I'm really gonna do there

154
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,418
and don't ask me why I closed the

155
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,069
program I always close the program for

156
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:59,049
no reason that's just what I do

157
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:03,069
apparently let's launch that back up

158
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,689
again all I'm gonna do here at first for

159
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,610
that is I'm gonna go into world mode

160
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:12,639
where we're doing that sort of closest

161
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:15,060
point thing and I'm going to take the C

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,060
here oops

163
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:25,300
and I should be over here what I'm gonna

164
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,779
do is I'm gonna go into this code for

165
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,538
the hero head and I'm gonna pull out the

166
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,579
code that I was using for the hero body

167
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:37,839
so that I can search for the closest

168
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:39,459
point in both cases right and this is

169
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,818
actually an important step for the code

170
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:44,348
anyway because eventually we're gonna

171
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,598
want you know we don't really want to do

172
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:47,829
all of these tests we want a spatial

173
00:06:46,598 --> 00:06:50,319
query you know we've got to do right

174
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:51,219
here for it so it's true in general that

175
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,479
I'm going to want to be able to issue

176
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,280
some of these spatial queries and

177
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,750
accelerate them so I'd like to get in

178
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,939
the habit of calling a function do that

179
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,319
anyway because that function is gonna

180
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,209
get a lot more complicated and I want

181
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,620
lots of people to have access to however

182
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:07,508
it's going to work all right so I'm just

183
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:13,030
gonna pull that out here into a little

184
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:15,699
thing that you know Jimmy that goes

185
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:19,649
through and does its thang something

186
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:22,569
probably like this sort of a thing

187
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,848
because I'm just computing well I guess

188
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:26,129
I really only need the closest p-part so

189
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:29,379
I'm going to take this out I'm gonna

190
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:33,000
drop this here and I'm gonna say all

191
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:37,560
right internal void get closest

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:44,168
traversable and that's gonna go ahead

193
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:47,199
and that's going to go ahead and say

194
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:51,399
well from whatever point I'm starting

195
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,800
with and we'll just assume that that's

196
00:07:51,399 --> 00:08:00,279
gonna replace the entity point that we

197
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:05,530
were using before well I guess we should

198
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:07,598
say really frumpy and default P might be

199
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:09,309
the better way to do it something like

200
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:14,649
that probably although the other way I

201
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:16,569
could do it is like this maybe we we

202
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:19,269
have a pool that says whether or not we

203
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:22,210
found one and then we write the result

204
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:25,448
if we did so we'll basically say like

205
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:27,638
found equals false and in here we would

206
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,720
say like found equals true because we

207
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,299
got one

208
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,680
and then we'd write closest P to result

209
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,839
although really I guess I can just sort

210
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:44,609
of say well get rid of this and just say

211
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:46,899
that this is result equals that like so

212
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,009
so what comes out of here I don't know

213
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,870
if I need a struct though because I

214
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:52,569
don't know whether I used closest

215
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,889
distance it looks like I didn't but you

216
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,120
know we probably will need to augment

217
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:56,559
this function as we go further because

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,879
people are plugging a lot more when we

219
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,369
do these facial queries plugin I have to

220
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,559
provide more information than what we're

221
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,940
giving here but you know I rather than

222
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,019
be premature about it I'll just let that

223
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,090
happen when it happens

224
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,169
obviously I need the sim region here

225
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,970
because that's the thing that we're

226
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:11,289
looping over and that'll be the thing

227
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,680
that eventually has a spatial query

228
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:17,169
inside of it we've got the from P which

229
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,909
is what we're actually testing so in

230
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:21,849
here instead of head P we're talking

231
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:23,439
about from P and I think that's roughly

232
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,420
everything there is to it

233
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,010
so I'm gonna then go ahead and change

234
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:32,110
the hero head code in here to use that

235
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,899
well I I guess I should do the body one

236
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,149
first obviously so I'm gonna say here

237
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,500
that we've got that closest P and the

238
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,899
closest P is going to be like get

239
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,980
closest reversible and it's going to

240
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:47,649
take the region and it's going to be the

241
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:55,000
closest thing to the head and this is

242
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:56,799
going to be oh I guess should do it like

243
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,929
that and so it's gonna move over right

244
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,339
closest P if it finds anything and I

245
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:01,809
also get a blue back that tells me if I

246
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,700
did find it but I don't actually need to

247
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:07,029
know that in this particular piece of

248
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,650
code at the moment right so then what

249
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm gonna do is gonna say okay there's a

250
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:15,639
closest traversable in here as well

251
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,159
right so when i go to call when I go

252
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,569
step into the hero head code I want to

253
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:24,339
know that as well and you can see in

254
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:26,410
here that when I go to do this

255
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,970
simulation currently what I'm doing is

256
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,169
I'm looking for the body and I'm

257
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,639
snapping to the body but I don't

258
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:33,009
actually need to do that right now

259
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,019
anymore what I can do instead is say

260
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:37,120
like hey let's take a look to see

261
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:41,299
whether we got one of these traversable

262
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,250
x' like so and assume

263
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:45,500
that I did then instead of using the

264
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,759
body we'll just we'll just use that so

265
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,809
I'm not going to use the body you pee

266
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:53,899
anymore I'm going to use the closest fee

267
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:56,239
and the only thing I'm gonna do since I

268
00:10:53,899 --> 00:11:01,429
don't want to adjust the Z is I'm gonna

269
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,039
say that let's let's not match in fact I

270
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:11,569
guess I

271
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:12,708
hmm nope nope nope nope nope I'm gonna

272
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,959
do it I'm just gonna keep I'm gonna do

273
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:18,349
the Z as well so I'm just gonna entirely

274
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,639
replace the head P with the closest P

275
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,120
and that's it

276
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:26,028
or sorry the body P that's closest B and

277
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,959
that's everything and then a memory

278
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:31,399
button so a head is not relevant here

279
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:41,778
we're actually looking for the closest

280
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:48,500
thing to us because we are the head and

281
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:50,240
so that's much nicer now yeah so the

282
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,610
other thing I want to do too is I don't

283
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,399
really want the facing direction at the

284
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,259
moment is based on the movement and I

285
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,578
don't like that at all the facing

286
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,409
direction should be based on the last

287
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:02,120
direction I push because you can see

288
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,850
what's happening here if I overshoot and

289
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,129
come back the head because it faces in

290
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,320
the direction it goes flips but I don't

291
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:12,278
want it to flip I just want it to use

292
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,450
whatever the last direction I pushed was

293
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,950
and so I'm going to take a look at where

294
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,140
that face Russia said I think it's set

295
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,980
and move entity and that's just stupid

296
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,980
and I don't want it

297
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,470
my head appears to be blocking this but

298
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,629
I'll just zoom down a little so leave

299
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,100
facing direction whatever it was or face

300
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:35,830
direction you'll is a tan - so these are

301
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,089
just not I don't want this right I don't

302
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:44,790
want this at all so really really I'm

303
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:44,790
just gonna say this code gets nerfed out

304
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,009
and probably what I want to do is I want

305
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:53,080
that to be based on what direction you

306
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:57,009
were pushing with the controller and so

307
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,320
since the DDP code here the con hero DDP

308
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,470
is really the code that I'm looking for

309
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,129
then setting the head at least I guess

310
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:14,920
we can do this right we can say like

311
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:16,480
let's take that DDP and use that so

312
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:20,620
that's like what direction I was trying

313
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,259
to accelerate in and that's that's

314
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,970
almost sure they're gonna be better yeah

315
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:27,309
cuz that's what I want I just wanted to

316
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:32,709
kind of slide back I don't want it to

317
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:34,059
turn or anything like that and the other

318
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,708
thing I want is I probably want that to

319
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:38,379
be pretty quick so right now it's not

320
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:42,609
particularly tight the spring is like

321
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:47,080
relatively weak also we don't need that

322
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:50,339
good anymore so I think I want this to

323
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,339
be a little bit beefier

324
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:19,050
and so yeah like I guess the only thing

325
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:20,340
that feels odd to me about it now I mean

326
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,750
other than the fact that we need to fix

327
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,820
up the fact that the head in the body

328
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,740
are totally except to segregated the

329
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,660
only thing that feels particularly weird

330
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:33,149
about it now

331
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:35,610
is that when I move if I'm off-center

332
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:40,230
and I stop it feels good like that feels

333
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:43,769
fine like that actually feels totally

334
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,180
fine you know what I actually want to do

335
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:46,379
too you know what I'm gonna talk about

336
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:49,139
that in one second that let me let me

337
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,659
let me do one more thing I actually want

338
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,179
to be able to hop straight hop and so

339
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,829
you know the sword stuff is not what I

340
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:57,479
ever wanted really that was we were just

341
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,070
playing with that that has nothing to do

342
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,320
with the game design we were just doing

343
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,210
some stuff so I'm gonna get rid of that

344
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,710
and it's really the distorted stuff

345
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,540
that's what would I would want the

346
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:08,910
determine the facing direction it's the

347
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,019
last direction I attacked in is actually

348
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:16,429
what I would want

349
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:21,529
so really it's like con hero D sword or

350
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:23,939
yet D sword he's actually what I want

351
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,139
and so I think putting that in just

352
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,880
temporarily even though we're not

353
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,769
dealing with attacks or anything at the

354
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,309
moment I wanted to see what that feels

355
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:34,379
like because that's more that informs my

356
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:37,169
decisions a lot better if I could

357
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:38,759
actually see the hopping using that

358
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,019
methodology and of course I close the

359
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,299
program why they close from I have no

360
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,549
idea

361
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,019
force of habit so this is actually what

362
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,819
it will look like so I'll be like

363
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:49,319
strafing around like this and then maybe

364
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,510
I will like start attacking something

365
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,250
below me and I'll go like this right and

366
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:55,649
then I'll attack something here or here

367
00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:01,799
and so this is actually what that would

368
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:04,649
be like so okay so stopping on to a

369
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,329
square feels fine to me now because once

370
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,610
I let go I don't really care so much

371
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,379
about what happens it's like it's like

372
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,810
it's like the you know what on an analog

373
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:15,389
stick you know I'm fine with it sucking

374
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:17,219
back to the center right but what I

375
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:20,399
don't like what does not feel good to me

376
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,190
is as I'm hopping along if I'm right in

377
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,110
a row it feels fine

378
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,600
if I'm below the row the fact that it

379
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,279
sucks me up like that feels weird so

380
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,560
like when I'm hopping this way and then

381
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:33,169
I go up that re-centering

382
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:36,139
doesn't feel great and so I wonder if

383
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:38,750
maybe I just shouldn't do that maybe I

384
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:41,689
should say that when we do the the sort

385
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,980
of spring back to the center maybe I was

386
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,020
premature and I said we don't need that

387
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,210
code let's delete it maybe I really want

388
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:52,189
to make sure that all of the things are

389
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:53,389
in fact zero look I'm not

390
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,280
I only want to spring back when I'm not

391
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:58,159
pushing anywhere so if I was to do that

392
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:03,220
I would just say like what's the length

393
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:06,170
of the DDP so let's do should apply

394
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,029
equals length EDP less than dope one so

395
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:11,029
basically if I don't have any

396
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:15,129
application then I'll just do should

397
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:15,129
apply here

398
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:29,389
and that definitely feels better so even

399
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:30,680
though it's kind of wonky and it means

400
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:38,030
that you don't really go into the

401
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:41,090
channel I guess what I could do is make

402
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:43,190
the spring stiffness based on that so

403
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:49,579
what I could do potentially is say well

404
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:52,190
okay so I'll keep this code here which

405
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:54,579
is to say this is the code to tell me

406
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,230
whether I want to apply anything at all

407
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:59,960
but this is the code which says what the

408
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:03,860
factor is so really this is an r32

409
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,259
that's like my my coefficient for on the

410
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:08,629
position of the spring and what I'll say

411
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,819
is like okay if if you're not pushing it

412
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:15,560
all then it's the super stiff spring if

413
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:17,990
you're not if you're if you are pushing

414
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,669
in some direction but not in the

415
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,380
direction of correction at this

416
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,570
particular point like for whatever acts

417
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,780
we're talking about then we will use a

418
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:28,250
weak force to gently guide you back but

419
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:32,799
in a way that's hopefully so subtle you

420
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:35,059
won't know or won't be bothered by it

421
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,289
right so then it's kind of like just

422
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,039
feels a little bit more debt like

423
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:43,089
diagonal you know what I mean

424
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,089
to kind of catch you back in there

425
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:48,210
and I don't know how I feel about that

426
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,750
still doesn't feel great I think the

427
00:19:05,308 --> 00:19:15,058
best feeling thing is just not to do it

428
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:17,339
I don't know it might just be that it's

429
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:26,658
only it only should happen when you when

430
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:34,259
you land yeah I don't know easily to any

431
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:39,778
push equals this and I guess really it's

432
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:41,940
just like hey yeah that's not so much we

433
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:47,220
can always change back but it does kind

434
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:50,120
of seem like does kind of seem like it

435
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,120
wants to be free floating

436
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,430
I'm gonna leave it like that it's

437
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:23,470
obviously a decision that we can make

438
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:26,170
later on when we play the game and see

439
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,089
how it feels because again it's not

440
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,160
gonna make a huge difference in terms of

441
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:33,250
any other sort of design thing but it's

442
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,590
just like hey you know you gotta tune

443
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,109
the game so that it feels good to you I

444
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:42,159
mean you know whoever the person who's

445
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:45,069
responsible for it has to tune it and so

446
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,420
I think in this case it just feels

447
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:47,649
better when I don't do that

448
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,320
so I think that's what I'm gonna stick

449
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,540
with for now and because that's starting

450
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,669
to feel much better yeah so even though

451
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,230
it'll kind of be like a little weird I

452
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,779
think that's just what we want to do

453
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,730
because in general like any game where

454
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:02,619
you have a grid-based thing that people

455
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,779
have to work with there's a number of

456
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:06,699
you know I mean the best possible thing

457
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:09,069
for clarity is always if the person is

458
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,380
just directly on the grid but the bottom

459
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:13,599
line is it just doesn't feel good in a

460
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,560
game to lock a person to a grid like

461
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,730
that usually especially not in an action

462
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,369
game and so you kind of have to be

463
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,720
careful about what you do and so I just

464
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:24,699
want to make sure that we don't

465
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,350
compromise the feel of moving the

466
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,569
character for the grid so the grid is

467
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:31,000
supposed to be something that sort of

468
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:32,259
like happens but that's why there's the

469
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,849
body and the head as separate pieces

470
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,859
it's because I want to make sure that

471
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:37,959
that works and that's something we can

472
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:40,719
do so that's starting to feel pretty

473
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,789
good there so let's I guess let's go

474
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,950
ahead and start tackling that last part

475
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:47,079
which is just making the the two things

476
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,490
connect and then once we've got that

477
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,379
going I think we're kind of at the point

478
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,029
where I think we want to go revisit the

479
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,170
renderer a little bit and tidy up all of

480
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:56,500
our stuff so that everything's sorting

481
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:59,170
properly probably fix the hero bitmaps a

482
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:03,069
little bit and and just do the assorted

483
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,509
kind of assorted little to do's that are

484
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,549
stopping us from having a correct

485
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:07,690
looking character like the fact that

486
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:09,039
those are sorting in the opposite order

487
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,390
and stuff like that so we want to have

488
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,049
to fix all of those and make sure that

489
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:17,009
those are correct so in this scenario

490
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:19,990
what I need to do is I need to start by

491
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,789
exposing some of the capabilities of our

492
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,410
renderer because one of the things our

493
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:25,240
renderer can do is our renderer can

494
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,300
scale things our render can shear things

495
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,920
and our renderer can rotate things but

496
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,659
since we have done literally no

497
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,470
rendering of that name

498
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,330
sure we don't have any way to actually

499
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,150
specify that as part of like when we

500
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:43,359
specify a bitmap so what I need to do is

501
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,250
open up the code in the renderer so that

502
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,569
I can actually send it the ability that

503
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,579
you know I can actually send it

504
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:52,980
information about the fact that we need

505
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:55,689
our our body to to scale or you know

506
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,500
stuff like that right I need I need to

507
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:08,230
sort of have have that work so how am I

508
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:13,480
gonna do that let's take a look here we

509
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:15,130
go to handmade render group and you can

510
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,559
see that in handmade render group we've

511
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:20,230
got like a render entry rectangle and

512
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:23,409
that's got you know the ability to scale

513
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,720
I guess but no rotation and no sharing

514
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,680
so there's no axis Pesa fied there's

515
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,690
just the dimension and so what i would

516
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,259
like to do is have some way of

517
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,840
specifying additional information and

518
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:42,400
probably i want there to be a whoops

519
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,750
and then probably search for bitmaps so

520
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,820
I probably want another type of render

521
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:49,950
entry that's like render entry like

522
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:53,109
flexible bitmap or something like that

523
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:55,720
and in addition to the color the P and

524
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:59,529
the size instead of specifying size as

525
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,509
to just to like sort of distances what

526
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:03,309
I'll do instead is specify the x axis

527
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:09,579
and the y axis and those will come out

528
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:12,909
of the point P right and so in order to

529
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:15,460
do this I need to add the ability in the

530
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,200
renderer to do a push bitmap call that

531
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,590
actually has this information associated

532
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,600
with it now I could make it so that we

533
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:24,009
always specify this but I feel like it's

534
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,509
probably a good idea to keep this in

535
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,819
case we ever want to increase the

536
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:32,529
rendering throughput of stuff that

537
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:36,700
doesn't have to be rotated we might want

538
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:39,250
to do that now obviously well you know

539
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,200
what honestly that's probably not all

540
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,950
that necessary because it's easy to test

541
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,259
if the X and the y-axis yeah it's easy

542
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,049
it's

543
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:49,759
the X and y-axis and jump so I feel like

544
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,779
probably actually what we can do is just

545
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,670
change this I feel like we can just go

546
00:24:53,779 --> 00:25:02,899
with a single one hey how many times I'm

547
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:05,450
gonna do that hey it's like a pair of

548
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:10,100
zircon encrusted tweezers let's go ahead

549
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,960
and just do the corrections necessary to

550
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:13,459
make this work not changing anything

551
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,900
just gonna render the exact same stuff

552
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,610
but I'm gonna now instead of just

553
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,610
encoding a size I'm going to encode that

554
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:20,629
that directionality as well all right so

555
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:21,919
I'm going to start with the OpenGL

556
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,510
renderer because that happens to be what

557
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,470
we're using and then we'll switch over

558
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:26,839
the software in or make sure that

559
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,279
handles the two because we might as well

560
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,859
keep both working it'll be pretty

561
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:32,899
trivial to do so since our software

562
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:34,669
rasterizer does already handle this case

563
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,470
so it's not like it's something we got

564
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,830
to go right rendering code it's just a

565
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,299
case of setting it up properly so here's

566
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:42,679
the way that we were rendering something

567
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:43,849
and you can see us calling OpenGL

568
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,110
rectangle and that's not really gonna

569
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,969
come to any more because OpenGL

570
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:50,479
rectangle is something that draws

571
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:52,610
something rectilinear right and you can

572
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,099
see that happening here so what we need

573
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:58,339
to do is we need to actually have this

574
00:25:55,099 --> 00:26:00,379
this little fellow here do a more

575
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:02,149
explicit thing where it's not going to

576
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,730
be rectilinear like that so I'll drop

577
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:07,730
this in here for starters and then we're

578
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,349
gonna change how it works so menu v-max

579
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,420
would be obviously will just flow

580
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:13,459
through properly and then we've got the

581
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,840
max P and the min P and those are here

582
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,360
and those will flow through properly so

583
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,369
if I were to do nothing else right if I

584
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,889
wasn't if I was to do absolutely zero

585
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:25,369
out here then you know what I can also

586
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:27,110
do here I can do this there's a you can

587
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:31,250
point to it you can pass a pointer to a

588
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:33,169
color and have it loaded soon so if I

589
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:36,079
was to just do this I could delete the

590
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,610
OpenGL rectangle call I believe and be

591
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,299
fine so I'm gonna double check that

592
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:43,549
that's true and then we'll go from there

593
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:46,159
let's see size is not a member of that's

594
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:47,809
true you know what I probably should do

595
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,410
I should probably do these changes one

596
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:54,279
at a time

597
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:54,279
render group that hb2 size

598
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,870
all right

599
00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,829
connect everyone from from vo to class

600
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,319
oh oh sorry yes you need the pointer to

601
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:07,659
the floats don't you so I'm going to go

602
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,769
ahead and run and I should see exactly

603
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,710
the same thing on the screen as I did

604
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:13,240
before which is what I want and then and

605
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,920
I do have to restart the app now because

606
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,069
this is not in the reload section this

607
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,410
is in the rendering code so now what I

608
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:22,210
need to do is I need to make this code

609
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,650
actually work with sort of a stretched

610
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,720
version of the bitmap and what that

611
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:29,380
means is that instead of being able to

612
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,410
use the the kinds of a min and a max P I

613
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,690
actually need four separate points right

614
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,160
I need each quarter because they can be

615
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,930
sheared and rotate there's there's notes

616
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,940
there's it's not like two boundaries

617
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,590
anymore I need to know the different

618
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,039
points so just to be explicit about this

619
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:46,659
right if I'm just drawing something

620
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,639
that's that's rectangular and aligned

621
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,320
with the screen then it's pretty easy

622
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,360
well I guess I'll do it this way it's

623
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,419
pretty easy to send down a minimum X Y

624
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,129
and a maximum X Y and that specifies

625
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,350
obviously the entire rectangle because

626
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,300
it's just like it's like bounding this

627
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:03,669
by a set of four planes right the min

628
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,079
and the max in each axis but as soon as

629
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,570
I move over to something that could be

630
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:09,369
rotated scaled and sheared let me see if

631
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:17,559
I can draw something kind of crazy that

632
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:19,569
illustrates that so right this is now a

633
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,759
totally legal shape for our renderer to

634
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:23,289
output and the the bitmap will just get

635
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,779
kind of squashed around in there and so

636
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:27,970
if that's what we're gonna do then you

637
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:29,710
can kind of see that like hey we can't

638
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,269
really specify it to the renderer

639
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:35,440
anymore as as a min and the max instead

640
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:36,670
we're gonna need something else and so

641
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,330
what I was saying is well let's just

642
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:42,009
pass in you know here and here okay and

643
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:44,230
then I know we can produce these other

644
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:46,690
four points because like we just take

645
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,849
the center point that we have and we do

646
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,950
we subtract this in this to get this guy

647
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:52,869
we add this and subtract this to get

648
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,819
this guy we add both of them to get this

649
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:56,919
guy and we add this one and subtract

650
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:59,649
this one to get this guy right so we can

651
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:03,509
produce all four points and so then what

652
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:03,509
this becomes is this becomes us

653
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,990
sort of having to generate those four

654
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:12,269
points from what we're given and to

655
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,400
generate those points you know what we

656
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:16,109
could also do here because both render

657
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,030
paths are probably well known I guess

658
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:20,099
they don't really need it so what we're

659
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:21,660
gonna do here is just say okay assuming

660
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,980
that we've got the other information in

661
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,660
there let's let's jump over to render

662
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,589
group that H assuming that we've got

663
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:32,300
these in their x-axis and y-axis and

664
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:32,299
these are scaled in fact I'll note that

665
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:51,269
so if we want to go through and do this

666
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,579
code what we need to do is produce like

667
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:55,769
the midpoint so this is min min this is

668
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:58,589
essentially min min P it's min X min Y

669
00:29:55,769 --> 00:30:04,109
right in fact we could do it this way

670
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:06,299
well I'll just do min min and the next

671
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:11,849
minute Y so that's been X min Y this is

672
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:13,678
max X then Y and again I can also do

673
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:20,219
this with the with the floating point

674
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:21,420
passing I want to this one is max X and

675
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:35,160
I'm just like I said just reading these

676
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:42,450
off here max Y min X min Y max X max Y

677
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:44,279
and min x max Y okay so if we take a

678
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,480
look at what happens here all of our UV

679
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,829
coordinates are going to be exactly the

680
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,349
same and now we're just computing these

681
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:50,849
points a little bit differently so what

682
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:54,569
we can do now is say well we have our

683
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:59,039
min X min Y point our min x max Y point

684
00:30:54,569 --> 00:31:01,049
our max X min Y point and our max X max

685
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,649
Y point those are our points we know

686
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:06,569
that these are all going to start at P

687
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,220
you know at our at our main point and

688
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:10,619
then we're going to need you can see

689
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,350
here we've got this x axis Y axis thing

690
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:16,159
this is literally the equation in fact I

691
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,159
guess we can just

692
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:24,859
I'm interested to know oh so our entropy

693
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:27,888
oh so our entropy is already based in

694
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:29,689
the lower left corner so these can just

695
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:33,699
be scaled by the actual dimension are

696
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:38,110
already scaled by the dimension

697
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:42,350
apparently I don't know if I like that

698
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:46,278
but we can always change it there no big

699
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:48,109
deal anyway so if I want to move on from

700
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:50,808
here I can simply say all right we've

701
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:52,008
got the P which is that the MVP and I

702
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,148
guess we could still call it min P

703
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,860
because that makes sense and then this

704
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:56,778
is really the code this is the entirety

705
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:59,528
of the code we need is this exact code

706
00:31:56,778 --> 00:32:01,609
it's now what we're doing is saying hey

707
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:03,259
we don't need to multiply by the size

708
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:05,178
anymore because these are multiplied by

709
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:06,589
the size already we don't need to

710
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:14,749
construct them in place because they

711
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:17,118
actually exist in the entity itself and

712
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:19,278
then all we have to do is construct each

713
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:21,769
of the points by doing exactly what we

714
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,499
just said so min X means subtract the x

715
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:27,079
max X means add the X min Y means

716
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:28,460
subtract the Y max X means add the Y and

717
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,199
so there's our four points on the

718
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,490
corners of our parallelogram which could

719
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,490
be rotated you know two rotated and

720
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:37,960
shared square right so it becomes a

721
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:40,308
parallelogram of arbitrary dimension

722
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,690
arbitrary size dimension I guess we

723
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:44,148
could mean something else's context so

724
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,149
we won't use that and so then we should

725
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:49,069
be basically all set now all we have to

726
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:52,008
do is actually record this information

727
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:56,168
in the actual renderer and we should be

728
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:59,860
good to go now if I switch back to the

729
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:03,710
renderer the regular software renderer

730
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:05,990
which is somewhere where is that here it

731
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,308
is in the regular software renderer when

732
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,808
we're rendering a bitmap you can see us

733
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:11,269
calling draw a rectangle quickly now the

734
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:12,678
same stuff applies here right you can

735
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,839
see that we basically already set

736
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,360
ourselves up for success really all we

737
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,009
have to do is is pass these along and I

738
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:21,368
think that's it like that's all we need

739
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:23,628
to do to support what we were trying for

740
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:26,178
so I think that's the entirety to

741
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:28,009
modifications so really most of the work

742
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:30,900
we're gonna have to do now is going to

743
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:33,029
be about actually passing this

744
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,890
to the renderer it's not about the

745
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:38,160
renderer code handling it because it

746
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:39,990
will just handle it so okay we can start

747
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,038
by supporting the existing push bitmap

748
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,269
call this is not going to be

749
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,429
particularly difficult because we know

750
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:47,129
what the size is so if we instead just

751
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:49,798
keep the size as a v2 real quick real

752
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:54,650
quick like then we know what the x-axis

753
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:57,029
is and we know what the y-axis is right

754
00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:01,769
because all they're going to be is just

755
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:05,579
whatever that size X was that's that

756
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:07,918
goes into the X component and whatever

757
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:10,049
the size Y was that's what goes into the

758
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,000
y component so that'll do our that's all

759
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:16,010
we were doing before so we can just do

760
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,510
it now so then if we come in here and

761
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:23,129
wait what am what's the problem Oh

762
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:24,480
entity I spelled it wrong so now if we

763
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:27,839
come in here we just have to clean up

764
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,760
these calls where I'd forgot the V and I

765
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,169
think we should be good to go when I run

766
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,859
this code hopefully if I didn't mess

767
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,648
anything up

768
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:36,389
and I obviously did that's kind of

769
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:41,190
spectacular you have to admit that's

770
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:42,480
awesome we should get a basically exact

771
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,190
same thing on screen so it definitely

772
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,108
messed something up there and that's not

773
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,289
a good thing oh you know what I just

774
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:48,289
realized

775
00:34:48,579 --> 00:35:11,920
whereas render group there we go -

776
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:14,650
x-axis + s up so men men we don't

777
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,050
subtract anymore so we just have I don't

778
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,059
know why I deleted all that so we we

779
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,530
don't subtract cuz that was I did that

780
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,610
as if we were doing half dimensions but

781
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,590
that's not what we're doing we're doing

782
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,780
whole dimensions so I doubled the scale

783
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,610
of everything right I was still thinking

784
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:35,680
this in my head but really what we have

785
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:38,470
is this right so all we do is start at P

786
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,569
we add the x-axis we add the after we

787
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,279
add the x-axis we add the y-axis you

788
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,590
know so that's it we don't do

789
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,030
subtraction so since I was doing it I

790
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,920
was essentially doubling the size

791
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,900
because these were the whole size of the

792
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,110
other side and I was doing that which

793
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,720
was just dumb again had the wrong mental

794
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,849
model stuck in my brain for some reason

795
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,039
so now I think we're good and that

796
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:02,849
allows us now to render anything that's

797
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:06,880
like scaled and sheared and rotated

798
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:08,409
which is what we need so now we just

799
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,700
need a cut like I said most of the work

800
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:11,440
is getting it down there now we just

801
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:15,460
need some code that can actually specify

802
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,530
some useful things here when we call

803
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,880
push bitmap so you can see that we've

804
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:23,230
got a couple different ways of calling

805
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,920
it here and I think what we want to do

806
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:29,710
is we probably want again this to sort

807
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,289
of get one more step removed so that

808
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:37,869
these are you know kind of again

809
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:41,800
inlinable we hope and what I can do here

810
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:44,710
is say well okay so the sizes that come

811
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,480
down on these we can just multiply those

812
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:52,539
by maybe two vectors that we end up

813
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:55,949
getting that we pass in right so maybe I

814
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:55,949
can just say like okay

815
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,470
Oh

816
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,180
we think about this so see a line we

817
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:15,769
just have a tunt we just have so many

818
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:17,960
things that we passed a push bitmap it's

819
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:19,730
kind of annoying but you know like if we

820
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,800
wanted to write we could even stick

821
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:35,329
these on the end here right this could

822
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:38,060
just be x-axis y-axis if we want to and

823
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:39,349
again not it's not great but we totally

824
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,940
could do that because then what we would

825
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:44,000
do is just say well whatever the size X

826
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:46,369
is times the x axis and whatever the Y

827
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,719
the size y is x will axis now the other

828
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:49,429
thing that I'm not sure is if that we

829
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:52,009
have would have any problem with that as

830
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:59,690
far as the scale the nonlinear scale is

831
00:37:52,010 --> 00:38:01,190
concerned and I have to think about that

832
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,929
because if you think about what happens

833
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,840
here right when we go through and say

834
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:07,279
get bitmap dimensions we get back some

835
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,450
scale values that are based on

836
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,780
projecting those sizes and so that

837
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:17,719
projection is nonlinear which means we

838
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:25,880
can't just multiply it on the outside so

839
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:31,989
I feel like we kind of need that to be

840
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:36,039
more respected now if you always pass in

841
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:36,039
non scaled axes

842
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:47,329
that would be fine

843
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:51,460
but at some point I think that's just

844
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:55,779
not what you want if that makes sense

845
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,780
so I'm gonna take this back a bit and

846
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:07,129
think about this

847
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:10,340
so inside kept it mapped in well I guess

848
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:14,360
it's actually getting render MV basis P

849
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:19,100
I suppose because we get the base of

850
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:21,320
scale oh well I guess it's okay because

851
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:23,389
we have it as a separate scale and so I

852
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,980
guess we baked the non-linearity into

853
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:31,969
that is that correct though does that

854
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:38,539
actually work how does our how does our

855
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:43,809
get run our energy basis code work let's

856
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:43,809
take a look so where I produce the scale

857
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:52,309
it's the meters to pixels the projected

858
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:55,519
XY dot Z so the projected XY dot Z which

859
00:39:52,309 --> 00:40:00,500
is the 1 over 2 focal length times raw X

860
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:02,300
Y so it's definitely dividing that value

861
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:06,230
by its month well so yeah that that

862
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,470
actually is gonna be totally fine all

863
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,300
right

864
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:12,250
I take it back I guess that would just

865
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:16,039
work I think that just works

866
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:19,130
conveniently for us we can just do that

867
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:21,199
so the way this is working in here is we

868
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,019
pass in a height value right and the

869
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:29,089
height value it does some like monkeying

870
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:31,820
around to sort of get that to to be

871
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,820
scaled properly and so what I could do

872
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,670
here is just I could say and probably

873
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:42,789
what I would want I'm guessing is to

874
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:45,079
specify sort of the x and y axes we're

875
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:49,369
like let's see here where the height

876
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:51,349
actually yeah like the optimal thing I

877
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,730
think might be just specify the XY axes

878
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:55,759
as constant AXI

879
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:59,119
so the X and y axis would be unit length

880
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,250
and we still specify the height and then

881
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,950
you know I would just grow the height to

882
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:08,030
figure out how high I want to be and it

883
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:10,129
would stay uniform and then if you

884
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:12,650
wanted to you could shrink the width by

885
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:16,030
shrinking the x-axis so that way you're

886
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:23,000
shrinking it proportionally I don't know

887
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:25,070
it's really tough to say it's real tough

888
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,050
to say because the other thing we can do

889
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:28,910
is just specify those two axes directly

890
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,099
and just have them multiplied by the

891
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:32,659
scale and you never specify like that

892
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:35,450
size

893
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:38,559
and the width over height that just

894
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:38,559
never gets actually used

895
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:47,730
I guess I should think about what I

896
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:49,409
actually want to have happen here at

897
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,480
least in this one specific case so that

898
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:53,909
I baby can say that at least work for

899
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,579
one thing so what I would want to do

900
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:58,859
here right is we've got the the hero and

901
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,079
he's kind of a you know a trapezoidal

902
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:04,559
looking thing and he's on top of another

903
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,360
trapezoidal looking thing and then he's

904
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:06,719
got a point which is that where the head

905
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,210
is

906
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,689
and so what I'm sort of saying is well

907
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,070
okay if the head shifts over to the side

908
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:18,740
what I've currently got going on is

909
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:21,809
something that looks like this right and

910
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:24,569
so what I'd like to do is I'd like to go

911
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:28,590
ahead and correct this vector so that it

912
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:33,780
points back towards the where the head

913
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:37,320
is right now there's different ways that

914
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,390
we can do that we can leave this so that

915
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,740
it we could shear it so we could make it

916
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:42,739
so that it just goes like this right

917
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:47,130
which might make some sense we could

918
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,830
also rotate it this way

919
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,119
and then scale it right and that would

920
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:55,319
be a little bit different that would

921
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,730
look more you know like like that and I

922
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,059
don't know which one of those is going

923
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,199
to be the right thing to do but the

924
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:03,989
reason that things are slightly

925
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,149
complicated is because when we know you

926
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:09,209
know if we have this thing or I should

927
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:12,960
say what we actually have is we just

928
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:19,440
have a notion of where the bitmap

929
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:21,240
actually is and it's its width that

930
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,690
height are determined by what the input

931
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:26,399
art file is right and that makes things

932
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:30,090
a little bit complicated because it

933
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:33,510
means that we don't really have a stable

934
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:37,800
sense in the external code of what the

935
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:39,600
wit is so I guess we want to just keep

936
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,490
doing it off of the height and we'll

937
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,170
just specify some height stuff and say

938
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:47,669
hey did we want you know if we want to

939
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:51,680
bend that height around we'll just

940
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:51,680
change what that y-axis is

941
00:43:53,230 --> 00:44:00,380
and that's it I think that's probably

942
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,538
what we're gonna want to do now we're

943
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,190
gonna have a problem here and that

944
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:06,289
problem is going to be that like the

945
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:08,749
pivot for the object is what we have to

946
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:10,549
kind of work around and I don't know to

947
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:15,439
what extent we're already doing it so

948
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:17,989
here's our our alignment and the

949
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,150
alignment gets baked into the offset so

950
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:22,998
I guess that will probably work

951
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:24,680
correctly but it's a little janky here

952
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:26,719
because we've all you know we've kind of

953
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:28,730
also got this concept that you know

954
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,909
we're trying to talk about something

955
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:34,849
that's based here and stretching to some

956
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:36,379
point but the actual bitmap is being

957
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:38,420
rendered you know something more like

958
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,490
this because remember we haven't even

959
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,990
gotten rid of the empty space there so

960
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:52,548
the actual bitmap is something that

961
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:58,008
looks like that you know I'm saying so

962
00:44:52,548 --> 00:45:00,739
when we actually start here and we want

963
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:02,539
a displace to there then what we're

964
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:05,389
essentially doing is we're having to

965
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:07,789
sort of do the whole thing this whole

966
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:13,429
thing has to kind of happen like that

967
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:15,319
right but it has to counter move if it

968
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:16,969
just did that then this point would

969
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:18,739
slide as well which we didn't actually

970
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:21,788
want we wanted this point to remain

971
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:25,309
rooted so we have to counter slide this

972
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:26,989
point by however much is necessary to

973
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:28,730
keep this point in this Innis the same

974
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:32,749
place right

975
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:36,679
essentially the pivot has to be

976
00:45:32,748 --> 00:45:39,139
respected so we've got some work ahead

977
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:41,088
of us to make this happen the way that

978
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:42,409
that's working now is inside get bitmap

979
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:44,028
dim you can see that we're using this

980
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:48,548
align thing and that align point that

981
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:51,920
sealion times Hadamard nonsense right

982
00:45:48,548 --> 00:45:54,048
that code is actually aligning us to a

983
00:45:51,920 --> 00:46:00,650
bogus alignment point if the alignment

984
00:45:54,048 --> 00:46:04,009
point that we set in when we packed the

985
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:05,599
assets and those alignment points are I

986
00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:08,000
think based on the ground

987
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,309
like where the ground is and that's not

988
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,719
something we actually want because now

989
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,849
we're animating these three pieces

990
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:16,730
separately what we actually want is that

991
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:21,739
point to be specific to like basically

992
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:23,539
the the sort of wrote the part around

993
00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:28,399
which we rotate about the imaginary part

994
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:29,690
that it connects to the the legs well

995
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,590
they're not really legs because there's

996
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:33,970
no legs

997
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:36,559
it's a legless child the stump

998
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:38,329
so wherever connects to the stump is

999
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,889
what we actually would want that point

1000
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:42,949
to be and that's not what that point is

1001
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:45,650
at the moment now we can always override

1002
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:47,210
it so that's not that big a deal but it

1003
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,530
is worth noting that like that's

1004
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,539
probably saying when we bake the art

1005
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,830
assets you know I'm gonna have to make

1006
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:53,719
sure when I produce some of the final

1007
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:57,289
art packs for this we want to get those

1008
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:59,569
things right yeah so this is kind of

1009
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:00,800
complicated we're gonna have to do a lot

1010
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:05,690
of work to sort of get this into the

1011
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:08,030
right it to get this into shape but what

1012
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,829
I do think is true about this is I do

1013
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:12,470
think we want to just go ahead and say

1014
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:15,170
that you can pass x and y AK axes and

1015
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:17,089
we'll just scale those as necessary so I

1016
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:19,820
think we probably keep roughly what we

1017
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:22,850
had I think it'll probably work okay and

1018
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:26,510
then we just say like okay yeah when you

1019
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:29,150
pass one of these down we'll just go

1020
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:35,210
ahead and say it's size x times the x

1021
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:38,740
axis and size y times the y axis and I

1022
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:44,050
don't know so where is get bitmap dim

1023
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:44,049
used is it only used in this function

1024
00:47:53,769 --> 00:48:03,619
so where else is it used get bitmap Tim

1025
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:15,740
is in text up so get bitmap Tim is used

1026
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:17,659
for text rendering and block work so

1027
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:20,209
that's basically all that's used for so

1028
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:21,799
I'm relatively free it's only even using

1029
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,570
the debug system I'm relatively free to

1030
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,760
make changes to that and it's not a big

1031
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,590
deal so if we take a look at what

1032
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,590
happens here where we've got the dim dot

1033
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:33,530
size that computes this information and

1034
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:37,010
we've got the dimensions dot aligned and

1035
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:39,410
all that nonsense so in here what I can

1036
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:43,810
do is say well this offset needs to be

1037
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:46,670
computed now based on those axes right

1038
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:52,009
because the alignment is going to be now

1039
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:54,139
is not gonna be done in flat 2d

1040
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:57,220
rectilinear it's actually gonna be like

1041
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:59,509
in the near sheared rotate escape face

1042
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:00,679
so maintaining that alignment point

1043
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,050
which of course is wrong at the moment

1044
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:06,230
but if it were right maintaining that

1045
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,910
alignment point has to be done in a

1046
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:12,199
different way with this that with this

1047
00:49:07,909 --> 00:49:15,589
p-value and what we have to do is take

1048
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:18,289
that alignment and multiply it by the X

1049
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:20,930
and the y axes to get what we actually

1050
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:24,559
need I'm gonna change the way that this

1051
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:27,829
function is working I'm gonna say that

1052
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:30,139
it's since we don't touch the Z I'm

1053
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:33,409
going to say that the Dimpy Z equals the

1054
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:38,809
offset Z and then I'm going to say that

1055
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:41,859
the X y equals basically the equation on

1056
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,860
the XY itself

1057
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:52,440
and then I can't be got it actually

1058
00:49:45,900 --> 00:50:01,920
change my underscores back to not

1059
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:03,630
underscores okay so that is step one and

1060
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,389
again we're not actually asking to do

1061
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:08,610
anything yet so we'll see the same thing

1062
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:12,539
so after I do that after I get the entry

1063
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:14,460
x-axis and y-axis stuff I need to then

1064
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:18,469
pass them down in here and this needs to

1065
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,470
be something that looks like this

1066
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:27,869
right so this function now has to take

1067
00:50:24,929 --> 00:50:29,849
an x-axis which again can still be a

1068
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:31,829
default so anyone who was calling this

1069
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:33,719
thing can still call it the same way

1070
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:40,009
that they were calling it before and

1071
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:40,009
that's totes fine but it needs to know

1072
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:57,510
now again hopefully that will produce no

1073
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,250
change and it doesn't so that's good and

1074
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:02,309
so now what I want to do is just see

1075
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:04,230
whether we can get some kind of a

1076
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:10,380
stretch going on here right something

1077
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:14,760
that's sort of you know moves the kind

1078
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:16,559
of moves the stretches the body out in

1079
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,819
some way and it's gonna be a little bit

1080
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,839
wrong I think but we'll do what we can

1081
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:22,558
because like I said those those pivot

1082
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:26,608
points are in the wrong place

1083
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:32,700
unfortunately so now if I go down to

1084
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:37,049
handmade handmade world mode and I come

1085
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:38,939
in here to the hero body what I can do

1086
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:41,220
is take a look at the distance between

1087
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:44,338
the head and the body

1088
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:49,318
that's this head distance here so I'm

1089
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:56,969
going to take a v2 or I guess we'll do

1090
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:58,139
it v3 which is the head Delta and I'm

1091
00:51:56,969 --> 00:51:59,639
just gonna take a look at what the

1092
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:02,759
difference between the two of them is so

1093
00:51:59,639 --> 00:52:04,920
where is the head versus where it

1094
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,599
where's the head moved relative to where

1095
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,760
the body is that's the displacement off

1096
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,760
of those and then I'm just gonna try

1097
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:17,640
driving a little bit of change in that

1098
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:22,470
y-axis based on that so you know when we

1099
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:24,960
kind of compute that we'd come down here

1100
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:27,750
I think we have the render code for the

1101
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,500
hero head and then here's the code for

1102
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:36,659
the hero body so in here what I can do

1103
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:41,039
is say well the torso and the Cape let's

1104
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:44,149
use a different you gotta take a look at

1105
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:47,460
all my parameter let's use a different

1106
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:50,940
thing for them let's use a different X

1107
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:52,949
and y-axis for them so at the moment I

1108
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,059
don't have any needs for color although

1109
00:52:52,949 --> 00:52:55,098
I feel like eventually we will probably

1110
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:57,890
want to change the

1111
00:52:55,099 --> 00:53:00,769
color of things on the hero that would

1112
00:52:57,889 --> 00:53:03,978
not surprise me but anyway we've got the

1113
00:53:00,768 --> 00:53:05,988
color that we're passing the CTU line is

1114
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:11,710
always going to be 1.0 that's not going

1115
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:11,710
to change and then we've got our x axis

1116
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:26,210
y axis so x axis to start at and the

1117
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:29,358
white said before there when I didn't

1118
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:30,409
have to our x-axis and a y-axis can

1119
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:38,778
start out being what they were

1120
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:43,578
previously and looks like I didn't quite

1121
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:46,759
get that right notice here that our ties

1122
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:47,239
could be well trying to match the are

1123
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:51,759
here lose

1124
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:57,679
okay so render group have a transform ah

1125
00:53:51,759 --> 00:54:01,119
right I missed one of my functions since

1126
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:06,038
we can pass the bitmap ID to these guys

1127
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:06,039
this push bitmap call also needs them

1128
00:54:09,338 --> 00:54:13,548
okay and so this should do exactly the

1129
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,689
same thing was doing before because

1130
00:54:13,548 --> 00:54:19,458
we're passing it through and we're fine

1131
00:54:16,688 --> 00:54:22,518
and so now what I would need to do is

1132
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:24,528
inside the world mode code I need to

1133
00:54:22,518 --> 00:54:26,328
actually have I guess I'd probably

1134
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:31,458
because because we're doing rendering

1135
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:34,099
and in updating separately I would need

1136
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:40,848
to store this in the sim entity

1137
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:47,380
structure as well so inside here in

1138
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:55,039
salinity I will need to add you know

1139
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:56,959
x-axis y-axis and the x-axis y-axis at

1140
00:54:55,039 --> 00:55:01,939
the moment because I don't really have

1141
00:54:56,958 --> 00:55:08,649
any particular desire to fuss with it is

1142
00:55:01,938 --> 00:55:08,649
just going to be set to the default

1143
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:18,248
might as well set it on everybody PI

1144
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:18,248
step that's a construction someday

1145
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:23,929
alright so what I want to do here is I

1146
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:29,390
want to actually compute different ones

1147
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:31,219
for this for the hero's body here I will

1148
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:32,719
just use I will now get it out of the

1149
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:34,938
entity so that it can be stored by the

1150
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,650
entity update routines to be whatever

1151
00:55:34,938 --> 00:55:42,318
they want based on how they were moving

1152
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:43,459
and yeah pretty straightforward so now

1153
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:44,838
we just have to actually compute

1154
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,858
something and that's the part that think

1155
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:47,358
we're probably not to put off till next

1156
00:55:45,858 --> 00:55:49,130
week because there's this is gonna be

1157
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:50,058
fairly complicated and we have to figure

1158
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,588
out how we're gonna deal with the fact

1159
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:54,949
that the hot spots are in the wrong

1160
00:55:51,588 --> 00:55:56,509
place but anyway when I have that had

1161
00:55:54,949 --> 00:56:03,199
Delta there what I could do is say well

1162
00:55:56,509 --> 00:56:05,059
okay whatever they had Delta is after I

1163
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:07,489
figure out where my new location is I

1164
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:11,719
can go ahead and take my entity x-axis

1165
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:15,139
and I can compute I suppose that in the

1166
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:18,720
y-axis I can go ahead and compute that

1167
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:21,159
by displacing that axis

1168
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:25,029
relative to where the head is right and

1169
00:56:21,159 --> 00:56:31,059
so if I'm gonna do this I could I could

1170
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:33,010
do this fairly straightforwardly by

1171
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:34,360
saying hey what the x-axis is just

1172
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:36,220
whatever it is or we can even leave the

1173
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,250
XS is the same in fact maybe let's do

1174
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:40,899
that first

1175
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:42,579
and I could say that the y-axis is just

1176
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:48,730
going to be whatever the y-axis would

1177
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:55,779
have been plus some coefficient times

1178
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:57,820
the displacement now this is going to be

1179
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,019
grotesquely wrong but like I said for

1180
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:04,780
the time being I think that we're gonna

1181
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:08,340
have to live with that do not know why

1182
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,340
I'm not seeing any results there

1183
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:27,440
why not doing anything well I guess we

1184
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:32,329
can start by saying hey this should make

1185
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:36,470
the guy be twice as big right twice as

1186
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:38,679
tall and it sure doesn't so something's

1187
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:38,679
not happening

1188
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:49,090
so here's here a body it's getting those

1189
00:57:44,389 --> 00:57:56,539
things out it's passing them down oh

1190
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:58,670
right got to actually pass them so

1191
00:57:56,539 --> 00:58:02,239
that's getting passed there this is

1192
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:04,340
getting passed there Thanks fine and

1193
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:04,879
dandy there we go that's what I was

1194
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:09,380
expecting

1195
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:12,980
okay good all right so let's actually go

1196
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:18,230
and try that one more time so here we

1197
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:29,179
are in world mode I'm gonna go up to our

1198
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:32,900
y-axis and I'm gonna say I don't know

1199
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:35,089
why I made that in x-axis there we go

1200
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:36,200
so that now does what exactly what I

1201
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,600
think it should do so now we're

1202
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:44,839
operating at least properly so now I'll

1203
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:48,230
put this back in here here we go and so

1204
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:52,160
now well that's that's great I did it

1205
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:54,380
again there we go

1206
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,960
so now you can see I'm already starting

1207
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:59,450
to do that stretching which is all fine

1208
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,260
and dandy it doesn't look particularly

1209
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:02,750
great though

1210
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:04,880
right you can it's it's not it's it's

1211
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:10,010
better than it was to a certain degree

1212
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:11,030
but it's not fabulous right like you

1213
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:12,500
probably don't want the game to look

1214
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:15,369
like that like that's not going to be

1215
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,719
that's not gonna be great

1216
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:19,338
so we'll have to start dealing with this

1217
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:21,828
next week as I said we're out of time at

1218
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:23,779
this point but at least we now sort of

1219
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:26,030
have the renderer supporting us if not

1220
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,319
our art assets since our art assets are

1221
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:29,960
not really aligned in the way that they

1222
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:32,588
probably would need to be in order for

1223
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,588
this to work properly

1224
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:22,309
so I sauce the kid

1225
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:25,250
zircon encrusted tweezers are you moving

1226
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:29,000
to Montana soon yeah

1227
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:34,369
just me and the pygmy Pony man over by

1228
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,380
the dental-floss bush frosty ninja why

1229
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:38,809
does our limbless hero need to suffer in

1230
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:40,130
such gruesome ways well you know it's

1231
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:42,079
tough being a video game character you

1232
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:46,240
get squashed you get stretched you die

1233
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,239
repeatedly in a lot of games

1234
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:05,740
do I need the pay version of mischief to

1235
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:08,859
change the background-color yes I think

1236
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:12,129
so but I would hold off on that because

1237
01:01:08,858 --> 01:01:16,828
somebody on the handmade who was a

1238
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:16,829
handmade hero friend

1239
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:22,028
they made a replacement for mischeif and

1240
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,889
it's supposedly almost ready so we're

1241
01:01:22,028 --> 01:01:29,889
probably gonna switch to that pretty

1242
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:31,328
soon now so there's that will you try

1243
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:33,699
rotation to visually compare against

1244
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:37,480
shearing before deciding probably what

1245
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:39,759
we'll do actually is a combination so in

1246
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,920
order to get it as minimally messed up

1247
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:45,010
as possible we'll probably do some

1248
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,720
rotation and some shearing and that's

1249
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:51,460
you know I think probably the best that

1250
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:53,139
we're going to be able to do we might

1251
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:55,028
also try having one more frame of

1252
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:57,098
animation in each direction or a rather

1253
01:01:55,028 --> 01:02:01,239
frame of imagery so that when you're

1254
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:05,460
really far over it like splays out it

1255
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:05,459
like changes to another image

1256
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:25,940
let's see

1257
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:28,709
see you got sure you wrote the scales

1258
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,298
for this way because it's already done

1259
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:31,769
in a software renderer but these

1260
01:02:30,298 --> 01:02:34,759
transformations would usually be done in

1261
01:02:31,768 --> 01:02:36,389
a vertex shader right no these these

1262
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:40,889
transformations have nothing to do with

1263
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:42,719
a vertex shader if you were trying to do

1264
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:47,548
these sorts of transformations you would

1265
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:50,368
do them in a geometry shader is the way

1266
01:02:47,548 --> 01:03:03,210
they would actually be done so this

1267
01:02:50,369 --> 01:03:05,548
piece of information here here so what

1268
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:08,548
you would do is this concept right here

1269
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:10,650
this render entry bitmap this would

1270
01:03:08,548 --> 01:03:15,288
actually be what you would send to the

1271
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:18,869
card and then the geometry shader would

1272
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:22,140
output it well the geometry shader would

1273
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:25,259
literally do exactly what you saw me do

1274
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:28,858
here so this code would be in the

1275
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:31,710
geometry shader like literally all of it

1276
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:36,119
like right here and down all of that

1277
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:38,608
would all be in the geometry shader if

1278
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:40,950
you wanted to pass this width and height

1279
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:42,420
somehow otherwise you'd do just this one

1280
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:45,298
part and you would the thing that would

1281
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:48,739
be that you'd pass them in menu the max

1282
01:03:45,298 --> 01:03:48,739
UV to the geometry shader

1283
01:03:52,489 --> 01:03:56,059
some other games have similar moves

1284
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,260
styles but they use a floating indicator

1285
01:03:56,059 --> 01:03:59,420
instead of separating the head from the

1286
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:01,369
body your thoughts yes this games

1287
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:04,190
designed very specifically requires you

1288
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:07,550
to not do that you have to move the

1289
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:08,990
actual head so I sauce the kid for

1290
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:12,280
collision detection will there be skewed

1291
01:04:08,989 --> 01:04:16,159
boxes as well or will it just be a a BB

1292
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:19,130
so I don't think we will probably have

1293
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:22,190
any actual collision detection on the

1294
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:30,170
hero anyway it will probably be mostly

1295
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:32,358
semantic if that makes sense so the body

1296
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:35,260
shirred body will not really be go

1297
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:37,699
undergoing collision detection probably

1298
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:39,880
garland Oh bloom so we moved how that

1299
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:43,539
I'll haven't seen the new movement yes

1300
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:43,539
we moved house tile

1301
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:53,909
bird Amina are we eventually going to

1302
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:56,849
move these over to shaders if we had to

1303
01:04:53,909 --> 01:05:00,778
for some kind of performance reason we

1304
01:04:56,849 --> 01:05:05,309
would if we never do have to do that

1305
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:07,949
though that no because basically OpenGL

1306
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:09,449
programming is it's kind of useless

1307
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:13,709
programming right it's programming that

1308
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:15,329
won't be relevant in five years it's

1309
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:18,629
oftentimes not even relevant in two

1310
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:22,159
years because it's you know completely

1311
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:27,329
different it all gets changed around

1312
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:30,088
repeatedly so you know my preference

1313
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:32,999
would be to teach as little graphics API

1314
01:05:30,088 --> 01:05:34,909
specific stuff as possible I would

1315
01:05:32,998 --> 01:05:36,898
rather show how to code it in software

1316
01:05:34,909 --> 01:05:38,999
so that you know how it works and then

1317
01:05:36,898 --> 01:05:41,188
you know if for some reason you can't if

1318
01:05:38,998 --> 01:05:42,328
if you actually go follow hey I made

1319
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:44,158
Hiro to the point where you've written

1320
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:47,039
the software rasterizer it should be

1321
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,659
trivial for you to go like learn how to

1322
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,699
drive a graphics API do it cuz that's

1323
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:52,619
just like looking up the API is stuff

1324
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:54,959
and going how do I call it to do this

1325
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,369
right because you already know exactly

1326
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:59,188
what happens there just a question of

1327
01:05:56,369 --> 01:06:03,179
like okay how do I call these things and

1328
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:04,528
those things change frequently and so

1329
01:06:03,179 --> 01:06:06,269
teaching them on the stream is like

1330
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:09,719
literally complete waste of time so I

1331
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:11,278
try to keep it just to the parts we

1332
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:16,159
actually need to do to make sure that

1333
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:16,159
the game runs okay on GPUs

1334
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:29,450
any word on the new debugger a new

1335
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:32,429
debugger I am not working on a debugger

1336
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:34,579
if anyone thought that that was

1337
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:34,579
happening

1338
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,470
courage against and you have a stream

1339
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,500
about someone counting you about making

1340
01:07:11,469 --> 01:07:16,629
butter no not contacting me

1341
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:19,150
it was contacting oh I know what you're

1342
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:21,940
talking about now you're talking about

1343
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:25,480
the the folks who were looking to put

1344
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:27,820
the debugger into for coder all right

1345
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:30,610
now I know we're talking about I have no

1346
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,869
idea I just did the stream because I was

1347
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:33,250
like if people are trying to work on it

1348
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:35,860
then I'm gonna give them as much

1349
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:38,769
information about it as I can because I

1350
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:42,099
would love to have a debugger but

1351
01:07:38,769 --> 01:07:43,570
unfortunately I you know I don't have

1352
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,610
much time to look into stuff like that

1353
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:53,590
so I I have no idea what they're doing

1354
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:57,250
with that I know that that Alan Webster

1355
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:58,630
has to finish up the UI upgrades in for

1356
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:01,449
coder before you could have like

1357
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:03,579
debugger looking things in it and I

1358
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:06,219
would assume since I haven't seen any

1359
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:08,319
for coder updates in a while that he is

1360
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:10,449
the middle finals and stuff since he's

1361
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:13,080
in school so I'm guessing that that

1362
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:16,389
probably until there's some free time

1363
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:20,409
for Alan I'm guessing that we won't see

1364
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:32,319
anything but you know maybe once school

1365
01:08:20,409 --> 01:08:34,528
is out that that will happen if that

1366
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,529
makes sense

1367
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:54,549
and insofar as you say I doubt the

1368
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:57,279
concept of shaders is going anywhere

1369
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:59,170
soon I disagree

1370
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:04,989
right like and this is you know this is

1371
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:06,789
I guess a point where I sort of separate

1372
01:09:04,989 --> 01:09:10,630
I guess from the credentialism maybe

1373
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:12,850
it's just my wishful thinking but I

1374
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:15,400
don't really think like shaders are

1375
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:17,650
obviously stupid right they don't make

1376
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:23,429
any sense because essentially what they

1377
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:27,129
are is a way of having sort of like a

1378
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:29,920
way of pigeonholing a particular type of

1379
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:32,800
stuff that you might do in code whose

1380
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,829
has a very irregular boundary that's

1381
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:38,350
based on a strange overlapping set of

1382
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:41,439
things that you that different Hardware

1383
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:47,770
did or did not do at certain times or

1384
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:51,609
whatever and because of that rather

1385
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:53,950
disgusting architectural artificial

1386
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:56,079
architectural creation it means that

1387
01:09:53,949 --> 01:09:58,539
it's constantly undergoing drastic

1388
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:01,630
revisions like it first started out it

1389
01:09:58,539 --> 01:10:04,000
was a bunch of API calls that you used

1390
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:05,949
to set up like some blending things you

1391
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,109
could do then it moved to an assembly

1392
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:10,090
language thing that you programmed that

1393
01:10:08,109 --> 01:10:11,469
was like DirectX like certain you could

1394
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,760
do a certain number of ops and those

1395
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:14,860
would be baked down right or whatever

1396
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,329
then it became like a sort of see like

1397
01:10:14,859 --> 01:10:16,779
thing that get compiled into these

1398
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:19,479
things

1399
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:21,699
now it's bifurcated so there's like many

1400
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:24,699
see like things each of which can do

1401
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:27,159
certain select operations or one

1402
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:29,170
general-purpose see thing that isn't

1403
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:30,760
really meant for rendering and you can

1404
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:31,600
sort of call that separately but we

1405
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,020
don't even know where it goes in the

1406
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,960
pipeline

1407
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:36,220
it's a non-sustainable system and you

1408
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,470
know it's not sustainable because it

1409
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,510
hasn't ever remained the same for more

1410
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:42,789
than like a year or two in a row right

1411
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:44,680
and they're constantly having to add all

1412
01:10:42,789 --> 01:10:46,060
this nonsense about like oh we added

1413
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,950
this new wave actually texture so we had

1414
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,240
all these API is for it and then those

1415
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:51,849
get routed in through the sato-mobile

1416
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:54,579
it's like it's stupid it's just it's a

1417
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:56,350
dumb dumb way to do things the correct

1418
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:58,890
way to do things is to like create an

1419
01:10:56,350 --> 01:11:01,960
actual programming model just like a CPU

1420
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:03,579
export what that is as an ice ax and

1421
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:08,739
then we code to it

1422
01:11:03,578 --> 01:11:11,170
like just get there right and so I kind

1423
01:11:08,738 --> 01:11:12,908
of feel like it's inevitable that we

1424
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:15,099
will get there because if shaders were

1425
01:11:12,908 --> 01:11:17,289
the right model then that's how would we

1426
01:11:15,099 --> 01:11:19,119
be programming actual code like that's

1427
01:11:17,289 --> 01:11:22,000
how we would actually be programming

1428
01:11:19,118 --> 01:11:23,859
computers is all shaders you wouldn't

1429
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,349
have like the ability to write a program

1430
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:29,439
you would write a collection of things

1431
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:31,869
this is a piece of string code and it

1432
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:33,819
would be in string Lang right and like

1433
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:37,479
this thing over here oh well this is

1434
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:39,279
written in blah right and so I think

1435
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:41,138
it's got to get there eventually because

1436
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:44,738
it's the only actual sustainable model

1437
01:11:41,139 --> 01:11:46,840
that I know about so and the fact that

1438
01:11:44,738 --> 01:11:50,529
shaders have changed so radically like

1439
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:52,960
every 2 3 years since their inception I

1440
01:11:50,529 --> 01:11:54,939
feel like it's got to go there

1441
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:57,039
eventually now unfortunately it will

1442
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:58,928
probably still be super janky but I just

1443
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:02,260
don't think the current way that shaders

1444
01:11:58,929 --> 01:12:04,480
work is gonna be relevant to anybody in

1445
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:05,349
like 5 years let's say I just I just

1446
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:08,229
don't think so

1447
01:12:05,349 --> 01:12:09,400
I think at the very least in five years

1448
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:11,649
we'll be on some different

1449
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:13,988
conceptualization of shaders that's not

1450
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:15,819
like the one that's that's now right

1451
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:17,859
like they're not separated into five

1452
01:12:15,819 --> 01:12:21,599
stages anymore there's like they've been

1453
01:12:17,859 --> 01:12:25,179
reorganized or something like this right

1454
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:28,000
and so I kind of think that's gotta

1455
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:29,139
happen and I hope it happens sooner

1456
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,578
rather than later but of course it

1457
01:12:29,139 --> 01:12:33,760
probably won't and we'll probably have

1458
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:36,158
another ten years of every two years you

1459
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,900
have to relearn how shaders work because

1460
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:40,049
they've been completely modified you

1461
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:40,049
know

1462
01:12:56,618 --> 01:12:59,920
may blow do you think you'll use the

1463
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:01,239
spring code from the other day on the

1464
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,649
camera movement I'm imagining a

1465
01:13:01,238 --> 01:13:10,109
critically damped spring would be the

1466
01:13:02,649 --> 01:13:13,149
thing to use for that pet peeve is non

1467
01:13:10,109 --> 01:13:16,630
critically damped Springs on camera code

1468
01:13:13,149 --> 01:13:18,129
so we would definitely not use a non

1469
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:19,539
crude of your damp spring I don't know

1470
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:23,618
that we would ever use a spring we would

1471
01:13:19,539 --> 01:13:26,368
probably use a b-spline maybe I don't

1472
01:13:23,618 --> 01:13:28,359
really well you know what I don't know

1473
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:30,670
you might be right critically damn

1474
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:32,019
spring could be good just never use an

1475
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:33,279
under damp spring for camera there are

1476
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,780
so many games that use it under dance

1477
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:37,000
together it makes people nauseous I

1478
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:40,569
often times get sick trying to play

1479
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:43,090
Stephen sausage roll because the the

1480
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:44,529
camera is an under damped spring so it

1481
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:46,800
shoots past the guy and then goes back

1482
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:49,599
and you feel like you're getting like

1483
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:52,570
you know like your your heads going

1484
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:55,349
crazy I see tons of games to do that

1485
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:55,349
it's awful

1486
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,099
super nauseating

1487
01:15:16,539 --> 01:15:26,979
so it looks like we got really no more

1488
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:28,930
cues about where we were doing your land

1489
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:33,929
of them for camera stuff I just do X

1490
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:33,930
plus equals X minus deaths divided by 10

1491
01:15:34,289 --> 01:15:39,329
well where's the time where's T in there

1492
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:49,380
Matt where's where's T in that equation

1493
01:15:43,449 --> 01:15:49,380
there is no T where is the T

1494
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:32,349
Orlando Bloom that's not accounting 40

1495
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:34,750
that's if it was instantaneous well so

1496
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:39,810
you you just apply that no matter what

1497
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:39,810
the time step was so it takes you know

1498
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:48,789
in one frame you are going to move one

1499
01:16:45,579 --> 01:16:59,619
tenth of the way to the destination no

1500
01:16:48,789 --> 01:17:00,880
matter what is that the idea or it's

1501
01:16:59,619 --> 01:17:04,630
like I move a tenth of the way of the

1502
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:08,199
destination every time which also means

1503
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:09,400
you'll never actually get there I mean

1504
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:11,050
you will cause a floating point but

1505
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:12,069
that's a Zeno's paradox kind of thing

1506
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:19,079
right it's like I'll never actually

1507
01:17:12,069 --> 01:17:19,079
reach the destination point

1508
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:33,480
and yes Allen I think you're correct

1509
01:17:30,809 --> 01:17:35,130
like if it's actually X - desk then it

1510
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:43,288
would be moving a tenth of the way away

1511
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:45,960
from the destination this is like fixed

1512
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:48,268
FPS so it was fine but I've changed hold

1513
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:50,099
on look it up well so yeah if you're if

1514
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:51,719
you're wondering what that would be

1515
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:54,809
that's that's basically a like a

1516
01:17:51,719 --> 01:18:05,279
logarithmic or exponential however you

1517
01:17:54,809 --> 01:18:15,690
want to look at it so if what you're

1518
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:19,009
doing there is this is distance and this

1519
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:24,149
is time I'll say this is distance from

1520
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:26,489
Target then what your site effectively

1521
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:30,779
doing is saying well I'm always gonna

1522
01:18:26,488 --> 01:18:33,598
start off by moving the most right off

1523
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:37,288
the bat right because you've effectively

1524
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:39,179
got distance over ten right or stated

1525
01:18:37,288 --> 01:18:42,719
alternately distance divided by

1526
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:44,760
something right is your amount and so

1527
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,219
the higher the distance the more you

1528
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:50,190
will move and so the very first move is

1529
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:51,689
the most is most of the move right is

1530
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:53,969
that is the most you will ever do

1531
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:57,808
everything after that move will be less

1532
01:18:53,969 --> 01:19:04,590
right and so what you're gonna do is

1533
01:18:57,809 --> 01:19:06,599
you're gonna look like this right so

1534
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:08,969
this is what your approach curve looks

1535
01:19:06,599 --> 01:19:12,679
like it's like an asymptotic you know

1536
01:19:08,969 --> 01:19:12,679
kind of thing that that looks like that

1537
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:19,939
so you know like a hyperbola or

1538
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:22,939
something like this is what you would

1539
01:19:19,939 --> 01:19:24,529
think of for that kind of a curve and

1540
01:19:22,939 --> 01:19:26,448
it'll never get there right it'll never

1541
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:27,409
actually get to zero distance other than

1542
01:19:26,448 --> 01:19:29,839
the fact that floating point will

1543
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:33,079
eventually round it but that's what

1544
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:35,090
would actually happen and the reason

1545
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:36,649
that I wouldn't do something like that

1546
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:39,920
like I wouldn't really recommend that is

1547
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:43,069
there's no acceleration right it's

1548
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,289
instantaneous so it immediately jerks

1549
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,920
the camera as hard as possible towards

1550
01:19:45,289 --> 01:19:48,619
the target

1551
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,989
if the target somewhere else and you

1552
01:19:48,619 --> 01:19:53,238
know you probably want a little bit of

1553
01:19:50,988 --> 01:19:55,159
acceleration there right like I would

1554
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:57,879
argue the correct curve probably looks

1555
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:57,880
something like this

1556
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:10,550
you know because you want that camera to

1557
01:20:08,179 --> 01:20:11,840
like start moving a little bit just just

1558
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:13,400
even a little bit doesn't have to be

1559
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,869
huge and you don't want to feel sluggish

1560
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:15,920
necessary but it's like you want a

1561
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:17,539
little bit there you don't want to just

1562
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,190
have a massive instantaneous

1563
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:21,829
acceleration and then everything else is

1564
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:25,279
deceleration right because this is

1565
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:28,399
basically like instantaneous huge

1566
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:30,979
acceleration and then every other point

1567
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:32,599
is deceleration right decelerates here

1568
01:20:30,979 --> 01:20:37,250
decelerates here decelerate zero so it's

1569
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:38,510
here right so I wouldn't you know I mean

1570
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:39,920
there might be a reason why you would

1571
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:42,079
want to do that but I wouldn't recommend

1572
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,179
it because it really doesn't have a very

1573
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,590
flattering curve there I think and also

1574
01:20:44,179 --> 01:20:47,300
obviously it's time step dependent but

1575
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:50,150
you could make it you can make a time

1576
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:52,010
step independent one of these so I still

1577
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:52,750
just wouldn't recommend Nestle shaping

1578
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:55,750
the curve like that

1579
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,750
necessarily

1580
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:11,260
plants are adding camera shake or blur

1581
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,329
are similar if the hero gets hit or a

1582
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:18,969
boulder hits the ground near the hero

1583
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:21,308
yeah I mean probably I don't know those

1584
01:21:18,969 --> 01:21:24,989
are kind of polished sorts of stuff that

1585
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:32,349
I'm not sure how important it is to

1586
01:21:24,988 --> 01:21:33,879
think about like now but but they're

1587
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:35,769
definitely things that we might want and

1588
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,210
they're pretty trivial for us to

1589
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:41,670
implement right because we can shake the

1590
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:41,670
camera without having really to do much

1591
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,849
all right

1592
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,599
I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up

1593
01:22:24,369 --> 01:22:28,179
so silly looking now

1594
01:22:58,389 --> 01:23:07,819
that's just really silly all right let's

1595
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:09,110
go ahead and close that down thank you

1596
01:23:07,819 --> 01:23:10,309

have a forum site that is hosted at

1604
01:23:22,069 --> 01:23:25,488
handmade network now which is pretty

1605
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:27,500
cool you can check it out if you want to

1606
01:23:25,488 --> 01:23:29,988
