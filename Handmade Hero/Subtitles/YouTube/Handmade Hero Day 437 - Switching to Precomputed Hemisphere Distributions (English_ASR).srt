00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,370
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,778
Hero show recode a complete-game live on

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,490
stream we're gonna start the stream

4
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,650
today with a question we got because

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,839
it's actually very germane to what we're

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:17,640
doing

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:19,410
here on day 437 the question was I was

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,089
watching the previous stream came from

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,350
the trap I was watching for your stream

10
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:24,210
about getting better noise stamping and

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,550
wondering why you need any randomness if

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,859
you obtain a pretty and evenly well

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,480
covered sampling Hemisphere I think

14
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,429
that's a great question I think I kind

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,570
of mentioned the answer when we were

16
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,950
talking about letting before but we

17
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,579
didn't really harp on it and it is

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,149
important I think to harp on it simply

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,939
because it is a important thing to

20
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:53,039
understand about sampling and so let's

21
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:54,420
talk about it okay so what we need to

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,219
talk about is under sampling

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,929
specifically and the consequences of

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,280
under sampling because that's all we're

25
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:02,488
dealing them that's the whole thing

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,890
we're dealing with here right our

27
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:10,438
problem is that we have a system that we

28
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,750
know we could get perfect results from

29
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:15,389
if we just threw a ton of samples at it

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,849
right and we saw that happen when I turn

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,409
on the accumulation version and we just

32
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,978
let you know 60 frames or something

33
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,219
accumulate we end up with a nice pretty

34
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:30,090
stable lighting solution right so we

35
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:33,030
pretty much know for sure that there's

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,240
no problem with the algorithm if it was

37
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,909
off line our problem is with running the

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,408
algorithm on too few of samples right

39
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,630
having it have to produce a lighting

40
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,530
result without being able to sample as

41
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:50,429
much as it wants to that's all we're

42
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,180
doing right so the question that the

43
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,990
person had on chat is well why can't we

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,670
just not use random samples right why

45
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:01,890
can't we just say like alright you know

46
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,049
if I'm sampling here and I just sample

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,478
out in a few equally spaced directions

48
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,539
and I know that that won't have any

49
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:13,270
noise because you know it's not changing

50
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:15,129
the sampling directions isn't that

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:19,270
sufficient can't we just stop there

52
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:22,210
right and the problem with this is

53
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,250
because it's and and again the reason I

54
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,560
wanted to kind of open talking about it

55
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,500
is because it's critical to understand

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,460
what the functions domain is that you're

57
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,370
sampling and what will happen if you

58
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:43,870
undercover certain parts of that domain

59
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:48,840
as a result alright so let's look at

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,550
this lighting for our hemisphere is

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,590
talking about sampling a function that

62
00:02:51,550 --> 00:03:01,710
looks like this effectively right we

63
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,710
have a hemisphere

64
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,689
and that hemisphere for the surface we

65
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,849
could parameterize with two angles right

66
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:15,189
we could look at it as like how far

67
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:17,189
around the hemisphere you're going you

68
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:19,180
know and then how far up let's say

69
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,289
really anything we want

70
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,819
it doesn't matter there's just two

71
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:23,560
degrees of freedom doesn't matter how we

72
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:27,689
parameterize it but there's two degrees

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,949
of freedom to create a hemisphere right

74
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,359
and we could talk they could be anything

75
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,399
that could be X&amp;Y and then you just

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,750
normalize Z right or something right so

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,000
it doesn't matter what you put here I

78
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,219
don't care just any two parameters that

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,469
get us so that if we did the whole range

80
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,740
of them right like in this case like 0

81
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:47,520
to 2 pi and 0 to PI over 2 right because

82
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:50,170
you can only lift it up that high right

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,780
if we just do something there I don't

84
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:54,069
care what it is as if you densely

85
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,650
sampled it you would get the right

86
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,900
answer and then we have time right now

87
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,849
why do I include time in here well I

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,300
include time in here because this

89
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,579
function changes over time there's you

90
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,320
know a light and that light doesn't stay

91
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,959
here necessarily that light may move

92
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,750
over here over the course of a second

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,569
let's say and so as it moves we would

94
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,488
expect the the lighting answers to

95
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:25,449
change right they're not going to be the

96
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:30,519
same all right so let's suppose we hold

97
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:34,569
T constant so our game is not moving

98
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:38,168
it's just a static steam in the case

99
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:40,930
where it is just a static scene

100
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:44,259
what happens to our domain sampling

101
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,259
right we're sampling the hemisphere I'm

102
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,849
gonna look from top down because just

103
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,680
easier to talk about it we don't need

104
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,419
the extra dimension really so we can

105
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,769
even just think about one of these

106
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:59,680
dimensions at this point which is theta

107
00:04:53,769 --> 00:05:01,629
right so as I'm sampling what I'm doing

108
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,360
is I'm looking out into the world and

109
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:07,659
I'm seeing the sorts of things that I

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,610
hid out here and sometimes because of

111
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,520
the sampling density I will miss things

112
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:16,710
entirely right they just I just won't

113
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:19,539
hit them make sense

114
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:21,729
now normally if we were doing rate

115
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,740
racing for reals in an offline renderer

116
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,270
we would be rate racing from way more

117
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,160
points than we're rate racing from right

118
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,839
now right now we're only rate racing

119
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,320
from like like for example one little

120
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:34,750
point here at the centre of this big

121
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,209
reflector right or maybe for points one

122
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,339
in each corner or something right but

123
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:41,620
normally in a ray tracer we'd be tracing

124
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:46,779
from lots of individual little points

125
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,730
right and so the question of if we were

126
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:52,389
to take randomness out of the system

127
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,730
right because randomness means that

128
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,169
every time we sample we will get

129
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,330
slightly different answers if we're

130
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,340
under sampled right because sometimes

131
00:05:58,329 --> 00:06:02,139
we'll hit things like sometimes we'll

132
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:04,899
randomly hit this and sometimes we

133
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:09,039
randomly won't that leads to noise in

134
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:11,289
the answer that we see right so as these

135
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,850
vectors jitter around sometimes they hit

136
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,530
brighter things sometimes they get

137
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,590
darker things that's the source of the

138
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:19,029
noise so what the person on the chats

139
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,199
proposing is like why don't we just not

140
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,409
do that so the first answer is because

141
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,269
okay

142
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,390
something not relevant to our game let's

143
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:30,370
say this or just an offline ray tracer

144
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:32,860
what would happen is the noise that you

145
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,209
now no longer see in terms of the

146
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,350
changing brightness of a particular

147
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:40,989
point goes into noise across points so

148
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:45,580
this point and this point and this point

149
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,930
will all hit differently right so some

150
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,250
of them will be brighter and some of

151
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,639
them will be darker and you'll end up

152
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,790
with noise there right so what the

153
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,099
temporal noise attempts to do is smooth

154
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,960
that noise out by giving everyone a

155
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,570
little bit of flicker so that over time

156
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:05,139
they still look like they're all roughly

157
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:06,759
the same amount of lighting right so by

158
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:08,889
locking it in what you're effectively

159
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,750
saying is well now I'm gonna have stark

160
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,490
lighting changes especially if we said

161
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,189
we're gonna use the same hemisphere for

162
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,230
every point then you would see like you

163
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:20,168
know dark dark dark bright bright bright

164
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,430
dark dark dark as you've moved across it

165
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:25,930
would be like these little bands right

166
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,009
to be really bad okay but so maybe you

167
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,870
don't care about that because that's not

168
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,509
what we're doing right so that's fine so

169
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,069
now let's talk about

170
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,689
releasing this constant right instead of

171
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:36,790
willing T constant let's talk about what

172
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:37,269
happens when a light moves through the

173
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,850
scene

174
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:43,329
well now what happens is you get really

175
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,950
bad behavior because as this light moves

176
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,719
through the scene that noise that was

177
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:49,000
previously distributed amongst pixels in

178
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,940
the offline case is now distributed over

179
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,519
frames in our case instead of having a

180
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:56,800
little bit of flicker but generally the

181
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:59,049
right lighting amount what we have is a

182
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,990
stable lighting that appears to be dark

183
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,759
as the light moves across this ray it

184
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,460
becomes bright all of a sudden and then

185
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,740
as it moves away it becomes dark again

186
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:10,870
right so what you've done is you've

187
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,759
pushed a flicker that was happening

188
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,069
across frames that was just gentle and

189
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:19,149
consistent but reflective of the actual

190
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:21,159
lighting into a perfectly solid very

191
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,689
dark color that then gets very bright

192
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,370
all of a sudden and then very dark again

193
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:29,860
right and so what I'm trying to impress

194
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:34,379
upon you is that when you are under

195
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:38,288
sampled if you do not want to have

196
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:40,570
randomness in your initial sample you're

197
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:42,338
still going to get the noise coming out

198
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,760
somewhere else the question is where is

199
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,330
it going to come out and at least for my

200
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,980
taste

201
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,500
actually if I have to pick between those

202
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,970
two in the end I'd rather have the

203
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,339
flicker especially cuz this is a night

204
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,980
time game most of our light sources are

205
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:59,380
going to be kind of flickery anyway I

206
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,050
would almost say the flicker that's more

207
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:04,899
accurate in you know on average is

208
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:09,269
actually better than perfectly stable

209
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:12,669
but highly erroneous result all the time

210
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:15,789
and so that's really how to think about

211
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:19,329
Monte Carlo if you take randomness out

212
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:22,870
of a sampling problem that really does

213
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:25,210
have a very complex domain you're going

214
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,049
to push the noise somewhere the question

215
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:32,290
is where do you push it and all the way

216
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:33,729
you could literally summarize all of the

217
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:37,838
techniques involved in Monte Carlo

218
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:41,649
sampling they are all about only one

219
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,329
thing and that is pushing the noise to

220
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:47,328
the least objectionable play

221
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:49,979
that is all that all of them are about

222
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:52,349
because there is no way to get rid of

223
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,740
noise in a Monte Carlo problem that

224
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:59,100
you're under sampling period the noise

225
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,350
is there the question is how do you push

226
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:07,290
the noise to the place that causes the

227
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:09,089
lease objection all visual artifacts all

228
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:16,198
right hopefully that clarifies things a

229
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:20,310
little bit I and yeah and that explains

230
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:21,838
a little bit more about why you it's not

231
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:23,789
as simple as just saying well you know

232
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,139
we know that it's stable if we don't

233
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,458
introduce any noise so how about we just

234
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,519
don't introduce any noise it's like well

235
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:31,919
that noise we're introducing is actually

236
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,339
pushing noise that we don't want out of

237
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,929
the place that it previously was and it

238
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,759
is important to push it out of that

239
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:41,370
place so we're moving the noise from one

240
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,230
place to another I think to a place that

241
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,209
we actually would prefer it to be in

242
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,938
this case but again those are decisions

243
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,289
you're free to make like I said the

244
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,120
important thing to understand is you're

245
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,909
not getting rid of the noise you're

246
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,409
moving the noise always so you have to

247
00:10:53,909 --> 00:11:00,179
just think about are you moving it to

248
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:02,129
the best place that it could go right so

249
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,419
anyway and like I said you know just

250
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,429
looking at the way the lighting is

251
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,049
working at the moment I also do think

252
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:09,000
like that flicker is not really

253
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,429
objectionable to me if you imagine this

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,039
light source is supposed to be a candle

255
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:16,229
or a fire or a torch right it actually

256
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:18,028
looks just fine and so since this game

257
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,970
does take place at nighttime I would be

258
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:22,110
inclined to leave that noise in so that

259
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,990
we don't get some of the more

260
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:30,000
objectionable artifacts in other cases

261
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:31,528
as well right so that's probably the way

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,049
I would summarize what's going on at the

263
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:36,509
moment hopefully that makes some sense

264
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:39,750
if it doesn't I apologize

265
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:42,300
but yeah but there you go so at the end

266
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,159
of the last stream time I was talking

267
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:45,479
about how to introduce blue noise onto

268
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:47,759
the sphere and you can see we made a

269
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,199
sphere here that's a blue noise based

270
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:55,230
sphere and the questions that sort of we

271
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:57,149
were working on was just how exactly we

272
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:01,860
would allow this sphere

273
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:05,250
to have its points very so that we could

274
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,769
sample neighborhoods around these points

275
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,360
more efficiently right and the other

276
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,360
thing that we needed to figure out is

277
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,519
how we were going to ask cast coherent

278
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,250
Rea bundles this coincidentally is also

279
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,199
a problem that we would have if we went

280
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,370
with the spiral based sampling speech

281
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,990
schemes same problem we just need some

282
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,379
algorithm on the back end to figure out

283
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:30,180
how we cluster these into bundles that

284
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,580
will probably hit similar geometry

285
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:34,139
because the more disparate the bumble

286
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,370
the bumble that's good

287
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:40,799
I like that array bumble I guess so

288
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,889
if you put rays together that are

289
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,629
coherent maybe that's a ray bundle but

290
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:49,370
if you put rays together that are

291
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:56,370
incoherent maybe that's a ray bumble

292
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:58,620
anyone any takers whatever anyway so

293
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,919
putting those together into a coherent

294
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,049
ray bundle so that's for example these

295
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,579
four are picked to send together because

296
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,919
they go out in similar directions as

297
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,750
opposed to say picking this one that one

298
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,009
that one in that one which would all go

299
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,600
in completely different directions and

300
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,639
never need to do any of the same

301
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,670
geometry tests those will have

302
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,909
significant effects on our performance

303
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:23,639
because we're not doing any kind of ray

304
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:26,490
re-up we don't once a ray has terminated

305
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,429
we don't really have a good way to re

306
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,049
stream it in so all of our rays go

307
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,029
through all of the checks that all of

308
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,879
the Rays need to do in the bundle and

309
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:39,620
that means that the closer they are to

310
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:44,120
hitting the same stuff the better right

311
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:50,429
so that's you know that's where we're at

312
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:52,080
so given that yeah I don't know if I

313
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,199
just want to cluster things on this or

314
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
what

315
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:03,879
we could do some kind of K clusters on

316
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,880
this to produce some clusters of four

317
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,770
I'm not sure what else we might want to

318
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,220
do there the other interesting thing

319
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,990
about this is you know if you imagine

320
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,980
tessellating this sphere and producing

321
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,690
your analyst inside if that's another

322
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:26,028
way to go anyway

323
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:37,670
I don't remember I'm gonna take a look

324
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:39,320
here I don't remember if we saved our we

325
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,778
did so we've got you know a couple of

326
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,820
different things here in terms of sphere

327
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:45,439
creation right we have a couple

328
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,550
different ways in which the sphere is

329
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,990
getting created

330
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:53,469
so one thing we might want to do here

331
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:56,330
too is pull those out into you know

332
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:59,000
routine for generating this for just for

333
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,540
our own testing purposes really where we

334
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,500
can kind of say like okay let's you know

335
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:05,329
have some different routines we can

336
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,879
switch between well we're testing and

337
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,230
obviously we'll only weld one in when we

338
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,208
find the one that we definitely want to

339
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,500
use but you know for testing we may want

340
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,139
to be able to be a little more flexible

341
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,159
and switch between different

342
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:18,500
tessellations of the spheres that we can

343
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,120
actually use here right so I think the

344
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500
first thing we do is just get that into

345
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,080
place so that we can do some testing

346
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,458
with them and that'll basically be

347
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,100
something you know in here that we can

348
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:29,088
use to generate our sphere and play

349
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,769
around with it from there

350
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:34,040
so if you take a look at the way this

351
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:36,528
was working we've got this like points

352
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:42,139
buffer here and what I'd like to do is

353
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:44,120
just go ahead and make that you know

354
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:46,370
sort of an array out here we can we can

355
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,220
play with separately and I'll put a

356
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,828
little sample point count out here as

357
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,959
well although actually I guess we always

358
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:55,099
need to produce 64 of them so maybe you

359
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,449
know that can just be something that

360
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,028
happens only inside the routine I

361
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,190
suppose that's that should be fine um

362
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:03,559
and so then what I can do is I can kind

363
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,990
of make ways of creating these routine

364
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,199
ways of switching between which routine

365
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,000
we want to produce the sample points so

366
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,579
for example here where

367
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,589
I've got all this stuff I can grab this

368
00:16:13,578 --> 00:16:21,019
out like so and then make one routine

369
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:25,449
for the spiral and one routine for the

370
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,448
blue noise so here we go on

371
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:36,318
you know generate spiral samples or

372
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:39,578
something like this and generate song

373
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:42,620
samples Poisson obviously being another

374
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:44,688
way of referring to blue noise or a

375
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,370
pull-on rather as a pattern that happens

376
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:50,599
to exhibit blue noise might be a better

377
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,209
way to say that so here is our spiral

378
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,778
sample this is the spiral sample version

379
00:16:53,208 --> 00:17:00,169
we had here oops that the wrong place

380
00:16:56,778 --> 00:17:04,880
there we go so if I take a look at what

381
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:08,078
happens here what I can do is make it so

382
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:13,819
that we pass in the random series here

383
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:19,149
and that way as it goes we should be

384
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:19,149
able to know

385
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,509
okay I'll do it this way

386
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,950
so as we do the sampling from the series

387
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,029
this will make it so it doesn't affect

388
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:42,779
anything else just uses that as the

389
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:45,480
starting point and that should do

390
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,519
everything else correctly except when we

391
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,319
go to do the push cube here what I'm

392
00:17:47,519 --> 00:18:00,329
going to do instead is just retire the

393
00:17:49,319 --> 00:18:04,490
point so in the destination and what I

394
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,490
want to do here is go ahead and

395
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:20,940
hard-code this so what I want to do here

396
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:23,009
is I just want to say okay as this goes

397
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,779
through we're going to take 64 samples

398
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:27,599
we're gonna write them into dest

399
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:30,690
so the index is just gonna tell us where

400
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:34,349
to put this thing we're not gonna do

401
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:36,210
that and so the rest of this routine is

402
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:37,980
fine as it is it just goes ahead and

403
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,829
writes us in there we don't need the sub

404
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:46,470
indexing at the moment of that

405
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:48,990
and this so there is our spiral without

406
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,929
any noise just the basic spiral that

407
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:58,319
gets put in there and then here is our

408
00:18:51,929 --> 00:19:03,690
plus on version which of course means

409
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:06,259
fish in French just kidding this

410
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,808
person's name

411
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:10,710
although plus song is also fish in

412
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:18,089
French doesn't matter

413
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:20,038
point being I as we go through here we

414
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:23,490
will just replace it and right to the

415
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,169
destination array exactly as we were

416
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,190
writing to the one outside but this time

417
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:31,860
you know we let it pass it in there and

418
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:34,080
yeah I think that's really all we need

419
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:36,719
to do so those are our two ways of

420
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,579
generating samples and then when we

421
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,308
generate those samples now down here

422
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,599
where we're going to draw them what I

423
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:45,359
can do is

424
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,699
when we take the normal here instead of

425
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,928
doing any of this stuff to it what I'm

426
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,600
going to do instead is just say all

427
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:56,548
right let's take the sample points that

428
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:58,859
we recorded or saying we will record in

429
00:19:56,548 --> 00:20:02,129
our solution and just draw whatever

430
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:05,398
those were then what we can do is when

431
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:09,929
you actually initialize the lighting we

432
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:13,678
can not that I know where we do that

433
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:15,120
anymore but there it is so when we

434
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,038
initialize the lighting we can

435
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,918
initialize the lighting with one of

436
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,869
these two doesn't matter which one but

437
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,639
for example if I want spiral samples now

438
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:28,459
I just say okay Ron should do the spiral

439
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:49,709
samples into my sample points buffer and

440
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:53,269
that'll be bad you have to replace the

441
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:56,848
point count with the fixed point count

442
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:56,848
[Music]

443
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:04,849
and we should be good to go

444
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:24,700
area and let's take a look so we should

445
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:26,529
hopefully if that was correct we should

446
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,450
now have the spiral sample in there

447
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:36,279
right there is our spiral sample which

448
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:40,900
again is quite nice and if we want to we

449
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:44,940
can switch that to our our blue noise

450
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:47,769
sample and I can make I could make a key

451
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:59,160
that would switch between these as well

452
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:59,160
so you know if I go into world mode here

453
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:15,000
you know we could bind the f9 keys to

454
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,240
generate these

455
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:50,319
so this way if we wanted to test like

456
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:53,680
say the difference between these two or

457
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:58,659
something like that run time you know I

458
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:02,170
can or should in theory be able to did

459
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,660
not work very well did it I should be

460
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:16,870
able to do that fairly trivially where

461
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:22,029
is my seems like this is having some

462
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:28,239
trouble inserting due to the cosine

463
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:30,129
measurement um the other thing too I

464
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,970
wonder here is if we should try to make

465
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:35,230
this a more efficient generator but

466
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:39,370
that's kind of a separate issue I

467
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:43,809
suppose so if we take a look at this

468
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:48,099
here the maximum cosine it has to be

469
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:52,240
higher than that so we would like this

470
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:53,919
value to be larger yes because the

471
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,589
higher I'm sorry ought to be smaller

472
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,730
right because the smaller this value is

473
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:59,730
the better for us I think

474
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:20,320
because the closer it would be to one so

475
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:28,000
I think if we make this value lower

476
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:31,509
we're in better shape right yeah so

477
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
there we go so the other nice thing

478
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:36,099
about this is since it uses a random

479
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,009
series that is updating every time it

480
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:42,609
also means we can generate as many of

481
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:44,879
these as we want right now our spiral

482
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:49,569
sample at the moment is not randomized

483
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,950
so it's pretty hard for us to tell about

484
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:51,939
that distribution because we don't

485
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,370
really have any Renison there where it's

486
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,759
the blue noise one you can see we have a

487
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:59,109
lot of random sampling options there

488
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:05,819
right because it'll always produce a

489
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:08,469
random sampling there I'm not sure

490
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:12,250
exactly what we want to do with the

491
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:17,019
spiral per say in terms of generating

492
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:21,369
random samples from it we haven't looked

493
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:23,559
too hard at how that function works so

494
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:26,619
it's kind of hard to say anyway

495
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:30,099
regardless of any of that once these

496
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:36,279
things are generated we could now

497
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:38,049
actually try using them for our sampling

498
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,450
just by feeding them directly in now

499
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:42,700
unfortunately we don't have any like I

500
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,400
said clustering of these that's kind of

501
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,620
the hard part now is to figure out how

502
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:52,180
we want a cluster for arrays together on

503
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:54,129
any given one of them right because

504
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,930
neither of these two emits a

505
00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:00,010
straightforward way of figuring out

506
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:01,700
which ones should be attached right

507
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:04,798
which ones

508
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,798
[Music]

509
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:10,619
which ones we should be looking at so

510
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,840
for example let's just go ahead and I'll

511
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:18,418
show you kind of what this what this

512
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,889
implies if we take a look at how we're

513
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:25,049
drawing these here where we do the push

514
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:30,570
cube right if we were to do that again

515
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:33,538
here where instead of drawing cubes we

516
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:38,849
actually just drew a line between the

517
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:47,038
two points that's there I'll show you

518
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:48,750
what I mean so let's suppose we take the

519
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,079
previous point and this point and we

520
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:55,259
connect the two of them with a line so I

521
00:26:52,079 --> 00:27:00,349
do push line segment and I say you know

522
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:05,579
I'm going to go from P plus normal a to

523
00:27:00,349 --> 00:27:14,298
P plus normal B and then you know we

524
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:16,769
just have some color flow line like so

525
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:18,418
then what we could do is we can see if

526
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:20,099
we were to just group them in groups of

527
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:27,419
four you can sort of see what would

528
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:29,730
happen with our pairing right so looks

529
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:32,990
like I've got something room slightly

530
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:37,220
wrong there what did I do wrong there oh

531
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,220
I don't need to offset these

532
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:50,450
sorry about that they're just they're

533
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,809
offset from just that constant they were

534
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:56,450
being offset from each other um so if we

535
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:59,119
take a look at this series right of

536
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,430
points you can kind of see that you know

537
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:05,509
the way the spiral algorithm puts them

538
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:09,100
in place is kind of nuts right it just

539
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:13,460
it just goes like in this really

540
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:15,079
unfortunate kind of bounce pattern it

541
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,720
makes it so that we really just don't

542
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:21,069
know from one to the next well what we

543
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:23,569
do know is they won't be coherent right

544
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:26,059
so it's kind of hard for us to make a

545
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:28,250
lot of assumptions about that now maybe

546
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:30,589
we could do something where we just

547
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,119
reverse engineer this pattern enough so

548
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:34,669
that we can sort of say well we know

549
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,289
that the first four points will all be

550
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,660
kind of pointing upward so that's fine

551
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:41,750
and then after that you know we know

552
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:44,950
it's like okay well take every endpoint

553
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,450
maybe you know it's a little hard to say

554
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,660
so I'm not really sure about that one

555
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,490
the blue noise one is no better because

556
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,230
it's gonna be completely random or

557
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,569
should be based on the way we generated

558
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,190
it like you can see here right it's just

559
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,349
kind of connected all over the place

560
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,450
so again no real rhyme or reason to it

561
00:29:00,349 --> 00:29:04,399
now we could have generated this in a

562
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,750
more coherent pattern what we would have

563
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:12,200
done is started with a point and

564
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:14,000
branched out from that point but even so

565
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,000
again it could still form kind of

566
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,630
relatively long chains that wouldn't be

567
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,490
the closest clusters together so you

568
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:27,140
know again I'm not really sure there's a

569
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:31,069
lot to do here the spiral pattern

570
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:39,590
definitely gives us the most plausible

571
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:42,139
way we could it's the one we'd be most

572
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:44,779
likely to figure out a rote algorithm

573
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:50,200
for certainly more so than the blue

574
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:52,099
noise the blue noise definitely you know

575
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,830
the blue noise would definitely be

576
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:58,548
harder because there is no sort of

577
00:29:54,829 --> 00:30:00,259
yes correlation there so I'm not sure

578
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:01,369
exactly what we want to do we could take

579
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:05,960
a look at the the other one there

580
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:07,759
whether we want to use some like you

581
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:13,970
know other kind of sampling patterns

582
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:19,009
there are like let's see know if there's

583
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:21,798
any other interesting points for

584
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:24,648
hemisphere sang but like something that

585
00:30:21,798 --> 00:30:33,918
has a specific let me see if this has

586
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:35,239
some diagrams in it here's like a Halton

587
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,759
sequence was the one that I was thinking

588
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,259
of unfortunately I don't it doesn't seem

589
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:56,710
like they actually they don't have a

590
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:56,710
diagram of it here yeah come on people

591
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:18,410
here we go these are hammer Selena

592
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:22,009
halting parts that those are related

593
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:27,130
though I don't remember they're they're

594
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:27,129
more mostly the same right mr. year

595
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:48,630
again mostly results but not oh there we

596
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:48,629
go

597
00:31:54,769 --> 00:32:00,960
so here's Halton points and here's

598
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:06,450
Hamersley points these are the diagrams

599
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:10,048
I think that we want here right so here

600
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:13,798
we go this is I guess random for

601
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:16,410
comparison and here are various p-values

602
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:18,650
for the sequence which I mean that looks

603
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,778
really nice right

604
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,778
[Music]

605
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:38,269
here are Halton points with different

606
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:39,829
bases on this right so I'm not sure what

607
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:42,889
they were using for bases right because

608
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:46,759
these are 2d planes so it's kind of hard

609
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:48,230
to say how they were mapping them on

610
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,420
exactly right that's the thing is

611
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:56,170
because Halton amorously points are 2d

612
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,170
tilings of points and I'm not sure

613
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,250
see here they've they're talking about

614
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:12,269
basically how they're gonna put them on

615
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,269
to a hemisphere right

616
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:39,679
so my question is it's not directly

617
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,379
answered here but I assume that the

618
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:46,400
answer is yes the reason I mentioned

619
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:50,420
these points sets more specifically is

620
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,179
just because if you look at how these

621
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:56,750
point sequences work they're made to

622
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:58,759
sort of progressively refine as you go

623
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,519
further into them which made me think

624
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:03,679
that you would maybe be able to more

625
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:10,000
easily figure out how to bundle rays

626
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,000
together with them right let me see

627
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,949
so for example here you go red is 1

628
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,648
through 10

629
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:37,049
blue is 11 through 100 and green is 100

630
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:39,449
through 256 now don't ask me why they're

631
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:42,570
split in that way I guess but you can

632
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:48,000
kind of see how they scatter fairly

633
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:51,690
regularly like amongst the sets so you

634
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,909
don't get for example a lot of red

635
00:34:51,690 --> 00:35:00,420
points next to each other which is the

636
00:34:53,909 --> 00:35:02,400
important part here so you know my

637
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,019
thinking there was perhaps you could

638
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,309
come up with something a little bit more

639
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:12,449
a little bit more regular for sampling

640
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:22,019
the sphere and getting randomness around

641
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:24,239
a particular point so I don't know so it

642
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,130
may be that we want to investigate you

643
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:29,009
know some other series as well that

644
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,200
would be a little bit easier to make it

645
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,640
go you can see what the algorithm is

646
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,389
here it's not you know particularly

647
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,389
complicated right

648
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:54,980
and the other problem is it's kind of a

649
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:56,930
recurrence relation here so you kind of

650
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,900
have to keep running state as you go

651
00:35:56,929 --> 00:36:11,029
which I don't know how problematic that

652
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:13,160
would be for us probably not really yeah

653
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:19,280
I don't necessarily know that we care

654
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:21,969
too much about that anyway but again

655
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,220
it's a little bit it's a little bit iffy

656
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:27,500
so I'm not sure if we want to go one of

657
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:29,119
those routes if we had infinite time I

658
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,039
think the best thing to do would be to

659
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,710
implement lots of different syriza's on

660
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,889
the sphere and take a look at which ones

661
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:41,630
were easiest to control given what we

662
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:44,239
have at the moment I guess what I would

663
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:47,630
say my first inclination is to take a

664
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:51,229
brief look and see if the spiral version

665
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:53,329
is possible to glean a little bit more

666
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,940
structure from how it is being generated

667
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:58,519
such that we could more easily generate

668
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,250
points next to each other or know which

669
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:03,739
of these points were next to each other

670
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:07,610
and then furthermore to jitter them to a

671
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:10,339
certain degree right or whether that is

672
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:15,140
not going to be possible and then

673
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:18,170
furthermore to yeah to make sure that

674
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:19,730
that can be done over time so my first

675
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,880
inclination is to take a look at that I

676
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:27,800
would like to maybe have some idea of

677
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:30,260
the ordering of these points a little

678
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,940
bit so I think what I would like to do

679
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,850
is introduce a color sequence that

680
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,789
allows me to more clearly see visually

681
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:39,349
what's going on with the points I'm

682
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:41,559
going to turn off the lines for now

683
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:45,529
because I don't necessarily need that

684
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:47,690
what I would like to see instead is a

685
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:51,500
sequence so I manage juices a structured

686
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:55,010
sequence of colors here so that I can

687
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,239
see pretty clearly what's going on so

688
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,440
what I'm going to say is I'm going to

689
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:04,539
start with red

690
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:13,690
go to green go to blue then I'm gonna go

691
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:17,769
to yellow cyan and white black one two

692
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:21,269
three four five six seven I and oh sorry

693
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:21,269
I forgot one magenta

694
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:31,720
white and black maybe we'll start with

695
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:36,760
black and with like so they'll get a

696
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:40,089
black red green blue yellow cyan magenta

697
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:45,160
white and that way I can sort of see the

698
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:55,960
colors as they go so here where I would

699
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:58,480
be drawing cube this whole thing there

700
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,159
we go here where I would be drawing cube

701
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,170
instead of always using white I'm going

702
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:08,559
to use a color from the table so what

703
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:11,530
I'm going to do is going to say give me

704
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,940
the color from the color table that's

705
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:19,750
whatever is indicated by the point index

706
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:22,090
and just wrap you know so this will

707
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:25,389
because we have eight this will give us

708
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:29,108
eight sets of of eight permutations of

709
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:31,569
this color table basically so now we can

710
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:36,309
at least see a little bit about a little

711
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:42,280
bit about how these colors go I realized

712
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:43,719
I forgot the trailing one there and

713
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,220
hopefully this will just let me see a

714
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:46,929
little bit more about what the pattern

715
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:49,929
looks like because at the moment right

716
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:54,309
obviously don't really know and so

717
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:57,339
here's the spiral and so if we take a

718
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:59,139
look at this pattern here you can see

719
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:03,460
that we start with black on the top

720
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:04,809
right so and we can almost see you know

721
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,570
you can really actually see the way

722
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:12,018
these things curve down now that I look

723
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:14,750
at it right so every eight points

724
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:21,679
kind of produces almost like a try strip

725
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:24,170
pattern right coming down here which to

726
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,778
me is actually very interesting I I

727
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,818
could probably make interesting use of

728
00:40:26,778 --> 00:40:32,000
this to a certain extent so let's take a

729
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:34,849
look at the black spiral for example so

730
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,329
the black spiral starts up at the top

731
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:40,539
here to move this down a little bit

732
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:40,539
lower

733
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,910
so this the this black spiral starts

734
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:58,159
here and as it comes down you know the

735
00:40:55,909 --> 00:41:00,019
initial point is probably gonna be a

736
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,269
special point so you know point zero is

737
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:05,719
a little degenerate and I'm not sure

738
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:09,559
exactly how we would process it but one

739
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:14,000
thing you know let's ignore that one for

740
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:15,559
a moment if we ignore that top one then

741
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:34,130
what you can see here is that the black

742
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:38,450
and blue so that's here and here so the

743
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:41,838
zero and three entries form a nice sort

744
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:43,759
of tessellation there that you could do

745
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:47,889
you know you can make quads essentially

746
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,890
between those if you had wanted to right

747
00:41:48,699 --> 00:41:56,798
so I guess you know the one way to look

748
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,798
at this would be let's do it this way

749
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:09,568
so if we wanted to we could even sort of

750
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:13,679
draw that out right we could draw that

751
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:17,130
pattern pretty directly so let me

752
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:25,440
actually do that just so you can see

753
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:46,619
what I mean so how many of these are

754
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:48,539
there 1 1 2 well you know 1 2 3 so one

755
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:50,608
problem that you do get though if I look

756
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:53,039
at this right is it kind of becomes too

757
00:42:50,608 --> 00:43:02,400
eccentric as it goes so there's really

758
00:42:53,039 --> 00:43:08,548
no fill down here 1 2 3 4 5 and then you

759
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:10,798
got these two here so it does seem like

760
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:17,400
maybe okay so maybe that's barking up

761
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:18,809
slightly the wrong tree there right so I

762
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,099
may not be ill I was gonna think I was

763
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:23,880
gonna say that maybe that would be a

764
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:29,130
pretty easy way to create regions that

765
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:31,289
could be sampled in regularly but not so

766
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:33,690
much as it turns out because of the way

767
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:37,170
those are not gonna quite line up as

768
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:41,190
they strip down the sphere there's a

769
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:42,088
little too much triangularity to it now

770
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,369
there's anything wrong with that but

771
00:43:42,088 --> 00:43:47,000
just makes it not as attractive as what

772
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:47,000
I thought it might be

773
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:54,248
so I want to take a look too let's let's

774
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,869
look at a couple other things now that

775
00:43:54,248 --> 00:43:57,868
I've got that so it's pretty easy to see

776
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:17,798
when we generate our spiral samples here

777
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:22,059
I if I twiddle this value here so the

778
00:44:17,798 --> 00:44:24,068
3.0 that's that's the value we know that

779
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:28,479
we want to at least be something above

780
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:32,768
two right because we don't want the full

781
00:44:28,478 --> 00:44:34,239
sphere if it was just zero then I mean

782
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:36,429
if it was just one we would get the

783
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,829
whole sphere two gives us a hemisphere

784
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:42,338
because we're only going to go half way

785
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:44,199
down so then the question is well what

786
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:48,130
happens if we do less than that you know

787
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:51,999
kind of scrunches up right which is sort

788
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:54,209
of one way of keeping us from sampling

789
00:44:51,998 --> 00:45:01,419
direct you know directions that are way

790
00:44:54,208 --> 00:45:02,858
non-contributory that said however we're

791
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,499
free to kind of pick anything in there

792
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:08,318
so I'm wondering what happens as we vary

793
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:12,058
that value a little bit so what I'm

794
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,058
gonna do here is I'm just gonna say

795
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:17,708
let's have a sphere amount here it's

796
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:21,899
gonna be two point O plus random

797
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,899
unilateral let's say 2.0

798
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:40,259
so now every time i generate i'll get

799
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:47,129
some coverage of the sphere that's a

800
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:48,389
little bit different right so you can

801
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,009
kind of see that you know i basically

802
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:53,368
get the exact same points they just

803
00:45:50,009 --> 00:46:03,478
jitter vertically that you know pretty

804
00:45:53,369 --> 00:46:05,369
well right I would say it's not awful it

805
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:08,428
does produce different amounts of

806
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:11,789
clumping towards the top of course which

807
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:13,918
is not really what I want to have happen

808
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:16,649
but it does at least jitter that

809
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:23,578
direction okay and then similarly if I

810
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:25,679
wanted to I believe that just offsetting

811
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:28,739
the theta would probably spin it as well

812
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:39,809
right so if I said that I locked my

813
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:41,909
sphere amount in as sweep right now if I

814
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:49,079
take my theta offset and I do a random

815
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:51,179
unilateral up to say 2 pi well I don't

816
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,318
remember how this affects the series

817
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:54,318
either but I'm interested to see

818
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:16,739
keep wanting to do that and so if we

819
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:19,230
take a look at that so that's not what I

820
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:21,359
wanted and you know what that's because

821
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,090
I did this originally I think as well

822
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,710
theta is the wrong place to do that so

823
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:33,210
really what we want it's it's a row

824
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:35,990
offset here let's fix that so that

825
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,990
should spin us around

826
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:51,809
so that's better in terms of spinning

827
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:56,429
right so now if I combine the two of

828
00:47:51,809 --> 00:48:09,659
these together you know in theory this

829
00:47:56,429 --> 00:48:11,940
should give me something that generally

830
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:25,349
covers the sphere okay

831
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:36,090
hard to say really right but it's at

832
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:38,009
least not awful right and if you take a

833
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,900
look at you know one of the appealing

834
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:42,630
things about this obviously is that it's

835
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,450
pretty cheap to compute as well right

836
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,960
there's not a lot of math in here so we

837
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:51,659
could actually compute this for every

838
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:55,260
sample set probably and we'd probably be

839
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:56,940
okay however obviously there's a little

840
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,290
bit of an issue here which is that we

841
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,019
still have to do the one thing that I

842
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:05,039
was talking about before which is decide

843
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:07,199
from the randomness we actually need to

844
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,639
figure out how to cast points together

845
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:14,189
right so points that will end up being

846
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:16,319
somewhat close to each other so going

847
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:18,869
back to the colorist to see if I can do

848
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:30,840
much with that you know if we were to

849
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:32,460
cast say you know points 0 1 2 &amp; 3

850
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,890
together those would certainly be

851
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:39,900
reasonable then the next one here is

852
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:45,299
this next point here we would want to

853
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:49,170
cast that effectively with with it

854
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:53,280
probably with the red we'd probably want

855
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:56,639
to cast those four together right so we

856
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,310
probably then want to do a fairly weird

857
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:59,259
like

858
00:49:57,309 --> 00:50:04,119
in pattern in terms of what gets cast

859
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:15,250
together it'd be like what is that point

860
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:22,420
number five for so it'd be like point

861
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:26,110
number four then point number nine for

862
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:32,490
and then nine and then the next two

863
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:36,610
would be like the eight offset from that

864
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:40,869
so I'm gonna try something here which is

865
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:43,240
again kind of dumb that's fine I'm

866
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:45,699
literally going to manually make the

867
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,859
sequence as my first thing

868
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:50,469
why am I gonna mail image videos well

869
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:52,870
because it's easy for us to go read the

870
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:56,439
sequence off now that we can see it and

871
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:58,719
so when I'm hoping is that if I manually

872
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,400
construct the sequence the series of

873
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:01,929
numbers that emerges will be something

874
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,070
that doesn't have to be manually

875
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:07,179
constructed right that will be clearer

876
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:09,880
and then we can see whether it actually

877
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:11,319
holds true across multiple jittering x'

878
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,970
as well which we don't know if it will

879
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:17,530
but we hope that it will based on how we

880
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:25,619
did that right so okay so let's take a

881
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:31,690
look here if we use our get current

882
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:34,779
quads loop if we use this this loop here

883
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:36,190
what I'm going to do I don't know why

884
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,210
we're still doing this placement because

885
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:39,210
we don't actually use it

886
00:51:45,409 --> 00:51:52,710
here we go so what I want to do here is

887
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,579
have a point sequence that we're gonna

888
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,429
use instead

889
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:59,269
so here what I'll do is say you know

890
00:51:56,429 --> 00:52:16,889
before oops

891
00:51:59,269 --> 00:52:18,630
we were doing it like this right we just

892
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:20,609
pick out the color and the normal like

893
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:22,110
so now we're going to do it slightly

894
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:23,940
differently when we push the key bond

895
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:26,220
here what we're going to do is we're

896
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:31,170
going to use the color as the color

897
00:52:26,219 --> 00:52:33,509
table point index mod array count clar

898
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:36,510
table as before this time it's going to

899
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,620
be point index divided by four because

900
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,970
we're going to take four points at a

901
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,139
time to put them into clusters because

902
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:43,199
that's what we have to raycast

903
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:54,059
right and then what we're going to do is

904
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:57,089
we're going to take the normal out of

905
00:52:54,059 --> 00:53:05,429
our cluster table and so here we go with

906
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:08,910
cluster table and inside the cluster

907
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:11,399
table we will just put the points that

908
00:53:08,909 --> 00:53:13,849
we want in there so you know if we did

909
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,849
nothing

910
00:53:39,329 --> 00:54:00,579
Tydeus a little bit more efficiently

911
00:53:41,380 --> 00:54:02,079
this way and compiled so in this case we

912
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:05,260
should get exactly the same thing we

913
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,869
were getting before only now when we

914
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:09,940
actually draw them we should get a well

915
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:18,099
you know we could get exactly the same

916
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:19,240
thing if we just do this right and so

917
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:21,818
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

918
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:24,939
actually try to get those clusters to

919
00:54:21,818 --> 00:54:27,969
come out so that we get things next to

920
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:29,318
each other by manually inserting these

921
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:31,509
samples so now I'm going to delete all

922
00:54:29,318 --> 00:54:34,808
this so everything is just going to be

923
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:37,630
point zero so we're just gonna see well

924
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:40,778
effectively nothing we're just going to

925
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:43,559
see the top point so now let's try and

926
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:47,079
work out what the cluster should be

927
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:52,000
based on what we said we saw there so

928
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:53,950
here's like all the points with their

929
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,510
sequences intact so what we're sort of

930
00:54:53,949 --> 00:54:58,118
saying is like well the first cluster

931
00:54:55,510 --> 00:55:00,670
you know if we wanted to sort of send a

932
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:05,230
series of rays at the top that was good

933
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:07,990
I guess I would say maybe this set

934
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:09,849
together makes some sense I don't know

935
00:55:07,989 --> 00:55:17,788
how you guys feel about that but that'd

936
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:17,789
be 0 1 3 5

937
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:42,550
one three six so if I switch back now

938
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:46,150
and look at that there's my cluster my

939
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:48,519
first cluster why is that black though

940
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:52,510
shouldn't be oh yes black is correct

941
00:55:48,519 --> 00:56:00,849
never mind so let's take a look at

942
00:55:52,510 --> 00:56:03,640
cluster number two so if I wanted to

943
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:07,719
send another cluster down now going down

944
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:12,569
the spiral it would it's just

945
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:13,869
pinks and reds from here on out right

946
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,930
now

947
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:25,659
I don't know those actually look a

948
00:56:16,929 --> 00:56:28,779
little more coherent so maybe not you

949
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:32,559
know maybe not if we're sending those

950
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:34,269
down together as the first tranche you

951
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,500
know maybe the next truck should be

952
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:40,289
these guys right here

953
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:48,159
so the first two yellows the first green

954
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:52,599
and the first white you know so yellow

955
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:58,569
is four so the first two yellows would

956
00:56:52,599 --> 00:57:00,460
be 4 and then 4 plus 8 right so 12 the

957
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:08,140
first green in the first white first

958
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:09,940
white is 7 and the first green is 2 so

959
00:57:08,139 --> 00:57:11,440
putting these in order not that we

960
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,150
really necessarily want them to because

961
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,519
but just because that may make them

962
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,519
slightly easier to see at first

963
00:57:20,289 --> 00:57:31,119
so there's another one another set and

964
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:35,710
again there's looks those look pretty

965
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:37,210
coherent and you know the other good

966
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:40,030
thing about them is they look coherent

967
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:43,599
no matter which randomization of the

968
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:48,460
spiral I'm using so that's also sort of

969
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:52,210
encouraging to a certain extent

970
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,710
oh so that's good as well all right

971
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,389
let's take a look at another one and

972
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,190
again I'm just going to do several of

973
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,839
these and see if I can see any pattern

974
00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:00,670
emerging north some way that I could

975
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,230
make force the pattern to emerge maybe

976
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:10,440
by changing a little bit of how I sign

977
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:10,440
it or who knows what right okay so

978
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:18,739
you know what I think might also be good

979
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:38,450
because as we get higher it's gonna be a

980
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:41,829
little harder to see I might do this so

981
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:41,828
this way I can see both at the same time

982
00:58:43,748 --> 00:58:49,748
and what I'll do here is I'll just say

983
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:58,369
I'll push the cluster table version out

984
00:58:49,748 --> 00:59:00,858
slightly further right so now you can

985
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:07,309
kind of see which ones of these are

986
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:09,558
already taken and furthermore I could

987
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:16,130
make that easier to see by maybe pushing

988
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:19,719
a line segment instead so what I could

989
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,719
do here is say like okay

990
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:46,150
so now you can see the raycast clusters

991
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,769
coming out as little lines but you can

992
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,869
still see the points there involves that

993
00:59:47,769 --> 00:59:56,829
way we don't have to guess about which

994
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:58,480
points go with what right so yeah so you

995
00:59:56,829 --> 01:00:00,940
know looking at that it's like alright

996
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:06,369
can we make another bundle that would

997
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:08,230
make sense here you know you can see the

998
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:12,359
problem with the triangularity is still

999
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:15,070
there it's just hey you know oh well

1000
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,390
because as you pick ones you're always

1001
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,580
going to be in situations where you get

1002
01:00:16,389 --> 01:00:20,289
some that aren't really great but here

1003
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:22,000
we go let's do some more so the next two

1004
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:29,400
Reds the next two Pink's would be fine

1005
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:33,579
as a cluster right so the next two Reds

1006
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:37,030
we've already used one so the next two

1007
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:42,009
Reds would be 1 plus 8 and 1 plus 16

1008
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:45,130
right and the Pink's we've already used

1009
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:54,790
1 pink if you were to use 6 so the next

1010
01:00:45,130 --> 01:01:04,289
two Pink's would be again 6 plus 8 and 6

1011
01:00:54,789 --> 01:01:12,279
plus 16 right 6 plus 16

1012
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:14,730
so yeah so something like that right and

1013
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,730
there they are

1014
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:20,440
and so at that point it seems like you

1015
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:23,559
then want to kind of switch a little bit

1016
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:26,849
it looks like you know then the next set

1017
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:31,089
of points probably wants to be blues

1018
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:32,950
maybe it's really hard to say cuz if you

1019
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:35,018
cast again you get really eccentric

1020
01:01:32,949 --> 01:01:38,288
there I don't know if there's a way

1021
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:41,498
around it right but you could sort of do

1022
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:45,849
something janky there and so like if I

1023
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:47,798
took if I took these guys together for

1024
01:01:45,849 --> 01:01:52,329
example that would be the next two

1025
01:01:47,798 --> 01:01:53,768
purples and these two blues here the

1026
01:01:52,329 --> 01:01:56,170
problem is then what do you do down here

1027
01:01:53,768 --> 01:01:59,108
right because you're starting to get

1028
01:01:56,170 --> 01:02:01,358
down to it there's and you're gonna

1029
01:01:59,108 --> 01:02:02,828
paint yourself into a corner so again

1030
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:05,078
it's really hard to know how you would

1031
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:10,028
really get these guys together

1032
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:14,068
I guess one man I just say I wonder if

1033
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:14,068
there's some virtue to skipping point-0

1034
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:21,999
you know I'm saying - skipping the top

1035
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:23,650
point because if you skip the top point

1036
01:02:21,998 --> 01:02:27,358
maybe that gives you a better alignment

1037
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:27,358
going forward I'm not sure

1038
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:38,650
but it could be that you know you can

1039
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:41,080
get you could get a little bit closer

1040
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:46,110
that way I'm not sure that's a good

1041
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:48,519
question hmm

1042
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:50,710
or if you did it like slightly offset

1043
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:52,539
like offset by 0.5 or something like

1044
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:54,010
that as you go down you know do you get

1045
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:57,070
something a little bit easier to

1046
01:02:54,010 --> 01:03:00,060
tessellate because that's what we're

1047
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:00,059
effectively trying to do right

1048
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:20,589
so I guess I really just don't have an

1049
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,590
opinion about that

1050
01:03:56,588 --> 01:04:00,469
so I'm a little bit tempted at this

1051
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:03,608
point just because I'm seeing how hard

1052
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:05,778
this is gonna be to keep these coherent

1053
01:04:03,608 --> 01:04:08,058
I'm also a little bit tempted to ask

1054
01:04:05,778 --> 01:04:14,559
what would happen if we just were doing

1055
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:17,089
a straight forward polar sphere so

1056
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:25,099
because we you know the spiral version

1057
01:04:17,088 --> 01:04:27,199
requires us to use sines and cosines

1058
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:28,338
anyways so we've already you know if we

1059
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:29,808
were going to go that route it's not

1060
01:04:28,338 --> 01:04:32,778
like sines and cosines are a big deal

1061
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:34,459
because we're already doing them so the

1062
01:04:32,778 --> 01:04:41,449
question would be like okay if we were

1063
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:45,429
going to do a straight up one that was

1064
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:45,429
just that long right

1065
01:04:54,199 --> 01:05:03,848
what would that look like so if we take

1066
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:08,570
a look at what that would look like I

1067
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:11,359
would want to divide into rings the

1068
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:15,109
sphere and I'd want to take certain

1069
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:16,639
samples around the Rings right so in

1070
01:05:15,108 --> 01:05:18,078
order to take certain samples around the

1071
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:19,719
ring is what we're gonna basically say

1072
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:22,010
is like okay

1073
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:23,689
and I guess technically these might be

1074
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:25,420
considered more like cylindrical samples

1075
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:29,000
I don't know how you want to say that

1076
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:31,190
but if you imagine taking the height so

1077
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,838
how many if we said how many slices

1078
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:40,119
around the ring do we want I don't know

1079
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:43,250
maybe we want 16 something like that

1080
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:46,010
then you know my height in this case is

1081
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:50,088
going to be something proportional to

1082
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:54,280
the slice amount so maybe 1.0 - the

1083
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:54,279
slice over the slice count right

1084
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:18,420
something like this and then of course I

1085
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:21,090
just want to take my I just want to take

1086
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,250
wherever I am on the disc and I probably

1087
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:28,350
want you know this to actually be sliced

1088
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:29,639
plus one in this case but I want to

1089
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:32,670
think wherever I am on the disc and I

1090
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:38,489
want to go out in my sine cosine fashion

1091
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:41,579
right so I've got my sign I've got my

1092
01:06:38,489 --> 01:06:54,659
cosine so now I want to place things

1093
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:55,469
around my slice and again I'm just gonna

1094
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:57,149
do this

1095
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:59,339
wrote at first and then we're going to

1096
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:01,110
tune it so we know we want 4 spokes

1097
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,160
around each slice we don't actually want

1098
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,150
to do that eventually we're gonna want

1099
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:05,789
to send a little bit more sophisticated

1100
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:08,599
but for now let's do it this way and

1101
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:12,179
then I'll say ok for each of the spokes

1102
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:15,210
you know whatever my theta is for the

1103
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:23,250
spoke is just going to be whatever its

1104
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:25,650
focus divided by the spoken and so then

1105
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:35,480
in here I can figure out what my x and y

1106
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:35,480
are don't ask me why this is still here

1107
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:47,789
and so what I can do here is just say

1108
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:50,940
all right I've got my theta like so and

1109
01:07:47,789 --> 01:07:57,179
I know that I'm just going to be

1110
01:07:50,940 --> 01:08:01,829
assigning as I go up my height right of

1111
01:07:57,179 --> 01:08:05,039
the slice is effectively telling me what

1112
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:06,630
my well let me just draw it for you

1113
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,559
because I can't really explain this in a

1114
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:22,020
good way with that pointing to a diagram

1115
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:25,619
so if I look at a hemisphere right as I

1116
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:27,650
go up effectively if I assume that I'm

1117
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:30,509
going to be on like a particular height

1118
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:33,210
then what that height effectively tells

1119
01:08:30,509 --> 01:08:34,680
me is it tells me you know looking at my

1120
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:37,710
right triangle that I would construct

1121
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:40,829
here it tells me what like sine theta is

1122
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:43,048
for this angle right and so if I wanted

1123
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:45,210
to know what this had to be it would

1124
01:08:43,048 --> 01:08:48,238
just be the cosine theta of that right

1125
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:50,730
or put another way Pythagorean theorem

1126
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:53,218
lies I know this is 1 and I know this is

1127
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:56,159
the value that I'm giving you is H so I

1128
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:58,250
know that H squared plus whatever the

1129
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:02,759
thing is that I'm looking for right I

1130
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:05,939
know that H squared plus R squared has

1131
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:08,939
to equal 1 well 1 squared which is still

1132
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:10,889
1 right so I know that if I just solve

1133
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:12,689
for how far that had to go out I would

1134
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:18,719
know that it's going to be the square

1135
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:20,068
root of 1 minus the H squared right and

1136
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,480
I know I don't want it to be negative so

1137
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:24,298
I know it's always positive here right

1138
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:26,579
so I know I could always figure out what

1139
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:30,210
that value should be which means I don't

1140
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:32,309
really need a sine or cosine for that so

1141
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:33,989
I know my radius in this case is always

1142
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:38,520
going to be equal to like the square

1143
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:40,048
root of 1 minus the square of the height

1144
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,549
and furthermore that's just you know

1145
01:09:40,048 --> 01:09:45,509
that's only persuade that's not going to

1146
01:09:41,548 --> 01:09:47,310
change right so I know in this case I

1147
01:09:45,509 --> 01:09:48,960
know what my Z is and in fact I could

1148
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:50,580
just call it my Z instead of my height

1149
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,770
right so I know what my Z

1150
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:55,079
is and then I know what my X and my Y

1151
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:59,340
are because my X and my Y in this case

1152
01:09:55,079 --> 01:10:00,960
are just going to be equal to the circle

1153
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,640
right the radius that I want to go out

1154
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,100
times the sine and cosine for the sweep

1155
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,140
around so at that point I pretty much

1156
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:11,670
just have my normal and I can just say

1157
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:13,860
like okay whatever the point I'm

1158
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:21,390
recording is just going to be that XY

1159
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:31,949
and Z and then I'm done right so this

1160
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:32,940
could just be called point count well I

1161
01:10:31,949 --> 01:10:35,569
guess I don't know what that is because

1162
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:39,839
we don't have that structure here so

1163
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:42,809
generate polar samples it's just another

1164
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,550
thing we could do here and I can make it

1165
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:50,300
in world mode I can make that be

1166
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:50,300
something that we look at

1167
01:11:03,789 --> 01:11:17,409
so now in addition to spiral sample blue

1168
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:23,889
toy sample we also have whatever this

1169
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:25,269
sample is right okay so actually and I

1170
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:27,010
think we did that pretty much correctly

1171
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:29,200
the first time except for we forgot our

1172
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:40,239
tau term so we're not doing the whole

1173
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:41,529
circle but other than that right because

1174
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:43,300
this is just going to range from what

1175
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:50,739
from zero to one and we needed to range

1176
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:52,630
from zero to two pi so there we go uh so

1177
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:55,090
here you can see yes sort of covering

1178
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:57,819
the hemisphere a little bit right but

1179
01:11:55,090 --> 01:12:01,659
not a lot because we've got way too many

1180
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:03,549
slices versus spokes in this case so

1181
01:12:01,659 --> 01:12:06,099
what I want to do here and I guess you

1182
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:07,659
know we could just reverse the numbering

1183
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:09,550
here or something or do eight and eight

1184
01:12:07,659 --> 01:12:11,800
or something like this but what we want

1185
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:14,680
to do hopefully you can see is we need

1186
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:18,100
to change the slice count sort of

1187
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:20,770
proportional to where we are in the

1188
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:25,710
sphere right because as we get closer to

1189
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:28,030
the top we don't need nearly as many as

1190
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:30,250
when we're down at the bottom when maybe

1191
01:12:28,029 --> 01:12:33,789
we maybe we might want more right it's

1192
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:35,439
hard to say so you know if we put this

1193
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:38,739
out the other way then you can see we've

1194
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:41,729
got good sampling kind of around the

1195
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:44,019
base but as we get up towards the top we

1196
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:45,549
we would like more here but we don't

1197
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,870
have enough slices for it and if we kept

1198
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:49,840
the slices going they would get way too

1199
01:12:46,869 --> 01:12:51,909
dense so what we can do instead is say

1200
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:55,260
something like oh okay maybe the spoke

1201
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:58,000
count is proportional to the slice count

1202
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:01,420
so you know maybe the slice count can be

1203
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,939
something higher but the Emmis boat

1204
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:05,829
count adjusts as it goes up so we've got

1205
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:09,339
you know some number of slices that go

1206
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:11,890
in here and then as we adjust the spoke

1207
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,619
count what we'll say is like okay you

1208
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:15,740
know maybe the

1209
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:18,500
vote count is starts out at four and

1210
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:19,849
goes up to 16 as we go right so let's

1211
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,289
just take a look so we can tune this

1212
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:22,730
ourselves and then we can make them we

1213
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:28,310
can make an expression for it once we

1214
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:31,819
have something that we've hand tuned to

1215
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:32,900
what we want right so in here with spoke

1216
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:35,869
count we're just going to say it's the

1217
01:13:32,899 --> 01:13:38,689
smoke table indexed by the slice amount

1218
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:40,519
and so let's say we did something that

1219
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:43,309
was like we know we've got eight of

1220
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:50,270
these so you know if we did something

1221
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:55,310
like this all right so let's see we did

1222
01:13:50,270 --> 01:14:01,570
something like I don't know how we doing

1223
01:13:55,310 --> 01:14:01,570
here that's 16 plus 16 plus 24 right

1224
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:05,180
oops

1225
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:10,760
I've been admonished to never use

1226
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:16,460
calculator on the screen there we go so

1227
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:20,360
6 yeah 16 plus 16 to 24 right so we have

1228
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:26,020
a little bit more to distribute there so

1229
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:26,019
you know maybe we do something like that

1230
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:34,899
so now we have 4 plus 4 plus 8 well 2

1231
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:39,769
times 4 plus 4 times 8 plus is that

1232
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:41,629
that's 2 times 12 right so you know I

1233
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:44,000
mean I'm just I'm winging it right I

1234
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:46,310
don't have any particular opinion about

1235
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,840
why this would be good or not I'm just

1236
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:53,570
trying to come up with something that

1237
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:56,770
seems plausible maybe right you know

1238
01:14:53,569 --> 01:14:56,769
maybe plausible

1239
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:05,559
and that slice wants to be able to get a

1240
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:07,599
little higher so I also think you know

1241
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:11,289
and since we're doing the spoke thing

1242
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:14,320
here you know also so this 1.0 - slice

1243
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:17,500
+1 I think maybe what we want to do is

1244
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:19,929
actually sort of put this inside here

1245
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:24,850
and say it's probably more like slice

1246
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:26,530
point 0.1 or something right so it's

1247
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:32,620
more like that so we do get a couple up

1248
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:33,789
at the top you know and then furthermore

1249
01:15:32,619 --> 01:15:40,809
you can see how these are sort of

1250
01:15:33,789 --> 01:15:43,840
distributed down as they go you want to

1251
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:47,020
kind of be less at you know you want I

1252
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:50,170
think this slice value also kind of

1253
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:53,770
wants to be more proportional right it

1254
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:55,690
wants to kind of go itself as a you know

1255
01:15:53,770 --> 01:16:01,660
as a cosign or something it wants to be

1256
01:15:55,689 --> 01:16:05,469
counter balanced so it will sort of

1257
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:07,989
progress at a different rate than that I

1258
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:12,640
don't know what the best waiting for

1259
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:14,859
that would be I'll try I'll try like

1260
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:18,910
changing that to you know maybe a square

1261
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:21,069
root first just to see if that helps

1262
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:23,849
we'll try a square in a square root just

1263
01:16:21,069 --> 01:16:23,849
to see what those look like

1264
01:16:29,539 --> 01:16:33,680
so that does shrink up towards the top

1265
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:36,250
but not really the way that I wanted

1266
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,250
that too

1267
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:57,659
so if we do something like pi32 that's

1268
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:59,760
gonna be one hemisphere we actually only

1269
01:16:57,659 --> 01:17:01,889
want half of that so if we were going to

1270
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,300
use like a sign to move it down just

1271
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:10,440
take a look at what that looks like

1272
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:16,560
oh that's too tight you something stupid

1273
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:17,069
there let me um oh I did do something

1274
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,390
stupid

1275
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:23,939
I put the slice coming I said I'm just

1276
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:29,010
going to take this out there we go so

1277
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:33,359
I'm gonna go ahead and take just this

1278
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:36,480
raw value says slice over slice count

1279
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:39,319
I'm gonna take that ratio out just so I

1280
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:41,729
can get it in here clean more cleanly

1281
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:43,739
there we go and we're probably gonna

1282
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:45,989
want to like I said offset this angle a

1283
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:47,670
little bit inside here because we're

1284
01:17:45,989 --> 01:17:54,689
gonna generate points right on top of

1285
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:59,100
each other there so here is us right

1286
01:17:54,689 --> 01:18:05,849
generating four points on top of each

1287
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:08,300
other there I'm gonna go ahead and look

1288
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,300
at this first

1289
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:14,549
that's still just that weights the

1290
01:18:12,449 --> 01:18:16,199
opposite way that I want it to so it

1291
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:20,750
looks like what we really want here is a

1292
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:20,750
cosine weighting of these points right

1293
01:18:28,609 --> 01:18:34,159
there we go and that's much better

1294
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:44,139
again so progressing a little bit

1295
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,520
further on this so the interesting about

1296
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:47,980
the coastline - that's kind of nice

1297
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:50,560
there is that the ratio when the ratio

1298
01:18:47,979 --> 01:18:52,149
collapses so if you look at where this

1299
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,460
is going to go it's not going to go from

1300
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:59,920
0 to 1 it's going to go to 0 - not quite

1301
01:18:54,460 --> 01:19:03,340
1 so Z will not quite go to 0 but it

1302
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:08,170
will the cosine term will hit 1 exactly

1303
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:09,789
right so what I can do here again was

1304
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:14,500
like think I do want to bias it slightly

1305
01:19:09,789 --> 01:19:16,988
just to get it out of to get that angle

1306
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,909
out slightly I'm not sure how much we

1307
01:19:16,988 --> 01:19:20,889
want it to be biased there but do want

1308
01:19:18,909 --> 01:19:23,050
it a little bit right so you can see our

1309
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:25,989
first set being right there yeah and we

1310
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:29,350
don't I don't really know again how far

1311
01:19:25,988 --> 01:19:31,059
out we want that to be biased there you

1312
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:37,030
go

1313
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:38,980
probably not quite that much so now just

1314
01:19:37,029 --> 01:19:41,229
looking at it it looks to me like maybe

1315
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:43,059
we still have like too dense of a

1316
01:19:41,229 --> 01:19:44,319
sampling in terms of already and not

1317
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:46,239
enough here like we got much bigger

1318
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:48,069
holes there so I think what that tells

1319
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:50,259
me is the slice count probably wants to

1320
01:19:48,069 --> 01:19:53,439
be reduced so I'm going to reduce the

1321
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:57,760
slice count to 6 which means that we're

1322
01:19:53,439 --> 01:20:01,169
going to remove like some of these here

1323
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:03,520
right so we're gonna remove two of these

1324
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:04,779
which means we could afford to

1325
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:10,239
distribute these points a little bit

1326
01:20:04,779 --> 01:20:14,349
more right hard to say exactly how we

1327
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:16,089
should distribute them obviously and

1328
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:20,940
that first one probably def you know

1329
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:20,940
only does want to be 4 to be fair

1330
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:29,380
just to be a little bit easier for me to

1331
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:37,539
work with there we go so if you've only

1332
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:42,520
got six we can maybe start to make these

1333
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:43,569
ones a little higher there's something I

1334
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:50,800
might want to do there again with the

1335
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:55,679
sampling hard to say we've got four more

1336
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,680
there so I might I might say like that

1337
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:15,029
and that's looking awesome honestly I

1338
01:21:09,149 --> 01:21:18,729
feel like that's pretty good right and

1339
01:21:15,029 --> 01:21:20,739
so you know the interesting part about

1340
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:24,250
this then is just how do we line these

1341
01:21:20,739 --> 01:21:26,439
up for casting purposes and the reason

1342
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:28,449
that I kind of liked this tiling is

1343
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:31,229
because I feel like it's a little bit

1344
01:21:28,449 --> 01:21:34,779
easier maybe to work with as far as

1345
01:21:31,229 --> 01:21:36,549
alignment is concerned certainly the

1346
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:39,149
first four points just get cast together

1347
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:44,250
that's not that tough

1348
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:44,250
so the question more is like you know

1349
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:55,270
the question is mostly just like what do

1350
01:21:49,569 --> 01:21:57,309
we want to do with rows that where the

1351
01:21:55,270 --> 01:22:01,930
row breaks happens so from 8 to 12 from

1352
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:04,230
12 to 16 you know and down here at the

1353
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:06,130
end like I was saying I don't know that

1354
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:08,919
you know it would really help if we

1355
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:11,109
always had pairs so you know maybe one

1356
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:15,119
thing we could say is maybe you could do

1357
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:15,119
something like this

1358
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:37,960
and trying to think of how to get rid of

1359
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:42,760
that there so you know that's that would

1360
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:44,500
be pretty easy to do the problem with it

1361
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,699
again is you get some bigger holes in

1362
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,710
here now one of the things that I

1363
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:49,479
probably should do though is we don't

1364
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:54,730
really want to be sampling that ring

1365
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:56,799
that ring is it's too much right

1366
01:22:54,729 --> 01:22:59,679
and so we almost want to make sure we

1367
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,840
constrict our hemisphere to not really

1368
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,250
quite go that far right so we want to be

1369
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,869
sampling a little bit more like that so

1370
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:07,539
let's keep it like that because I think

1371
01:23:04,869 --> 01:23:11,170
that informs our our layout a little bit

1372
01:23:07,539 --> 01:23:12,850
better as well so all right let's let's

1373
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:14,590
keep pushing on that a little bit here

1374
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:20,530
let's try to get that top part cleaned

1375
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:22,630
out more so let's suppose that we reduce

1376
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:24,840
the slice count further because you can

1377
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:27,400
see we're still a little too tight here

1378
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:33,670
so maybe we reduce the slice count to

1379
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:36,029
five so we have something more like this

1380
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:36,029
here

1381
01:23:54,319 --> 01:24:03,618
right and again that admits are really

1382
01:24:00,738 --> 01:24:08,738
simple covering almost everywhere except

1383
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:08,738
that last you know that last pairing

1384
01:24:09,069 --> 01:24:14,628
which isn't quite great and you know I

1385
01:24:12,618 --> 01:24:17,858
guess one thing we could do if we swap

1386
01:24:14,628 --> 01:24:17,858
those two I don't know it doesn't

1387
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:32,739
I'm still not sure quite how I feel

1388
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:32,739
about that

1389
01:24:51,288 --> 01:24:56,118
because again it's really tough to kind

1390
01:24:53,569 --> 01:24:57,349
of decide how you group these points

1391
01:24:56,118 --> 01:24:58,880
together and there's some further

1392
01:24:57,349 --> 01:25:00,710
complexities there like this is really

1393
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,300
very well structured so you know we've

1394
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:03,590
got the best chance here of figuring out

1395
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,739
how to bundle them together but still

1396
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:08,538
difficult right and part of the reason

1397
01:25:06,738 --> 01:25:10,129
for that is when you think about how

1398
01:25:08,538 --> 01:25:13,788
we're going to have to introduce jitter

1399
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:15,889
in here well we know that you make the

1400
01:25:13,788 --> 01:25:22,880
jitter is proportional to this ratio

1401
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:28,788
right because we know that the this

1402
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:35,059
ratio is going in steps and I mean here

1403
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:37,009
I'll just play to you this way so if I

1404
01:25:35,059 --> 01:25:49,190
introduce a random unilateral jitter

1405
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:58,699
here it's pretty easy to see how we get

1406
01:25:49,189 --> 01:26:00,558
the vertical jitter to cover right and

1407
01:25:58,698 --> 01:26:05,109
we probably want to do that for every

1408
01:26:00,559 --> 01:26:05,110
spoke as well so that this thing

1409
01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:10,038
probably wants to live down here

1410
01:26:08,179 --> 01:26:12,699
which is a little more computation but

1411
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:12,698
that's okay right

1412
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:21,340
so you probably want something that goes

1413
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,900
like that I mean I don't know maybe you

1414
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:24,489
don't because maybe you want to maintain

1415
01:26:22,899 --> 01:26:26,589
more regularity so maybe you want to

1416
01:26:24,489 --> 01:26:28,569
make sure that the jitter can't actually

1417
01:26:26,590 --> 01:26:30,130
produce points that close together in

1418
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:31,750
which case you would sort of want to

1419
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:33,460
jitter them maybe more as a group I

1420
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:35,949
don't know that's a hard that's a really

1421
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:38,050
hard call and I'm not sure about it one

1422
01:26:35,949 --> 01:26:43,960
way or the other because again

1423
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:45,070
yeah like the more that you do the more

1424
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:49,720
that you do that the harder it is to

1425
01:26:45,069 --> 01:26:57,729
know right yeah so again just really

1426
01:26:49,720 --> 01:27:00,070
difficult to say and you know the last

1427
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:04,689
point I just made is a really important

1428
01:27:00,069 --> 01:27:06,309
one to the fact that it's like you want

1429
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:07,599
to jitter these points but once you

1430
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:09,400
start jittering them then you have to

1431
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,190
decide how are you going to maintain an

1432
01:27:09,399 --> 01:27:15,879
even sampling despite the jitter that as

1433
01:27:12,189 --> 01:27:17,919
well kind of then you know makes me

1434
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:19,630
think again do we even want to do that

1435
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,720
right we've looked at several of these

1436
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:25,510
and I'm not sure any of them really do

1437
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:29,470
necessarily exactly what we want like

1438
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:31,390
the spiral probably does I mean for the

1439
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:34,780
most part the spiral always maintains

1440
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:36,160
the even sequencing right so the spiral

1441
01:27:34,779 --> 01:27:37,539
is really the only one that I know of

1442
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:42,430
would do that this one I don't know

1443
01:27:37,539 --> 01:27:43,779
would really do that because again it

1444
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:46,329
you know it's gonna want if it's really

1445
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:49,090
gonna be sarcastic over the frame it's

1446
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:52,689
gonna want to jitter the points

1447
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:55,569
vertically this way and there's gonna

1448
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:57,309
you know so the spiral is the only

1449
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:58,869
procedural one you know the blue noise

1450
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:00,430
obviously will always do it but the

1451
01:27:58,869 --> 01:28:06,399
spiral is only procedural one that would

1452
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:07,810
probably generate an even spacing every

1453
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:10,149
time but that would still be coverage

1454
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:11,770
based now we'd have to test it to make

1455
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:15,509
sure it really does end up being

1456
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:18,510
coverage based but you know there you go

1457
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:18,510
so

1458
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:28,510
it seems like the only two options I can

1459
01:28:26,829 --> 01:28:30,039
really think of at this point based on

1460
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:32,980
this experimentation that seemed viable

1461
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:35,289
to me are either figure out some way to

1462
01:28:32,979 --> 01:28:37,659
actually cluster the spiral procedurally

1463
01:28:35,289 --> 01:28:42,119
which I don't immediately see but you

1464
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:42,119
know if we grind on it we may find one

1465
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:50,860
or the other option is take the just

1466
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,560
precompute these pre compute a bunch of

1467
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:57,969
permutations of them and use those

1468
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:59,740
permutations and we could perhaps rotate

1469
01:28:57,970 --> 01:29:01,690
the permutations as well for extra

1470
01:28:59,739 --> 01:29:03,969
permutations because it's we know that

1471
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:07,149
if we wrote if we spin the sphere this

1472
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:10,090
way we don't change its distribution at

1473
01:29:07,149 --> 01:29:12,759
all it's still the same distribution so

1474
01:29:10,090 --> 01:29:14,529
for example blue noise or spiral if we

1475
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:17,560
generated a bunch of different ones of

1476
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:19,809
those clustered them proceed you know

1477
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,460
actually using a routine that just

1478
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:25,539
looked for the clusters so we don't have

1479
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:27,670
to have a procedural way to do it if we

1480
01:29:25,539 --> 01:29:31,210
did that and then just picked random

1481
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:34,539
picked a random series out of our batch

1482
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:37,539
and randomly rotated it maybe that's

1483
01:29:34,539 --> 01:29:39,489
just better and then we could literally

1484
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:42,640
use blue noise at that point so we could

1485
01:29:39,489 --> 01:29:44,559
actually have something that was truly

1486
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:49,990
blue noise not the spiral sample which

1487
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:52,320
is not really blue noise right so I

1488
01:29:49,989 --> 01:29:52,319
don't know

1489
01:29:57,170 --> 01:30:01,579
but I'm kind of leaning towards that

1490
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:28,680
that to me seems like the same is the

1491
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:28,680
way to go

1492
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:57,319
and I think the bonus of that method is

1493
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,909
also that it doesn't really matter how

1494
01:30:57,319 --> 01:31:01,819
we come up with those distributions

1495
01:30:58,909 --> 01:31:04,099
either so it kind of has the nice point

1496
01:31:01,819 --> 01:31:05,750
of like alright if you want a spiral or

1497
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:08,030
you want blue noise or you want

1498
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:09,380
something really difficult to compute it

1499
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:11,269
doesn't really matter because we can

1500
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:15,260
just compute pre compute a bunch of them

1501
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:17,960
and just pull one out because that gets

1502
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:18,949
us out of the business of caring how

1503
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,510
long it takes to produce the

1504
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:23,179
distribution which some of them like the

1505
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:26,050
spiral don't take very long but others

1506
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:28,579
like blue noise might take very long

1507
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:35,060
even if it's optimized it may still be a

1508
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:40,000
little bit too expensive right so I

1509
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:40,000
think that's what I like best honestly

1510
01:31:59,189 --> 01:32:04,169
I think that's what I like best so I

1511
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:05,640
think that's what I'm gonna try it's not

1512
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:06,869
super hard the only thing we have to

1513
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,760
write that we haven't written is the

1514
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:10,140
clustering algorithm and the only thing

1515
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,239
the clustering algorithm really needs to

1516
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:13,680
do although it is hard but we doesn't

1517
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:17,159
need to be perfect it just needs to make

1518
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:18,900
sure that every four point pet set tends

1519
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:20,189
to be fairly correlated and maybe if one

1520
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:21,509
of them is wrong it's alright but you

1521
01:32:20,189 --> 01:32:28,679
know generally we don't want like lots

1522
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:31,170
of wrongness there right so yeah I mean

1523
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:33,390
that's just gonna be there's a sample

1524
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:35,219
point array and we've got you know some

1525
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:38,190
number of them I don't know how many of

1526
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:40,590
them we actually want to do but you know

1527
01:32:38,189 --> 01:32:42,988
let's say we took 16 of them or

1528
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:45,800
something and then you rotated them that

1529
01:32:42,988 --> 01:32:49,409
seems like a very large number of

1530
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:53,400
permutations right furthermore these

1531
01:32:49,409 --> 01:32:58,880
sample points if we get down to it we

1532
01:32:53,399 --> 01:33:01,769
don't really need to store 3-3 whole

1533
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:04,140
floating point values we can just store

1534
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:06,690
two floating point values because the Z

1535
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:10,770
value is always positive and it's always

1536
01:33:06,689 --> 01:33:12,779
the square root of the two other values

1537
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:14,940
my each other right like we know that x

1538
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:19,710
squared plus y squared plus Z squared

1539
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:22,319
always has to be equal to one so we

1540
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:24,569
don't really have to store that value so

1541
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:26,130
again in terms of like if we just want

1542
01:33:24,569 --> 01:33:27,960
to make sure we're always minimizing the

1543
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:30,719
amount of like bandwidth that's

1544
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:32,399
necessary to use precomputed sample

1545
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,319
points here not only is that true but

1546
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:36,719
also we maybe don't even really need

1547
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:39,029
that much precision so we could also

1548
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:41,069
decide to just store it as some more

1549
01:33:39,029 --> 01:33:42,630
compact representation as well so for

1550
01:33:41,069 --> 01:33:45,059
example we could sort them a 16-bit

1551
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:46,980
values instead of 32-bit values we know

1552
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:48,120
their range is always between 0 &amp; 1 so

1553
01:33:46,979 --> 01:33:50,759
it's not like we even need

1554
01:33:48,119 --> 01:33:55,760
floating-point for that we can just use

1555
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:59,250
literally 64 I'm sorry 65 thousand

1556
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:01,350
divisions of the 0 to 1 range and

1557
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:03,390
probably be fine with that as well

1558
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:06,329
so I feel like we've got a lot of

1559
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:11,770
options here so I'm fairly comfortable

1560
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:15,500
with this as as an option

1561
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:17,360
so I think that's okay and furthermore

1562
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:19,399
we can we can make sure that these

1563
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:20,779
sample points are lined up nicely for

1564
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:24,500
however we want to load them so if we

1565
01:34:20,779 --> 01:34:26,599
just go briefly back to where we're

1566
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:28,550
actually sampling these and you can see

1567
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:31,610
here where we're picking our random

1568
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:33,730
bilaterals and so on right so the way

1569
01:34:31,609 --> 01:34:41,839
that that has to work at the moment is

1570
01:34:33,729 --> 01:34:50,509
it's picking up the the Delta there so

1571
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:53,000
it wants to to load in it wants to load

1572
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:56,270
it in forward time right so we can also

1573
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:59,420
you know kind of pre make make this a

1574
01:34:56,270 --> 01:35:02,420
little bit sort of nicer on us by saying

1575
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:05,239
that you know we actually just want 16

1576
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:08,239
of these and we want them to be pre

1577
01:35:05,239 --> 01:35:11,630
packed in the load format so you know

1578
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:16,789
that is also another way that we can get

1579
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:18,980
a benefit here right so let's go ahead

1580
01:35:16,789 --> 01:35:22,819
and try making our algorithm work this

1581
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:25,359
way just temporarily and the way that I

1582
01:35:22,819 --> 01:35:27,979
think we can do this is just by saying

1583
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:31,639
look if we know that this is a rollable

1584
01:35:27,979 --> 01:35:34,879
value then we can automatically make a

1585
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:38,119
mask for it so in here where we go

1586
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,489
through casting our rain radius out of

1587
01:35:38,119 --> 01:35:42,590
the sample points here what we can do is

1588
01:35:40,489 --> 01:35:45,429
sort of say well alright don't you know

1589
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:45,430
don't do this anymore

1590
01:35:50,770 --> 01:36:06,120
instead just load these out of the

1591
01:35:52,720 --> 01:36:13,840
sample point array and the array index

1592
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:15,090
mask in this case is just 15 right but

1593
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:20,380
we'll play with that a little bit more

1594
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:22,750
just get rid of that so in here then we

1595
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:24,550
just have to load out sample for the X

1596
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:30,189
from there and I think we're pretty much

1597
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:33,720
done and in fact this garbage doesn't

1598
01:36:30,189 --> 01:36:33,719
have to happen anymore either out think

1599
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:44,139
right because these would already be

1600
01:36:39,489 --> 01:36:48,010
ready to go so I think that's pretty

1601
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:49,720
much it and so if we just now initialize

1602
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:53,140
those with useful values then I think

1603
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:55,390
we'd probably be good obviously we need

1604
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:58,060
to know which one of these were using

1605
01:36:55,390 --> 01:37:00,640
here and that one could be based on the

1606
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:06,520
sample point index for example as we

1607
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:14,860
step through so maybe this is a sample

1608
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:16,660
pattern mask as well and so as we step

1609
01:37:14,859 --> 01:37:18,939
through those we would get different

1610
01:37:16,659 --> 01:37:21,609
samples out and so what we can try first

1611
01:37:18,939 --> 01:37:27,159
of all is just now when we ended our

1612
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:31,899
lighting in here what we could do is

1613
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:33,639
just make our lighting code do this to

1614
01:37:31,899 --> 01:37:35,949
start with and this will replicate our

1615
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:38,560
existing lighting to a certain

1616
01:37:35,949 --> 01:37:40,059
approximation using the tables instead

1617
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,360
so we can just you know double-check

1618
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,360
that

1619
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:49,248
actually didn't really need to do that

1620
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:53,239
today because I'm going to put this

1621
01:37:49,248 --> 01:38:02,510
inside another for a look inside so here

1622
01:37:53,238 --> 01:38:08,388
we have our pattern index and that's

1623
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:12,829
gonna be proportional to however many

1624
01:38:08,389 --> 01:38:16,609
there are in the pattern array and then

1625
01:38:12,828 --> 01:38:18,198
there's the bundle index and the bundle

1626
01:38:16,609 --> 01:38:20,359
index is going to be proportional to

1627
01:38:18,198 --> 01:38:22,998
however many there are and like say one

1628
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:25,299
of these and then we're going to produce

1629
01:38:22,998 --> 01:38:28,788
those random ones and then in here in

1630
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:34,429
instead of just using it we're just

1631
01:38:28,788 --> 01:38:47,840
going to do a reassignment back to the

1632
01:38:34,429 --> 01:38:49,489
sample points and so then in when these

1633
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,099
are stuffed here after we're done with

1634
01:38:49,488 --> 01:38:55,038
that I think all we really need here is

1635
01:38:52,099 --> 01:38:56,510
a way to get our series out so what I'll

1636
01:38:55,038 --> 01:39:05,960
do here is say that the random series

1637
01:38:56,510 --> 01:39:12,889
series equals solution series and that

1638
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:16,609
should be the end of it okay uh so I'm

1639
01:39:12,889 --> 01:39:18,769
gonna not do the drawing for a second

1640
01:39:16,609 --> 01:39:19,929
here because that's sort of a another

1641
01:39:18,769 --> 01:39:22,730
part of the problem

1642
01:39:19,929 --> 01:39:29,029
what are we complaining about sample

1643
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:32,058
point and okay so this one sample point

1644
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:34,248
n is just saying what direction the

1645
01:39:32,059 --> 01:39:35,809
sample point had to go here that's a

1646
01:39:34,248 --> 01:39:37,460
good point so we are gonna have to

1647
01:39:35,809 --> 01:39:40,460
rotate these to align with a sample

1648
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:41,929
point though this is this is a good

1649
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:43,460
point so we do need a little bit more

1650
01:39:41,929 --> 01:39:46,460
code there it's not going to be quite as

1651
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:52,489
dropping as I was about to say there but

1652
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:54,800
that's okay so the sample point in in

1653
01:39:52,488 --> 01:39:56,959
this case though if we want to produce

1654
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,909
patterns that are just basic patterns

1655
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,569
then what we're really looking to do

1656
01:39:58,908 --> 01:40:01,250
here is that

1657
01:39:59,569 --> 01:40:02,960
sample point in is just the normal we

1658
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:05,109
want these to all be pointing along and

1659
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:08,989
of course we know what that actually is

1660
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:11,439
in this case we know because we want it

1661
01:40:08,988 --> 01:40:14,899
to just always be pointing upward right

1662
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:16,819
so really in this case when we're

1663
01:40:14,899 --> 01:40:19,609
looking at the the less than or equal to

1664
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:22,908
mask we only really need to look at the

1665
01:40:19,609 --> 01:40:24,889
Z and that's you know so we don't we

1666
01:40:22,908 --> 01:40:27,769
don't need this inner product anymore

1667
01:40:24,889 --> 01:40:33,020
all we really need to do is say well we

1668
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:34,840
want to we want to basically pick

1669
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:38,179
between the positive and the negative

1670
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,650
versions of these based on whether or

1671
01:40:38,179 --> 01:40:41,690
not the Z was going the right way

1672
01:40:39,649 --> 01:40:43,670
and that's all we needed right there so

1673
01:40:41,689 --> 01:40:50,138
that that's all that's doing and that's

1674
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:52,550
that's fine right so let's go ahead and

1675
01:40:50,139 --> 01:40:54,170
nerf this out temporarily but I'm gonna

1676
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:56,239
put it in I'm gonna put it back in

1677
01:40:54,170 --> 01:41:03,679
I spun nerf it out for a quick moment

1678
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:05,799
there because yeah we're gonna have to

1679
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,980
have fuss with it a little bit more

1680
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:09,050
alright

1681
01:41:06,979 --> 01:41:10,669
and so our lighting is gonna be a little

1682
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:12,199
bit broken when I first run this the

1683
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:14,810
reason for that like I said is because

1684
01:41:12,198 --> 01:41:16,609
it's not aligning with the normals so it

1685
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:18,440
will sort of do lighting but it will be

1686
01:41:16,609 --> 01:41:22,969
gathering like backwards and doing other

1687
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:28,279
kind of odd stuff right and so first we

1688
01:41:22,969 --> 01:41:33,189
have to correct that part of it in here

1689
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:33,189
where I grabbed out those sample points

1690
01:41:37,719 --> 01:41:42,800
here so once we have that we know that

1691
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:44,750
the sample point normal which is this

1692
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,090
thing here we know that we need these

1693
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:52,719
things to be aligned along that sample

1694
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:52,719
point normal and so in order to

1695
01:42:02,738 --> 01:42:12,399
why did I bother masking this this is

1696
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:17,680
done we know there's exactly that many

1697
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:24,500
yeah I yeah that's just that was stupid

1698
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:25,940
anyway um so looking at this we know

1699
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:28,159
that once we have one of these

1700
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:31,099
we now need this to be oriented along

1701
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:34,130
the sample point normal right and if we

1702
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:36,980
look at the sample point I believe we

1703
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:41,000
sort of have this nice factor here that

1704
01:42:36,979 --> 01:42:42,319
the x axis and the y axis are known to

1705
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,359
us which is pretty important actually

1706
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:46,609
because that's the only way that we

1707
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:49,429
could trivially construct things that we

1708
01:42:46,609 --> 01:42:51,019
know face out that hemisphere so

1709
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:53,300
generally speaking when we do this

1710
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:55,100
sample here and we have the sample for X

1711
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:58,640
that's aligned in like the reference

1712
01:42:55,100 --> 01:43:01,460
coordinate frame where Z up is 1 of 0 0

1713
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:05,510
1 and then our X and y axes are 1 0 0

1714
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:07,489
and 0 1 0 respectively and so if we want

1715
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:09,020
to transform this what we need to do is

1716
01:43:07,488 --> 01:43:14,269
effectively create an equation here that

1717
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:16,190
reinterprets it along those lines so we

1718
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:17,630
kind of need something that's going to

1719
01:43:16,189 --> 01:43:19,729
look like this

1720
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:24,260
that reinterprets these as they should

1721
01:43:19,729 --> 01:43:26,449
be along the various directions so this

1722
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:31,640
is the sample point in here and we need

1723
01:43:26,449 --> 01:43:37,309
the sample point x and y here whoa what

1724
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:44,780
that was like so and so in here where we

1725
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:46,340
do x and y that's just these axes and i

1726
01:43:44,779 --> 01:43:49,130
think that's really all we need to do to

1727
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:49,640
make sure that they point in the correct

1728
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:52,699
direction

1729
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:54,140
so yeah you know not necessarily a huge

1730
01:43:52,699 --> 01:43:55,609
deal but but something we definitely

1731
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:59,090
need to do we don't know if that's

1732
01:43:55,609 --> 01:44:00,829
actually correct yet so we would need

1733
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:02,900
more we need to actually test and draw

1734
01:44:00,829 --> 01:44:04,970
these things to make sure that we're

1735
01:44:02,899 --> 01:44:07,129
doing this properly but that's basically

1736
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:10,190
what we need to do right we need to

1737
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:14,690
basically take the samples that we've

1738
01:44:10,189 --> 01:44:15,558
baked in there and we need them to to be

1739
01:44:14,689 --> 01:44:18,618
reinterpreted

1740
01:44:15,559 --> 01:44:21,020
along these these axes let me make it's

1741
01:44:18,618 --> 01:44:22,639
not sample point X&amp;Y it's the x-axis and

1742
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:25,570
y-axis which is different so I'm just

1743
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:28,340
want to make that a little clearer there

1744
01:44:25,569 --> 01:44:30,889
so as we pull each one of these out

1745
01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:32,569
again the sample point index this is

1746
01:44:30,889 --> 01:44:35,690
just giving us which sample point array

1747
01:44:32,569 --> 01:44:37,908
we actually want to look into and the

1748
01:44:35,689 --> 01:44:39,558
rate index is just 0 to 16 that which

1749
01:44:37,908 --> 01:44:42,679
were the valve sorry 0 to 15 the values

1750
01:44:39,559 --> 01:44:45,469
in there that we're actually that we've

1751
01:44:42,679 --> 01:44:48,349
actually stored and that should be

1752
01:44:45,469 --> 01:44:51,380
usable right that should be giving us

1753
01:44:48,349 --> 01:44:54,429
something similar it looks a little off

1754
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:56,690
to me so again I think we didn't quite

1755
01:44:54,429 --> 01:45:02,029
we don't quite have the transformation

1756
01:44:56,689 --> 01:45:03,469
exact yet that's my guess anyway but

1757
01:45:02,029 --> 01:45:06,259
it's pretty close so tomorrow what we'll

1758
01:45:03,469 --> 01:45:08,599
do is we'll draw it and then we'll also

1759
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:11,449
actually generate ones that have good

1760
01:45:08,599 --> 01:45:13,400
distributions and we will be able to

1761
01:45:11,448 --> 01:45:14,988
then verify what we want I'll take a

1762
01:45:13,399 --> 01:45:17,000
quick look now just to make sure there's

1763
01:45:14,988 --> 01:45:18,229
no obvious bugs but then you know we'll

1764
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,109
tackle the rest of the debugging and the

1765
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:23,948
improvement itself tomorrow so looking

1766
01:45:21,109 --> 01:45:23,948
at this here

1767
01:45:38,679 --> 01:45:43,420
I mean really the other thing about this

1768
01:45:41,349 --> 01:45:46,989
here is we'd we'd rather just have this

1769
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:49,288
be completely randomized it's alright

1770
01:45:46,988 --> 01:45:49,288
but

1771
01:46:06,248 --> 01:46:12,399
it's it looks fairly reasonable to me

1772
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:13,630
though so I don't see anything else

1773
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:17,259
around with it so I'm gonna go ahead and

1774
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:20,849
go to Q&amp;A today and we will take care of

1775
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:20,849
the debugging of it tomorrow

1776
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:08,329
while I'm waiting for questions I

1777
01:47:06,229 --> 01:47:09,439
noticed as Sylvan said by the way I

1778
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:10,609
mentioned this on Twitter but the

1779
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:12,229
easiest way to compute a cosign

1780
01:47:10,609 --> 01:47:14,119
distribution is to start with a 2d disk

1781
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:20,599
distribution for X Y then compute Z by

1782
01:47:14,119 --> 01:47:23,630
projecting to a sphere that seems pretty

1783
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:27,020
good I guess what I would say is what we

1784
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:29,079
could do let's assume that this idea of

1785
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:31,520
pre-computing the points is a good idea

1786
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:34,579
one thing we could do is generate a

1787
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:37,790
bunch of blue noise disks and then

1788
01:47:34,579 --> 01:47:45,859
project the Z so that they end up being

1789
01:47:37,789 --> 01:47:53,510
cosine weighted you know that seems

1790
01:47:45,859 --> 01:47:54,829
pretty compelling to me I guess you know

1791
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:59,989
I would I think that's a good thing to

1792
01:47:54,829 --> 01:48:01,789
try assuming that this this precomputed

1793
01:47:59,989 --> 01:48:04,460
version is a good way to go

1794
01:48:01,789 --> 01:48:08,300
then we could pre compute like 16 blue

1795
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:12,739
noise disks and project them up using

1796
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:14,150
the square root do you have some

1797
01:48:12,739 --> 01:48:15,949
resources for researching different game

1798
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:20,409
system architectures in C I'd like to

1799
01:48:15,949 --> 01:48:23,869
focus on the data layout I do not really

1800
01:48:20,409 --> 01:48:32,779
I mean obviously there's the game

1801
01:48:23,869 --> 01:48:36,760
architecture book by what's it called

1802
01:48:32,779 --> 01:48:39,800
key game programming game game engine

1803
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:45,020
gaming engine architecture I think by

1804
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:48,970
Jason Gregory and he's doing a third

1805
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:48,970
edition I think of that now as well

1806
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:07,929
okay maybe yeah there it is yes third

1807
01:49:03,488 --> 01:49:10,269
edition so when is that coming out I

1808
01:49:07,929 --> 01:49:23,949
don't know when that's coming out

1809
01:49:10,270 --> 01:49:26,159
actually yeah I don't know I don't know

1810
01:49:23,948 --> 01:49:31,299
what to say necessarily about that but

1811
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:32,948
that's kind of a I would say one of the

1812
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:36,010
basic rest for it

1813
01:49:32,948 --> 01:49:38,229
a lot of these things unfortunately most

1814
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:43,179
most books that kind of talk about these

1815
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:46,539
sorts of architectures things the coasts

1816
01:49:43,179 --> 01:49:49,690
date my having learned how to make

1817
01:49:46,539 --> 01:49:51,069
engines so I don't know what's in them

1818
01:49:49,689 --> 01:49:53,919
cuz I don't read a lot of game

1819
01:49:51,069 --> 01:49:56,829
architecture books now for obvious

1820
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,779
reasons I already kind of know most of

1821
01:49:56,829 --> 01:50:00,219
the things I like to do so when I want

1822
01:49:58,779 --> 01:50:02,229
to look something up I tend to be more

1823
01:50:00,219 --> 01:50:03,579
pigeonhole so if I was gonna look up

1824
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:05,138
something in a game of cartridge why I'd

1825
01:50:03,579 --> 01:50:06,189
be looking at a specific section I

1826
01:50:05,139 --> 01:50:10,810
wouldn't really be reading the whole

1827
01:50:06,189 --> 01:50:17,319
book typically anyways so one of the

1828
01:50:10,810 --> 01:50:19,179
problems is ie I I don't have a lot of I

1829
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:20,500
can't let go back to when I was learning

1830
01:50:19,179 --> 01:50:21,670
and go oh here's the books I liked

1831
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:23,439
because there really weren't any good

1832
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:24,940
ones at that time there may be good ones

1833
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:27,509
now and I just don't know what they are

1834
01:50:24,939 --> 01:50:29,559
but that one I you know Jason Gregory

1835
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:30,940
obviously has a lot of experience with

1836
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:32,469
these sorts of things so I would be

1837
01:50:30,939 --> 01:50:33,908
pretty surprised if the book didn't have

1838
01:50:32,469 --> 01:50:35,189
good information in it I guess one way

1839
01:50:33,908 --> 01:50:39,429
to put it

1840
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:40,809
Jeff Lander as well obviously I don't

1841
01:50:39,429 --> 01:50:42,429
think I know the third author I know the

1842
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:44,289
I think I know that who was there was a

1843
01:50:42,429 --> 01:50:47,670
third author I don't I know two of them

1844
01:50:44,289 --> 01:50:47,670
and I don't know the third I don't think

1845
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:54,550
yes so so Matt witting I don't know who

1846
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:56,169
that is

1847
01:50:54,550 --> 01:50:57,849
although I guess it looks like Jeff

1848
01:50:56,170 --> 01:51:04,510
Lander just wrote the foreword so maybe

1849
01:50:57,849 --> 01:51:06,610
it's all Jason but Jeff Lander is also a

1850
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:07,969
very good programmer most people don't

1851
01:51:06,609 --> 01:51:13,009
know who

1852
01:51:07,969 --> 01:51:14,448
I think probably but he's very good and

1853
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:19,989
he's been around a long time and done a

1854
01:51:14,448 --> 01:51:19,988
lot of really good work so you know

1855
01:51:20,198 --> 01:51:24,859
apparently he didn't write the book so

1856
01:51:22,039 --> 01:51:27,850
doesn't matter but the foreword is

1857
01:51:24,859 --> 01:51:27,849
probably also good

1858
01:51:28,238 --> 01:51:36,339
let's see blackburn 1911 what should i

1859
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:39,969
do every day to become a good programmer

1860
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:43,610
well i guess i would say that

1861
01:51:39,969 --> 01:51:46,069
programming a lot and exploring new

1862
01:51:43,609 --> 01:51:48,500
ideas is really the most important stuff

1863
01:51:46,069 --> 01:51:50,269
right like i feel like the two main

1864
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:53,869
ingredients to being good programmer are

1865
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:55,580
programming a like a lot so you know at

1866
01:51:53,869 --> 01:51:58,219
least six hours a day every day your

1867
01:51:55,579 --> 01:52:01,010
whole life right you can take weekends

1868
01:51:58,219 --> 01:52:03,649
off if you want is step number one and

1869
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:05,750
number two is always be looking for new

1870
01:52:03,649 --> 01:52:07,189
things like don't assume that the way

1871
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:08,770
you did something last time or the way

1872
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:10,969
someone told you to do it is a good way

1873
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:12,850
explore new options and think critically

1874
01:52:10,969 --> 01:52:15,408
about how you can improve things and

1875
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:16,850
that process takes a long time but

1876
01:52:15,408 --> 01:52:18,619
that's the only really way to get good

1877
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:19,909
right it's the same as getting good at

1878
01:52:18,619 --> 01:52:24,079
anything else you know how do you get

1879
01:52:19,908 --> 01:52:26,029
how do you become a concert pianist it's

1880
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:28,158
like well you play piano every day and

1881
01:52:26,029 --> 01:52:29,929
you constantly try to think of new ways

1882
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:31,869
to interpret a piece of music that sound

1883
01:52:29,929 --> 01:52:36,109
better or more interesting right I mean

1884
01:52:31,869 --> 01:52:39,738
you know it's it's just a lot of hard

1885
01:52:36,109 --> 01:52:41,238
work and most people who are bad

1886
01:52:39,738 --> 01:52:42,859
programmers unless somehow they were

1887
01:52:41,238 --> 01:52:45,229
born with brains that literally just

1888
01:52:42,859 --> 01:52:47,059
can't be good at programming one of

1889
01:52:45,229 --> 01:52:49,069
those two things isn't true either they

1890
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:50,750
don't program enough or they don't try

1891
01:52:49,069 --> 01:52:52,250
hard enough when they're programming to

1892
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:54,590
do new things or look at things

1893
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:56,238
differently because it really is an

1894
01:52:54,590 --> 01:52:58,789
active process like you don't just sit

1895
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:00,678
down and do it it's an active process of

1896
01:52:58,789 --> 01:53:02,329
going I want to make an improvement here

1897
01:53:00,679 --> 01:53:03,619
I want to get better at doing this thing

1898
01:53:02,329 --> 01:53:05,510
so I'm going to try something new and

1899
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:06,769
see how it works because that's the only

1900
01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:08,000
way you get better is by trying

1901
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:09,560
something new and seeing which one's

1902
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,488
work and sometimes they don't work you

1903
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:11,929
see done a hand meet here all the time

1904
01:53:10,488 --> 01:53:15,349
we try something new it doesn't work

1905
01:53:11,929 --> 01:53:18,710
right that's the cost of finding a good

1906
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:20,449
way is having to have gone down bad ways

1907
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:20,750
and recognize that they didn't work and

1908
01:53:20,448 --> 01:53:22,309
then

1909
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:24,500
start over that's just that's just how

1910
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:28,100
new things happen otherwise you're just

1911
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:29,630
kind of a monkey right typing in stuff

1912
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:32,990
the same as everyone else and that

1913
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:34,670
doesn't really isn't really worth a

1914
01:53:32,989 --> 01:53:37,340
whole lot unless you just I mean if you

1915
01:53:34,670 --> 01:53:38,510
just want a job that's fine but if

1916
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:42,920
you're trying to really be good that's

1917
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:45,110
not good enough well effect do you use

1918
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:47,529
templates in the code no we don't use

1919
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:47,529
templates

1920
01:53:58,930 --> 01:54:03,230
I'm programming my first game in 2d is

1921
01:54:02,119 --> 01:54:05,059
an intake assignment for my next

1922
01:54:03,229 --> 01:54:07,219
education the game uses an entity

1923
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:08,810
component system but now I'm stuck

1924
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:10,100
because I want different entities to

1925
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,970
have different animations for different

1926
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:13,280
situations but don't know how to

1927
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:15,260
implement that my question is how do I

1928
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:17,029
go about that without writing different

1929
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:20,000
sprite components for every different

1930
01:54:17,029 --> 01:54:26,389
env type all sorts of information is

1931
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:29,899
welcome so I guess what what I would try

1932
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:31,940
to encourage you to do here because this

1933
01:54:29,899 --> 01:54:33,409
is for educational purposes is I would

1934
01:54:31,939 --> 01:54:36,829
encourage you to take a step back and

1935
01:54:33,409 --> 01:54:38,479
think about whether the structure that

1936
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:43,239
you've been posed or that your

1937
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:47,769
assignment more perhaps has imposed on

1938
01:54:43,239 --> 01:54:50,090
the question you're asking right and

1939
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:52,010
this again is one of the really big

1940
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:54,860
problems I have with object-oriented

1941
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:56,390
programming as well but it's not really

1942
01:54:54,859 --> 01:54:58,130
a problem with object-oriented

1943
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:59,990
programming per se it's just that it's

1944
01:54:58,130 --> 01:55:02,180
particularly pernicious in that type of

1945
01:54:59,989 --> 01:55:04,099
programming but it extends to all types

1946
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:07,640
of programming if you let it

1947
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:10,220
and it's always bad and that is thinking

1948
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:12,470
about the answer to a question in terms

1949
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:15,260
of artificial constraints you have put

1950
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:17,570
on the solution because either someone

1951
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:19,159
told you they were good ideas or because

1952
01:55:17,569 --> 01:55:21,139
you thought they were good ideas and

1953
01:55:19,159 --> 01:55:23,389
it's always important to re-examine

1954
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:25,160
those so let's take your question apart

1955
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:27,950
more specifically and look at what you

1956
01:55:25,159 --> 01:55:29,449
asked you said I'm stuck because I want

1957
01:55:27,949 --> 01:55:31,760
different entities to have different

1958
01:55:29,449 --> 01:55:34,309
animations for different situations but

1959
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:36,320
I don't know how to implement that okay

1960
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:38,060
but you absolutely do know how to

1961
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:40,549
implement that because it's trivial

1962
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:42,560
right so more specifically what you

1963
01:55:40,550 --> 01:55:45,260
don't know what you actually don't know

1964
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:48,080
is how to implement different animations

1965
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:51,020
for different situations in terms of

1966
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:54,979
this structure you've imposed on your

1967
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:57,340
code somewhat artificially right because

1968
01:55:54,979 --> 01:55:59,869
if all you want to do is have different

1969
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:01,550
animations for different situations we

1970
01:55:59,869 --> 01:56:03,939
all know how to do that right whatever

1971
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:03,940
you've got

1972
01:56:09,189 --> 01:56:15,710
you could just have a thing in here

1973
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:21,230
that's like alright ennum my different

1974
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:28,579
situations situation one situation to

1975
01:56:21,229 --> 01:56:32,529
situation 3 right and then you've got

1976
01:56:28,579 --> 01:56:32,529
something that's like play animation

1977
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:52,309
let's put in here right so we all know

1978
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:55,909
many ways in code to just sit down and

1979
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:58,940
type in something that has different

1980
01:56:55,909 --> 01:57:01,550
responses based on some parameter that

1981
01:56:58,939 --> 01:57:02,989
we just set on an entity like hey this

1982
01:57:01,550 --> 01:57:04,579
entity I'm just throwing a thing in here

1983
01:57:02,989 --> 01:57:07,189
that says it plays this animation for

1984
01:57:04,579 --> 01:57:11,420
this circumstance right you just

1985
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:14,989
literally put that in and so the

1986
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:19,069
question that you are actually asking

1987
01:57:14,989 --> 01:57:21,590
here is in some weird construct that

1988
01:57:19,069 --> 01:57:23,449
I've created where I pre said I'm not

1989
01:57:21,590 --> 01:57:25,760
gonna do that thing that is very

1990
01:57:23,449 --> 01:57:29,359
straightforward and obvious how do I do

1991
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:31,850
it well the answer should be rethink how

1992
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:34,309
you're doing it if it's not obvious how

1993
01:57:31,850 --> 01:57:36,470
to make a special case in your system

1994
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:39,260
there's something wrong with the system

1995
01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:41,570
and that system should be augmented to

1996
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:43,340
include an easy way to add a special

1997
01:57:41,569 --> 01:57:45,920
case or it should be thrown out because

1998
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:47,300
it's just bad and again that's the

1999
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:49,760
problem I have with a lot of auditory

2000
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:52,190
systems is they they make it so that the

2001
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,980
obvious way to type something in is like

2002
01:57:52,189 --> 01:57:56,689
round upon or bad or just straight-up

2003
01:57:54,979 --> 01:57:59,149
impossible because they've made this

2004
01:57:56,689 --> 01:58:01,929
ridiculous collection of objects and

2005
01:57:59,149 --> 01:58:04,099
concepts that are impenetrable to

2006
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:06,350
actually writing what's supposed to

2007
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:09,110
happen writing what's supposed to happen

2008
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:12,410
explicitly is not bad it's in fact

2009
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:13,939
optimal and the goal of any system

2010
01:58:12,409 --> 01:58:16,849
should be to make it as easy as possible

2011
01:58:13,939 --> 01:58:19,609
for the programmer to say explicitly

2012
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:20,599
what they wanted and every additional

2013
01:58:19,609 --> 01:58:22,429
step you add to

2014
01:58:20,599 --> 01:58:24,878
system that forces the programmer to do

2015
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:28,340
something other than the obvious

2016
01:58:24,878 --> 01:58:32,569
hard-coded correct answer he's actually

2017
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:34,639
bad not good what a system is supposed

2018
01:58:32,569 --> 01:58:37,518
to do is make it easy for the programmer

2019
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:39,739
to put in special cases and to apply

2020
01:58:37,519 --> 01:58:41,748
cases to as many useful ways as possible

2021
01:58:39,738 --> 01:58:44,538
so if they have a thing that's like a

2022
01:58:41,748 --> 01:58:47,868
anything that sort of acts like a sheep

2023
01:58:44,538 --> 01:58:50,958
should play the Sheep animation when you

2024
01:58:47,868 --> 01:58:52,938
know chased by a wolf the goal is to

2025
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:57,858
make it as easy as possible to write

2026
01:58:52,939 --> 01:58:59,719
that down it is not supposed to be to

2027
01:58:57,859 --> 01:59:02,389
prevent the programmer from saying

2028
01:58:59,719 --> 01:59:04,038
explicit things and as soon as you get

2029
01:59:02,389 --> 01:59:05,479
yourself into a system into a system

2030
01:59:04,038 --> 01:59:07,728
where you don't even know how to say

2031
01:59:05,479 --> 01:59:11,418
explicit things anymore that system is

2032
01:59:07,729 --> 01:59:13,729
bad . so it's important to understand

2033
01:59:11,418 --> 01:59:14,958
these pieces so I don't know exactly

2034
01:59:13,729 --> 01:59:17,320
what your system looks like right now

2035
01:59:14,958 --> 01:59:20,118
there's two situations you may be

2036
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:21,590
encountering one is that you've ended up

2037
01:59:20,118 --> 01:59:23,808
with a system that is simply too

2038
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:26,498
unwieldy and it should be torn apart a

2039
01:59:23,809 --> 01:59:29,779
little bit and made simpler right and

2040
01:59:26,498 --> 01:59:31,398
made more flexible the other is that you

2041
01:59:29,779 --> 01:59:32,569
just don't understand the system that

2042
01:59:31,399 --> 01:59:34,070
you've built well enough and this

2043
01:59:32,569 --> 01:59:36,108
happens to everybody it happens

2044
01:59:34,069 --> 01:59:37,368
literally to everyone all the time which

2045
01:59:36,109 --> 01:59:39,349
is when you first start building a

2046
01:59:37,368 --> 01:59:40,759
system no matter how good you are you

2047
01:59:39,349 --> 01:59:42,078
have no experience with that system so

2048
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:43,849
you don't really know how to use it yet

2049
01:59:42,078 --> 01:59:45,408
it may be that you're a situation where

2050
01:59:43,849 --> 01:59:46,458
your system actually could express this

2051
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:48,589
very easily but you just don't

2052
01:59:46,458 --> 01:59:51,288
understand how and so you need to look

2053
01:59:48,590 --> 01:59:52,340
at that a little bit too and so you need

2054
01:59:51,288 --> 01:59:53,988
to figure out which one of those cases

2055
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:56,059
you're in if you're in the case where

2056
01:59:53,988 --> 01:59:57,828
you just needed to like sit down think

2057
01:59:56,059 --> 01:59:59,719
about a little bit more and the system

2058
01:59:57,828 --> 02:00:01,728
actually expresses this cleanly great if

2059
01:59:59,719 --> 02:00:02,989
not you need to back up and you need to

2060
02:00:01,729 --> 02:00:05,289
say how did I paint myself in this

2061
02:00:02,988 --> 02:00:05,288
corner

2062
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:19,929
var said he played with the spiral and

2063
02:00:18,069 --> 02:00:23,979
had problems with the angular fall-off I

2064
02:00:19,929 --> 02:00:27,699
can yep I could see that that's why I

2065
02:00:23,979 --> 02:00:29,669
kind of like the idea of precomputing

2066
02:00:27,699 --> 02:00:38,519
[Music]

2067
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:38,520
the the distributions more but we'll see

2068
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:45,670
3d gamer first time we're here from what

2069
02:00:43,929 --> 02:00:47,020
I saw it looks like organizational wise

2070
02:00:45,670 --> 02:00:48,819
a lot of things are bundled together in

2071
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:50,410
your code how do you handle organizing a

2072
02:00:48,819 --> 02:00:51,759
lot of code in general is it a c c++

2073
02:00:50,409 --> 02:00:53,380
thing to have so many things together

2074
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:56,469
I'm just kind of used to having small

2075
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:58,659
pieces of code um no that's not only a C

2076
02:00:56,469 --> 02:01:00,250
C++ thing there's lots of C++ code

2077
02:00:58,659 --> 02:01:02,139
programmers who break things down into

2078
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:06,189
incredibly tiny parts that's just how

2079
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:08,710
they like to do things in my opinion I

2080
02:01:06,189 --> 02:01:11,049
think that's usually bad the reason is

2081
02:01:08,710 --> 02:01:13,539
because the more interrelated code is

2082
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:15,010
the easier it is to play with it you can

2083
02:01:13,539 --> 02:01:18,429
just quickly like rewrite parts of it

2084
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:20,530
and do whatever so I tend to postpone

2085
02:01:18,429 --> 02:01:22,719
breaking things apart too much later in

2086
02:01:20,529 --> 02:01:24,130
the process than most people now that

2087
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,899
doesn't mean that I actually leave them

2088
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:28,090
all bundled together forever because I

2089
02:01:25,899 --> 02:01:30,129
usually don't so eventually when I get

2090
02:01:28,090 --> 02:01:31,989
to the part where I'm totally sure I

2091
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:34,630
know exactly how something works and I

2092
02:01:31,988 --> 02:01:37,059
want to kind of put my stamp of finish

2093
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:38,710
this on it I will then tend to break it

2094
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:40,600
apart a little bit more into pieces

2095
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:41,980
possibly if I want to do some testing

2096
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:43,690
possibly if I want to do some

2097
02:01:41,979 --> 02:01:47,738
optimization because sometimes you need

2098
02:01:43,689 --> 02:01:49,210
to do that and so on but I think

2099
02:01:47,738 --> 02:01:51,279
typically there's a lot of fetishism

2100
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:52,869
around breaking code into small pieces

2101
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:54,399
and I don't really approve of that if

2102
02:01:52,869 --> 02:01:56,079
you don't have a reason to break code

2103
02:01:54,399 --> 02:01:58,059
into a smaller piece you typically

2104
02:01:56,079 --> 02:01:59,619
shouldn't because it just makes it

2105
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:01,360
harder for someone who's coming to the

2106
02:01:59,619 --> 02:02:02,649
code to edit it and read it to know

2107
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:04,179
what's going on because now they have to

2108
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:05,619
look across many many small pieces of

2109
02:02:04,179 --> 02:02:07,270
code to figure out what's happening

2110
02:02:05,619 --> 02:02:08,800
rather than just stepping through the

2111
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:10,929
code in series and seeing exactly what

2112
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:13,659
it does and furthermore it creates

2113
02:02:10,929 --> 02:02:16,239
artificial divisions in the code that

2114
02:02:13,659 --> 02:02:17,439
don't actually exist that then crimp

2115
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:19,599
create problems when you're trying to

2116
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:21,579
modify it so typically I think code

2117
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:24,519
should be broken into pieces that are as

2118
02:02:21,579 --> 02:02:26,618
small as necessary but no small

2119
02:02:24,519 --> 02:02:28,539
and I think it's important to remember

2120
02:02:26,618 --> 02:02:29,768
that but no smaller part because a lot

2121
02:02:28,538 --> 02:02:30,998
of people just break things into small

2122
02:02:29,769 --> 02:02:40,420
pieces of code for no reason I don't

2123
02:02:30,998 --> 02:02:41,529
think that's done really good case I

2124
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:43,748
just want to say thank you for

2125
02:02:41,529 --> 02:02:45,219
everything I started watcher you in 2014

2126
02:02:43,748 --> 02:02:46,958
when I graduated University you taught

2127
02:02:45,219 --> 02:02:48,130
me more than all my teachers there I

2128
02:02:46,958 --> 02:02:50,380
loved game development and love

2129
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:52,059
programming all because of you well that

2130
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:54,159
is very kind thing to say

2131
02:02:52,059 --> 02:02:56,309
I very much appreciate that and I hope

2132
02:02:54,158 --> 02:03:00,069
that you continue to love programming

2133
02:02:56,309 --> 02:03:02,559
and it continues to be something that

2134
02:03:00,069 --> 02:03:10,929
you you find interesting and enjoyable

2135
02:03:02,559 --> 02:03:14,529
throughout your life did I find a answer

2136
02:03:10,929 --> 02:03:17,010
to my questions in my blog post the

2137
02:03:14,529 --> 02:03:25,809
particular bog blog posting question

2138
02:03:17,010 --> 02:03:29,530
I'll bring it up here is all registered

2139
02:03:25,809 --> 02:03:31,110
names still useful no I haven't this is

2140
02:03:29,529 --> 02:03:34,630
a blog post it's just about hardware

2141
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:36,429
it's not an educational blog post it's

2142
02:03:34,630 --> 02:03:39,130
just a question that I posed to hardware

2143
02:03:36,429 --> 02:03:41,529
designers and the question was simply do

2144
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:44,739
you think that register names are still

2145
02:03:41,529 --> 02:03:49,389
the best way to communicate a program

2146
02:03:44,738 --> 02:03:52,689
from a compiler to a cpu in light of the

2147
02:03:49,389 --> 02:03:54,639
fact that nowadays hardware doesn't

2148
02:03:52,689 --> 02:03:56,379
really use registers in the same way

2149
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:58,359
that it used to it used to be that

2150
02:03:56,380 --> 02:04:01,719
registered names really were registers

2151
02:03:58,359 --> 02:04:03,518
so it was the CPU was literally getting

2152
02:04:01,719 --> 02:04:06,130
exactly what it should do from the

2153
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:08,639
instruction stream and registers names I

2154
02:04:06,130 --> 02:04:11,949
think make a ton of sense there nowadays

2155
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:14,559
what the what the instruction stream is

2156
02:04:11,948 --> 02:04:16,719
telling the processor is actually not

2157
02:04:14,559 --> 02:04:19,119
that because the processor typically has

2158
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:22,118
lots of versions of any given register

2159
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:23,768
in-flight at a given time either in a

2160
02:04:22,118 --> 02:04:29,109
hyper threading context the registers

2161
02:04:23,769 --> 02:04:31,179
are wide across threads in a an out of

2162
02:04:29,109 --> 02:04:32,738
order processor there they're often

2163
02:04:31,179 --> 02:04:34,449
referring to different things at

2164
02:04:32,738 --> 02:04:35,919
different times so the same register

2165
02:04:34,448 --> 02:04:37,748
name is actually referring to different

2166
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:40,298
states throughout differ

2167
02:04:37,748 --> 02:04:41,769
parts of the microp retirement and all

2168
02:04:40,298 --> 02:04:45,038
these sorts of things so this was really

2169
02:04:41,769 --> 02:04:47,319
just a question like our register names

2170
02:04:45,038 --> 02:04:50,438
still useful or is there some other

2171
02:04:47,319 --> 02:04:52,689
naming scheme we should be using I know

2172
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:53,798
like the mill CPU proposed one I didn't

2173
02:04:52,689 --> 02:04:56,229
think it was a particularly interesting

2174
02:04:53,798 --> 02:04:57,609
proposal I think there's other proposals

2175
02:04:56,229 --> 02:04:58,989
that might be more useful I gave an

2176
02:04:57,609 --> 02:05:00,939
example of one which was like a

2177
02:04:58,988 --> 02:05:03,308
stack-based register naming scheme I

2178
02:05:00,939 --> 02:05:05,019
don't think just using memory directly

2179
02:05:03,309 --> 02:05:06,819
makes sense and the reason for that is

2180
02:05:05,019 --> 02:05:09,759
because memory names are too long

2181
02:05:06,819 --> 02:05:12,239
they're sick up to 64 bits long and

2182
02:05:09,759 --> 02:05:14,529
that's simply not a concise way of

2183
02:05:12,238 --> 02:05:16,268
producing an instruction stream because

2184
02:05:14,529 --> 02:05:19,409
instruction streams need to be compact

2185
02:05:16,269 --> 02:05:24,128
in order to avoid too much cache

2186
02:05:19,408 --> 02:05:25,688
decoding and so on so I asked that

2187
02:05:24,128 --> 02:05:27,578
question here in this post I have not

2188
02:05:25,689 --> 02:05:29,289
received any real answers from hardware

2189
02:05:27,578 --> 02:05:30,548
designers yet probably because they

2190
02:05:29,288 --> 02:05:31,599
don't read my blog because why would

2191
02:05:30,548 --> 02:05:33,998
they there's nothing in it about

2192
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:35,949
hardware but I still wanted to post it

2193
02:05:33,998 --> 02:05:40,778
anyway if I ever do get any answers I

2194
02:05:35,948 --> 02:05:42,278
will be sure to let you know fort 99 you

2195
02:05:40,779 --> 02:05:43,509
mentioned not using templates to use any

2196
02:05:42,279 --> 02:05:47,019
code generation or meta programming at

2197
02:05:43,509 --> 02:05:49,029
all I do in our actual code base at Mali

2198
02:05:47,019 --> 02:05:51,789
rocket I do not use any meta programming

2199
02:05:49,029 --> 02:05:53,469
on stream on handmade hero only because

2200
02:05:51,788 --> 02:05:56,259
I wanted to restrict this to kind of C

2201
02:05:53,469 --> 02:05:58,149
C++ programming for this particular

2202
02:05:56,259 --> 02:05:59,948
stream meta programming is a whole

2203
02:05:58,149 --> 02:06:02,259
nother thing that you do it's a

2204
02:05:59,948 --> 02:06:03,759
completely different discipline largely

2205
02:06:02,259 --> 02:06:05,618
unrelated to anything we're doing on the

2206
02:06:03,759 --> 02:06:09,788
stream so I didn't really want to take

2207
02:06:05,618 --> 02:06:10,898
on that topic here every time I am

2208
02:06:09,788 --> 02:06:12,788
designing the data layout of a game

2209
02:06:10,899 --> 02:06:14,289
system I get very happy inside is this

2210
02:06:12,788 --> 02:06:16,418
normal or should I see a psychiatrist

2211
02:06:14,288 --> 02:06:17,559
also I absolutely love the sections

2212
02:06:16,418 --> 02:06:20,798
about the entity system in game design

2213
02:06:17,559 --> 02:06:22,359
decisions I don't know if it's normal or

2214
02:06:20,798 --> 02:06:23,559
not but it's probably good anything that

2215
02:06:22,359 --> 02:06:26,548
makes you happy on the inside while

2216
02:06:23,559 --> 02:06:26,548
programming is good

2217
02:06:29,739 --> 02:06:33,039
sneaky Bob how much more optimized do

2218
02:06:31,810 --> 02:06:34,600
you think you'll be able to get this

2219
02:06:33,039 --> 02:06:36,250
lighting code once you've sorted out

2220
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:38,350
this bundling I don't know depends

2221
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:39,460
whether we do a GPU version or not and

2222
02:06:38,350 --> 02:06:41,110
we got to look at it a little bit more

2223
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:42,489
but right now we just want to smooth out

2224
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:43,899
our sampling a little bit and that's not

2225
02:06:42,489 --> 02:06:45,250
really optimization that's just getting

2226
02:06:43,899 --> 02:06:47,769
a little bit higher quality from the

2227
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:48,760
same optimization I'm a programmer a

2228
02:06:47,770 --> 02:06:50,020
three years experience what would you

2229
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:51,250
recommend for someone with my experience

2230
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:52,570
level to do to improve as a developer

2231
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:54,220
I've been trying to learn new things

2232
02:06:52,569 --> 02:06:56,559
outside of work while avoiding breaking

2233
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:58,240
the non-compete part of my contract

2234
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,920
yeah I would say that taking up side

2235
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:01,179
projects that you just use purely for

2236
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:02,859
your own educational purposes and

2237
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:06,100
experimentation are actually very good

2238
02:07:02,859 --> 02:07:07,989
things to do it depends on what you're

2239
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:09,310
interested in learning but you know if

2240
02:07:07,989 --> 02:07:11,189
you wanna learn graphics write a ray

2241
02:07:09,310 --> 02:07:14,560
tracer for example would be a good idea

2242
02:07:11,189 --> 02:07:17,229
things like that but it really depends

2243
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:20,289
what you want to learn a pick pick a top

2244
02:07:17,229 --> 02:07:22,329
you know pick a side project which

2245
02:07:20,289 --> 02:07:23,769
aligns well with your goals do you wanna

2246
02:07:22,329 --> 02:07:26,170
learn more math do you want to learn

2247
02:07:23,770 --> 02:07:27,340
more programming structure architecture

2248
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:28,690
do you want to learn more sound

2249
02:07:27,340 --> 02:07:30,760
programming do you want to learn more

2250
02:07:28,689 --> 02:07:34,179
rasterization do you want to learn more

2251
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:36,250
physics you know make the project fit

2252
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:37,600
the main thrust of what you want to get

2253
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,680
better at just your own personal

2254
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:42,789
preference what you want get better at

2255
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:46,270
right now that's what I would say do I

2256
02:07:42,789 --> 02:07:50,079
still use my Amiga well use my Amiga may

2257
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:52,390
be a strong term I don't really use it

2258
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:53,739
for any real purpose do I still fire it

2259
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:56,079
up occasionally to marvel at how much

2260
02:07:53,739 --> 02:07:57,099
better it is then this piece of garbage

2261
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:59,170
Windows 10

2262
02:07:57,100 --> 02:08:02,560
CPUs sitting in a system sitting in

2263
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:04,170
front of me absolutely but really I just

2264
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:06,310
get depressed because I realized that

2265
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:08,109
you know thanks to Microsoft

2266
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:09,580
we've spent 30 years getting absolutely

2267
02:08:08,109 --> 02:08:11,039
nowhere even though the hardware we have

2268
02:08:09,579 --> 02:08:13,359
is absolutely amazing

2269
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:15,250
any good resources about game

2270
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:20,009
development that is surely not language

2271
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:22,680
or platform specific I don't know

2272
02:08:20,010 --> 02:08:25,449
couldn't couldn't say for sure sorry

2273
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:28,060
alright and with that we have come to

2274
02:08:25,449 --> 02:08:31,269
the end of the questions so I will go

2275
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:34,810
ahead and close things down probably

2276
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:37,240
should get rid of this here before I do

2277
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:40,349
so we don't check in that code to the

2278
02:08:37,239 --> 02:08:43,148
github in a second here

2279
02:08:40,349 --> 02:08:46,300
everyone would pull the changes from

2280
02:08:43,149 --> 02:08:47,709
today and be like what is this thank you

2281
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:48,550
everyone for joining me for the set of

2282
02:08:47,708 --> 02:08:50,349
hand made here it's been a pleasure

2283
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:51,939
coding with you as always I think we've

2284
02:08:50,349 --> 02:08:53,769
pretty much settled into how we want to

2285
02:08:51,939 --> 02:08:58,030
do our sampling so tomorrow we will try

2286
02:08:53,769 --> 02:08:59,979
to improve that by actually implementing

2287
02:08:58,029 --> 02:09:01,148
some of those like maybe putting putting

2288
02:08:59,979 --> 02:09:03,128
our blue noise scheme in there or

2289
02:09:01,149 --> 02:09:05,109
whatever and then seeing how that does

2290
02:09:03,128 --> 02:09:08,408
when we put it into actual practice in

2291
02:09:05,109 --> 02:09:10,269
the game so hopefully you'll join me for

2292
02:09:08,408 --> 02:09:12,188
that tomorrow same time same place

2293
02:09:10,269 --> 02:09:13,449
until then if you do want to play around

2294
02:09:12,189 --> 02:09:15,280
with the source code you can always peer

2295
02:09:13,448 --> 02:09:17,228
to the game on handmade hero or it comes

2296
02:09:15,279 --> 02:09:18,969
with the source code so you can play

2297
02:09:17,229 --> 02:09:21,128
around that yourself and do your own

2298
02:09:18,969 --> 02:09:23,078
experimentation maybe you can find some

2299
02:09:21,128 --> 02:09:26,108
good ways to do letting sampling in the

2300
02:09:23,078 --> 02:09:27,759
meantime that will be interesting that's

2301
02:09:26,109 --> 02:09:28,989
about it for today I'll see you back

2302
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:30,309
here tomorrow till then have fun

2303
02:09:28,988 --> 02:09:33,268
programming and I'll see everyone on the

2304
02:09:30,309 --> 02:09:33,269
Internet take it easy everybody
