1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,719
here there we go hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,699
welcome to handmade hero the show where

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,558
we code a complete game live on twitch

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,419
we don't use any libraries or engines

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,838
here we cover the entire game

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,820
development process from from scratch so

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,980
that you can see absolutely every piece

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,230
of code that's involved in actually

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,170
making a game run because somebody

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,969
somewhere had to write every last little

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,460
thing like you see me riding on this

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,288
stream today in order to get a game to

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,669
run no matter what game it was and even

14
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,840
if they use something like a license

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,209
engine well someone had to make that

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,820
engine and so we are showing how to do

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,770
absolutely all of that not just the

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,159
little light fluff that sits on top but

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,039
actually the entire the entire suite of

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,509
things that are required so what we're

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
doing today is we're doing a little more

22
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:53,039
work on our sound mixer which is coming

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:54,988
along nicely we just want to kind of add

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,510
some features to it it's a it's a fairly

25
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,549
bare-bones sound mixer at the moment and

26
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:01,320
so it does some kind of advanced stuff

27
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,089
like get dynamically stream sounds off

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,069
disk and stuff like that so that's

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,840
pretty cool but we haven't really added

30
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,609
much in the way of ability to control

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,368
the sounds that are being played so for

32
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:13,379
example you can set the volume of the

33
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:15,209
sound but you can't animate that volume

34
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,310
over time so sound couldn't like fade

35
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,839
out or something like that so we would

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,400
like to do is go in there and add some

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,799
of those features so that our sound

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,689
mixer can do a bunch of things that we

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,280
might want it to do when when the time

40
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:28,019
comes to actually tune the sound

41
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,000
environment for the game so that's what

42
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,259
we're going to be working on today now

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,349
if you would like to follow along at

44
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,140
home with the source code today is day

45
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:39,149
142 go ahead and unpack day 141 source

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,140
code because that is what we are going

47
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:49,790
to be working with today all right let's

48
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,790
go ahead and get started here here we go

49
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:59,158
and so yeah if you remember we have just

50
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:04,609
at the end of yesterday string we had

51
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:07,590
just pulled out the audio code into a

52
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:08,909
into its own file right and you know one

53
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,550
of the things that I should probably

54
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:13,770
mention that we haven't mentioned we

55
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,830
haven't really looked at in too much

56
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,600
detail but a lot of times people are so

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,340
incredulous of being able to write

58
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,560
everything from scratch right there like

59
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,450
that's that's just ridiculous it's not

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,280
possible you know a better thing to do

61
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,750
with your time would be to download huge

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,849
numbers of libraries and try to get them

63
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,750
all to build together and spend all your

64
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,989
time trying to figure out how they

65
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,539
worked well you know audio mixing wise I

66
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,090
mean take a look it's just a brief look

67
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,389
at actually how much code we wrote here

68
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,430
so here's the asset system right it's

69
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,289
about eight hundred lines of code and a

70
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,629
lot of that was just us defining some

71
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:50,549
test assets right so really it's you

72
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,979
know it's something like 600 lines of

73
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,640
code that was to do full dynamic

74
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:58,979
streaming of all the assets in the game

75
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,699
separately threaded right that's all

76
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:05,639
that took and that also handles dynamic

77
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:06,780
streaming of sounds that are long right

78
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,439
so you can have a long piece of musical

79
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,400
dynamic extreme than 600 lines of code

80
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:17,400
right the audio mixer here's this is a

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,159
test sine wave right so including the

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,650
test sine wave all the audio mixing code

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,930
here and things that tracks the sounds

84
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,620
was a hundred ninety four lines of code

85
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,780
okay that's probably less than the

86
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,580
number of build script modifications

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,390
you'll have to make to like go compile

88
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,719
someone saw Leo library right um so yet

89
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:42,599
you know I can appreciate wanting to

90
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,879
reuse code and if the code out there was

91
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,669
really good all the time and library

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,979
distribution worked really well and and

93
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,708
people programs really reliably and

94
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,269
great you know maybe that would be good

95
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,340
but the reality of it is that oftentimes

96
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,590
if you know what you're doing writing

97
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,479
the thing yourself takes far less time

98
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,330
than getting the premade thing to work

99
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,709
and then heaven help you when you get to

100
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,540
the end of the product and you find out

101
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:07,920
that there's bugs in it or weird things

102
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,329
that you can't fix and you have no idea

103
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,799
how the code works and now you've got to

104
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,940
go learn it all yourself well you'll

105
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,760
definitely end up spending more time

106
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,139
then right and so a lot of times it's

107
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,730
worth just taking a step back and

108
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:22,500
realizing just how few lines of code

109
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,270
these things actually are if you just

110
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,279
write them sanely and don't go into

111
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,269
object-oriented nightmare land and do

112
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,948
all these weird

113
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,598
kind of modern programming practices

114
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,728
that are very counterproductive if you

115
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:34,709
keep those things out of your code base

116
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:36,620
and just write the actual code you need

117
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:40,709
it turns out that these just aren't

118
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,360
taking very much space right so yeah so

119
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:44,068
I just want to emphasize that just

120
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,158
taking a quick look at just how small

121
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:50,129
this code actually is and again we wrote

122
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:52,560
it in this you know this past two weeks

123
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:55,080
I think one hour a night was all it took

124
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,788
for us to write all the assets streaming

125
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:01,740
all the sound stuff right so just keep

126
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:05,219
that in your mind and think about just

127
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,250
how easy that actually is it's worth

128
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,139
reminding yourself that that it's just

129
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,509
not that hard once you know what you're

130
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,280
doing to actually write these things and

131
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,210
maybe you don't ever want to be someone

132
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,489
who knows what they're doing and that's

133
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:19,529
fine too but you know assuming that you

134
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,848
actually don't mind doing the

135
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:22,619
programming practice and getting up to a

136
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:25,319
certain level of proficiency once you

137
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,030
get there you know to a reasonable level

138
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,460
of program proficiency I think you will

139
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:31,859
probably find that building your own

140
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,689
stuff tends to pay off quite a bit and

141
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,120
really doesn't take very much time

142
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,918
compared to how much it would take you

143
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,439
to use something frustrating and that's

144
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,269
possibly not exactly what you want right

145
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,709
so just a little public service

146
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:45,389
announcement there I try to sprinkle

147
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:47,008
those in occasionally just to remind you

148
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,259
of why we do things from scratch because

149
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,560
seeing how easy it is sometimes is a big

150
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,389
deal and so let's go ahead and continue

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,028
on let's take a look at what we have

152
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,278
here and what we might want to do so in

153
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,870
our playing sound system we have this

154
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:02,788
concept of a volume and what I'd like to

155
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,310
do is I'd like to extend that concept of

156
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:08,579
volume to allow me to animate the volume

157
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,610
over time and now normally the way that

158
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,889
I would do this there's there's some

159
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,560
ways that i would do animation in a

160
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:19,550
graphic sense that are not the same as

161
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,389
in a sound sense there's a lot of

162
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,210
differences between the way sound

163
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,620
programming works and the way graph

164
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:27,778
experiment works and the reason for that

165
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,120
is because graphics is actually a very

166
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:32,098
low frequency phenomena we talked about

167
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,598
this a little bit but basically graphics

168
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:35,509
you are talking about something where

169
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:38,930
you are outputting a frame of

170
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:41,129
information to the user you know at most

171
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,889
90 times a second

172
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:46,528
in like a VR scenario but often times as

173
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,408
few as 30 times a second in sort of a a

174
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:52,079
high complexity lower frame rate game

175
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:54,899
right and nowadays maybe in a common

176
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,008
scenario 60 frames a second right but

177
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,110
audio is something that happens

178
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:01,408
primarily at something like forty eight

179
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,348
thousand times a second and when you

180
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:06,899
think about what happens at that sort of

181
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:08,338
that high frequency it just leads you to

182
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,988
do some things that are a little bit

183
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:12,629
different than what you would normally

184
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:14,848
do and so for example in it we've seen

185
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,129
this in the renderer you will notice

186
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:20,938
that in the renderer we tend to batch up

187
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:23,218
static sets of things into like lists

188
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,259
and when we just draw them right and the

189
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:28,050
renderer itself doesn't really need to

190
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,269
understand that all that much about how

191
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,860
things are animating but that really

192
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:34,379
doesn't work for something like sound

193
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,908
mixing because for sound mixing you can

194
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,800
imagine this loop that we've got here

195
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:39,688
right you'll notice get outputs many

196
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,119
many frames it outputs like something

197
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,649
like 800 frames if you will right which

198
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,939
we call samples in the sound room but

199
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:48,990
that's what they are they're frames of

200
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:53,039
information we output 800 of those every

201
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,199
time we output just one frame of video

202
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,588
data and that means that there really is

203
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,778
no way to architect the audio system to

204
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:03,118
work the same way that the video system

205
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:06,598
does which is to say that all or most of

206
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:09,059
the animation capability is taken out of

207
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:11,699
the final compositor and placed in the

208
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:13,800
hands of a higher level component of the

209
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,569
engine that's not typically true and

210
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,990
sound typically in sound there are at

211
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,789
least a few core animation components

212
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,800
that will be sitting directly in the

213
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:25,528
mixer and that is because those things

214
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,209
need to animate for every frame just

215
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:29,908
like they do in video but those frames

216
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,709
are happening so fast that they have to

217
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:35,158
be done inside those composite loops

218
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:37,168
right and so what happens is in sound

219
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:39,990
mixing you tend to have stuff like the

220
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:42,120
animation of the volume or a few other

221
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,799
things that might be animated like that

222
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,970
tend to be happening directly in the

223
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,068
mixer and that's how we're going to have

224
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,620
to do it now and so like I said the way

225
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:51,479
that I might handle animating a value

226
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,419
over time in other parts of the engine

227
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,670
and you've seen me do some of those

228
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:56,899
we haven't really gotten to animation

229
00:08:54,669 --> 00:09:00,409
complex animation stuff yet but you see

230
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:02,929
me do a little bit of that anyway those

231
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:05,389
techniques are not applicable to sound

232
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:07,549
at the low level here what has to happen

233
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:11,089
here is that animation stuff has to

234
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:12,859
occur directly inside the actual system

235
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,470
that outputs the sound samples directly

236
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,199
and we will see a little bit of about

237
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,329
that in rendering potentially there are

238
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:21,889
times when we do need to push animation

239
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:24,289
concepts a little lower so that they're

240
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:26,839
actually in the renderer proper but it's

241
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:28,759
rare whereas in the sound system it's up

242
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,130
front and center and very core concepts

243
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:33,350
like volume which is you know one of the

244
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:36,980
most basic fundamental concepts of sound

245
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,480
volume and and frequency of the sounds

246
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,528
that we playback those are actually

247
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,930
going to be handled directly in the

248
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:43,429
mixer out of necessity not because it's

249
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:45,528
architectural e convenient for us to do

250
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:48,739
so not because I like it better that way

251
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:51,230
but because it is just a fact that it

252
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:57,019
has to be handled inside in order to be

253
00:09:51,230 --> 00:10:00,230
efficient ok so what we want to be able

254
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:03,980
to do here is we want to be able to set

255
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,019
our volume so that we can change it over

256
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,829
time and so what I'd like to do is

257
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:12,919
introduce the notion that the volume we

258
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:15,409
have is kind of twofold right there's a

259
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:18,559
current volume and then then then maybe

260
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:22,370
there will be a target volume right so

261
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:24,078
when we set the volume of a sound what

262
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,698
we will be doing in the future instead

263
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,500
of just setting its volume directly is

264
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:30,139
will sort of be setting a target volume

265
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,509
that's like a request to the mixer to

266
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:38,179
get to that volume at some point right

267
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:41,120
but it won't be discontinuously setting

268
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,679
that volume directly and so that's the

269
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,209
first step that I want to do is just to

270
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,159
introduce that separation because

271
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,518
basically we can't just go around

272
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,169
setting those volumes anymore and having

273
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,269
discontinuous volume changes what we

274
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:57,669
need to be able to do is we need to be

275
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,669
able to have our volumes here

276
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:14,370
oops this is in the wrong place I think

277
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:17,680
where is that we gotta put here yeah

278
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,360
sorry God will distracted there to do is

279
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,739
in the wrong place anyway so what we

280
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,629
need to do here is me to be able to set

281
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,070
a volume so that people in the code you

282
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:26,110
are trying to talk about the volume of a

283
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,560
playing sound and want to change the

284
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:32,680
volume of that playing sound can do so

285
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:34,539
but so that it won't lose the

286
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,370
information that we need later to

287
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:37,539
smoothly ramp to that value because in

288
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,100
order to smoothly ramp that value we

289
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:41,049
need to know what it currently is so

290
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,830
we're going to track the current volume

291
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:46,779
as a separate thing from the other the

292
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,670
other information so then we'll set this

293
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:52,269
target volume and what we want to do is

294
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:54,969
here in this loop where we are going a

295
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:56,829
you know sort of overtime what we want

296
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,110
to be able to do in this loop is figure

297
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,790
out what the volume should be at every

298
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,649
sample we want to kind of change it

299
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:05,019
right so you want the volume to smoothly

300
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,189
animate as we output the sample so that

301
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,009
in each sample it's going to use a

302
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:12,090
slightly different volume now there's a

303
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:16,090
couple different ways we can do that and

304
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:17,379
they have some they've got some

305
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,970
trade-offs right there's there's

306
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:22,149
different ways that this that this could

307
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:24,879
work and there's obviously reasons why

308
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:27,850
we may or may not want to do certain

309
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,679
things but what I want to do is is do

310
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,440
this sort of most straightforward

311
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:36,459
version first but that has a little bit

312
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,700
of a potential caveat in it and then

313
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,900
sort of when we when we are finished

314
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,790
with that maybe we can talk about

315
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,379
whether we want to change it or not and

316
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:46,659
we'll take a look at the cindy version

317
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:48,360
of it to sort of make that distinction

318
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:52,059
but it's basically a performance issue

319
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,820
is the reason why it's worth thinking

320
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:56,199
about so anyway so what I want to do now

321
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,510
is start to extend this concept a little

322
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,240
bit so let's go ahead and think about

323
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:03,759
this here what I want to do is when we

324
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,519
do this play sound call I want to have

325
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:10,049
another call but people external can

326
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,360
make where they can say you know

327
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:18,189
something like chain

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,139
volume right and so when you call change

329
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:25,870
volume what I want to do is you'll pass

330
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:27,120
the playing sound in like so just maybe

331
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,320
we'll pass the audience day as well

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,200
you'll pass in the sound whose volume

333
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,980
you're trying to change you'll pass in

334
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,690
what you wanted the volumes to be so

335
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,250
you'll pass in like what you want volume

336
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:44,050
in the tuna two channels to be like this

337
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,899
but what we also want to do here in

338
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:48,909
addition is give it some indication and

339
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,370
we don't really have anywhere to store

340
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:53,169
this yet but we'll add something we want

341
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,328
to give it some indication of how fast

342
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:56,949
we want it to get to that volume right

343
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:59,739
because the sounds at a particular

344
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:02,110
volume now and we're gonna say this is

345
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,700
how we want to get up to its next volume

346
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:09,940
right but you know we haven't actually

347
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,680
said anything about how that volume how

348
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,750
fast that volume will change does it

349
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,849
take a second to go from the current

350
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:19,149
volume to the new volume does it take

351
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,889
you know is it instantaneous does it

352
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,629
take a minute is it super long you know

353
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:27,009
what's what's the what's the actual time

354
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:29,649
frame and so to figure that out we've

355
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:32,019
got two ways we could specify it one way

356
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:34,089
is we could specify how long we expect

357
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,828
it to take in seconds basically right we

358
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,290
could say this is how many seconds i

359
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:40,750
want to take to reach the new volume and

360
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:42,278
that's a good method for if we know that

361
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,350
generally we want things to take a fixed

362
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:46,539
amount of time the other way we could do

363
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,139
it is we could specify that we want it

364
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:51,578
to happen at a particular rate and then

365
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,730
that would mean that it would happen

366
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:58,059
however fast it happens would be sort of

367
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,039
based on the Delta between the volume so

368
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:02,018
if it was a certain volume now and it's

369
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,120
going to be a certain volume later if

370
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:06,278
that is a large gap it will take longer

371
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,190
than if it was a small gap so when we

372
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:11,049
pass in those values that's that's sort

373
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,430
of how that would work now i think what

374
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:15,059
i'm going to do is I'm going to lean

375
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:18,250
towards going with the the other way

376
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,559
where we say how much time to take and

377
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,899
the reason that I want to do it that way

378
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,159
I think is because I feel like most of

379
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,659
the time that's what people will

380
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,409
actually want to specify they'll want to

381
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:28,120
say

382
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:30,730
need this sound to be at this volume in

383
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,818
a second or whatever I feel like that's

384
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,680
likely and they aren't going to want to

385
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:37,179
go look for us to see how loud it is now

386
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,859
and then figure out the rate I feel like

387
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:40,149
that's probably the case but we could

388
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,528
certainly change that later that's

389
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,828
something that we can't really write the

390
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:46,629
test case for just yet so I can't really

391
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:48,909
prototype it because we just don't have

392
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:51,399
enough in the game that's really using

393
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:53,078
sound or anything at this point so it's

394
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,429
hard to say and the one thing you know

395
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,899
that I can think of right off the bat

396
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,638
that we would use this for is fading

397
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,350
music in and out and it seems pretty

398
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,909
clear to me that the way we would fade

399
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,829
music in and out is probably going to be

400
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:04,448
something like saying that the music

401
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:07,239
fades in and out over two seconds of

402
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:09,219
time or something right so I feel like

403
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,259
that's probably the way that we're going

404
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,589
to want to do it so we'll leave it that

405
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:18,250
way so we've got the volumes here i'm

406
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:21,879
going to say that we've got seconds time

407
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:24,789
in seconds right or duration maybe a

408
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,490
fade duration in seconds and so if the

409
00:16:24,789 --> 00:16:28,688
fade duration in seconds is 0 right that

410
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,579
would tell us that we want to

411
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,259
instantaneously change the volume and if

412
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:34,028
the fade duration is anything other than

413
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:41,079
0 then we will figure out what that rate

414
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:43,539
should actually be right ok so let's

415
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:48,008
start out if the fade duration in

416
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:50,438
seconds is is something wonky right then

417
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:52,778
what we want to do is just full on cold

418
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:55,778
set the sound right we just want to say

419
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:59,470
all right the current volume is going to

420
00:16:55,778 --> 00:17:01,480
equal the target volume now and it's

421
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:07,870
going to be whatever the dude passed in

422
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:10,538
right so it's like that otherwise what

423
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,729
we want to do is say all right well if

424
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:14,919
you're going to take a certain duration

425
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,769
seconds then what I want to do is I want

426
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,600
to set that speed that you know I

427
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:21,548
probably want to report a speed here

428
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,889
right so it's going to be something like

429
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:28,150
d current volume write the velocity of

430
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,759
the volume that D current volume is

431
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,980
going to be based on the difference

432
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:36,129
between the target volume

433
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:40,990
and the current volume right so like

434
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,820
this right so I'm saying I want to get

435
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,630
to the target volume I'm at the current

436
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:47,950
volume so that's how much you know

437
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,410
that's that's how much distance I have

438
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,048
to cover and then I've been told what

439
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,240
the fade duration in seconds is so I can

440
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:57,429
also figure out like how long it would

441
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,870
actually take me to get there and then I

442
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:00,640
can set the speed to that so that we've

443
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:04,269
got you know a speed that would actually

444
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,970
be reasonable right and what I hopefully

445
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:10,089
you can see here actually as well is

446
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,100
these are you know these are basically

447
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,599
executing the exact same equations right

448
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,548
I'm looking at exactly the same

449
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,279
equations on these and so what I could

450
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:21,369
choose to do pretty easily is just set

451
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,470
these to be vectors right if I set these

452
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:24,909
to be vectors then what i can do is i

453
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:30,819
can make this into just a vector

454
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:32,890
equation in both cases right and you

455
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,990
know i'd end up with you know something

456
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,309
that's that looks much cleaner and not

457
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,440
really have to worry about duplicating

458
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:40,000
it out for multiple channels and also

459
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,650
its kind of handy if we want to make

460
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,140
this into something that that eventually

461
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,610
handles you know five channels of audio

462
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,350
or something like this we could make a

463
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:51,069
v5 and all of this stuff would

464
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:52,449
presumably still work so i'm going to go

465
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:56,500
ahead and do that that seems like a

466
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,759
reasonable thing to do and yeah so there

467
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,460
we go now i don't remember if we made a

468
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:03,509
vector division operator so we may have

469
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:08,558
to do one over there but yeah either way

470
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:13,890
let's go ahead and and set these guys up

471
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:17,980
correctly there we go yeah I thought not

472
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:23,500
let's see here and so that's okay i

473
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:26,890
think i may leave a 11 / fade i may

474
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,750
leave that undefined and just do it

475
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,150
manually here cuz i'm not sure i really

476
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,240
want the addition operator to be in

477
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,548
there for vectors so that would give us

478
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,769
a delt on the current volume now what I

479
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:42,730
would like to do when we initially make

480
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:44,829
these guys I would like to now go back

481
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,669
and think about these other ones that

482
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,230
are in there and make

483
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,730
sure that you know we always set our

484
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,499
target volume to the same thing as the

485
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,829
current volume and that the D current

486
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:56,690
volume is going to be a zeroed thing so

487
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:59,358
that we don't by default we're not

488
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:06,649
moving the current volume around like

489
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:09,319
you know or anything like this okay so

490
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:11,418
now we've got this it's pretty easy for

491
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,509
us to do sort of the stupid thing which

492
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:16,190
is not particularly good but we can sort

493
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:19,700
of do the stupid thing to get ourselves

494
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:23,419
started here right and so let's just

495
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,669
make sure this is also playing right you

496
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:29,538
can kind of hear that the music still

497
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:32,200
playing and we can say that the little

498
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:35,089
bloop weird bloop drop thing is playing

499
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:37,460
so what we want to do now is we want to

500
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:39,858
come in here and start to to mess with

501
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,350
the volume here right so we've got the

502
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:46,099
volume we can use that as a vector here

503
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:49,579
as well and when we're in here doing our

504
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:53,959
volume stuff we can just grab it out at

505
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:55,548
the at the last moment okay so when we

506
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,259
have the volume what we want to do now

507
00:20:55,548 --> 00:21:01,429
is whenever we're going through this

508
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:03,858
loop we want to change the volume based

509
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:06,320
on you know sort of as we step through

510
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:08,358
those samples we want to change it so

511
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,428
that we're using that that volume

512
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:13,009
velocity basically right we want we want

513
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:16,100
to do something in here where every time

514
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:21,440
we take a step we want to basically you

515
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:24,498
know we want to do this right and we

516
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,570
want to change the volume for every for

517
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:29,298
every sample problem is right now we

518
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:31,939
have the volume in terms of a change per

519
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:33,710
second right and so if you think about

520
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,179
this this goes back to our old friend

521
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,980
dimensional analysis we haven't talked

522
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:38,538
about him in a while because we've been

523
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,999
working on sort of structural

524
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:43,730
programming sorts of things but when

525
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:45,079
you're in the world of velocities and

526
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,019
stuff like that it tends to be a good

527
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:51,558
thing so we have something where we've

528
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:55,489
got a value that's in that that's in

529
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:58,249
sort of volume per second right that's

530
00:21:55,489 --> 00:22:00,500
what we said right you can see that up

531
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:03,650
here where we have

532
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,069
literally volume times one over seconds

533
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:11,600
right so we essentially had one over

534
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:15,169
seconds times volume right and that is

535
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:18,199
literally volume over seconds but that's

536
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:23,420
not what we want right we have volume

537
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:26,120
over seconds but what we want at the end

538
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,750
of the day is actually volume over

539
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:32,419
samples right so dimensional analysis we

540
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:37,579
know what we want to do here is we want

541
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:40,940
to cancel out seconds and we want to

542
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:44,710
introduce samples as the divisor right

543
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:47,720
so what we need to do is multiply our

544
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,750
source value our input value here by

545
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,710
seconds over samples to get us into

546
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:56,630
volume change per sample right I you

547
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,200
know you know I'm saying you feel me

548
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:03,710
dawg so in this case we actually know

549
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:07,340
what this is because we have forty-eight

550
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:10,039
thousand samples per second right we

551
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:12,109
know that samples per second is the

552
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,359
inverse of what we want here we want

553
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:16,490
seconds per sample so all we have to do

554
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,399
is invert our samples per second we just

555
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,890
have to do one over our samples per

556
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,600
second to get seconds per sample so it

557
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,090
should be pretty easy for us to do and

558
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:33,199
if we take a look at that sound output

559
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:36,049
buffer that we defined right sound game

560
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
sound of that Mary now you can see that

561
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:41,419
samples per second is actually a value

562
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,490
that we put like right in there right so

563
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,130
we can actually take samples per second

564
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,690
and we can you know invert that to give

565
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,310
us the value that we need and that way

566
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,990
we're not even dependent on that

567
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:52,309
constant the operating systems just

568
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,579
telling us what it's playing the sound

569
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:59,809
back at and then we can you know you

570
00:23:55,579 --> 00:24:01,399
know we can adapt right we'll never

571
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:03,079
going to do that because we will author

572
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,150
all our sound samples at a particular

573
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:08,119
frequency and will want to play them at

574
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:11,150
that frequency but point being the mixer

575
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,609
itself wouldn't care so all right so we

576
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,400
have

577
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:17,259
no seconds per sample and that's just

578
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,840
going to be 1 point 0 / samples per

579
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:22,929
second and samples per second comes from

580
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,439
that sound buffer so there we go so if

581
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:28,570
we want to create d volume here what we

582
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,789
need to do is just take the current

583
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:32,529
volume and multiply it by that seconds

584
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:34,389
per sample as we saw that's what will

585
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:37,269
give us the value that we actually need

586
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,190
to step with and so we're going to do

587
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,500
that stepping in here now the problem

588
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,509
that we have is that this will never

589
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,669
actually complete right it'll just keep

590
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:48,099
changing the volume in that direction

591
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,720
forever and so a not particularly

592
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:53,139
correct way to do this and we're going

593
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:59,308
to have to do a put to do this is not

594
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:02,020
correct yet need to truncate the loop

595
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:05,950
what we want to do here is say oh okay

596
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:09,129
you know when we when we have the volume

597
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:13,110
and the target volume we want to be able

598
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:16,360
to look to see what's actually happening

599
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:19,029
if we've actually hit the volume targets

600
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,639
that we've tried to hit right what we

601
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:25,509
want to do is say something like okay

602
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,250
you know if if d volume and this is

603
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,009
probably something we need to do it per

604
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,650
channel of the volume right you can

605
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:36,879
imagine so we have like a channel index

606
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:38,679
here and we would do that for whatever

607
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,980
the channel can't actually is in this

608
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:45,259
case it's we can only do it for two but

609
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:49,610
I guess let's see here how about we say

610
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:51,740
hey where's the channel count we don't

611
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,359
even define a channel count really we

612
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,410
just have stereo out so I guess we're

613
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:58,399
just going to have to hard code that

614
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:01,690
there could do it this way could say

615
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:06,290
channel can't teach an old count is two

616
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:10,250
output channel count like that so if we

617
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:12,170
say output channel count here what we

618
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,690
want to do is say if the you know if the

619
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:22,570
d volume is greater than zero or if the

620
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:22,570
you know d volume oops channel index

621
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,900
argh we go is less than zero in either

622
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,000
of these cases we were animating right

623
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,890
and what I want to do this is great

624
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,480
emacs thinks this is a template now so

625
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,670
it's thinks I'm indented here which I'm

626
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,450
not watch what happens when I delete

627
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:50,000
this and and get it back to its normal

628
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:54,100
state oops cut that back in there or

629
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:01,730
maybe not is this guy what has happened

630
00:26:54,099 --> 00:27:04,099
why do you think I'm indentity max I do

631
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:09,289
not know ye max thinks I'm indented here

632
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:10,939
oh right yeah I get this weird thing

633
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:13,460
sometimes where Emacs thinks I've made a

634
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:17,059
template when I do this I have no idea

635
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,039
why it is it's super strange and then I

636
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:20,569
have to go like deleting them so

637
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,730
sometimes when i get an indentation I

638
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:24,889
don't thinks like I I have to go do this

639
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,519
weird thing I've never really been able

640
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:29,870
to reproduce it reliably but yeah that

641
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:32,150
time it was fine it was just missing if

642
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:34,609
so we're good didn't have to do the the

643
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,050
weird dance of hunting for for greater

644
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:38,539
than to less stands that it thinks our

645
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:42,109
templates initializers or something like

646
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:44,420
this all right so off we go in either

647
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:46,369
case we know that we're animating here

648
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:50,240
and so what I want to do is just say

649
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:53,329
alright if the volume that we're

650
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,829
actually trying to hit right if the if

651
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:57,829
the you know volume that we're actually

652
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:58,939
trying to hit is it something that we've

653
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:01,099
achieved then

654
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,170
stop doing the animation right so

655
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:06,980
basically if like the current volume in

656
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:09,680
this case is and you know the d volume

657
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,740
was was what was positive so we're going

658
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,710
up to towards the target volume if the

659
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,289
current volume has met or exceeded the

660
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:21,819
target volume then I'm just going to go

661
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:25,670
ahead and and assume that we hit it

662
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:28,460
right and we're going to stop so we say

663
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:33,880
you know we're done there and then the

664
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:37,700
the the d volume the d current volume

665
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,350
can stop animating entirely right and

666
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,930
the same thing would be true in the

667
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:44,990
opposite case we would just do the other

668
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,210
direction of comparison and again we

669
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,769
would be done and I think I actually

670
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,829
should say i want this the other way i

671
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,509
want to set it to the target volume

672
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:55,549
right i want to say it should match the

673
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:57,109
target biome exactly now this is not

674
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:59,629
actually correct what's going on here

675
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:01,759
because like I said it will overshoot a

676
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,890
little bit because it will do more of

677
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:06,799
this loop than it should have done you

678
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,020
know it'll go further potentially so we

679
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,109
need to actually make sure the loop only

680
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:15,799
executes for as many as it it should but

681
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:21,769
for the time being let's go ahead and

682
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:27,259
run that okay so now we don't actually

683
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:32,389
have right any fading going on but what

684
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:35,750
I can do now is if we want to fade that

685
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,790
sound out right I can just take make a

686
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,960
set a breakpoint in here somewhere right

687
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:45,379
in whereas our handmade audio I guess we

688
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:52,809
don't have handmade audio yeah let's see

689
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:56,740
how about output playing sounds alright

690
00:29:52,809 --> 00:30:00,339
so let's try that again

691
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,759
I would like it if this were would keep

692
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:05,470
playing while we were in the bugger

693
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:09,599
should probably try to set that up as a

694
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:15,160
sort of trick thing anyway it's playing

695
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:19,149
so now if we if we go in here and I you

696
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:21,970
know I set a breakpoint what i can do is

697
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:25,720
i can i can step in and I can just

698
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,579
full-on cold set you know one of these

699
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,289
playing sounds to start fading out right

700
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:35,369
because I can take a look at playing

701
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:40,690
sound and and I can change what the

702
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:42,909
that's odd are we oh yeah you know what

703
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:48,100
I forgot about the little caveat that

704
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:50,519
we're still compiling in in release mode

705
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:52,629
so we don't be able to change anything I

706
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:55,299
wonder if you know what's one thing we

707
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,210
should probably do I wonder if this

708
00:30:55,299 --> 00:31:00,519
would be a good idea now that we can

709
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:02,558
because our code is fast enough I wonder

710
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,750
if we should just turn off 1920 x 1080

711
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,428
so that we can just always compile in

712
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,900
debug mode I wonder if we'd be fast

713
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:09,900
enough to hit 30 frames a second there

714
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:19,759
yes we are so that would allow us to

715
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,330
keep going in debug mode which is kind

716
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:27,140
of nice right so I think maybe we'll

717
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:29,269
we'll keep that good all right so if we

718
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,000
go back in here now now that I can

719
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:34,940
actually look at playing sound so if I

720
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,829
want to I can set the target volume to

721
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,470
like to fade out right I could say that

722
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:42,470
I wanted to set the target volume to

723
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:46,548
fade out and I could set the D current

724
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:51,230
volume to be something like I wanted to

725
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:54,740
fade out you know at a rate that was

726
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:58,849
going to be pretty slow right so it's

727
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:01,099
going to fade out like so that would

728
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:03,230
basically be you know again this is

729
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:06,168
volume for sample so this is saying that

730
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,789
it would take you know five seconds to

731
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:09,799
fade out the sound right because it

732
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:13,069
negative 2 per second negative point 2

733
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:15,679
per second would take five seconds to to

734
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:17,710
add up right so let's see if that does

735
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,710
anything

736
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:37,069
oh you know what though it's not really

737
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,240
going to do anything quite yet although

738
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:39,559
I guess I should probably have not

739
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,109
closed that we could have just used live

740
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:45,440
code editing to change this I never

741
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:48,949
actually wrote back yet the volume so we

742
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,650
also at the end here do need to actually

743
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:55,220
write back whatever the volume actually

744
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:57,380
is right so as we do these volume steps

745
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,360
we do want to actually save with the

746
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,560
volume is at the end of the loop so that

747
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,539
we could do it which actually now I

748
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,849
think about it it makes this a little

749
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:08,210
bit tricky I was trying to store the

750
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:10,879
volume in in a thing that would not be

751
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:14,029
dependent on the samples per second but

752
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,150
having to do that this gets a little bit

753
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:18,889
ugly right because if i was to store

754
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:21,830
back the volume i need to store it back

755
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,180
so that every frame you know I record

756
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:25,759
how much volume change happen in the

757
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:30,920
previous frame if I was to do that here

758
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:34,640
I'd have to reconvert this value the

759
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,230
volume value right back up wouldn't I oh

760
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,759
no you know what I could just use it

761
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,029
directly that's that's not true that's

762
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,710
not true I was I was all right look a

763
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:44,210
little out to lunch today that's not

764
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,519
true I think we can literally just do

765
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:52,069
that and we're fine so let's try that

766
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:55,940
one more time and I'll go in there and

767
00:33:52,069 --> 00:34:00,970
set a breakpoint and I will set the D

768
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:08,210
current volume to you know negative oops

769
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:11,079
2.2 8.2 and the target volume to 0 so I

770
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,449
just want to fade out the sound right

771
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:19,039
seems reasonable so let's see how that

772
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:21,668
goes trying to unset this breakpoint

773
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:21,668
there we go

774
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:32,030
there we go and off it goes so yeah

775
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:35,088
that's fading not particularly difficult

776
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,040
but we have not really done sort of the

777
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:40,039
nasty part of it yet which is dealing

778
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:46,808
with what happens when the fade doesn't

779
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:49,159
quite line up perfectly right because

780
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:51,200
this is going to be a loop that has

781
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,450
about 800 steps in it right it's going

782
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,219
to do this loop about 800 times when it

783
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,379
comes through here to do 800 of those

784
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,909
samples and so what you have to think

785
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,818
about when you're in there is like what

786
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:03,318
happens if the volume would have hit the

787
00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:05,829
target level just like right in the

788
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:11,298
middle there we don't want to keep

789
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:15,500
adding that volume in right so really we

790
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:19,190
need some way of actually making sure

791
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:22,760
that that loop won't do that that won't

792
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:25,010
it won't overshoot now this is already a

793
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,839
loop that kind of re-enters itself I

794
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:31,280
mean reenters is wrong word reruns

795
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:33,650
itself if it runs out of sound to mix

796
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,170
and there's a next sound there's a sound

797
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,180
that comes afterwards right it'll do

798
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,059
that reloading so I feel like what we

799
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:43,429
could do here as an easy way to fix that

800
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:45,980
problem of not stopping the volume

801
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:52,879
directly where it should be stopped is

802
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:55,400
we could you know in here we could check

803
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,180
to see when we expect to hit the volume

804
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,579
and clamp samples to mix to that if it's

805
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:03,919
going to be greater right if samples to

806
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:06,289
mix would have gone past that we could

807
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,409
just clamp it there and then this loop

808
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:11,088
would re-enter itself again would rerun

809
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:13,909
itself again and mix the remainder of

810
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:15,769
the samples I think so let me just make

811
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:17,838
sure there's nothing weird that would

812
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:21,199
stop us from doing that I don't think

813
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:23,358
there would be I think it just means

814
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,139
that we would have to get rid of this

815
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,139
assertion right

816
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,639
because now this assertion would just

817
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:33,529
totally fire I'm going to leave that

818
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,529
assertion in there for a second just to

819
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:38,810
make sure it does fire but I think

820
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:43,010
that's all we need so what we want to do

821
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:49,880
here is sailrite again this is going to

822
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:53,390
be a channel thing like so and what we

823
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,550
want to do here is just say that as we

824
00:36:53,389 --> 00:36:59,019
go through the the channel stuff and we

825
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:04,460
could also set a bull here right as well

826
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:05,900
which is going to be something like in

827
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:10,119
fact I guess this output channel count

828
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,119
should probably something more like this

829
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:20,690
audio state output channel count what we

830
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:24,920
could do here is say volume ended keep

831
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:26,450
sort of a a a set here where we will say

832
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,309
whether the volume going to end so that

833
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:30,349
later when we get down here we don't

834
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:33,739
actually have to do these checks at all

835
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:38,599
anymore if that makes sense so what we

836
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:43,069
would do is say all right you know for

837
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:48,199
each one of these if the volume ended on

838
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:50,360
the channel index then do that for it

839
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,859
and don't bother doing any of those

840
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,660
checks because we're going to do them up

841
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,880
here when we actually calculate when to

842
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:57,949
end so what we want to do to calculate

843
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,550
when we're going to end is we want to

844
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:05,509
see if the d volume for this channel is

845
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:06,920
not 0 right because if it is 0 then the

846
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:10,940
volume isn't animating so there's really

847
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:14,240
nothing that we need to do right to make

848
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,950
that work if the volume is animating

849
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,109
then what we have to do is just say ok

850
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:20,839
how many samples is it going to take us

851
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,900
to get from the current place to where

852
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:28,300
we're trying to go right so we want to

853
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:31,910
say we have a volume that we're at right

854
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:35,360
we have a volume that we're going to

855
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:39,049
which is that playing sound target

856
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,320
volume right and what we want to do is

857
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,960
say

858
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,980
eh all right we know that this is how

859
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:50,840
far we have to go right this is our

860
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:52,789
volume Delta right so we know that this

861
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,809
is how far we have to go in volume space

862
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:59,539
right and we know that this is how much

863
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:02,779
time it will take us right we've got our

864
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:05,360
d volume or sort of volume sample count

865
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,700
maybe it's the best thing to say this is

866
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,610
how much time we this is how much we

867
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:13,369
move every sample so if we take the

868
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,220
Delta and figure out how many of these

869
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,170
volumes is going to take us to get there

870
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:19,789
that would give us the sample count for

871
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,019
the volume right now it's going to give

872
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:25,820
us a floating-point version of the

873
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:27,530
sample count so what we need to do is we

874
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,470
really want that to be truncated and

875
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:33,110
round it up right so we want to do is

876
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:35,269
something like saying all right the

877
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,950
volume sample count is actually just

878
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:40,940
going to be you know some kind of a

879
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:43,549
thing where we where we round that up to

880
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,829
to the nearest sample and then we just

881
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:49,370
go ahead and use it so when we do that

882
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:53,900
rounding we then want to make sure that

883
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:56,750
we will truncate this this samples to

884
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,970
mix if we need to so if samples to mix

885
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,380
is greater than the volume sample count

886
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:03,139
we could do before hitting the volume

887
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:06,769
cup for this guy we are going to only

888
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:12,049
allow it to do that many right and

889
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:14,030
furthermore we are going to record that

890
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:17,500
fact so that at the end we will stop the

891
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:24,730
volume ramp from actually occurring okay

892
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:30,530
so there we go right uh that's about it

893
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:36,460
and did go and actually this should also

894
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:41,470
be volume ended see each channel index e

895
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,470
channel index so

896
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:57,108
and oops and this should be our account

897
00:40:51,630 --> 00:41:01,769
going ended as well so I think that's

898
00:40:57,108 --> 00:41:04,608
pretty much all we have to do let's go

899
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,608
ahead and check that out

900
00:41:06,608 --> 00:41:08,670
you

901
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:22,139
so let's let's try taking a fade in here

902
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,460
should probably set up a good test case

903
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:26,460
for this summer to keep going and

904
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,800
editing these but let's say I want the

905
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:33,510
target volume this time to be 0 point 5

906
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,880
or let you know it will do 0.0 on the

907
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:40,920
left channel and 0.5 on the right

908
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,750
channel and then that way we can hear it

909
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,470
should still be in one year basically

910
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:48,900
right and then the D current volume I'll

911
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:52,139
set something again really low Oh point

912
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:55,559
one for that guy Oh point one so it

913
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:59,539
should take about 10 seconds to fade out

914
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,539
and let's see how that does

915
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:10,809
and so hopefully this is exactly what I

916
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:12,700
thought it was this was the I saying it

917
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:13,659
should stop the loop early this was the

918
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:16,539
assert that I left in there

919
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:19,359
intentionally right and so hopefully

920
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:22,389
what that did here was that actually

921
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:25,269
sort of truncated it to one of the those

922
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:26,589
those values so that samples to mix was

923
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:28,659
less than what it should have been which

924
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,970
I guess was 1600 to 30 frames a second

925
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:32,799
is that correct so I was saying 800 it's

926
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:36,669
actually 2800 I was thinking the number

927
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,900
for 60 Hertz so let's take a look volume

928
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:43,840
ended 01 and so the volume that ended

929
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,369
first right is the one that got 20 point

930
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,470
five and that's exactly what should have

931
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:50,440
happened because right it should take

932
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:52,469
longer to get down to zero then to 0.5

933
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,940
so that's good that's sec what we want

934
00:42:52,469 --> 00:43:00,029
let's go to the disassembly on that just

935
00:42:54,940 --> 00:43:03,480
to skip over that that mauve there we go

936
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,480
set next statement

937
00:43:06,608 --> 00:43:11,768
and there's it hitting again and now it

938
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:14,650
should be the other one and that's

939
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:24,179
exactly what it was so that's good again

940
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:24,180
let's skip over that perfect

941
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:32,690
awesome uh all right so you know

942
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,339
certainly haven't exhaustively tested

943
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,679
this sometimes you can have audio bugs

944
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,150
that are very subtle so you know I'm not

945
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:39,769
going to put some kind of official seal

946
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:41,180
on this and say that it's fantastic or

947
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:44,030
anything like that but now we've got

948
00:43:41,179 --> 00:43:47,059
animated volumes and so we can now do

949
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:49,340
panning animated and we can change the

950
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:58,340
volume over we want to change the volume

951
00:43:49,340 --> 00:44:00,800
as well so that's all good yeah so

952
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,990
really the only thing we might want to

953
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:08,030
add in addition here would be pitch

954
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:10,689
changing right and so pitch changing is

955
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:13,970
is sort of a different beast altogether

956
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:22,159
but I don't know whether we want to

957
00:44:13,969 --> 00:44:25,369
start that mm this time or not yeah yeah

958
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,539
so let me talk briefly about actually

959
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:29,359
the stuff that I want to talk about that

960
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:31,550
was really do this so one of the

961
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,289
problems with doing things this way

962
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:36,110
though that I'm doing them here where we

963
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:39,739
just do a delta value that gets stepped

964
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:44,079
over time is that sometimes this can

965
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:48,169
lead you to not hit your volume as

966
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,730
exactly as you should hit it right and I

967
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,650
don't know to what degree that could

968
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,230
cause little minut errors in the sound

969
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:56,090
the reason for this is that if you take

970
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:59,449
something that's going to happen over

971
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:02,930
1,600 samples and you're adding a little

972
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:04,489
bit every time well if so you know if I

973
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:07,609
have a volume change that I want you

974
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:11,689
know X and I do 16 instead of just

975
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:15,200
adding X to the thing I do 1600 editions

976
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:17,059
of x over 1600 well that's all fine if

977
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,500
you're doing precise map but this is

978
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:20,150
floating point math at a computer and

979
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,519
floating-point math is in precise or the

980
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:26,210
question is is there error that will

981
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:28,789
accumulate when you do this right so

982
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:31,250
another way that we could do things is

983
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:35,210
by just setting a particular volume and

984
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:37,559
going to that volume by multiplying out

985
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:40,079
the new volume every time

986
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,759
right and the way that would work is we

987
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,449
would take sample index and we would

988
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,330
divide it by samples to mix to get like

989
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:50,759
how far we were in in this mix and we

990
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:54,239
would have a beginning and an end sound

991
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:56,250
value and we would just do the linear

992
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,469
interpolation between those right and

993
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:01,590
the reason that you don't want to do

994
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:05,539
that is because it requires you to do a

995
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:09,150
reciprocal like a you know an inversion

996
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:11,340
every step potentially or something like

997
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,349
this and so you may not want to do that

998
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,570
but these days you know the math I'm

999
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:18,539
chips is so fast that it's hard

1000
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,370
sometimes to really argue against doing

1001
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:22,139
stuff like that that are better a little

1002
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:23,789
bit more robust because it turns out

1003
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:26,759
that the chips today it's not like a

1004
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:31,889
divide is a huge deal anymore right it's

1005
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:35,040
really not that big a deal so sometimes

1006
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:38,250
it doesn't really make sense to sort of

1007
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:42,179
cut those corners if that makes if that

1008
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:43,829
makes a little more sense so yeah so

1009
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:48,529
that's one thing the other thing that we

1010
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:51,929
could do here is instead of adjusting

1011
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:59,190
how far in the loop we go we could

1012
00:46:51,929 --> 00:47:01,409
instead just adjust the Delta vol.2 to

1013
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,090
hit it at the end so if the volume was

1014
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:05,579
going to get there before the end we

1015
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,920
just reduce the Delta to make it so that

1016
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,960
it does line up at the end exactly right

1017
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,970
so we just back solve for that instead

1018
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,130
of solving for the samples we just back

1019
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:15,509
solve for the Delta volume that would be

1020
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,150
necessary to hit it right at the end

1021
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:21,000
right so that's another way we could do

1022
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:23,430
it and again I don't really know that

1023
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,380
there's a strong reason to or not to do

1024
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:27,750
it in any of these particular ways

1025
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,869
unless we actually hear problems that

1026
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:33,090
we're trying to fix or have reasons in

1027
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:36,029
the code why we want to do them so i

1028
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:39,300
probably will just leave that be for now

1029
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:41,220
and will redress that when we move this

1030
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,200
assembly because maybe in the sindhi

1031
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:47,399
optimized loop which maybe is going to

1032
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:50,009
want to operate for example on four

1033
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,720
things at a time say four samples at a

1034
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:54,070
time or something

1035
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:57,289
like this we may find that it becomes

1036
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:58,700
important there to be able to do those

1037
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:02,389
adjustments a little bit differently or

1038
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:05,029
something like this right I don't know

1039
00:48:02,389 --> 00:48:08,650
so I'm just pointing those out there I'm

1040
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:11,180
just I'm just saying what the idea is

1041
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:14,150
but that's basically where it's at so

1042
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:16,639
let's take a look now at the change

1043
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,440
volume stuff we aren't actually calling

1044
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,069
that so maybe we need to kind of test

1045
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:24,230
that routine here and what I'm what I'm

1046
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:27,470
going to do i guess is i'll just go into

1047
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:30,650
where we're currently calling the sword

1048
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:34,159
sound stuff so when we do our play sound

1049
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:38,869
calling here and we play the music I'll

1050
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:41,799
just go ahead and store a handle to the

1051
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:45,500
music when I actually play it in there

1052
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,960
so in here I'll do playing sound you

1053
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,358
know music or something like this and so

1054
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,909
I'll say you know we've got the music

1055
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:55,460
like that again this is just kind of

1056
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:57,679
placeholder code so I'm just using this

1057
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,289
for testing purposes so we'll grab the

1058
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:03,079
music there and then when we do some

1059
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:06,289
stuff like I go in here and I push one

1060
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,358
of these buttons maybe I'll make up fade

1061
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:09,920
in the volume and down fade out the

1062
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:13,039
volume just so we can play with it a

1063
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:17,180
little bit more so what we'll do here is

1064
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:21,920
in the the audio system I'll make a

1065
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:25,730
change volume call and I will have that

1066
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:32,108
do something useful here right so game

1067
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:36,260
state audio States it will take that

1068
00:49:32,108 --> 00:49:40,190
music and i will say that i want to have

1069
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:42,740
you know a ten-second fade on the music

1070
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,599
and i want it to fade in or out

1071
00:49:42,739 --> 00:49:47,539
depending on which i do so if i put up

1072
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:50,680
it'll fade in and if i push out it'll

1073
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:53,599
fade out right that should be about yet

1074
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:56,319
oops and i forgot that the volume is

1075
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,850
supposed to be for two channels

1076
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:03,039
like so so we'll just do it this way and

1077
00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:06,130
you know I'll also you know why not in

1078
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:11,079
here we could also do a thing where

1079
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:14,320
maybe we do a quick pan like so so we

1080
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:19,049
can move things between the two left and

1081
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:22,300
right speaker or something like that

1082
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:24,550
let's see no user define operator can

1083
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:27,880
perform the conferred what what is the

1084
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:30,340
problem here you want the ampersands

1085
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:44,530
i'll give you the ampersand if you want

1086
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:46,420
it you got it alright so here goes all

1087
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,960
right forgot to have to actually have

1088
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,960
stanch it a guy

1089
00:50:57,409 --> 00:51:05,309
that is doing absolutely nothing what

1090
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:07,470
did I do wrong what did I do wrong is

1091
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:09,090
our change volume code busted let's make

1092
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:13,139
sure it's being called first change

1093
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:18,870
volume because we tested the code and it

1094
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:22,019
worked fine in our test let's see so

1095
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:25,279
fade duration in seconds is 5 so it

1096
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:28,050
should skip that one over fade Oh

1097
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,530
fantastic I never actually set the

1098
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:34,350
target volume didn't change volume so

1099
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:38,760
glad we went ahead tested that target

1100
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:41,940
volume should equal volume that kind of

1101
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,610
goes to that saying and the Delta kind

1102
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:48,090
of has to have it have happened already

1103
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:51,630
as well so yeah so that was just a total

1104
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:57,260
nonsense routine that should not have

1105
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:57,260
worked and did not work all right

1106
00:51:57,409 --> 00:52:03,739
there we go so now it's in the left

1107
00:51:59,989 --> 00:52:05,799
channel right oh and I suppose we should

1108
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:09,649
take out our test assertion as well

1109
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:13,150
assert total samples to mix because this

1110
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,150
is actually going to happen now

1111
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:31,239
right so there's the paint one left

1112
00:52:27,768 --> 00:52:31,238
here's the pan back to the right

1113
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,190
voice back to centered

1114
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:39,900
you

1115
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:44,250
and fade 201

1116
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:59,989
all right I think that about wraps it up

1117
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:03,320
for today and tomorrow I guess we'll go

1118
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:07,039
do frequency changes that seems like

1119
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:09,500
probably the best idea to me but for now

1120
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:17,300
yeah let's let's go ahead and take it to

1121
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:26,409
the queue and the a let's see here do we

1122
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:26,410
have Q&amp;A hopefully we do there we go

1123
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:44,400
expect pre stream questions today uh-oh

1124
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:50,070
does that mean we were on the twitch

1125
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:52,139
frontpage what does that mean can you

1126
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:54,650
show again how you skipped a failed

1127
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:59,460
assertion by going to disassembly

1128
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:01,200
certainly I can certainly do that yeah I

1129
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:08,900
guess we may be never really covered

1130
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:12,118
this on me on the stream so let's yeah

1131
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:16,650
so I'm just going to go ahead and blow

1132
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:27,260
an assert right here this is the end of

1133
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:30,980
your program hahaha so if I'm going to

1134
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:33,210
you know have an assertion the fires

1135
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:35,760
then there's a couple different things

1136
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:38,510
that you can you that you might want to

1137
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,890
do here right if you're using one of the

1138
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:42,660
system assertions there's you can

1139
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:46,618
usually just use ignore right to go

1140
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:48,059
ahead and have that not be a problem but

1141
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:49,769
if you're not using the systems

1142
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:52,409
assertions then you don't actually get

1143
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:55,289
that luxury right if you hit ignore

1144
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:56,879
it'll just tell you again which is I

1145
00:54:55,289 --> 00:54:59,009
don't even know why the ignore is there

1146
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,539
it's four different types of exceptions

1147
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:04,470
I guess really where you could ignore

1148
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:08,969
them so that's because we haven't really

1149
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:10,439
written a you know a fancy assert but

1150
00:55:08,969 --> 00:55:11,789
just because we haven't written a fancy

1151
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,030
assert doesn't mean you can't skip one

1152
00:55:11,789 --> 00:55:17,940
if you wanted to because all that we did

1153
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:21,210
for the assert if you remember right in

1154
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:24,000
in handmade we sort of put in our our

1155
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:26,730
poor man's assert here all we did was

1156
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,320
just right to know right so we write we

1157
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,320
wrote to the null pointer which we know

1158
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,180
will immediately cause a memory fault

1159
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,300
and the operating system will halt our

1160
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:38,190
program as if it had you know done an

1161
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:41,670
illegal memory operation because that is

1162
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:43,289
what it is doing right so what that

1163
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,030
means is that if we go to the

1164
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:46,980
disassembly we should be able to see

1165
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,390
that illegal memory operation right and

1166
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,530
you can see that illegal memory

1167
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:53,400
operation right here

1168
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:55,530
I and you know you can see in the

1169
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,539
assembly what's actually going on so

1170
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:01,140
here is the test that sets up the jump

1171
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:04,259
it's seeing whether or not this are a x

1172
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:05,909
value is is well this is this is sort of

1173
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:10,680
a test reserve kind of a thing right

1174
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:12,960
this test instruction well I won't go

1175
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:15,449
too far into this let's simply say that

1176
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:19,829
the test sets up a condition flag which

1177
00:56:15,449 --> 00:56:23,189
jump if equal jumps on right and so what

1178
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:26,549
is trying to do is say oh okay you know

1179
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:28,650
if this assertion was not supposed to

1180
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:31,230
fire than what i'm going to do is jump

1181
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:33,510
to this address if the assertion was

1182
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:36,210
going to fire then i won't jump and

1183
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:39,570
it'll execute the next line well where

1184
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:43,170
is this address right this oh seven fef

1185
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:45,450
91 DC 617 well it's right here right the

1186
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:48,240
only thing it was trying to do was jump

1187
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:49,799
over this line of machine code right so

1188
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,529
let's trying to do is go from here to

1189
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,200
here if the assertion wasn't supposed to

1190
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:57,480
fire so if we don't want the assertion

1191
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,149
to have fired we can just right click on

1192
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,309
that line and say set next statement

1193
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,110
because that's what the code would have

1194
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:05,039
done if the assertion didn't fire so we

1195
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,660
know that we don't really have to do

1196
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:07,769
anything fancy to patch anything up

1197
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:09,690
because it would have just been there

1198
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:11,730
and so for there we can just go ahead

1199
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:13,349
and run right it's going to come right

1200
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:16,740
back here in a cert because this assert

1201
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:19,619
is happening every time but that's just

1202
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:21,269
a you know how you would skip a single

1203
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:23,609
one now if you wanted to skip all of

1204
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:26,340
them I suppose you could try to edit the

1205
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:29,460
code bites here to be honest with you

1206
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:32,660
I'm not sure I am really the person who

1207
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,659
would know how to do that

1208
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:43,358
I'm not even sure if you can edit them

1209
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:45,279
can you edit them I don't yeah so I

1210
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:47,440
guess what you'd have to do is you'd

1211
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,550
have to go into the memory window if you

1212
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:54,670
wanted to patch out the assert I mean

1213
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:58,060
you know let's say that you were not

1214
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,380
that crazy and you don't know assembly

1215
00:57:58,059 --> 00:58:01,269
language particularly well like i don't

1216
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,070
so i don't know the code bytes for

1217
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:05,380
specific assembly language instructions

1218
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:07,180
so i'm not going to perform that level

1219
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,640
of surgery by any stretch of the

1220
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:10,989
imagination you could still imagine you

1221
00:58:09,639 --> 00:58:13,088
know making life a little easier in

1222
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:15,579
yourselves you really wanted to you

1223
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:17,529
could do something like this where you

1224
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:21,509
basically said okay there's a persistent

1225
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:24,670
variable here that's like ignore right

1226
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:29,680
and then what you're going to do inside

1227
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:34,329
the ignore is you're going to say if not

1228
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:37,809
ignore then do the thing right something

1229
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:40,299
like this and so you could do that if

1230
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:44,349
you wanted to oops forgot to put an int

1231
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:49,150
on there so this is a bool 42 so we go

1232
00:58:44,349 --> 00:58:52,630
in there now and you hit that assertion

1233
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:54,849
right if you wanted to again this is

1234
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:56,108
still a pretty poor man's version of

1235
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:58,359
this but I'm just kind of giving you

1236
00:58:56,108 --> 00:59:01,059
what the idea is right you can see that

1237
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:03,608
does a comparison on that ignore value

1238
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:07,329
as well here now instead of just doing

1239
00:59:03,608 --> 00:59:11,440
the jump right and so what you can then

1240
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:13,869
do is say oh ok now what I could do is I

1241
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,420
could set that ignore a value I could

1242
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:17,740
set that ignore value true that's easy

1243
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:20,670
to do you can do it in the watch window

1244
00:59:17,739 --> 00:59:24,848
no problem now when you come out here

1245
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:28,240
and you you take a look at that you know

1246
00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:30,609
at at the set next statement and come

1247
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:33,159
out here you can just let it keep

1248
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:35,469
running and then it will ignore that

1249
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:37,649
assertion forever until you restart the

1250
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:41,559
program right

1251
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:43,210
so so that's something so yeah you can

1252
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:46,150
do stuff you can do stuff like that if

1253
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:48,429
you're if you're feeling fancy about it

1254
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:50,829
what we will do when we do our debug

1255
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:52,539
code pass is will actually write a real

1256
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:54,400
assertion that does some more stuff

1257
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:57,190
that's you know a little bit cleaner

1258
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,720
than actually just faulting but just to

1259
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,309
give you the idea that hopefully that

1260
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,769
gives you an idea of how that stuff

1261
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:05,469
works let me take out the assertion that

1262
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:12,789
I just put at the beginning of our

1263
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:14,109
program would there be any case where

1264
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:19,449
you would like to increase volume

1265
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:21,550
nonlinearly up possibly but you know

1266
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,589
honestly it's kind of hard to tell with

1267
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:26,140
sound most the time usually your ear is

1268
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:30,190
not that good at sensing stuff like that

1269
01:00:26,139 --> 01:00:32,619
so typically linear is fine you care

1270
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:36,429
mostly about the speed at which things

1271
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:37,809
are going so you do want to be able to

1272
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:40,289
control that but you don't necessarily

1273
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:43,900
need to control the shape of the curve

1274
01:00:40,289 --> 01:00:45,610
all that much typically typically but

1275
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:48,010
you know again it all depends on the use

1276
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:50,110
case right handmade here is not a game

1277
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:51,970
about sound it's a game about other

1278
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:54,190
things that happens to have sound which

1279
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:56,439
is the way many games or most games are

1280
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:58,539
but there are games that are about sound

1281
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,789
in games that are about sound may want

1282
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:02,320
to do more advanced sounding so you know

1283
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:05,980
like with anything on handmade hero

1284
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:08,140
we're basically doing sort of the basic

1285
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:11,380
version of everything to a professional

1286
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:14,049
level of quality but any given thing

1287
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:16,210
that we do you could choose to go way

1288
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:19,690
further on right and and if your game is

1289
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:21,610
about that thing then you would want to

1290
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:23,769
really go into depth on that and sound

1291
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:26,620
is an example of that handmade hero is

1292
01:01:23,769 --> 01:01:29,199
not a game that needs some kind of crazy

1293
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:32,920
elaborate sound system you know like

1294
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:34,929
maybe rock band let's say or fracked OST

1295
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:37,750
or whatever it was called might want

1296
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:40,529
because their games about sound right

1297
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:44,170
and so it's important to remember that

1298
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:47,140
when I say we don't really need to do X

1299
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:49,389
what I mean is in order to do a

1300
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:50,480
professional a professional quality

1301
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:52,579
version on this

1302
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,619
we don't need to do it that doesn't mean

1303
01:01:52,579 --> 01:02:01,789
that the circumstance would never call

1304
01:01:54,619 --> 01:02:03,410
for you to do something of that kind so

1305
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:04,909
far you can just change the volume of

1306
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:06,679
individual sounds should we be able to

1307
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:11,809
change the volume of the master output

1308
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:14,299
as well um I mean we could probably do

1309
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:18,679
we probably would want something very

1310
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:21,380
simple they're like for example we might

1311
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:24,559
want a thing which was just like you

1312
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:26,630
know master volume like this and then

1313
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:31,329
that that audio state would just by

1314
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:34,430
default you know do master volume equals

1315
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:37,159
the you know default volume and then at

1316
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:40,069
the head end whenever we're doing these

1317
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:42,049
these volumes right you would just pre

1318
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:45,260
multiply it in right so whenever you

1319
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:48,830
grabbed out the volume you would just

1320
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:51,500
you know you could you'd pre multiply

1321
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:53,858
the volume in there and then you don't

1322
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:56,358
pre multiply presumably on the way out

1323
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:57,529
well I guess you know what probably the

1324
01:02:56,358 --> 01:02:58,730
easier thing to do would actually just

1325
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:01,010
to leave it in here so that way you

1326
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:03,590
don't have to mess with the iterator in

1327
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:05,540
and out so yeah you'd probably just do

1328
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:07,579
something where you actually just

1329
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:09,769
multiply it in the loop we could we

1330
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:13,340
could if that turns out to actually cost

1331
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:14,690
us appreciably we could we could not but

1332
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:18,530
that would be how you'd throw a master

1333
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:19,880
volume in there really not a whole lot

1334
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:21,650
to it

1335
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:28,490
but that would that would let you do

1336
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:30,500
that well handmade here at support

1337
01:03:28,489 --> 01:03:31,578
spatialization EG sound mostly in left

1338
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,900
channel life on the left side of the

1339
01:03:31,579 --> 01:03:34,609
screen sound boasting the right channel

1340
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:38,000
if on the right side so we support that

1341
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:41,048
in the mixer now and i guess it's up to

1342
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,880
us whether we choose to use that feature

1343
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:47,509
when we're actually when we're actually

1344
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,710
playing sounds in the game and i don't

1345
01:03:47,509 --> 01:03:50,509
know which one will want to do i think

1346
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,740
that will when we get further along in

1347
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:53,269
the game we'll have to see what the

1348
01:03:51,739 --> 01:03:55,879
sound mix sounds like to us and whether

1349
01:03:53,268 --> 01:03:57,558
we like it sounding that way or whether

1350
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,150
that's too distracting and we'd rather

1351
01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:06,109
have it sound more centralized in

1352
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:08,059
general how hard would it be to do a

1353
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:09,940
fade out fade in for the music when the

1354
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:12,440
window loses focus or gets focused back

1355
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:14,088
well obviously as you've seen it's

1356
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,528
trivial for us to do that in the mixer

1357
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:18,920
now because we implemented that so that

1358
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:21,710
would be free but it's harder for us

1359
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,240
potentially to do that with windows

1360
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:25,579
because windows kind of cuts you off

1361
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:27,500
there so what we'd have to do because

1362
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:31,970
right now our the way that our sound is

1363
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:33,829
set up it's set up in a mode where we we

1364
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:35,959
kind of have audio device access when

1365
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:37,910
we're active and then we we don't play

1366
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:41,179
when we're not active what we would have

1367
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:45,230
to do is change when we request our

1368
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:47,058
sound buffers from windows when we set

1369
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:48,769
up the primary audio device which if you

1370
01:04:47,059 --> 01:04:50,809
remember a long time ago we did we would

1371
01:04:48,768 --> 01:04:52,548
have to change the way we set that up to

1372
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:55,670
tell windows that we want to play sound

1373
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:58,369
all the time not just when were the

1374
01:04:55,670 --> 01:05:00,200
active app but you can certainly do that

1375
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:01,190
so you know if that was something that

1376
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:03,730
you really cared about you could

1377
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,730
certainly do that

1378
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:15,380
so what did you end up doing to de vol

1379
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:29,789
if it wasn't linear interpolation it was

1380
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:33,059
d volume is linear interpolation if you

1381
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:35,309
implement assert using ? colon instead

1382
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:37,920
of if you could use it as part of

1383
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:43,679
expressions or other such places where

1384
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:46,170
you can't have an if statement but why

1385
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:49,588
would you want to use an assert in that

1386
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:52,829
way because the certs compile out so

1387
01:05:49,588 --> 01:05:54,690
they can't be part of statements if you

1388
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:59,160
want those statements to work the same

1389
01:05:54,690 --> 01:06:01,380
in debug or release right so do you have

1390
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:03,539
an example of where you would want to

1391
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:05,220
use that because i don't think i've ever

1392
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:06,630
wanted what you're saying and I'm

1393
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:07,679
wondering if maybe you're thinking of

1394
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:16,710
something different than what I'm

1395
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:17,789
thinking of when you say that kasto 5s

1396
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:19,050
sorry I haven't followed everything

1397
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:22,170
you've done lately did you already

1398
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:24,930
implant audio clipping could you be more

1399
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:29,369
specific about what you mean by audio

1400
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:31,318
clipping we have not done anything with

1401
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:33,920
the dynamic range of the audio if that's

1402
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:38,639
what you're talking about so for example

1403
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:43,139
in here right now we have not done a

1404
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:45,679
clamp right so I can even put that in

1405
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,679
here for you

1406
01:06:50,940 --> 01:07:02,349
oops that's not where the clamp goes I

1407
01:06:53,289 --> 01:07:04,179
meant here so you know when we're in

1408
01:07:02,349 --> 01:07:07,750
simdi and it's free for us to do so we

1409
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:12,059
will throw a clamp in there but we will

1410
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:22,780
probably never do anything wonky like a

1411
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:25,170
compressor all right is that it for

1412
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,170
questions

1413
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,568
okay gasps Elias is managing the other

1414
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,329
than exchange yes no we have not done

1415
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:45,909
anything for that and I don't think we

1416
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:45,910
will I don't suspect that we will I

1417
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:51,979
don't really feel like this game will

1418
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:54,650
need an audio compressor I could be

1419
01:07:51,978 --> 01:07:57,159
wrong about that but I just don't expect

1420
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:57,160
that it will

1421
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:08,719
with respect to is research with respect

1422
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:09,679
to assert I don't know why you would

1423
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:10,579
want to put one expression but

1424
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:12,769
apparently that's how it's usually

1425
01:08:10,579 --> 01:08:15,139
implemented it can't hurt right sure it

1426
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:17,539
can because if someone accidentally put

1427
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:20,439
in a certain expression that's like bad

1428
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:23,689
right that's code that's probably broken

1429
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:25,909
so I don't really want to enable a use

1430
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:30,649
case that I can't think of ever it

1431
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:34,880
actually occurring so so yeah it can

1432
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:37,460
hurt right you don't want code if you if

1433
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,260
you can't think of any legitimate reason

1434
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:41,180
why anyone would want to write a piece

1435
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,859
of code then you don't really want to

1436
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:47,569
enable that if the compiler could be

1437
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:51,140
catching it and cause an error right so

1438
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:54,350
so I wouldn't tend to do that unless I

1439
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:55,640
had a valid use case in mind and if I

1440
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,690
had a valid use case in mind than I

1441
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,060
would because i'm not one of those

1442
01:08:56,689 --> 01:09:00,979
people who likes to like lock down all

1443
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,720
the code and make it really hard to work

1444
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:04,369
with because you were trying to prevent

1445
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:06,980
all these mythical errors from occurring

1446
01:09:04,369 --> 01:09:11,298
so I'm totally not you know I'm not one

1447
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:12,709
of those people but on the flip side if

1448
01:09:11,298 --> 01:09:14,539
I literally can't think of a single

1449
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:17,630
reason why I would ever want to do

1450
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:21,199
something and I can and the thing that

1451
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:22,430
you're talking about the only things I

1452
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,710
can think of our times when you would

1453
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,510
want it to not happen then that is

1454
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:28,909
something I'm going to leave illegal

1455
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:32,260
because that all the compiler can is

1456
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:32,260
just going to help me right

1457
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,069
you

1458
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:42,220
you

1459
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,920
you can't just hard tip audio though if

1460
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:51,359
you don't use a compressor limiter you

1461
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,798
would have to at least use soft clipping

1462
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,639
with an age thing that's actually not

1463
01:09:52,798 --> 01:10:00,420
true it's like games totally ship with

1464
01:09:56,639 --> 01:10:02,130
with hard clipping it's it's really it's

1465
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:07,078
really not as big of a deal as you think

1466
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:09,150
and it happens very rarely in actual

1467
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:15,118
practice it's really not that big of a

1468
01:10:09,149 --> 01:10:18,779
deal will you implement audio file

1469
01:10:15,118 --> 01:10:20,518
compression I don't anticipate doing so

1470
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:22,529
by that I mean I don't anticipate

1471
01:10:20,519 --> 01:10:24,809
putting in a special-purpose audio

1472
01:10:22,529 --> 01:10:26,309
compressor if we can get away with it

1473
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:29,969
because I feel like it would just take a

1474
01:10:26,309 --> 01:10:32,010
very long time to put one in and it

1475
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:33,599
wouldn't really be all that educational

1476
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:35,429
because I'm not an audio compression guy

1477
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:37,979
so I would it would literally be like

1478
01:10:35,429 --> 01:10:40,050
watching me implement odd vorbis from

1479
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,840
the spec or something would you just be

1480
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:44,550
a long time of watching me do it where

1481
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,538
I'm not really adding any insightful

1482
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:50,189
comments because I have no idea I don't

1483
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:52,679
have insight to share right I'm just

1484
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:54,449
like well spec said this is what they

1485
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:58,590
did so that's when I'm playing back

1486
01:10:54,448 --> 01:11:01,469
right uh so i would like to not bother

1487
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:03,659
i'd like to just shove it all through a

1488
01:11:01,469 --> 01:11:04,979
basic compressor and just live with the

1489
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:08,458
fact that our file for prints bigger

1490
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:09,689
than it should be and you know if we did

1491
01:11:08,458 --> 01:11:11,368
do something with compression it would

1492
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:15,719
be after we're done with the whole game

1493
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:17,938
and in something like that but because i

1494
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:19,920
really just don't want to it's just not

1495
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:23,150
that interesting and I don't want to

1496
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,800
insert this huge block of of stream time

1497
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:28,609
to dedicate something that I just don't

1498
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,610
feel is particularly relevant

1499
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:40,389
what would an audio compressor do so an

1500
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,750
audio compressor is something which

1501
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:48,489
attempts to squish the range of the

1502
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:52,090
audio in a nonlinear way right so

1503
01:11:48,488 --> 01:11:55,269
typically what happens is if you think

1504
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:57,819
about how we squish volumes we're

1505
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:59,500
squishing volumes in a linear way so you

1506
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:02,799
know we have something where we do like

1507
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:05,260
volume time sound right and so what that

1508
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,690
does is the volume range is between 0

1509
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:09,460
and 1 typically and so if you have some

1510
01:12:07,689 --> 01:12:13,259
sound sample and you multiply it by

1511
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:16,090
point 5 it gets like half as tall right

1512
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:18,489
so you know this is this is the the

1513
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:22,239
point five sound here and this is the

1514
01:12:18,488 --> 01:12:24,819
the one point 0 version of the sound and

1515
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:26,709
so the problem with that is that if you

1516
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:28,988
have very loud sounds and very quiet

1517
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:31,510
sounds it's sort of like HDR imaging you

1518
01:12:28,988 --> 01:12:34,119
end up in a situation where you just run

1519
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:35,829
out of room to do everything this way

1520
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:37,869
and you want to try and make it so that

1521
01:12:35,829 --> 01:12:40,449
all your sounds fit in there so what you

1522
01:12:37,869 --> 01:12:43,210
try to do is instead of mapping the

1523
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:45,309
sound in that linear way where you just

1524
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:47,560
have like a linear ramp of some kind for

1525
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:50,200
your sounds what you do instead is you

1526
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:52,420
map it to some kind of a curve so that

1527
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:54,250
as it gets louder you know here's the

1528
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:56,739
input volume and here's the output

1529
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:59,890
volume as sounds get louder and louder

1530
01:12:56,738 --> 01:13:02,049
they stop actually becoming all that

1531
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,000
much louder in practice right so from

1532
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:06,430
here to here it actually is quite a bit

1533
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,050
much louder by moving this far whereas

1534
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:10,690
if I if I increase the volume by that

1535
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:13,199
same amount at a much louder and I'm

1536
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:15,939
really not getting very much right and

1537
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:17,649
so what it what it does in practice is

1538
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:20,259
if you look at like the waveforms right

1539
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:22,089
and here is you know my my crazy sound

1540
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,860
that I'm playing back right what it does

1541
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:27,699
in practice is it makes it so that you

1542
01:13:23,859 --> 01:13:29,649
know you've got a normal linear sort of

1543
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:32,409
looking sound profile here but then as

1544
01:13:29,649 --> 01:13:35,710
things get up into like a band at the

1545
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:38,109
high end it compresses a huge amount of

1546
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:42,970
actual linear volume range into this

1547
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:45,179
little band right that's that's what it

1548
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:45,180
does

1549
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:50,719
how much optimization would the mixer

1550
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:52,849
require you know honestly probably very

1551
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,380
little we might even be able to leave it

1552
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:57,430
the way it is but I was going to show

1553
01:13:54,380 --> 01:14:01,430
you how to do it and Cindy just just cuz

1554
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:03,590
but it's it's not like the GPU the the

1555
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:05,240
graphic stuff where we did sort of our

1556
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:06,650
own version of a GPU where we had to do

1557
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:09,050
some pretty good optimization to make

1558
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:11,960
everything go well that's not really the

1559
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:14,090
case with the mixer the mixer in its in

1560
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,500
its unseen deed state is probably still

1561
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:22,460
pretty fast and we certainly won't have

1562
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:23,960
to multi-threaded I wouldn't expect what

1563
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:26,180
is the difference between a limiter and

1564
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,640
a compressor so you're asking the wrong

1565
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:32,840
guy i am not an audio guy so i'm not

1566
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:34,730
even qualified to say you know what all

1567
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,670
the different things are limiter or

1568
01:14:34,729 --> 01:14:41,569
compressors or the many other things

1569
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:43,520
that there are out there so you you

1570
01:14:41,569 --> 01:14:45,259
should probably ask an audio an audio

1571
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:50,480
person for a good explanation because I

1572
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:55,750
have no idea what most audio filter

1573
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:55,750
stuff actually is technically you know

1574
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:14,039
looks like that is it all right good

1575
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,039
deal

1576
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:28,170
good deal all right well I guess we will

1577
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:29,310
go ahead and wrap things up I didn't

1578
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:31,050
feel like we got too many pre stream

1579
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:34,139
questions that seemed like a pretty

1580
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:38,730
reasonable set of questions to me let's

1581
01:15:34,139 --> 01:15:39,690
see here close this up all right thank

1582
01:15:38,729 --> 01:15:41,039
you everyone for joining me for another

1583
01:15:39,689 --> 01:15:42,899
episode of handmade hero it's been a

1584
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:45,988
pleasure coding with you as always if

1585
01:15:42,899 --> 01:15:47,460
you would like to follow along with

1586
01:15:45,988 --> 01:15:48,988
handmade here at home and play around

1587
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:50,789
with the source code yourself you can

1588
01:15:48,988 --> 01:15:53,189
always go to handmade hero dot org and

1589
01:15:50,789 --> 01:15:54,539
pre-order the game it comes with all the

1590
01:15:53,189 --> 01:15:57,689
source code so that you can play around

1591
01:15:54,539 --> 01:16:01,380
with it and learn from the stream as we

1592
01:15:57,689 --> 01:16:02,698
go we also have a forum site you can go

1593
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:04,469
to to ask questions while you're doing

1594
01:16:02,698 --> 01:16:07,079
that and it also has an ant 8 episode

1595
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:09,149
guide so you can follow up on like old

1596
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:11,579
episodes and watch them a little you

1597
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:13,710
know catch up if you've missed some we

1598
01:16:11,579 --> 01:16:15,238
also have a patreon page where if you

1599
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:17,789
would like to support the video series

1600
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:20,698
by itself you can subscribe and finally

1601
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:23,340
we have a tweak bot the tweet bots will

1602
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:24,928
tweak the schedule at you and let you

1603
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,909
know when the stream is going to be live

1604
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:28,739
so if you like what you're watching and

1605
01:16:26,908 --> 01:16:30,029

pacific daylight time tomorrow for

1626
01:17:16,948 --> 01:17:20,969
another episode of handmade hero so if

1627
01:17:19,229 --> 01:17:23,549
you would like to join me for some more

1628
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:26,099
audio coding we will go ahead and do the

1629
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:28,289
frequency change stuff so we can we can

1630
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,949
pitch shift our sounds up and down a

1631
01:17:28,289 --> 01:17:31,078
little bit

1632
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:32,759
which you know again not super necessary

1633
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:34,978
for our game but it helps that a little

1634
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,449
bit of variety to your soundscape makes

1635
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:38,489
things a little easier on the audio

1636
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:40,379
engineering so it's something that we

1637
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:41,698
want to enable just small pitch bends

1638
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,618
right we're not talking about auto tune

1639
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:45,988
or something here but small pitch bends

1640
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:47,279
can be pretty handy so we will we will

1641
01:17:45,988 --> 01:17:48,899
go ahead and implement that far and then

1642
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:50,939
we're coming up on the end of the stuff

1643
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:52,469
we need to do for audio so it's been

1644
01:17:50,939 --> 01:17:54,238
good it's been really efficient coding

1645
01:17:52,469 --> 01:17:57,538
again we're knocking all this stuff off

1646
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:59,279
our to-do list is great so yeah I'm

1647
01:17:57,538 --> 01:18:01,109
looking forward to having a fairly

1648
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,998
complete engine here we're getting we're

1649
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:04,319
getting good work done so hopefully all

1650
01:18:02,998 --> 01:18:06,868
of you out there excited about the

1651
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:09,238
progress we're making i know IM and it

1652
01:18:06,868 --> 01:18:13,078
feels good to be coming up on on sort of

1653
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:15,089
you know having a pretty capable engine

1654
01:18:13,078 --> 01:18:17,308
that we can play with for for the

1655
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,479
remainder of our game coding time so

1656
01:18:17,309 --> 01:18:20,159
thanks for joining me i will see you

1657
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,958
guys back here tomorrow until then have

1658
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:24,118
fun coding and i will see you guys on

1659
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:26,359
the Internet at large take it easy

1660
01:18:24,118 --> 01:18:26,359
everyone
