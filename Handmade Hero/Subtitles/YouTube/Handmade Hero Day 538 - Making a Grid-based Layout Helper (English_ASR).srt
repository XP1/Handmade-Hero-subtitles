00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:10,169
here are the show Rico to complete game

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:13,589
live on stream welcome we I think want

4
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:17,339
to keep pushing on what we were working

5
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:20,250
on yesterday I had some ideas over the

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,929
sort of last night just in terms of like

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,579
stuff I want to do and I think I want to

8
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:24,439
keep keep on doing it so what we did

9
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,118
yesterday

10
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,028
for those of you just joining us who

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:35,730
maybe missed yesterday's stream no I

12
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:38,308
don't care what we do yesterday is make

13
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:42,599
it so that the exterior right the like

14
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:44,488
out outside part is filled with stuff so

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,640
you know we just wanted to make sure we

16
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:51,209
stuck tiles sort of around the game

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,859
region you know I'm saying and the

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,259
reason for that is just when we walk

19
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,649
around here we want to make sure that

20
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:01,920
wherever we go the users not seeing like

21
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,390
empty space out there right we want to

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,060
be able to fill that with trees and

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,728
stuff so we needed a system that just is

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,100
aware of what that empty space is and

25
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,049
once they know what that what's the

26
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,390
system knows that empty space is we can

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,368
then write arbitrary programs later on

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,040
as we go to polish the look of the game

29
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:22,319
that fill it in with whatever we want

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,270
right but we need a system there that

31
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,029
will be smart enough to do something to

32
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:30,810
fill it we need it to know like what

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,189
needs to be filled and why right okay so

34
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,460
here are some things that we need to

35
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:37,438
finish doing to that system and you know

36
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,328
I want to kind of talk about what I was

37
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,789
thinking about doing there and why I was

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,819
gonna do it the way I was gonna do it um

39
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,189
so what we ended on a problem yesterday

40
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,438
and that is that we didn't really have a

41
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:51,719
coherent way of checking where these

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,478
things should be placed there was a good

43
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,548
sort of happenstance that I hadn't

44
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,368
thought of when we started but it just

45
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,710
turns out to be very helpful and what

46
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:04,078
that is if you look at these room

47
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:05,609
volumes we had been creating these room

48
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,489
volumes and the reason that we were

49
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,430
creating them was because we have code

50
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,560
we want to execute whenever we're in a

51
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,790
particular room right so for example one

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,098
thing

53
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:18,108
you want to do and the prime motivation

54
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:19,250
for creating it at the moment since

55
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,569
we're not really concentrating on

56
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,150
gameplay we're just concentrate on

57
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:24,530
presentation at the moment what we

58
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,329
wanted to do was be able to program

59
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,829
where the camera was and how the camera

60
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,500
behaved right and so that's why we kind

61
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:32,150
of have like for example you'll notice

62
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,280
that one of the things that we're doing

63
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,340
is when we move from room to room here

64
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,140
if we're in like a tiny room the camera

65
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,870
is programmed to just focus on that room

66
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:43,638
and it stays locked right because that

67
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,829
was just a thing we wanted to do camera

68
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,780
wise there and then if you're out in a

69
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,790
larger room we programmed it so that it

70
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,530
would lock on dimensions of the room

71
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:56,388
that were small enough to be focused so

72
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:58,158
you can see as I move side to side as I

73
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,409
move side to side nothing happens to the

74
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,418
camera but as I move vertically you can

75
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:04,400
see that the camera will follow me right

76
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,319
and so this was just something that we

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
added the room volumes for and we

78
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,858
probably will use those room volumes for

79
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,609
other things in the future as well but

80
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:17,930
that was the main reasoning behind us

81
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:23,329
adding them this time so that is all

82
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:27,109
well and good but what happens here also

83
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:30,049
I'm kind of kind of interested in to

84
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:33,650
know something here why do we not have a

85
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:38,239
room volume for the hallway did you see

86
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,949
that it didn't get paged in we have a

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,750
bug in that page in our overlap

88
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:46,790
detection perhaps do you see that that

89
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,930
was a bug we didn't have before so

90
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:51,560
that's something we should probably look

91
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:53,000
at sorry to randomly switch topics on

92
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,400
you there but just wanted to point that

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,878
out so that's the bug we should look at

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,169
because right see that and it does get

95
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,120
paged in eventually but it looks like

96
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:05,479
it's not the overlap test is not

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,799
actually working properly on that or

98
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,459
something right something weird is

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,699
happening there anyway back to our story

100
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,900
so what the point is here is we've got

101
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,189
these room volumes that we're going to

102
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,019
be using for other stuff and that we're

103
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:20,988
already using for camera control so we

104
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,879
needed to have them and the really nice

105
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:24,560
part about them that I hadn't thought on

106
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,060
before but that actually turns out to be

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,879
pretty useful is that when

108
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,800
we go to fill in the exterior part of

109
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,959
the world with the apron like I was

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,000
saying where we just kind of fill in the

111
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:41,159
area outside of any actual playable area

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,689
just so that it doesn't look blank and

113
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,980
we know we can put trees in here and

114
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,180
whatever else we want to do to make it

115
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,800
look you know like it's actually

116
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,590
something real these regions allow us to

117
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,079
know where we shouldn't fill so rather

118
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:57,569
than having to actually manually test

119
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:01,978
for example whether or not there's like

120
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:05,430
an actual entity in each slot just the

121
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:08,719
room itself is enough to tell this

122
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,189
system not to put anything there right

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,710
so that's pretty great

124
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:15,600
that helps us immensely in in

125
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:18,930
simplifying how we're actually placing

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,570
things out into the world there so I

127
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,220
think what we want to do is embrace that

128
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,870
and have that work but it's not 100%

129
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,260
trivial and the reason why is because

130
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,360
when you get to places like here where

131
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,519
rooms are stacked on top of each other

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,620
if you're not careful about how you're

133
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:42,269
doing the testing such as in this case

134
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,459
right you can see that these were just a

135
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:47,038
little bit low and so when they come

136
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:50,399
through here they say oh don't put

137
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,918
anything there because this room would

138
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,989
actually be occupying that area that

139
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,240
they would be in so they're they're

140
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,870
disallowed right we you know don't put

141
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,780
them in there

142
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,600
it's what's what's happening and so that

143
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,689
is the problem that we actually ended on

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,760
and I think that the answer you know the

145
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,759
solution to our problem here is actually

146
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,620
something that we want to kind of

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,500
embrace to simplify our code anyway

148
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,470
because I started at the end of the

149
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,668
stream simplifying our code that we were

150
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,450
using for figuring out where to place

151
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:22,799
things in the first place

152
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,370
and what I was thinking we really

153
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,740
probably want is a helper function or a

154
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,829
helper struct and let me show you what I

155
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,340
mean by that so if I open up handmade

156
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:37,859
here oh and I go to the sort of the room

157
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,119
generation code which is the code that

158
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,840
we're actually where we're actually

159
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,480
talking about

160
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:47,829
how were sort of stamping things down

161
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:50,170
into our world right this the room sort

162
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:52,569
of the the world generation code

163
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,030
operates sort of semantically to like

164
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:57,879
place rectangles down and say here's

165
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:59,379
where the rooms are gonna be right but

166
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,459
then we have this other problem where

167
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,149
it's like okay once we know where the

168
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,949
rooms are going to be we have to

169
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:05,769
actually stamp down entities into them

170
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:08,409
right and so that's the first time that

171
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:11,259
we actually do work that's in you know

172
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,680
the kind of work that involves placing

173
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:16,269
things into the world and so at that

174
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,829
point we end up with code that kind of

175
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,069
looks like this you know we're we're

176
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:24,339
iterating over like tiles and that sort

177
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,990
of stuff right and you get all kinds of

178
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,369
code in here we don't we haven't really

179
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,930
thought you too hard about how we want

180
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,399
to do it but then you can sort of see

181
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,170
we've got the generate the apron

182
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,659
generation code over here is doing

183
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,250
something similar right and we end up in

184
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,000
all sorts of weirdnesses where we're

185
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,370
like oh okay so what's the math where we

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,199
want to say like okay place this thing

187
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,509
as a wall it should be this far off the

188
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,829
ground I guess and how big would that be

189
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,569
or what would the collision volume be

190
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,459
for that or you know all sorts of things

191
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,870
like this and that just gets baked into

192
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,000
the code you can see all this sort of

193
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,209
random stuff getting baked into the code

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,120
here and the problem is each piece of

195
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,799
code each each portion of that that we

196
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,980
do is giving us what amounts to a baked

197
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,199
in assumption about how we're placing

198
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,090
things in the world in a way that we

199
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,250
probably don't really want because it

200
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:18,629
leads to brittle like inflexibility and

201
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:21,430
brittleness and in fact you could argue

202
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:24,490
if one wish to make such an argument

203
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,310
that what we're seeing out here in the

204
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,990
world where we go to you know

205
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,449
investigate this part of the world and

206
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,340
find the exact problem that I was just

207
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:38,620
alluding to where you've got rooms that

208
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:41,410
are on the bottom floor right I like

209
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,570
this you could argue that this very

210
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,240
problem right if you look at what's

211
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,960
going on here it's because the two code

212
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,940
paths don't share a uniform idea about

213
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,570
where one room is and where the other

214
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,930
room is

215
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,940
these tiles should not even be legally

216
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:59,439
placeable here because these were

217
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,149
supposed to be tiles consisting of

218
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,470
solely in the upper floor they were only

219
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:07,360
supposed to be filling the upper floor

220
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,100
area they weren't supposed to extend

221
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,470
down into the lower floor at all but

222
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,028
because of just random baked in math

223
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,850
that I was you know cutting and pasting

224
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:17,379
and doing there they do right so you

225
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,990
could argue that this bug right here

226
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:22,659
just in even before we get into it any

227
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:26,379
further than that could just be seen as

228
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:29,259
a problem relating to the fact that we

229
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:35,470
don't have a coherent way of talking

230
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:39,100
about actual you know world tiles in a

231
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:43,509
systemic clear way so that the semantic

232
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,149
statement this needs to be inside this

233
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,430
tile doesn't mean anything because it's

234
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,318
just masked you're not all of the code

235
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:55,059
so what I'd like to do is make that be

236
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:57,370
more codified so what I'm going to do to

237
00:09:55,059 --> 00:10:00,059
try and make that work is I'm gonna go

238
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,470
ahead and introduce something here and

239
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:04,750
I'm gonna call this you know we've got

240
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,300
this this Jen room grid for example and

241
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,769
it's got like a series of tiles and this

242
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,559
sort of stuff on it for example right

243
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,899
and so what I'd like to do is I'd like

244
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:16,419
to sort of introduce an iterator that is

245
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,909
able to move over these things maybe

246
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:26,708
that works with this room grid as it is

247
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:30,969
I'm not sure but basically I want a way

248
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:36,099
to say give me the volume at this tile

249
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:40,569
location and allow me to ask you to give

250
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:44,769
me things that are based on that tile so

251
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:47,948
if I say I want something that occupies

252
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:50,500
the whole X Y of the tile and starts

253
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:54,578
about 10 percent of the way up and goes

254
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,188
for 1 foot or something right I can see

255
00:10:54,578 --> 00:11:00,399
that semantically to you and this system

256
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:03,610
will give me back an accurate rectangle

257
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,500
that represents that right so I that's

258
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,370
what I want to get like I want to get

259
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,169
something that

260
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,600
that rather than me happiness through

261
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:13,659
the math well through the thing it just

262
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,308
bakes all of that into one little helper

263
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:17,919
struct and then I can just call

264
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:20,350
functions that will use the information

265
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,958
in the helper struck to construct new

266
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:27,999
rectangles that are the placements that

267
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:29,698
I want right so that's what we're

268
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:38,409
looking for

269
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:46,240
all right so let's assume that here I

270
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:48,719
don't know we've got something like the

271
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,799
gen rim tile right is this thing up here

272
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,809
so maybe we call this like Gentile

273
00:11:52,799 --> 00:12:01,539
volume it's genteel it's the genteel

274
00:11:55,808 --> 00:12:02,528
volume so if we have a volume maybe what

275
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:05,919
I want to do is say look there's a

276
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:11,919
rectangle three in it that's the actual

277
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:14,979
volume right I probably want something

278
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:18,219
that says what its absolute position was

279
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:23,678
so you know we've got sort of a Gen B 3

280
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:30,428
which is the like tile pose something

281
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:32,980
like that something like that so it's

282
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:35,110
the coordinates of the tile and then

283
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,909
I've got sort of the volume of that tile

284
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:42,278
whatever that would naturally be and I

285
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:45,039
don't know maybe that can actually just

286
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:47,678
be a question that we've asked up here

287
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,259
I'm not sure so I have to think about

288
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:53,289
yeah in terms of the basis of this thing

289
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,909
like where the actual let's let's take a

290
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:56,919
look at how that's actually working in

291
00:12:54,909 --> 00:13:00,480
terms of the basis of what this would

292
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:00,479
actually be to give back three threes

293
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,900
so it's a world position here that the

294
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,909
base pays off of so maybe maybe that

295
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,459
goes in here as well so we basically

296
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:19,490
have like here's where the base position

297
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:23,150
is right here is the tile coordinates

298
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:35,810
that we're talking about and then I

299
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:37,669
think do we ever yeah so we've got a

300
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:38,989
chunk position from tile position here

301
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:43,479
right that would give us this so we

302
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:46,700
could from that always convert back out

303
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,670
so I think maybe that's all we've really

304
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,440
needed to say so we say all right here's

305
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:54,349
the base position here's the tile

306
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,170
coordinate and then from here you can

307
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,120
ask just questions about it all day long

308
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:01,279
we could also if we wanted to have this

309
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,759
utility just have the sim region baked

310
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,069
into it

311
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,939
because the sim region would also be

312
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:09,080
able to tell you that piece of

313
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,270
information I think because you know the

314
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,490
the origin of the sim region is the

315
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:17,838
change base key so that would be

316
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:21,019
sufficient I think for that I'm just not

317
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,170
sure exactly how we want to do that it's

318
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,460
tough to say so anyway yeah if you look

319
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:28,250
at what's happening here right you can

320
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:31,330
see for example we've got this X index Y

321
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,330
index bit here

322
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:51,590
I'm just trying to think through exactly

323
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,590
how this wants to work

324
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:03,888
I'm gonna start by converting this and

325
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:09,919
see what I get in other words I must see

326
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:12,110
what I what actually happens here and I

327
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,828
guess when we look at this you know I

328
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,930
wonder too if we wanted I wonder too if

329
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:21,289
what we actually want to do here is say

330
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:23,088
that there's just ways of getting these

331
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:25,519
off of the gender room grids so

332
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:28,490
basically if you just create a grid to

333
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:33,440
begin with you know what I mean and then

334
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:36,470
you you could ask for these tile volumes

335
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,199
off of the grid then we could put for

336
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,028
example the base position here into this

337
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,309
and then when you get these tile volumes

338
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:45,139
back that might be an easier way to do

339
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:48,469
it too I'm just not sure so I'm gonna

340
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:52,089
write the usage code first and assume

341
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:54,528
that that's what we want before I go

342
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,149
trying to define this because I just I'd

343
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,639
since I did I want to work from this

344
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,620
side of it because I'm not really sure

345
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,509
exactly how I want that to look so I

346
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,578
think the easiest way maybe would be to

347
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,889
take the generate apron call which is

348
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:09,708
less complicated and do that one first

349
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:14,000
and see what it is that we actually want

350
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:16,669
there so let's take a look so I'm gonna

351
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,589
also while we're at it I'm gonna kind of

352
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:20,448
make the stub functions here so I have

353
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:23,420
someplace to cut and paste the code to

354
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:26,328
write and so what you can see here is

355
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:28,578
like this for example where we've got

356
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:30,169
this Jen apron spec apron spec thing

357
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:32,359
here and then we do this this is

358
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:34,250
basically exactly the same as what we're

359
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,199
doing in the code above we get the

360
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,440
dimension of a volume whatever that

361
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:41,419
volume thing is and then we go ahead and

362
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,670
pull out like values about that we're

363
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:46,939
going to use for you know various

364
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:49,039
reasons right so I think what we wanted

365
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,920
to start with here is some way of making

366
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,078
this thing happen automatically so you

367
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,000
know maybe what I want to do is say

368
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,609
something more like all right we've got

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,948
temporary memory that we're gonna start

370
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,490
at the top of this thing and then I want

371
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:09,068
to do like let's begin gridding an area

372
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,910
so I want to say something like you know

373
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:13,578
create grid

374
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:20,029
and I want to tell it that the grid that

375
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:22,730
we're using is like this so basically

376
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:25,928
give me a grid that's going to work in

377
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,960
this you know with respect to this

378
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:34,120
particular volume and then I want it to

379
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,120
make all this stuff for me

380
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:40,519
no I'm saying

381
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,120
so basically when I ask you to create a

382
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,339
grid

383
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,408
I want that to create all of this stuff

384
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:46,788
automatically and maybe the best way to

385
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:54,530
write this would be you know more like

386
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:56,690
this right so create a grid you can use

387
00:17:54,529 --> 00:18:00,859
any we got scratch memory so you can do

388
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,288
whatever you want go nuts and then once

389
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:05,359
we're you know ready to kind of move

390
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:07,908
from there or and you know what we could

391
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:10,038
even do like an edit grid here so maybe

392
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:11,659
this could even get baked into it right

393
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,220
there's not a lot of reason not to

394
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:16,159
because these things are completely

395
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,769
dependent on it so what we could do here

396
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:26,570
is say yeah like do all of this right

397
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:31,548
all of this stuff goes in here this

398
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:33,319
entire thing right so we've got like a

399
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:35,359
begin gray to edit and that thing is

400
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,339
gonna give us you know all the stuff we

401
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,769
need and then we can do a and grid edit

402
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:42,230
and that'll do the cleanup portion of

403
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:45,379
our program right so here we say begin

404
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:49,509
grid edit and off we're gonna go there

405
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,510
maybe we even stick this thing in there

406
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:57,589
because why not uh and then here I think

407
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:00,980
this is something that we probably don't

408
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:02,538
really need to do so because what we're

409
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,860
doing here is just iterating over all

410
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:08,538
the tiles right and so what we might

411
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:11,149
want to do there is just take the

412
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:15,429
simpler route and say maybe we just have

413
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,429
a way of iterating over those things

414
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:29,950
and so maybe we do something more like

415
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:31,600
this you know this thing who knows how

416
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,490
that's gonna work right now but

417
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,490
basically what we're gonna say is look

418
00:19:39,210 --> 00:20:00,548
this thing gives us back something and

419
00:19:43,650 --> 00:20:03,100
we just tell it you know what something

420
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:05,859
like that you know I'm saying so we

421
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:07,719
essentially just ask it like we want to

422
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:11,740
iterate over all the tiles in the system

423
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,210
please so just do that like I don't want

424
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,940
to know how you're gonna do it and I

425
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,490
don't I don't care how you're gonna do

426
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,788
that at all you're just gonna provide us

427
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:25,509
with like this stuff here and then we're

428
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:28,179
gonna ask you questions perhaps about

429
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:29,619
this system right so you know we we're

430
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,120
gonna have like queries and stuff that

431
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:32,439
get the information that we need out of

432
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:36,038
here

433
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,750
and that's you know it's your

434
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,429
responsibility to give us back the stuff

435
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,679
that we expect in terms of like

436
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,419
questions about the tiles we don't care

437
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,370
how you're iterating in them we're

438
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,009
basically saying we don't we don't

439
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:50,529
really care what order you iterate over

440
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:52,000
these tiles at all you know you could

441
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:54,369
randomly iterate over them in any way

442
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,308
you want just donate it right over the

443
00:20:54,369 --> 00:21:02,529
same tile twice right and we're happy so

444
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:05,859
you know and then if we take a look at

445
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:08,379
what's going on here we can sort of say

446
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:09,908
well this whole nonsense is just to

447
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,640
figure out where the tile was in the

448
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:15,640
first place right so there's gonna be

449
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:21,400
something that's like probably you know

450
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:23,440
a rectangle 3 that's like get volume and

451
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,650
so this kind of stuff would give us the

452
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,308
vault the rectangle in simulation space

453
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:33,610
where this tile occupies right so that

454
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:36,490
we can base everything off of that in

455
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:38,139
the future so this would just be

456
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,880
something that takes you know one of

457
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:48,400
these edit tiles and returns the volume

458
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:51,400
that we have so once we get the volume

459
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,500
of this thing and but and maybe we don't

460
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,730
even need to call get volume technically

461
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,440
on it because it may be that they've

462
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,179
already has it but I don't know we'll

463
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,490
leave it as get volume for now but we

464
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:03,540
could just do tile call Youm in fact

465
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,539
maybe I like that better

466
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:18,390
so you know this thing here we can sort

467
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:25,799
of say like hey if overlapping entities

468
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:28,290
exist in this tiles volume then we don't

469
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,480
want to do anything if they don't then

470
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:32,730
we can do whatever we want to do here

471
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,579
right and that means although this

472
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,519
nonsense can just go away because what

473
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,619
we could do is we can issue this query

474
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,359
first and then once we know what we're

475
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:45,719
actually doing then we can compute all

476
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:47,129
this nonsense right you can see what I'm

477
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,710
trying to do here right you see how much

478
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:52,080
simpler this code can be once we get to

479
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:57,289
this point where we just say kind of

480
00:22:52,079 --> 00:23:01,559
begin grid edit you know and grid edit

481
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:06,839
like so and you know if we don't have

482
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:11,339
someone faster in there um if we just do

483
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:13,319
a system like this I think we want to

484
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:16,859
pass the generator to the grid as well

485
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,179
right yeah but I probably want

486
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:20,729
everything passed I don't know if the

487
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,190
gen the gen just trying to have worlds

488
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:25,200
in it I don't know if it does I'm

489
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,930
assuming it doesn't because if it did we

490
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,809
wouldn't have to pass it around but you

491
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:37,950
know don't take my word for that um it

492
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:40,559
does have the world in it oh no yeah it

493
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:45,289
does it's right here so I don't really

494
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,289
know what that's there for

495
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:57,000
does anyone know why I say I don't know

496
00:23:53,398 --> 00:24:00,329
why that's there hmm

497
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,589
well okay so I'm just going to go ahead

498
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:03,750
and put it to do to remove that because

499
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:08,509
I don't think we actually need it for

500
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,509
anything so I'm gonna do to do here

501
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:19,470
because I think that we can nuke that

502
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,210
and if we did it would be good right

503
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,149
because why pass something around but

504
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,590
you don't actually need so let's see

505
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:28,408
here so if we're gonna go ahead and do

506
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:30,089
this nonsense here iterate over the

507
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:33,149
tiles we should then be able to ask hey

508
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:35,939
if you know any of these overlapping

509
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:38,788
entities exist in here we can get the

510
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,019
region out of the not sorry the ghent

511
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:45,329
the grid so we can get the out of our

512
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:48,089
edit grid we can get the the region out

513
00:24:45,329 --> 00:24:50,879
of there we can say whatever we want

514
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:54,089
this collision region to be we should be

515
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,159
able to create that region first of all

516
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:59,398
we would need to know the location of

517
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,659
the center of the thing we need to know

518
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:04,288
like where we're actually placing this

519
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:06,059
thing and so yeah I don't know what we

520
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:09,929
want to do about that positioning but

521
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:16,589
let's say what we wanted to do was place

522
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:20,100
the entity so that its position was just

523
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:22,199
like at the bottom of you know look at

524
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:26,849
the at the center of the bottom of the

525
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:31,649
grid right so maybe we would call this

526
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:35,369
something we would say like get a bottom

527
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:38,189
center P or something like that right

528
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:41,038
and so we would ask that about the tile

529
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:44,700
and it would tell us that like that

530
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,169
bottom center point and then when we

531
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,889
want to set the collision volume it has

532
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:52,649
to be relative to that point and so what

533
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:56,269
we would do I guess is say something

534
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:56,268
like make relative

535
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:25,070
where we can then ask for some volume

536
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:25,069
right and get something like this

537
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:39,100
and then we could just say look how high

538
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,350
do you want this thing to be and you

539
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:44,799
know the wall height here could be

540
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:47,619
something that's somewhat random so we

541
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,589
could just do like the whatever the

542
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:56,559
series is off of the grid we could say

543
00:26:50,589 --> 00:27:00,579
like give us a random value here random

544
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,710
between and you know we want something

545
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:04,779
that's at least point five high but

546
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,309
could be as much as one high you know

547
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:08,700
and I'm just making those numbers up so

548
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:11,609
you know we'd pick them something else

549
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:15,460
all of this stuff would go away entirely

550
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:23,799
right and we would just be left with

551
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:26,079
this bit here and so yeah I think that's

552
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:27,909
all we really needed so we would create

553
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,089
the collision volume we create the the

554
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:35,259
point there this part here where we're

555
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:37,059
adding pieces for the piece type cube we

556
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:39,670
really just want that collision volume

557
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:46,179
and the P the point there right so I

558
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:48,850
think we can just say if we want to take

559
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:52,090
the collision volume and use it as the

560
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:54,309
actual values here that's utility

561
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:57,849
functions we definitely want so we want

562
00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:01,210
to be able to say you know 0.5 times get

563
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:03,039
dim and in the collision volume right

564
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,700
and that's the half dimension to the

565
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:12,839
radius of the thing right and I don't

566
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,840
know if we've got a get radius call yeah

567
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:20,429
and we can also ask for the center and

568
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:27,519
that's just saying hey the thing we want

569
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,990
to draw is just the thing that we're

570
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,339
actually using for the collision volume

571
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,980
because remember we can make those two

572
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:34,230
things different but in this case I

573
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,410
think we just need them to be the same

574
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:40,839
right so I think this is what we want

575
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:44,350
and you can see it took that huge big

576
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:46,419
ugly piece of code and it turned it into

577
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:50,459
something rather pleasant this is pretty

578
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:52,720
easy to work with you know it makes

579
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,850
makes things look pretty easy I could

580
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:04,569
also say like rectangle three ball

581
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:07,049
equals just to make it clear what's

582
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:07,049
going on here

583
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,180
you know there's the height of the thing

584
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:15,250
there's the volume we're just gonna sign

585
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,930
the volume here and then the volume can

586
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,000
get used here as well and that just

587
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,430
makes it a little bit easier on the eyes

588
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,660
for people who've coming to it who don't

589
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:27,820
know we don't know what they're

590
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:29,769
necessarily looking at there you go so

591
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:31,480
we're gonna pick a random height for the

592
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:33,160
thing we're going to get a volume that

593
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,110
space is starting for the minimum Z and

594
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,140
going up that amount of height we

595
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:39,819
obviously need to pass at the tile here

596
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,480
we're gonna add an entity and give it

597
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:48,759
that location and that collision volume

598
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,589
that we just computed we need this to be

599
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:55,210
made relative still though didn't mean

600
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:58,389
to get rid of that and then we're going

601
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:03,850
to use that for the piece as well so

602
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:06,570
that's going to be yeah that's going to

603
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,569
be that

604
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:36,369
although I feel like this still needs to

605
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:37,960
happen first right so basically here's

606
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:40,869
where we're gonna place the thing here's

607
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,329
how high we want it to be the volume has

608
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,518
to be something that's made relative to

609
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:47,980
whatever this location is here that

610
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,950
we're gonna place the entity and then

611
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:53,798
the collision volume is just exactly

612
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:59,919
what we create here and then this here

613
00:30:53,798 --> 00:31:01,929
is you know specified by the relative

614
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:07,690
volume of the local bought space volume

615
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:13,990
and I think then we're good right uh sue

616
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:19,590
I guess I'll start a file I guess in

617
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:21,130
here that's like handmade edit grid

618
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:25,418
something like that

619
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:31,720
and what I want to do here is pull this

620
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:33,460
code out I don't know how much of this

621
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:38,649
we went out they were probably all of it

622
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:45,509
right and I kind of want this stuff all

623
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:45,509
to live in here so that yes

624
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,088
[Music]

625
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,888
so that these are basically just

626
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:04,528
utilities and then all of our gencode

627
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:09,119
just is written in terms of them so

628
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:13,710
these are gonna come out here and these

629
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:15,028
are gonna come out here and now we have

630
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,350
to go through and actually implement

631
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:19,288
this stuff that we said we were going to

632
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:19,678
implement and then I think we're good to

633
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:22,579
go

634
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,929
so you can see we've got a couple of

635
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:28,558
functions that we want to put over in

636
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:35,940
our rectangle stuff and so that we kind

637
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:38,369
of have to put in here I don't see yeah

638
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,038
I don't see any of these existing at the

639
00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:46,979
moment so we're just going to plop those

640
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:51,720
right on down in here and so this is

641
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:57,149
going to be take a rectangle three and a

642
00:32:51,720 --> 00:33:00,120
position and return a rectangle three

643
00:32:57,148 --> 00:33:02,908
that's relative to that position very

644
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:05,638
simple function all it is is it's just

645
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:07,350
going to take the offset function we

646
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:10,168
already have and it's just subtract you

647
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:12,538
know so we're just subtracting P from

648
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,669
all the elements of our right so we're

649
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:18,359
just making it so that p is now the

650
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:24,149
origin around which our is expressed we

651
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:26,398
then want to come in here and oh well

652
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:27,599
that's actually part of the that's

653
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,579
actually not part of the rectangle

654
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,048
although I do kind of want a rectangular

655
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:33,210
version of it so I think I will stop

656
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:40,048
probably stop opening here so if I do a

657
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:42,269
rectangle 3 here for a rectangle what I

658
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:49,048
want to do is say the result of that is

659
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:53,038
going to be get Center R and then I want

660
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:59,000
the result Z to be the get Minzy of our

661
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:59,000
right so it could be that I think it's

662
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:14,750
right yeah get min corner so those are

663
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:16,369
the functions that produce that you know

664
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,719
very very simple utility functions but I

665
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:20,719
just want to be semantics so it was

666
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,609
clear what was happening right I and so

667
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,969
now we just need the parts that are

668
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,780
actually Grid specific and then I think

669
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,789
we're good to go

670
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:36,310
so in order to get to parts that a grid

671
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:38,539
specific we know we've got these and

672
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:40,969
again I'm just using snuffleupagus

673
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:43,759
oriented programming here right I'm just

674
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:45,529
saying what do I wish that I had write

675
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,399
it in terms of what I wish I had and

676
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:51,440
then implement that because it's hey

677
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:53,839
it's what I wanted right I know it's

678
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,639
what I wanted because you know I just

679
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,870
pretended I had snuffleupagus and and

680
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:05,920
then and then made us novel of I guess I

681
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:13,269
so assuming that we implement this and

682
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:23,980
these we would only be left without this

683
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:23,980
and this right so here we would have

684
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:38,619
the function prototypes for what we're

685
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,900
trying to do and so now it's just up to

686
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:43,630
me to fill them in which is a lot easier

687
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,280
than actually having to design anything

688
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:47,950
right I don't have to think about

689
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,849
anything now I literally just have to do

690
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:51,219
what I'm told

691
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,930
which is the easiest possible place to

692
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:56,879
be for a programmer because there's no

693
00:35:52,929 --> 00:36:00,338
more decisions left to make right okay

694
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,160
so if we take a look now at how we've

695
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:04,630
written this and we want to know for

696
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:07,210
example what's gonna happen in each of

697
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,190
these functions if we're going to talk

698
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,740
about begin create edit then what we're

699
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:13,750
looking at here is we have to take the

700
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:16,328
world generator certainly and then we

701
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:20,099
have to take the rectangle 3 I'm sorry

702
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:23,109
not the original page the jhen rectangle

703
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:27,940
what's it called what's what's a cogent

704
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:31,989
volume and the volume that we expect to

705
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:35,679
use to create that you know that grid

706
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:40,259
the grid in question so we know that our

707
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:43,449
grid here is going to have to store this

708
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,369
right because it's going to have to

709
00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:46,719
release the memory when it's done all

710
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,190
the memory that's using the temporary

711
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,469
memory that's using for all the world

712
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:52,358
changes is going to have to get released

713
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:54,399
back to the system so you know that's

714
00:36:52,358 --> 00:37:02,920
one really simple thing we know that we

715
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:06,039
need right I always I need a big water

716
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,050
bottle I got to get one of those all

717
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,759
right so when we do there begin create

718
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,289
at it here's our begin temporary memory

719
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,290
we know that we have to release it later

720
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:15,759
so here it is we then know that we want

721
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:17,588
to get the dimensions of this thing

722
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,890
obviously we're gonna want to store

723
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:24,639
those right and we're also going to want

724
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:26,618
to take a page from our room gen

725
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:31,179
playbook where we ported this guy up

726
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:33,608
here to using like tile count Minzy and

727
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:36,399
tile doing that stuff I think we want

728
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:40,150
that stuff here so we're basically gonna

729
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,869
say look here's the tile count here's

730
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,869
the min tile

731
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:51,880
here's the tile dim and let's do

732
00:37:48,909 --> 00:38:00,879
everything off of those right so here's

733
00:37:51,880 --> 00:38:02,588
us doing that the new way we're gonna

734
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,480
want to record those two things in the

735
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:09,420
grid we know that we wanted to record

736
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,420
the tempura Murray in the grid like that

737
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:18,068
and then here we also want that mean

738
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:25,619
tile the tile dim is off of the

739
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:28,420
generator so now we've got that and uh

740
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:30,579
yeah I don't know that we need anything

741
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,338
else here right so all the rest of this

742
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:34,839
stuff we can defer to later because we

743
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:37,750
got all of the information that we

744
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:41,019
actually wanted now we want to record

745
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:52,088
which random series to pull from and so

746
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:55,000
that's going to come in here so we've

747
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:56,139
got that general game entropy that's the

748
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,469
thing that we're using for our

749
00:38:56,139 --> 00:39:01,150
generation and when we do n grid edit

750
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:04,269
obviously we're gonna need to save this

751
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,710
region so when we actually do record our

752
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:08,440
begin world change here we're gonna want

753
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:11,650
to do that so I think all the rest of

754
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:15,690
this stuff just goes away so we're

755
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,900
looking at mostly this at first right

756
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,490
okay

757
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:24,910
that's sort of what our attic rid looks

758
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:27,009
like now once we have our Edit grid in

759
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:28,838
place to do this part I want to look

760
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:30,880
again back at generate room to figure

761
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:34,599
out how I want that to happen I believe

762
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,298
because we kind of made a cleaner

763
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:40,960
version of that I believe that we would

764
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:43,449
rather use so if I look here at what we

765
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,389
were computing we've got these like room

766
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:48,159
dimensions and the main room P and the

767
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:50,500
maximum P and stuff that's another

768
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,348
rectangle 3 so why we didn't actually

769
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,849
compute it as a rectangle 3 I don't know

770
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:58,130
we should have

771
00:39:55,849 --> 00:40:00,650
we just didn't so I think we actually

772
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:06,230
want another one here which is basically

773
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:10,490
like like this where we're saying okay

774
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:14,568
here's the entire dimension of this is

775
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:19,909
the entire dimension of the room and so

776
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:22,308
if I was going to create that I can

777
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:24,889
still do it this way temporarily so if I

778
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:33,589
pull this stuff out and say well the

779
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:41,629
room dam is like this stuff right and

780
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:43,639
the min room P and the max room peered

781
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:48,800
Jerian that way then I can just do a

782
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:53,328
rectangle min max or there we go

783
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,990
mini room P max room key and now I just

784
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:58,970
have the room dimensions as I want them

785
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:03,858
and I can ask for the room do more I can

786
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:08,118
ask for whatever I want right so that

787
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:12,108
seems good taking a look at this what I

788
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,670
want to do now is use this piece here to

789
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:20,150
talk about how we get all the rest of

790
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:24,170
our stuff excuse me uh so now if we look

791
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:26,180
at the general grid I think that that we

792
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,909
can probably again just supplant this

793
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:30,469
now and use the edit grid for everything

794
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:32,088
which will have all of this stuff kind

795
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:35,480
of bundled up but we'll see you know

796
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:37,039
we'll take it slow we'll see if there's

797
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,780
anything else we need to do there

798
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:45,829
specifically we'll see all right so the

799
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:50,559
change rect can be actually computed

800
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:55,430
directly now from the room dimension and

801
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:56,420
the tile and we know really know what we

802
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,279
want to do there but we're just gonna

803
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,639
say it's one wider right that's what

804
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,700
we're saying arbitrarily so that's fine

805
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:06,529
and then here we're gonna leave this

806
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:08,239
sort of not specifically talked about

807
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,710
quite yet

808
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:13,639
we're gonna talk about that a little bit

809
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:15,860
further down and then we don't need this

810
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:17,449
anymore because this stuff is already

811
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:22,070
now getting taken care of separately so

812
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:24,379
the region which is actually this eye

813
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,120
that needs the temp memory but we've

814
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,030
already got it right we can push this

815
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:37,719
all in the same place we know the worlds

816
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:37,720
it's that the changebase p wu is this

817
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:44,869
and i feel like we probably want that to

818
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,730
be stored I'm guessing we do I don't

819
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:57,440
actually know but it seems like that was

820
00:42:46,730 --> 00:43:02,389
something we would want to store so out

821
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,250
that comes and the change rect I don't

822
00:43:02,389 --> 00:43:08,239
actually know if we want to store that

823
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,889
anywhere we may not want to and so I

824
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:10,839
feel like we're probably gonna want

825
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:14,389
something that looks more like this

826
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:17,750
don't quote me on that but that's

827
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:21,469
probably what we're gonna do so if we do

828
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:23,119
this and then we just look at the only

829
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:26,299
thing remaining it's really the general

830
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,609
grid here and what we can do is we can

831
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,289
either continue to have a genuine grid

832
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:34,640
but I don't think that's really any

833
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:38,029
reason for that sorry I suspect is we

834
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:39,739
can just make this tiles be part of our

835
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:44,510
edit grid and get rid of Jen room grid

836
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:50,929
right and so then we can have our edit

837
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:53,300
tiles be things that are looped over and

838
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:55,819
accessed you know however we want to and

839
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:58,220
the storage for them we'll just be

840
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:02,450
stored inside the Edit grid directly

841
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:04,099
right I think again don't quote me on

842
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:07,579
that that's just what I think we're

843
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:12,440
probably gonna want to do so let's

844
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:16,190
suppose we do that and we say ok this

845
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:19,400
gen v3 here which is dim is actually

846
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:21,950
just a tile count right and so what we

847
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,680
want is to open

848
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:27,799
this is the only part we actually need

849
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,358
right that's the tile storage there so

850
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,570
we want to be able to do this exact same

851
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:35,328
thing we were doing before in here we

852
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:37,338
just want to use the grid temp mem there

853
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:39,800
well I guess this is always gen temp

854
00:44:37,338 --> 00:44:41,328
memory now that I think about it but you

855
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,990
know honestly I feel like that should be

856
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:46,310
in here so I feel like it should be like

857
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:48,348
that or something you know what I'm

858
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,940
saying to you so we would we would do

859
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:54,380
something where we would actually record

860
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,909
that kind of out well I don't know I

861
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,680
don't really know I'm gonna say here's

862
00:44:55,909 --> 00:45:01,338
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna say this I'm

863
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:04,639
gonna say look just call it memory for

864
00:45:01,338 --> 00:45:15,588
now so yeah so on here we're gonna start

865
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:20,269
off by saying let's let's just set

866
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:22,039
ourselves up here I guess I don't need

867
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:24,050
to record the memory for any particular

868
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:27,199
reason yet so I won't bother but we

869
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:34,250
might later so we're gonna create one of

870
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:35,509
these grids and then we're gonna do all

871
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,269
this work and then we're going to return

872
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,740
the grid when it's ready for action and

873
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:42,619
I think that's everything that we

874
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:46,429
actually needed to do we don't need to

875
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:47,930
do lips to do that so we don't actually

876
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:50,568
need this because we've already got the

877
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:53,078
tile count so that should be sufficient

878
00:45:50,568 --> 00:45:58,550
there as well

879
00:45:53,079 --> 00:46:00,880
like so and that's it right that's

880
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,880
everything

881
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,540
yeah so that'll looks good to me that's

882
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:10,769
a complete setup of the grid when we're

883
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:12,090
done with the grid we don't have to do

884
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,349
anything because everything just goes

885
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,690
into memory Rina so we just say hey get

886
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:17,250
rid of it all we don't need it anymore

887
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:19,108
and we're done with our simulation

888
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,969
system that like expanded all the

889
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:24,269
entities out and like looked at what

890
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:25,589
they were in the region in question so

891
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:28,050
we can throw that out as well so we just

892
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,579
throw out everything basically and it

893
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:32,460
just writes the changes back to the to

894
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,949
the stationery world so I think that's

895
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,050
everything we need there and so that

896
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:39,539
tells us what our edit grid struct looks

897
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:41,640
like and then we're pretty much down to

898
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:43,980
just an oh and by the way this can go

899
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:47,219
away completely so then we're just down

900
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:49,289
to the Edit tile and if you look at what

901
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:51,358
has to happen here we need to be able to

902
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:53,550
produce information about these tiles

903
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,529
specifically the most important piece of

904
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:59,160
information is what the actual volume of

905
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:01,140
the tile is but we also need to be able

906
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:02,969
to iterate the tile so we need some way

907
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:06,569
of recording like this sort of thing

908
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:08,489
right and since we don't actually know

909
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:11,990
what we want to do with Heights

910
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:15,500
here I want to change this a little bit

911
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:19,949
I want to call this iterate tile plane

912
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:24,510
and I want to call this like you know

913
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:28,549
relative Z or something right so

914
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:34,710
basically if you know that you're just

915
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:38,269
doing a planar tile or in fact I might

916
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:43,190
even go one further and say iterate as

917
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:49,800
planar tiles and that just says look I

918
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:54,240
don't actually care how many floors hi

919
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:58,710
this thing is I'm just going to treat it

920
00:47:54,239 --> 00:48:01,169
as if it was one floor because that's

921
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:04,740
actually what we want to do for a fair

922
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:06,539
number of rooms probably like so I'm

923
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:08,969
guessing that we just want that as a

924
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:12,108
default you can use and then when you

925
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:13,889
when once we actually have a

926
00:48:12,108 --> 00:48:17,319
circumstance where we want to like

927
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:18,789
generate an actual tower or something

928
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,160
and you know I'll be honest I don't know

929
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:22,750
that we ever do because even at our we

930
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:25,089
might just want each one of those to be

931
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,670
a room so I'm just gonna call it iterate

932
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:30,490
as planar tiles at the moment and assume

933
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:34,059
that we don't really want to really ever

934
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:36,039
talk about multi floor rooms as actual

935
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:37,989
single iterations because we probably

936
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:41,110
want to place them separately I'm just

937
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:43,029
guessing as separate rooms right that

938
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:46,210
just happened to connect or have empty

939
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:48,100
spaces right so I don't know but we're

940
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:50,440
gonna call that this for now just to

941
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,599
make it clear that anyone who is calling

942
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:55,900
it at the moment is not intending for

943
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,869
you to iterate the z-axis of the volume

944
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,849
should it contain more than one floor we

945
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:04,690
want to treat it all as one floor anyway

946
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:07,299
and that's all I mean by that right okay

947
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,429
and so for now we don't really have to

948
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,500
worry about that stuff but later on I

949
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:14,049
just wanted the naming to be clear so

950
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,849
that later on when we do potentially

951
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:20,590
have to upgrade that in some way it

952
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:23,699
won't be like what's going on right okay

953
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:26,740
so the Edit tile needs like a gen B free

954
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:29,379
v3 which is like the relative index of

955
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:31,929
this thing off of the edit grid right

956
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,599
and so these are like exactly what's

957
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:37,179
happening here and so what we want to do

958
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:40,630
is in order to determine whether or not

959
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:42,519
this thing is valid there's a couple of

960
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:46,950
different ways we could do that but I

961
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,949
think probably the most straightforward

962
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:54,789
is to just check if it's inside right I

963
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:59,680
think we've already got that that's not

964
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:02,230
what I wanted to look at so I believe in

965
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:05,169
here we can just say like is in volume

966
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:08,110
right and is in volume should tell us

967
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:11,380
that that piece of information so I'm

968
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:15,220
just going to take a copy of this saucy

969
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:17,680
gentleman right here and say look we

970
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:24,759
should also be able to call this like

971
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:28,359
this right and go okay tell me is in

972
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,940
volume for the components of P so I

973
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:34,059
don't have to manually pass them myself

974
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:37,119
right so I think all we would have to do

975
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:47,019
for is valid on an edit aisle is to just

976
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:53,200
say alright if it's in the volume as

977
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:58,179
given by the edit grid then I think

978
00:50:53,199 --> 00:51:00,429
we're we're good right although actually

979
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:04,719
you know we never create a volume

980
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:08,799
because it's based off of 0 so not sure

981
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:21,750
how I want to phrase that like you want

982
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:21,750
to do it this way something like that

983
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,739
and I think I'd also like to pass this

984
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:31,088
here since it's pretty free to do so and

985
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:35,858
it prevents me from having to store it

986
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:37,750
in the tile iterator itself so yeah what

987
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:39,969
I want to do is say like alright if it's

988
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,139
in the array bounds although you know

989
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:43,449
what now I think about it what's one

990
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,279
more pointer who cares this is the great

991
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:49,169
time code I don't care at all so maybe

992
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,170
the right answer is now it goes in there

993
00:51:49,619 --> 00:52:02,050
so we could just say look if it's inside

994
00:51:52,539 --> 00:52:06,039
here then it's then it's good otherwise

995
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:08,490
it's not and then that would just be

996
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,489
this

997
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:23,579
so for this volume here where we do

998
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:56,250
these results we would just say that

999
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:57,930
this is 0 and this is bounds ok so this

1000
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,579
way we just check to see ok it should be

1001
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:04,879
greater than 0 it should be less than

1002
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:04,880
whatever the bounds are no

1003
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,599
and that's all we need to do to check so

1004
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,880
assuming that we're inside those bounds

1005
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,640
off we go now one thing I don't know is

1006
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,160
that tile count I'm a little confused

1007
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,288
now because when we do the tile count

1008
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:26,818
are we actually adding the 1 yes we are

1009
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:29,839
so that's what's happening there that's

1010
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:31,980
like where's the one coming from we are

1011
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,409
so I think we should just be able to use

1012
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,318
that and be fine with it so in here we

1013
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:38,548
say like okay let's do and let's do a

1014
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:41,068
check that's the only check that we

1015
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:43,079
would actually need and so now we can

1016
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:46,349
get rid of this stuff as stuff that

1017
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,910
needs to happen and mostly just look at

1018
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:49,798
that code right there and also we can

1019
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:52,949
look at the code and the other one stuff

1020
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:55,259
that we want to do all right so in here

1021
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:56,909
yeah when we're iterating we just say is

1022
00:53:55,259 --> 00:53:58,588
it in the array bounds for this thing if

1023
00:53:56,909 --> 00:54:01,078
it is then it's valid otherwise that

1024
00:53:58,588 --> 00:54:04,318
it's not um when we want to advance

1025
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:06,450
things get a little bit hairier but it's

1026
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,068
not too bad still what we would say and

1027
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:10,018
in fact I may actually get in the habit

1028
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:16,108
of doing this as well so I don't have to

1029
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:18,298
keep saying that right so what I want to

1030
00:54:16,108 --> 00:54:20,489
do now is take that relative index and I

1031
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:23,130
want to advance it as if I was doing

1032
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:26,129
four loops on it right so what I want to

1033
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:29,130
do is say look the tile relative index X

1034
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:32,009
I want to increment that every time we

1035
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:36,298
advance but in the event that the tile

1036
00:54:32,009 --> 00:54:41,389
relative X X now at that point is out of

1037
00:54:36,298 --> 00:54:44,338
bounds so like if that if that

1038
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:46,920
advancement would cause it to be greater

1039
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:50,099
than or equal to whatever the tile count

1040
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,559
X is like meaning I overflowed it then I

1041
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:54,150
want to change the tile relative index X

1042
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,119
back to zero and in what I actually

1043
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,750
wanted to do was increment the Y you

1044
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,568
know I'm saying

1045
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,608
now maybe the Y pushes us out of bounds

1046
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:04,318
but that's what is valid is four it

1047
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:06,358
would trigger that and we would exit the

1048
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,838
loop so we're basically just turning to

1049
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:12,380
four loops into one call that does what

1050
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,670
the to four loops would have done right

1051
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,250
and it's a little less efficient because

1052
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:20,789
obviously it has to check every time it

1053
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:23,000
increments X it has to check X in a way

1054
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:26,130
that

1055
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,559
in a way that maybe isn't as clean as

1056
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:30,260
having the loops themselves isolated but

1057
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,389
it's really the same number of

1058
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:35,640
conditionals in a way right at the end

1059
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:36,929
of every X you're gonna do this check to

1060
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:39,118
see and you would have had to do that in

1061
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:40,349
the for loop so it's a little harder

1062
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,910
maybe for the compiler to see what's

1063
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:44,099
going on but otherwise it should be

1064
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:45,420
roughly equivalent most of the time I

1065
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:49,108
think I have to think that through

1066
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,670
but anyway again in the creation code we

1067
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:52,349
really don't care it's totally fine this

1068
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:55,800
is this is this is all child's play

1069
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:59,130
right so at that point we just need a

1070
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:03,539
way of it like starting this up right we

1071
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:06,090
have to start you know the iteration

1072
00:56:03,539 --> 00:56:07,380
somehow and really since the relative

1073
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:10,920
index always wants to start at 0 0

1074
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,420
anyway because why not you know since

1075
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,608
that just gives us some nice linear walk

1076
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,869
with tiles anyway the only thing we

1077
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:17,190
really have to do is just set the grid

1078
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:18,780
equal to the one that we come in we're

1079
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,970
just remembering that function but other

1080
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:23,160
than that just initializing the 0

1081
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:25,949
actually works which is great

1082
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:27,960
so that means I think we're down to just

1083
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:31,230
ways of getting like the center and the

1084
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,970
volume and stuff like that right and so

1085
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:35,039
what I'd like to do here is just have

1086
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:37,799
some way of computing this this

1087
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:38,940
information and like stuff like get

1088
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:44,019
volume and all that kind of nonsense

1089
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:47,809
right so in order to do that

1090
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:47,809
[Music]

1091
00:56:50,360 --> 00:57:01,820
I guess what I might say is maybe we

1092
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:07,579
should just make this volume just be

1093
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:09,830
directly computable so like what if we

1094
00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:15,440
just said yeah look that's all always

1095
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:18,949
there just for convenience and so then

1096
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,829
we could just say look when you're

1097
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:27,379
actually doing the general stuff what we

1098
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:28,969
were doing sorry room Jen all we were

1099
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:32,750
actually doing here to figure out where

1100
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:37,939
this crap was you know was we were doing

1101
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:40,099
like this kind of nonsense right and you

1102
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:41,570
can see here like here's how we figured

1103
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:45,529
out what the position of the thing was

1104
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:48,289
right and so I feel like what we could

1105
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:52,990
do is just create the volume here you

1106
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:52,989
know directly and

1107
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:06,039
how did we end up I can't remember what

1108
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:10,929
our decision was on the half tile Dib so

1109
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:13,929
we offset the room position and we don't

1110
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:22,929
offset the entity positions looks like

1111
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:24,730
how we decided to do that because I was

1112
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:29,199
vacillating on that and I'm not sure

1113
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:36,090
still I really know what I want to do

1114
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:36,089
about that right

1115
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:52,679
and if I had I think what I want to do

1116
00:58:47,670 --> 00:59:00,059
is not this so I think I don't want to

1117
00:58:52,679 --> 00:59:02,219
do this right I think we can do this in

1118
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:04,289
a more straightforward fashion so let's

1119
00:59:02,219 --> 00:59:08,608
suppose that up here instead of doing

1120
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:12,359
this we just don't do that at all so the

1121
00:59:08,608 --> 00:59:15,568
main room key is always nothing right

1122
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:17,940
and the max room P is always the room

1123
00:59:15,568 --> 00:59:19,829
dim so zero zero zero is always the

1124
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:23,639
origin and that's the minimum and that's

1125
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:28,650
just how we roll right if that was the

1126
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:30,629
case then every time we get a volume out

1127
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:33,088
of this thing and I think that means I

1128
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:36,690
don't want this because this is just

1129
00:59:33,088 --> 00:59:38,880
going to be very easy so every time we

1130
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:54,079
get a volume out of this it's gonna look

1131
00:59:38,880 --> 01:00:00,660
something like this the min and the max

1132
00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:05,690
are literally just taking the exact tile

1133
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:08,068
dim they grab this out again right and

1134
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:12,000
multiplying out the coordinates by the

1135
01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:12,829
tile dim right so the min P is just the

1136
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,119
tile

1137
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:22,619
Rayland X X tile Rayland X Y tile

1138
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:24,809
Rayland X Z right we're just gonna take

1139
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,740
that and we're just multiplying it by

1140
01:00:24,809 --> 01:00:27,740
the tile dim

1141
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:41,529
and similarly look max P is just min P

1142
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:43,389
plus one in each direction right so in

1143
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,820
order to actually get what these in

1144
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:52,619
depth being in the end it's just min P

1145
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:52,620
equals Hadamard right times a tile dam

1146
01:00:55,019 --> 01:01:00,940
and I think that just creates the volume

1147
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:03,879
right which is just much more

1148
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:09,880
straightforward of a way to do it than

1149
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:10,480
what we were doing before do you see how

1150
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,490
that works

1151
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,710
asked me after if you don't understand

1152
01:01:12,489 --> 01:01:17,709
but I'm just saying look we're on a grid

1153
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:19,780
just take this grid point and take what

1154
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:21,990
it would be to go positive 1 in each

1155
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:24,790
axis on the grid and that's the volume

1156
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:27,459
why am i screwing around right

1157
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:29,289
just do that then it doesn't matter

1158
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,579
whatever you make the grid you can do

1159
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:32,710
whatever you want the it'll always

1160
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:36,190
produce the correct volume as long as

1161
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:37,869
that is the grid right and so I think

1162
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:40,420
that's all we actually need there and

1163
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:46,839
then we can just say that the rectum in

1164
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:48,670
max of this is the total volume and so

1165
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,620
therefore if we ever want to do a get

1166
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:53,019
volume form in Z or something like this

1167
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:54,579
all we have to do is say that the result

1168
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:58,329
of that is to get the total volume

1169
01:01:54,579 --> 01:02:01,840
whatever the total volume is of the tile

1170
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:05,500
and then just change the height so the

1171
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:09,000
results max Z equals the result min Z

1172
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:12,780
plus the height that's I mean that's

1173
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,780
kinda self-explanatory right

1174
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:24,869
yeah so I think that's pretty much all

1175
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:27,750
there is to it similarly this code now

1176
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:43,219
is just literally calling the code like

1177
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:43,219
you know I mean what could be easier

1178
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:52,440
right I mean it's really really basic

1179
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:54,510
now which is nice okay so now what we

1180
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,280
got to do is actually include these

1181
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,780
files remember we haven't actually

1182
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,780
included them in the build so they're

1183
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,460
not doing anything right now they're

1184
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:05,790
just sitting off to the sidelines

1185
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:07,559
collecting dust as slightly differently

1186
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:08,279
magnetized pieces of our hard drives

1187
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:11,250
platter

1188
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,850
well this is an SSD so actually it's not

1189
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,480
that at all

1190
01:03:11,849 --> 01:03:19,230
anyway so I need to include this h-file

1191
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:22,469
I need to include the CPP file and I'm

1192
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:24,240
going to need to go in and port the old

1193
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:26,639
code now over to the new way of doing

1194
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:28,469
things and then I think we're in a

1195
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:30,059
better spot you know we've got

1196
01:03:28,469 --> 01:03:32,639
everything kind of cleaned up at that

1197
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:36,630
point all right so where is this room

1198
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:39,960
stuff happening room gen whatever blah

1199
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:41,590
blah blah so this is after the gen map

1200
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:47,380
maybe handmade

1201
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:50,320
a edit grid that's the key and we've

1202
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:53,170
also got handmade edit grid H in here

1203
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:58,120
should be I guess here maybe let's see I

1204
01:03:53,170 --> 01:04:02,349
don't know if that's true okay

1205
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:04,509
so I yeah this stuff that used to work

1206
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:06,250
on a genuine grid now just works to work

1207
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:08,350
on an edit grid but other than that I

1208
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:10,090
think it's basically the same we just

1209
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:13,179
changed the name of a couple of things

1210
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:14,920
so this dim here is actually tile counts

1211
01:04:13,179 --> 01:04:17,109
but other than that I think it's

1212
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,010
basically the exact same code so we

1213
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:22,120
don't really have to do anything

1214
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:24,880
differently there I don't think this

1215
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:27,279
would also be the same

1216
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,840
[Music]

1217
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,840
let's see what else you got

1218
01:04:44,380 --> 01:05:04,070
top count tile count and tile count okay

1219
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:24,039
um this is just memory this is off of

1220
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:24,039
the grid now this that and this that

1221
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:40,130
right right and my hammer about that I

1222
01:05:36,829 --> 01:05:43,969
think I'm right about that all right

1223
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:47,539
um this Jen room grid is an edit grid

1224
01:05:43,969 --> 01:05:52,009
don't ask me why I didn't change that

1225
01:05:47,539 --> 01:05:56,509
but I didn't shut person from tile

1226
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:59,720
position what is the problem here a grid

1227
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:02,300
based P grid min tile that's that should

1228
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:05,199
be correction it is there something what

1229
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,200
am I missing about that

1230
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:13,830
Oh identifier not found okay so we need

1231
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,840
that to be part of the grid stuff that

1232
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:18,989
that actually makes totally reasonable

1233
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:21,750
sense actually so we need chunk position

1234
01:06:18,989 --> 01:06:25,339
from tile position which is this thing

1235
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:28,050
here that actually needs to kind of be

1236
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:29,760
moved out into the edit grid itself

1237
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:32,039
because that's sort of a more primal

1238
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,730
function right so that's something that

1239
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:37,230
has to be available here which is

1240
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:42,659
earlier than it was being available

1241
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:45,599
before so I think now we are down to oh

1242
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:51,179
and this guy needs in the region in the

1243
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:54,618
region I think now we're down to porting

1244
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:58,618
the old code to work with the new code

1245
01:06:54,619 --> 01:07:00,750
let's see the grid needs to be pulled

1246
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:05,519
out here but otherwise I think we're

1247
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:07,500
good and let's see yeah so this is our

1248
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:09,500
kind of old code what I should probably

1249
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:11,909
do first and it will be slightly wrong

1250
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:15,719
but what I should probably do first is

1251
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:17,670
make sure that this stuff runs sort of

1252
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:19,529
exactly the same as it was running

1253
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:20,760
before well I guess I don't really want

1254
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,869
to do that to be honest so I think I'm

1255
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,570
just going to port it I'm just gonna go

1256
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:25,950
straight straight into the port you know

1257
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:27,269
go big or go home that's what we say

1258
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:28,739
here on handmade here we don't

1259
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:30,659
necessarily say that but we have said it

1260
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:33,599
I think someone said it was probably

1261
01:07:30,659 --> 01:07:35,579
that someone was me but who knows so

1262
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,750
anyway when we do a begin grid edit we

1263
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:38,099
don't need to pass the world I think we

1264
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,449
decided that we do need to pass the

1265
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:41,279
apron volume though so that's going to

1266
01:07:39,449 --> 01:07:43,019
remain what we're lapping entities exist

1267
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,460
this tile volume this needs to be get

1268
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:50,429
total volume right enough that goes this

1269
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:53,070
stuff all seems to be right as far as I

1270
01:07:50,429 --> 01:07:55,259
know that should all be fine I'm not

1271
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:56,609
sure what this is complaining about here

1272
01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:00,000
let's take a look at the error actually

1273
01:07:56,608 --> 01:08:05,909
just so we can get some idea of what it

1274
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,500
actually is saying it's wrong there why

1275
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:08,190
am I not able to step through these I

1276
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,710
have no idea

1277
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:13,500
let's see function does not take one

1278
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:15,119
argument overlapping is this so it's get

1279
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:18,359
total volume ease and address uh that's

1280
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:20,670
that's true and make relative doesn't

1281
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:21,509
take one argument either what are you

1282
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:24,630
talking about

1283
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:29,909
get volume from Minzy is that not get

1284
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:33,509
flying from NZ that takes in an edit

1285
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:37,829
tile which I'm passing and a height

1286
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:41,399
which I'm passing as well what is the

1287
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:43,909
issue there that's what it's supposed to

1288
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:47,939
do right I mean that that seems correct

1289
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:48,838
what's what's wrong with that you want

1290
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:58,048
to know what's wrong with that

1291
01:08:48,838 --> 01:09:00,509
oh well yeah you're correct

1292
01:08:58,048 --> 01:09:03,720
there is no entity yet so I think that's

1293
01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:06,060
all correct so now we just got this port

1294
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,880
to deal with now all of this stuff we

1295
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:11,670
basically replaced so in theory we can

1296
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,670
just basically delete like most of the

1297
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:17,819
code from this routine and replace it

1298
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:23,369
with this so right at the start here

1299
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:26,548
where we're doing room Vall that in

1300
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:28,649
theory like all of this goes away none

1301
01:09:26,548 --> 01:09:31,170
of this is necessary that's all gone

1302
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:35,579
this is gone that's gone and we're down

1303
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:37,380
to just this right so inside here is the

1304
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:43,670
stuff that we have to port the rest of

1305
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:46,890
it goes away when we get down to here

1306
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:48,659
right that's the four legs you can see

1307
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,400
the marker on the side there it's the

1308
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:54,750
for tile yeah so that's what we wanted

1309
01:09:50,399 --> 01:10:02,269
that's all fine and then this is gonna

1310
01:09:54,750 --> 01:10:02,270
be replaced with the end grid edit right

1311
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:11,670
so the end grade edit happens there the

1312
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:14,430
begin grid Edit happens up here and yeah

1313
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:18,359
then we're kind of moving on from into

1314
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:21,289
the actual reporting so now in order to

1315
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:24,089
get this position which we wanted before

1316
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:26,609
that's actually we already wrote that

1317
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:29,550
it's actually this right so this value

1318
01:10:26,609 --> 01:10:32,279
is just that this is what's at what we

1319
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:36,070
wanted it's the center point of the tile

1320
01:10:32,279 --> 01:10:40,920
with the lowest possible C value

1321
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:40,920
so that's pretty much just a non-issue

1322
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:46,750
this function now probably wants to be a

1323
01:10:44,948 --> 01:10:50,198
utility function that operates off of

1324
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:52,389
this because we're what we're trying to

1325
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:54,819
get here is the storage value from this

1326
01:10:52,389 --> 01:10:56,769
you know I'm saying so we don't really

1327
01:10:54,819 --> 01:10:58,960
want to have to do it this way anymore

1328
01:10:56,769 --> 01:11:00,400
because we've already got this so I'm

1329
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,239
gonna actually make this work a little

1330
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:06,729
differently I also want to transform all

1331
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:09,399
of these into testing functions that you

1332
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:12,368
can use that don't require you to do

1333
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:18,729
funky arithmetic and we can just bake

1334
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:20,768
all that in to the function proper so

1335
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:23,888
let's assume we were gonna do that

1336
01:11:20,769 --> 01:11:28,300
I'm just looking here what else I want

1337
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:33,250
to do yeah so you know stuff and so on

1338
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:36,099
happens and blob all of this looks fine

1339
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:42,238
this obviously is the grid region that

1340
01:11:36,099 --> 01:11:43,989
we're talking about here on the lamp is

1341
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,038
we're gonna have to figure out what we

1342
01:11:43,988 --> 01:11:49,328
want to do with that I don't know we're

1343
01:11:45,038 --> 01:11:50,768
gonna do with some of that stuff yeah so

1344
01:11:49,328 --> 01:11:55,750
a lot of this stuff is just gonna get

1345
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:57,429
cleaned up here all right all right all

1346
01:11:55,750 --> 01:12:00,750
right so this is gonna take a little bit

1347
01:11:57,429 --> 01:12:03,639
of us just slowly working this through

1348
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:05,679
but it's not going to be that bad at the

1349
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:08,679
end of the day all right so this is the

1350
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:11,349
grid region the collision volume for the

1351
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:13,569
room I think we just want this to be a

1352
01:12:11,349 --> 01:12:18,279
way that we get the entire room volume

1353
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:20,729
so here I'm just gonna say like get grid

1354
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:20,729
volume

1355
01:12:24,289 --> 01:12:34,050
you like this right from the grid I'm

1356
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:36,900
gonna want to call that the tile count

1357
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:38,940
here I think it's safe to just use it

1358
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:40,829
directly I don't think I need an access

1359
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:42,449
or for any particular reason they're not

1360
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:44,059
gonna obfuscate that for any particular

1361
01:12:42,449 --> 01:12:47,340
reason

1362
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:49,050
what this part here is a little nastier

1363
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:52,800
because we need to get the various

1364
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:54,719
volume parts of the room here to do the

1365
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:58,890
like mapping for the world room chunk

1366
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:00,689
space stuff so that we're gonna have to

1367
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,910
look at separately as how look that

1368
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:05,669
should probably be an access or as well

1369
01:13:02,909 --> 01:13:08,930
but but I'm not sure so let's go ahead

1370
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:08,930
and take these one at a time

1371
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:16,409
so let's figure out how we want to do

1372
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:19,439
tiles if I jump in here and take a look

1373
01:13:16,409 --> 01:13:23,639
at how get tile was working I can

1374
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:25,649
probably just make this be a helper

1375
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:33,150
where we just say look if you wanted to

1376
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:35,549
pass an edit tile then you just can and

1377
01:13:33,149 --> 01:13:39,269
it would just do that and so for now

1378
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:41,039
we'll just do this furthermore you don't

1379
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:47,400
really need that so you can pretty much

1380
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:50,100
just do this right and I think that

1381
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:51,869
takes care of our of our issue there the

1382
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:54,060
problem is this doesn't really want to

1383
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:55,409
be called tile and this is why say I

1384
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,210
don't know if we want to like sort of

1385
01:13:55,409 --> 01:13:59,119
line that up with this a little bit

1386
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:01,319
better

1387
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:03,779
meaning the stuff that's actually in

1388
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:06,599
here like the open structure old bit

1389
01:14:03,779 --> 01:14:09,269
there but like maybe it just gets copied

1390
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:13,070
into the tile so in other words if we

1391
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:16,380
wanted to you know we could do this and

1392
01:14:13,069 --> 01:14:19,319
then you could just get those pieces of

1393
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:22,460
information I don't know it's hard to

1394
01:14:19,319 --> 01:14:22,460
say but anyway

1395
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:50,610
something like this I think that's what

1396
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:53,069
we want something along those lines I

1397
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:56,670
definitely don't want any of that in

1398
01:14:53,069 --> 01:14:58,979
there but I think that's more or less

1399
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:01,739
what we want and so I mean here this

1400
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:05,609
would be like edit tile contents right

1401
01:15:01,738 --> 01:15:08,058
and that would just be the same code

1402
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:10,139
it's just I'm just changing the name

1403
01:15:08,059 --> 01:15:11,300
nothing particularly weird happening

1404
01:15:10,139 --> 01:15:15,118
there

1405
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:16,409
same here I could probably just search

1406
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:19,609
and replace this I don't because there's

1407
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:23,629
nothing we didn't actually change

1408
01:15:19,609 --> 01:15:23,630
anything about the code

1409
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,418
[Music]

1410
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:49,679
yes so I think that's mostly it right

1411
01:15:51,359 --> 01:16:00,578
all right so we've got this query here

1412
01:15:55,479 --> 01:16:07,900
we've got this in volume query here

1413
01:16:00,578 --> 01:16:11,349
which um not super sure what that's even

1414
01:16:07,899 --> 01:16:14,259
doing so it's basically saying okay it's

1415
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:19,510
just saying our is this tile inside this

1416
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:32,679
connection right so that's kind of like

1417
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:35,550
the absolute tile location so we kind of

1418
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:35,550
want this right

1419
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:49,170
and so this when we say like is this

1420
01:16:46,289 --> 01:16:51,899
thing in this volume right we want to be

1421
01:16:49,170 --> 01:16:53,970
able to do that and then when we're

1422
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:55,409
actually looking at those right you can

1423
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:59,460
see what those were right

1424
01:16:55,409 --> 01:17:03,470
so these want to be in terms of absolute

1425
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:07,409
right if this you know absolute value

1426
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:15,329
lines up with that absolute value then

1427
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:18,269
off we go this on edge function is just

1428
01:17:15,329 --> 01:17:20,100
a function of the tile and we should

1429
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:22,410
just be able to ask that question right

1430
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:35,610
and so I want to be able to do a couple

1431
01:17:22,409 --> 01:17:39,000
of these so here's the is on edge and

1432
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:46,019
that's just going to do like exactly the

1433
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:48,720
same thing it was doing so that's

1434
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:51,030
totally fine and then the other thing

1435
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,119
that we want to do here is allow you to

1436
01:17:51,029 --> 01:18:02,880
get that absolute value so that is again

1437
01:17:54,119 --> 01:18:05,220
really simple it's just an addition so

1438
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:09,960
in order to produce that we take the

1439
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:18,690
relative index and we just want to take

1440
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:20,100
the grid base right and offset it by the

1441
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:21,960
relative index and that gives us the

1442
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:27,270
absolute index right nothing nothing

1443
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:28,980
fancy okay so here this X index and why

1444
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:32,880
index those are actually just the

1445
01:18:28,979 --> 01:18:39,739
relative index right so if we just do

1446
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:42,630
something like this then this is P dot X

1447
01:18:39,739 --> 01:18:45,399
and this is P dot Y

1448
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:48,180
just makes it a little easier mm then if

1449
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:58,170
I had to expand that whole thing out

1450
01:18:48,180 --> 01:19:01,210
what else we got okay on lamp is I

1451
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:05,109
whatever like I don't even know I guess

1452
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:19,420
we just let it do that if that's what

1453
01:19:05,109 --> 01:19:21,609
you want I'm not going to stop you what

1454
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:23,940
is you can edit I'll just no yeah right

1455
01:19:21,609 --> 01:19:23,939
sorry

1456
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:42,989
so here we're just that all this looks

1457
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:42,990
fine this P dot X nonsense here

1458
01:19:47,869 --> 01:19:56,429
so this is the part we're gonna have to

1459
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:59,219
start actually thinking about what we

1460
01:19:56,429 --> 01:20:04,010
want to do because we now have ways of

1461
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:04,010
making this less hacky and we should

1462
01:20:07,698 --> 01:20:15,029
okay so yeah mostly we're start with

1463
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:19,800
that this is just grid region so I think

1464
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:33,479
that's just fine this is tile contents

1465
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:37,409
right and that's all good no issues

1466
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:41,698
there I don't think I don't see anything

1467
01:20:37,409 --> 01:20:45,029
weird anyway and so now I think we're

1468
01:20:41,698 --> 01:20:49,738
down to just the last few things all

1469
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:52,619
right so that's happy so let's talk

1470
01:20:49,738 --> 01:20:56,809
about these first because I think these

1471
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:58,800
are probably the easiest ones to do

1472
01:20:56,810 --> 01:21:01,230
because they don't really involve any

1473
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,469
thinking so this collision volume forget

1474
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:08,819
room volume off of the grid is pretty

1475
01:21:04,469 --> 01:21:12,659
straightforward so the grid hmm excuse

1476
01:21:08,819 --> 01:21:20,069
me the grid itself that collision volume

1477
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:24,679
is just a v3 if we know the grid we know

1478
01:21:20,069 --> 01:21:27,238
that it goes from well it's this right

1479
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:36,750
we actually created the min P to Mac

1480
01:21:27,238 --> 01:21:39,238
space so it's like done and the other

1481
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:41,010
one is kind of a little bit saucy ER so

1482
01:21:39,238 --> 01:21:42,869
it's basically saying I need to get like

1483
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:44,369
the min part of that and the max part of

1484
01:21:42,869 --> 01:21:48,238
that and I need to base them off of this

1485
01:21:44,369 --> 01:21:49,859
so I I'm gonna make accessors for those

1486
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:52,289
because it's still like it's a little

1487
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:58,698
wonky and I don't want someone to screw

1488
01:21:52,289 --> 01:21:58,698
it up so basically you know

1489
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:19,950
this sort of thing all I'm doing is

1490
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:22,409
calling this but with the right thing so

1491
01:22:19,949 --> 01:22:24,090
that someone can't screw it up because

1492
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:25,500
it's just a little bit too much to

1493
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:30,420
remember exactly about what's going on

1494
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:31,619
here right um so yeah I don't know if

1495
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:34,140
you should have to pass the world

1496
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:36,439
probably not if the grid is supposed to

1497
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,450
just have all this garbage in it anyway

1498
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:42,679
let's just go ahead and say that does so

1499
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:49,019
for example it's got the world generator

1500
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:57,480
in there and so you know it can get the

1501
01:22:49,020 --> 01:23:00,560
world anytime it wants to so the change

1502
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:04,259
base fee in this case right is just the

1503
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:10,070
we could we we stored this this value

1504
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:10,070
off right which is this and

1505
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:21,019
and I think that's really all we need

1506
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:26,420
right so I think we're just doing that

1507
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:28,910
and then we want to do grid room dem men

1508
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:31,220
and then when we want to do the max

1509
01:23:28,909 --> 01:23:36,319
version it's the same thing but with Max

1510
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:37,970
and that's it right and so to create the

1511
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:39,259
two world positions that that's what we

1512
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,909
would be doing and assuming we got

1513
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:44,510
everything else right that should just

1514
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:45,829
work in theory right that's a forward

1515
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:47,000
declaration there so we're just going to

1516
01:23:45,829 --> 01:23:48,619
tell it that hey there is a world

1517
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,029
generator we're pointing to it you don't

1518
01:23:48,619 --> 01:23:57,470
know what it is yet but trust me it'll

1519
01:23:50,029 --> 01:24:04,519
come and then here we just do get min

1520
01:23:57,470 --> 01:24:05,240
world P get room max world P and that

1521
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,690
just takes oops

1522
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:10,130
the grid so our construction grid is now

1523
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:11,719
pretty powerful right you could do all

1524
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:15,039
this stuff for us and so hopefully that

1525
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:18,050
just keeps us from having to worry about

1526
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:21,560
all of our kind of finicky little issues

1527
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:23,060
there this part here where it needs to

1528
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:25,360
know what the tyldum is we could just

1529
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:28,250
say for the moment like we just did that

1530
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:29,420
and it's fine I don't know if we want to

1531
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:32,210
do that or not but I'm gonna leave it in

1532
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:34,250
there and so now we've got the remainder

1533
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:36,619
of our time coudn't about 15 minutes or

1534
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:38,479
whatever let's see if we can debug all

1535
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:39,529
this stuff so we're probably gonna have

1536
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:40,939
to go through this a little bit more a

1537
01:24:39,529 --> 01:24:43,429
fine-tooth comb because we just did a

1538
01:24:40,939 --> 01:24:47,689
massive set of reengineering this stuff

1539
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:50,180
right and so you know we probably

1540
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:51,829
introduced our fair share of errors in

1541
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:56,690
there but we'll see if we can get it

1542
01:24:51,829 --> 01:24:58,609
done before the bell right so starting

1543
01:24:56,689 --> 01:25:02,089
off I will say there aren't a whole lot

1544
01:24:58,609 --> 01:25:05,809
of errors obviously popping up so that

1545
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:08,110
was smoother of a start than I thought

1546
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:10,960
[Music]

1547
01:25:08,109 --> 01:25:14,239
enough actually all looks quite good

1548
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,300
that's exactly what I wanted to see and

1549
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:19,130
those are like flatlined right at the

1550
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:24,770
baseline there which is also what I

1551
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:27,199
wanted to see so that's all good and we

1552
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:28,170
can go maybe look and see and try to fix

1553
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:31,079
this error over here

1554
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:33,119
because if there even is one looks like

1555
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:40,710
it fixed that air as well so so that was

1556
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:43,319
a pretty hardcore win there I want to

1557
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:45,689
say that that basically just was totally

1558
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:47,399
solved so you can just see what's going

1559
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:49,799
on with the rooms now when you're moving

1560
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:51,988
backwards it's not finding the next room

1561
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:55,289
boundary and it's actually literally not

1562
01:25:51,988 --> 01:25:57,899
paged in so something about the way I'm

1563
01:25:55,289 --> 01:26:01,019
doing the room boundary now is weird and

1564
01:25:57,899 --> 01:26:04,500
I want to say like the reason I think

1565
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:07,320
that that's probably happening is

1566
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:10,439
because we're making our room boundary

1567
01:26:07,319 --> 01:26:13,259
our entity for the room is based around

1568
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:15,419
the zero zero zero location probably I

1569
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:18,150
bet that's what's actually happening and

1570
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:20,489
so if the min corner it's probably

1571
01:26:18,149 --> 01:26:22,738
counting on it being in the middle and

1572
01:26:20,488 --> 01:26:25,979
pulling it in as opposed to doing an

1573
01:26:22,738 --> 01:26:27,419
overlap in terms of how if you remember

1574
01:26:25,979 --> 01:26:29,218
how we pull stuff out of the world you

1575
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:32,399
can only have things that are half a

1576
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:34,198
room's radius away so I think what we

1577
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,948
need to do if we want to fix that right

1578
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:42,710
is that this crap isn't going to work

1579
01:26:37,948 --> 01:26:42,710
what we actually want is we want this

1580
01:26:55,369 --> 01:26:59,880
and so what I'm doing they're saying

1581
01:26:57,659 --> 01:27:02,430
look we need this because people get

1582
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:04,319
packed into areas and there's a maximum

1583
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,039
entity radius in terms of how it will be

1584
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,739
unpacked

1585
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:09,930
we can't just arbitrarily expect rooms

1586
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:12,449
to get unpacked if they're at their

1587
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:14,280
minimum here and this thing is like

1588
01:27:12,449 --> 01:27:16,019
unpacking the cells around it it may

1589
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:18,809
never get to entities that were packed

1590
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:21,830
with their entity center there right and

1591
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:25,520
so I suspect that's probably the issue

1592
01:27:21,829 --> 01:27:25,519
let's see if it is

1593
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:39,948
yeah um so that's all good I'm gonna go

1594
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:42,710
ahead and turn off the collision section

1595
01:27:39,948 --> 01:27:44,210
drawing now and we still one of these

1596
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:46,939
days we got to make put that on a switch

1597
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:48,500
I'm just I'm being lazy I just don't

1598
01:27:46,939 --> 01:27:50,659
feel like making a little debug console

1599
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,179
for it what can I say

1600
01:27:50,659 --> 01:28:00,590
that's just that's just the way things

1601
01:27:53,179 --> 01:28:02,090
are so yeah if we turn that off and then

1602
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:04,219
we take a look at our world it's looking

1603
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:07,750
pretty respectable now right like like

1604
01:28:04,219 --> 01:28:10,310
now you don't see like dead area right

1605
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:13,250
and so yeah I mean our lighting still

1606
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:16,250
needs to be finished obviously but like

1607
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:17,600
you you don't see dead area well okay no

1608
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:19,779
you do there's some dead area right

1609
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,780
there

1610
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:46,059
hmm so that's a bit of a puzzler because

1611
01:28:43,329 --> 01:28:49,720
that really doesn't look like it has

1612
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:56,350
anything to do with anyone underneath so

1613
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:59,820
that's something different that does

1614
01:28:56,350 --> 01:29:02,950
that happen in all rooms of this nature

1615
01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:14,859
or just that one so it's not happening

1616
01:29:02,949 --> 01:29:15,670
there what about the garden area yeah

1617
01:29:14,859 --> 01:29:17,939
there it is again

1618
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:17,940
right

1619
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:36,899
hmmm that's gonna be not very much fun

1620
01:29:32,969 --> 01:29:40,649
to debug at all it could just be like

1621
01:29:36,899 --> 01:29:42,179
slight imprecision right in terms of how

1622
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:47,250
we're doing her and the overlap or

1623
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:49,170
something so I could try to hand wave it

1624
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:51,420
away by saying that but I would feel

1625
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:55,618
more comfortable if we actually tried to

1626
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:57,868
figure that out and demonstrate first

1627
01:29:55,618 --> 01:30:04,019
that that's actually what was happening

1628
01:29:57,868 --> 01:30:06,089
there right because it seems like really

1629
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:10,579
weird that it only is happening along

1630
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:10,578
certain edges and I don't know how to

1631
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:37,340
I don't really know how to assess that

1632
01:30:31,819 --> 01:30:38,029
so if I was going to play with this part

1633
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,980
of it

1634
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:42,559
I'm just want to see from my own

1635
01:30:39,979 --> 01:30:47,899
edification so suppose we didn't add

1636
01:30:42,560 --> 01:31:04,039
radius to here where we dropped the size

1637
01:30:47,899 --> 01:31:05,539
of this by like an epsilon right and so

1638
01:31:04,039 --> 01:31:07,310
essentially what we're doing here is

1639
01:31:05,539 --> 01:31:08,869
like take the volume we would have been

1640
01:31:07,310 --> 01:31:09,980
querying and just shrink it so that we

1641
01:31:08,869 --> 01:31:13,369
don't have floating-point precision

1642
01:31:09,979 --> 01:31:15,500
issues at the edge and I don't know that

1643
01:31:13,369 --> 01:31:16,939
that really I've done no work to

1644
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,430
determine that that's the case it was

1645
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:22,189
just like well you know I could make an

1646
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:25,840
argument that was happening so what you

1647
01:31:22,189 --> 01:31:28,069
can see is that does fix the problem

1648
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:37,850
which we could call good enough for

1649
01:31:28,069 --> 01:31:39,139
government purposes right I mean

1650
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:40,340
certainly anytime in recent American

1651
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,450
history that would have been good enough

1652
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:45,500
for government purposes I'll tell you

1653
01:31:41,449 --> 01:31:47,619
that right now so looking at this yeah I

1654
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:50,149
mean I think that would probably just

1655
01:31:47,619 --> 01:31:55,659
give me enough information to say that's

1656
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:55,659
probably what that was but so anyway I

1657
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:06,099
think we're pretty good now I'm

1658
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:06,100
relatively happy with with that

1659
01:32:16,029 --> 01:32:20,519
so yeah I think mission accomplished

1660
01:32:45,149 --> 01:32:54,210
all right try to think if there's any

1661
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:59,010
other last little thing I wanted to do I

1662
01:32:54,210 --> 01:33:11,970
think we did everything though ah well I

1663
01:32:59,010 --> 01:33:16,520
could do this since we don't actually

1664
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:16,520
think it's necessary let's remove it

1665
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:38,289
so yeah I'm not sure why we must have

1666
01:33:36,609 --> 01:33:40,119
decided at some point we were like

1667
01:33:38,289 --> 01:33:55,300
forget it it's got to keep the world

1668
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:57,010
anyway I guess and so we had like done

1669
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:04,449
we probably had done some stuff where we

1670
01:33:57,010 --> 01:34:06,699
were like oh you know we thought we were

1671
01:34:04,449 --> 01:34:20,679
gonna pass this around but you know as

1672
01:34:06,699 --> 01:34:23,319
it turns out we weren't okay so I think

1673
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:25,119
now we're all good all right so I guess

1674
01:34:23,319 --> 01:34:29,429
we can go to the QA let's just make sure

1675
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:40,090
this we're running okay looking good

1676
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:43,170
looking good yeah so I think we go fix

1677
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:45,730
ground cover then we fix lighting

1678
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:48,940
well not fix bunker we implement ground

1679
01:34:45,729 --> 01:34:52,839
cover you finish lighting and then we

1680
01:34:48,939 --> 01:34:56,019
clean up the tag system and then I think

1681
01:34:52,840 --> 01:35:01,690
I am very sad to say I'm out of things

1682
01:34:56,020 --> 01:35:03,490
to do which which puts us into game play

1683
01:35:01,689 --> 01:35:05,289
programming land and which as you know

1684
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:07,359
I've tried to avoid as much as possible

1685
01:35:05,289 --> 01:35:09,029
but you can only avoid it for so long

1686
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:11,769
eventually the engine does everything

1687
01:35:09,029 --> 01:35:19,139
and you don't have anything else you can

1688
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:19,140
do yeah

1689
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:25,480
we've got to fix the the camera Z height

1690
01:35:23,979 --> 01:35:32,049
should not move with the character

1691
01:35:25,479 --> 01:35:37,689
bounce with character hopping we should

1692
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:40,110
fix that as well okay does anyone have

1693
01:35:37,689 --> 01:35:40,109
any questions

1694
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:47,639
where's the little cute cute a return

1695
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:58,270
[Music]

1696
01:36:02,329 --> 01:36:08,429
do you plan to implement any fancy 3d

1697
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:12,599
audio stuff not really because the game

1698
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:15,029
is 2d really I mean it's 3d it does a

1699
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:17,760
bunch of 3d effects and stuff but since

1700
01:36:15,029 --> 01:36:19,109
you don't like you're looking down on

1701
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,989
like a 2d dungeon

1702
01:36:19,109 --> 01:36:23,969
I don't think 3d audio really makes much

1703
01:36:21,988 --> 01:36:25,529
sense because everything's supposed to

1704
01:36:23,969 --> 01:36:30,329
sound like it's coming from directly in

1705
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:32,488
front of you right and so you know I

1706
01:36:30,329 --> 01:36:35,698
mean you could come up with like weird

1707
01:36:32,488 --> 01:36:37,439
reasons to do stuff like oh let me try

1708
01:36:35,698 --> 01:36:39,448
to make it sound like you're in the

1709
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:40,799
stack of dungeons so things on floors

1710
01:36:39,448 --> 01:36:43,259
above you like sound like they're behind

1711
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:46,909
you or something like that but I don't

1712
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:48,840
care much for that sort of thing

1713
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:50,340
when you code in pure sweetie do you

1714
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,560
have your own string library do you

1715
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,090
always use subset of C++ and their

1716
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,400
standard string library oh dude I don't

1717
01:36:54,090 --> 01:37:00,210
touch the C++ standard library at all I

1718
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:03,689
would never ever ever use the C++

1719
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:09,569
standard library it's horrific write

1720
01:37:03,689 --> 01:37:11,189
your own string for sure will you at any

1721
01:37:09,569 --> 01:37:13,729
point remove the double walls between

1722
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:13,729
rooms

1723
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:35,539
I don't know I haven't thought about it

1724
01:37:29,079 --> 01:37:39,198
I mean there's no real reason to remove

1725
01:37:35,539 --> 01:37:40,729
double walls between rooms except for

1726
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:43,849
aesthetics but if we decided that it

1727
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:45,979
aesthetically looked nicer to have a one

1728
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:55,940
wide thing then we certainly could it's

1729
01:37:45,979 --> 01:37:58,158
not hard to do so maybe I don't know

1730
01:37:55,939 --> 01:38:03,408
it's not something that I had thought

1731
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:09,829
about see Geoffrey's comment I don't

1732
01:38:03,408 --> 01:38:10,969
know who Jeffrey is oh my a dream call

1733
01:38:09,829 --> 01:38:13,010
gate is two minutes not I've been into

1734
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:15,079
max okay I found it up in the chat there

1735
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:18,170
let me fix that

1736
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:21,109
those room add calls we don't use right

1737
01:38:18,170 --> 01:38:25,429
now so yeah that's why that's why we

1738
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:29,299
didn't see any actual consequences from

1739
01:38:25,429 --> 01:38:32,300
that it's because this is like kind of a

1740
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:33,860
slightly vestigial remain we we probably

1741
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,320
need it because we want to be able to

1742
01:38:33,859 --> 01:38:39,710
display like a map in the future but we

1743
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:41,599
you know we just don't do anything with

1744
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:44,300
it right now but you know to me while

1745
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:47,360
displaying that map eventually that was

1746
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:49,369
what that was supposed to do well let me

1747
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:52,189
see what else we got for comments what

1748
01:38:49,369 --> 01:38:53,658
we're doing hamyuts sine cosine yeah we

1749
01:38:52,189 --> 01:38:55,099
are doing we will do those eventually

1750
01:38:53,658 --> 01:38:56,988
because they're the only two functions

1751
01:38:55,100 --> 01:39:00,920
in our entire code base we didn't write

1752
01:38:56,988 --> 01:39:03,019
ourselves so we want to we do want to do

1753
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:06,469
our own sine and cosine eventually so

1754
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:09,520
that we can be completely completely

1755
01:39:06,469 --> 01:39:09,520
from scratch right

1756
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:18,010
I have a feeling you'll find more engine

1757
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,699
work to do once you starts the gameplay

1758
01:39:18,010 --> 01:39:23,920
stuff well yeah but it won't really be

1759
01:39:21,699 --> 01:39:27,399
engine work do you know what I mean it's

1760
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:28,750
gameplay work at that point like it's in

1761
01:39:27,399 --> 01:39:31,899
other words it's not stuff for

1762
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:34,029
presenting the world and managing stuff

1763
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:35,589
and you know streaming and it's like you

1764
01:39:34,029 --> 01:39:37,119
know it's just it's stuff that only

1765
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:38,860
exists because you had a gameplay

1766
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:40,539
requirement like I want to know if these

1767
01:39:38,859 --> 01:39:42,699
two things collide or I want to pass

1768
01:39:40,539 --> 01:39:44,890
find from here to there then you're

1769
01:39:42,699 --> 01:39:47,139
adding like nominally engine code but

1770
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:52,780
it's really it's just they're in service

1771
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:54,700
of a specific game play feature so yeah

1772
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:56,439
I don't typically count that quite as

1773
01:39:54,699 --> 01:40:02,319
engine work even though obviously it can

1774
01:39:56,439 --> 01:40:06,960
be reused sometimes without ever letting

1775
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:09,549
a tiny animation tool in the editor I

1776
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,319
don't really want to focus much on

1777
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:12,420
animation which is why we haven't done

1778
01:40:11,319 --> 01:40:14,949
that

1779
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:17,140
cuz typically at that point you need to

1780
01:40:14,949 --> 01:40:18,729
pick like an animation tool to you know

1781
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:19,720
to standardize on or something you

1782
01:40:18,729 --> 01:40:21,549
really don't want to write your own

1783
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:23,050
editor for animation unless you plan to

1784
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:24,310
make a big investment in it because

1785
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:27,369
artists aren't gonna want to use some

1786
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:30,660
hacky little thing you made would you

1787
01:40:27,369 --> 01:40:33,159
recommend any books for learning C++ I

1788
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:35,349
just am NOT up on the current books I'm

1789
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:38,139
sorry I would stay away from anything

1790
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:39,940
that really talks about C++ because C++

1791
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:42,910
is kind of garbage so I'd mostly focus

1792
01:40:39,939 --> 01:40:49,809
on learning C so whatever is good books

1793
01:40:42,909 --> 01:40:51,670
for wearing C would be good does the

1794
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:53,530
apron cover everything we need now I'm

1795
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:55,239
just wondering if there may be any point

1796
01:40:53,529 --> 01:40:56,439
in using our elevation and Cameron or

1797
01:40:55,239 --> 01:40:59,649
the figure out the necessary extents for

1798
01:40:56,439 --> 01:41:01,539
the apron for floor as far below us it

1799
01:40:59,649 --> 01:41:04,599
would only be the case if we actually

1800
01:41:01,539 --> 01:41:07,510
had rooms that are high up above the

1801
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:13,270
ground level once we're going down then

1802
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:15,010
no because for going down I believe the

1803
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:20,050
way we want to do that is just have the

1804
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:21,220
outside be filled to black because

1805
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:22,930
you're not really supposed to see down

1806
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:25,510
there anyway right it's supposed to be

1807
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:27,338
solid we may speaking of that we may

1808
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:30,569
want to add

1809
01:41:27,338 --> 01:41:32,859
blocks to the exteriors of areas

1810
01:41:30,569 --> 01:41:35,409
underground to just basically prevent

1811
01:41:32,859 --> 01:41:36,669
you from being able to see down we

1812
01:41:35,408 --> 01:41:48,188
probably will want to do something like

1813
01:41:36,668 --> 01:41:49,418
that darkened Dario the world apron is

1814
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:51,159
meant to make the outside of the world

1815
01:41:49,418 --> 01:41:53,019
not look empty could there be entities

1816
01:41:51,158 --> 01:41:56,469
in side of the world apron as ambien

1817
01:41:53,019 --> 01:41:58,449
entities so there could be but I think I

1818
01:41:56,469 --> 01:42:01,899
would probably rather not and the reason

1819
01:41:58,448 --> 01:42:05,918
for that is if a player can see an

1820
01:42:01,899 --> 01:42:08,800
animate thing I would like them be able

1821
01:42:05,918 --> 01:42:10,568
to get to the animate thing that's kind

1822
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,949
of just a more of a game design

1823
01:42:10,569 --> 01:42:16,030
principle than anything else which is to

1824
01:42:11,948 --> 01:42:20,438
say that anytime the user sees like a

1825
01:42:16,029 --> 01:42:22,509
monster or you know creature of some

1826
01:42:20,439 --> 01:42:25,269
kind I want them to be able to get there

1827
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:28,659
so I would rather have areas you can't

1828
01:42:25,269 --> 01:42:30,489
access be clearly labeled as such so

1829
01:42:28,658 --> 01:42:31,779
that you don't think that there's some

1830
01:42:30,488 --> 01:42:33,488
way to get there and spend your time

1831
01:42:31,779 --> 01:42:36,279
trying to get there does that make sense

1832
01:42:33,488 --> 01:42:37,658
so I would probably shy away from doing

1833
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:39,038
that even though there's no reason we

1834
01:42:37,658 --> 01:42:41,938
couldn't do it obviously the engine

1835
01:42:39,038 --> 01:42:45,818
would handle just fine

1836
01:42:41,939 --> 01:42:48,099
it's the particle system complete yeah

1837
01:42:45,819 --> 01:42:52,379
kind of we probably will want to write a

1838
01:42:48,099 --> 01:42:54,639
few more sort of pathing functions

1839
01:42:52,378 --> 01:42:57,639
because right now we kind of only have

1840
01:42:54,639 --> 01:43:00,038
like poof and we'll want some like

1841
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:01,359
explosions or something I'm out know

1842
01:43:00,038 --> 01:43:03,398
what we'll want but we'll probably want

1843
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:05,739
a few other things so there might be

1844
01:43:03,399 --> 01:43:08,319
some changes to that as we actually put

1845
01:43:05,738 --> 01:43:10,658
in process but mostly the it's pretty

1846
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:15,489
much is what it is right we just change

1847
01:43:10,658 --> 01:43:16,618
a few of the sim trajectories so you

1848
01:43:15,488 --> 01:43:21,038
know we'll want to add a couple more

1849
01:43:16,618 --> 01:43:23,518
trajectory types you can pick from if

1850
01:43:21,038 --> 01:43:23,518
that makes sense

1851
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,170
so yes so we will be placing more things

1852
01:43:33,698 --> 01:43:39,509
in the apron but they should all just be

1853
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:39,510
like trees and rocks and crap right

1854
01:44:04,908 --> 01:44:09,738
have yous get SVN or other vcs's for

1855
01:44:08,119 --> 01:44:17,448
actual collaboration what did you think

1856
01:44:09,738 --> 01:44:27,879
about them I have actually used I've

1857
01:44:17,448 --> 01:44:27,879
used get SVN CVS perforce

1858
01:44:38,969 --> 01:44:45,659
and I think that may be it so I've used

1859
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:48,260
those for in actual in an actual what

1860
01:44:45,659 --> 01:44:50,579
work environment like a real projects

1861
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:54,780
that you know sell for money or whatever

1862
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:56,850
and have multiple people on them and in

1863
01:44:54,779 --> 01:45:00,689
terms of what I think about them I think

1864
01:44:56,850 --> 01:45:03,539
that source code control systems are

1865
01:45:00,689 --> 01:45:06,419
very much like email they're a simple

1866
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:07,738
problem that the people who make source

1867
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:12,329
code control systems managed to

1868
01:45:07,738 --> 01:45:19,909
dramatically overcomplicate and it makes

1869
01:45:12,329 --> 01:45:22,738
it very unpleasant if I had to state the

1870
01:45:19,909 --> 01:45:26,849
overall reason why I believe that to be

1871
01:45:22,738 --> 01:45:30,509
true it's because they all seem to be

1872
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:34,320
written with the same methodology in

1873
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:36,600
mind which is let me implement what I

1874
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:39,420
think a bunch of source code control

1875
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:41,670
system functions are and then let me

1876
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:44,190
dump those in the lap of the user and

1877
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:46,369
force them to create a process that is

1878
01:45:44,189 --> 01:45:49,369
actually what they want out of those

1879
01:45:46,369 --> 01:45:49,369
pieces

1880
01:45:49,399 --> 01:45:55,439
whereas what you actually want is to

1881
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,480
first say what are the set of things

1882
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:59,369
that a programmer actually does with a

1883
01:45:57,479 --> 01:46:01,799
version control system and let me design

1884
01:45:59,369 --> 01:46:07,349
the system that has those as the

1885
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:10,820
functions so for example a pretty simple

1886
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:14,760
type of operation that you should be one

1887
01:46:10,819 --> 01:46:20,909
command in any version control system is

1888
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:23,159
I need to get the state of some other

1889
01:46:20,909 --> 01:46:28,260
programmers machine onto my machine

1890
01:46:23,159 --> 01:46:31,289
right now I don't want to lose the work

1891
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:36,930
I was doing I don't want them to have to

1892
01:46:31,289 --> 01:46:39,029
do anything I just want to just your a

1893
01:46:36,930 --> 01:46:41,969
source code control system make my

1894
01:46:39,029 --> 01:46:44,099
machine have a copy of his machine on it

1895
01:46:41,969 --> 01:46:46,439
please because I'm need to debug

1896
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:52,650
something that you just hit write or

1897
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:54,988
whatever this usually takes like 17

1898
01:46:52,649 --> 01:46:57,359
steps in these version control systems

1899
01:46:54,988 --> 01:47:00,738
and it usually screws up because you oh

1900
01:46:57,359 --> 01:47:04,738
you forgot to reverse and code double

1901
01:47:00,738 --> 01:47:08,119
back stash the previous change into a

1902
01:47:04,738 --> 01:47:11,309
head revision and so now you're abstruse

1903
01:47:08,119 --> 01:47:14,340
refactoring system put the line endings

1904
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:16,199
all into one file and deleted them and

1905
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:21,690
you're like good thank you that's great

1906
01:47:16,198 --> 01:47:24,089
right sue invariably whenever I've tried

1907
01:47:21,689 --> 01:47:27,539
to use any source code control system I

1908
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:30,239
always get that that is the outcome the

1909
01:47:27,539 --> 01:47:32,609
outcome is always that hey I can list

1910
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:33,869
probably five things and those five

1911
01:47:32,609 --> 01:47:35,189
things are the only things you pretty

1912
01:47:33,869 --> 01:47:36,988
much ever need to do with a source code

1913
01:47:35,189 --> 01:47:38,908
control system and you've implemented

1914
01:47:36,988 --> 01:47:41,549
one of them and forgot the other four

1915
01:47:38,908 --> 01:47:43,469
right and so then when programmers have

1916
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:45,719
to do the other four they're issuing

1917
01:47:43,469 --> 01:47:46,980
like ten commands in your source code

1918
01:47:45,719 --> 01:47:51,210
control system all of which are

1919
01:47:46,979 --> 01:48:00,329
error-prone just to get like what's just

1920
01:47:51,210 --> 01:48:03,600
what is what it should do right so they

1921
01:48:00,329 --> 01:48:05,309
all suck is the answer and they don't

1922
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,060
just suck a little bit like they suck

1923
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:08,060
super hard

1924
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:26,490
what about simple ambience like birds

1925
01:48:22,529 --> 01:48:30,119
flying from tree to tree I'm just I'm

1926
01:48:26,489 --> 01:48:32,519
just not okay with it like if you want

1927
01:48:30,119 --> 01:48:35,640
birds flying around they can fly around

1928
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:39,930
inside the rooms that you can actually

1929
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:42,720
access but they shouldn't land on like

1930
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:44,610
the trees in the other places I think I

1931
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:51,690
would I would prefer if they didn't do

1932
01:48:44,609 --> 01:48:53,219
that low mesas and in theory you can

1933
01:48:51,689 --> 01:48:54,689
have the composition of elements a theme

1934
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:56,400
of the apron be visibly different yet

1935
01:48:54,689 --> 01:48:58,559
still complimentary so that it's clear

1936
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:03,359
that is in fact an apron exactly that's

1937
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:05,880
kind of my game design philosophy there

1938
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:08,670
it's like I don't really want the player

1939
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:11,880
to be confused about what is and isn't a

1940
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:14,730
potential goal so I don't really want

1941
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:16,829
like birds flying over an area they

1942
01:49:14,729 --> 01:49:19,049
can't get to because maybe they thought

1943
01:49:16,829 --> 01:49:21,720
the bird was flying somewhere that they

1944
01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:25,730
want to go to right and so any time you

1945
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:29,039
know maybe a bird can fly and never land

1946
01:49:25,729 --> 01:49:30,629
over an area that the player can't get

1947
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:32,550
to so long as they were heading towards

1948
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:33,630
an area the player could get to so that

1949
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,739
it would indicate to the player that

1950
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:36,539
there was something over there explore

1951
01:49:34,739 --> 01:49:43,079
I'd be fine with that right but I don't

1952
01:49:36,539 --> 01:49:52,729
like I don't like possible miscues to

1953
01:49:43,079 --> 01:49:52,729
the player about that right

1954
01:49:56,270 --> 01:50:00,050
do you consider any AI related code as

1955
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:01,970
gameplay programming is there anything

1956
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:03,560
you can implement engine-wise in order

1957
01:50:01,970 --> 01:50:05,570
to ease the coding process of these

1958
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:06,830
topics for example I could see

1959
01:50:05,569 --> 01:50:15,139
pathfinding and role generation as a

1960
01:50:06,829 --> 01:50:18,680
possible candidate I'm not sure what you

1961
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:21,020
mean those two things seem unrelated so

1962
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:24,560
how are you what do you mean by AI

1963
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:29,690
related code and then world generation

1964
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:31,310
you're saying AI as like you know like

1965
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:42,109
putting a neural network into the world

1966
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:43,640
generator or something I guess I'm not

1967
01:50:42,109 --> 01:50:45,939
sure I really super understand the

1968
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,940
question

1969
01:50:50,738 --> 01:50:54,529
what about rolling fog cloud entities

1970
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:56,630
out there just a bunch of trees and a

1971
01:50:54,529 --> 01:50:58,880
large grid sounds kind of weird yeah

1972
01:50:56,630 --> 01:51:05,449
well it is kind of weird I guess but

1973
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:08,569
that's just how it goes how do you write

1974
01:51:05,448 --> 01:51:11,779
thread safe code in C or do you use C++

1975
01:51:08,569 --> 01:51:14,238
standard atomic in that case well thread

1976
01:51:11,779 --> 01:51:16,849
safe code really just has to do with

1977
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:20,598
having access to lock increment and

1978
01:51:16,849 --> 01:51:24,199
locked exchange right so I just call

1979
01:51:20,599 --> 01:51:26,710
lock exchange it's a it's an X 64

1980
01:51:24,198 --> 01:51:31,009
instruction right you don't need

1981
01:51:26,710 --> 01:51:34,578
anything fancy you just need to compile

1982
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:37,099
that X 64 instruction so you just use

1983
01:51:34,578 --> 01:51:40,988
whatever the compilers way of omitting

1984
01:51:37,099 --> 01:51:40,989
that X 64 instruction is and off you go

1985
01:51:44,769 --> 01:51:49,248
but what if the birds don't fly in a

1986
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:55,699
straight line as the crow flies well you

1987
01:51:49,248 --> 01:52:02,059
know I don't know how would you

1988
01:51:55,698 --> 01:52:05,018
implement a game like diggle's so I've

1989
01:52:02,059 --> 01:52:05,019
never heard of that

1990
01:52:05,529 --> 01:52:16,840
what is diggle's it sounds almost like a

1991
01:52:10,099 --> 01:52:16,840
joke name is this a real game

1992
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:32,908
the myth of Fenris is that okay so it's

1993
01:52:26,229 --> 01:52:43,959
it's from 2001 let's see here

1994
01:52:32,908 --> 01:52:46,299
giggles so let me see I can't actually

1995
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:49,980
find any actual digging here let me find

1996
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:49,980
a video where someone's doing something

1997
01:52:51,238 --> 01:52:55,589
okay now I see what's going on there

1998
01:53:00,748 --> 01:53:14,590
so it looks to me just like their de

1999
01:53:04,029 --> 01:53:16,118
storing a volume right yeah so I mean I

2000
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:22,090
don't know that you really would have to

2001
01:53:16,118 --> 01:53:23,558
do anything all that different from what

2002
01:53:22,090 --> 01:53:26,619
we're actually doing the only thing you

2003
01:53:23,559 --> 01:53:29,409
might want to do is you know maybe you

2004
01:53:26,618 --> 01:53:31,509
want to invert the way we're thinking

2005
01:53:29,408 --> 01:53:33,638
about the world so that essentially

2006
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:36,159
everything below a certain Z is

2007
01:53:33,639 --> 01:53:38,050
considered solid and what you store as

2008
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:40,268
entities are actually what we're the

2009
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:42,998
empty area is rather than where the

2010
01:53:40,269 --> 01:53:44,860
solid area is just to keep your storage

2011
01:53:42,998 --> 01:53:47,228
costs down but other than that I think

2012
01:53:44,859 --> 01:53:48,458
you wouldn't really have to do much you

2013
01:53:47,229 --> 01:53:49,809
could probably just use exactly what

2014
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:52,448
we're doing now and just invert the

2015
01:53:49,809 --> 01:54:06,489
meaning so rather than storing solid

2016
01:53:52,448 --> 01:54:09,098
areas you store empty areas right all

2017
01:54:06,488 --> 01:54:11,878
right I'm gonna go ahead and close it

2018
01:54:09,099 --> 01:54:11,878
down

2019
01:54:20,389 --> 01:54:24,868
there we go all right thank you everyone

2020
01:54:23,819 --> 01:54:25,889
for joining me for those sort of

2021
01:54:24,868 --> 01:54:28,198
handmade hero it's been a pleasure

2022
01:54:25,889 --> 01:54:30,630
coding with you as always if you would

2023
01:54:28,198 --> 01:54:32,069
like to follow series at home you can

2024
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:33,810
always pair to the game on hand made

2025
01:54:32,069 --> 01:54:36,179
here org and it comes with a source code

2026
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:37,650
so you can play around with it maybe you

2027
01:54:36,179 --> 01:54:42,149
would like to try implementing diggle's

2028
01:54:37,649 --> 01:54:45,118
yourself and switching our sort of world

2029
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:47,429
representation to be able to store the

2030
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:50,309
idea of empty areas instead of solid

2031
01:54:47,429 --> 01:54:52,889
areas you know it's an interesting it's

2032
01:54:50,310 --> 01:54:56,270
an interesting difference I will be back

2033
01:54:52,889 --> 01:54:58,969
next week to do more programming on our

2034
01:54:56,270 --> 01:55:01,110
probably ground cover at that point

2035
01:54:58,969 --> 01:55:02,010
until then have fun programming and I'll

2036
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:04,670
see everyone on the Internet

2037
01:55:02,010 --> 01:55:04,670
taking use everybody
