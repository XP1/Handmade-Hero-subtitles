1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,589
okay hello everyone and welcome to hand

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,140
made here on the show Rico to complete

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,410
gain live on twitch no engines no

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:13,289
libraries just us even our renderer

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,940
rewrote by hand and not like GPU render

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,829
but I mean literally we wrote the whole

7
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,108
thing by hand every last pixel is put

8
00:00:16,829 --> 00:00:21,448
there by us on the cpu if you can

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,660
believe it and we still run at 60 frames

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,000
per second how do you like that just a

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,160
little bit of old-fashioned elbow grease

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,820
you never know what's possible you

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,689
really don't anyway we're in the middle

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,549
of doing some asset work and I want to

15
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:40,949
sort of get right back into that because

16
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,409
we kind of ended at a good place last

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,850
last week and this week is going to kind

18
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,558
of be about actually exploring the

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,390
system that we set up and hopefully

20
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,119
coming up with a definition of what our

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,520
asset pack file will be so that I can

22
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,530
make one some time off the stream and

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,329
have a new asset pack file for us that

24
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:05,390
will you know conform to the standard

25
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:07,590
that we want it to to conform to I okay

26
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,409
before I get started to let me just say

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,240
it's day 1 36 aren't handmade hero so if

28
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,100
you have pre-ordered the game and want

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,199
to follow along at home unpacked day 135

30
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,298
source code that is the source code that

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,740
I am starting with today and so that is

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,259
the source code that you will want to

33
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,899
start with if you want to match what I'm

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,549
doing I have an itch on my back can we

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,530
just say that my allowed to say that I'm

36
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,740
stream my back is itchy I need one of

37
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,269
those little like hand scratcher thing

38
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,469
is that they sell those weird things

39
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:37,500
really like why would anyone want this

40
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:40,459
will now is right now is literally the

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,700
time that I actually do want that thing

42
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:47,280
okay so we have everything running

43
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,280
through our new asset system which we

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,228
worked on last week and it all streams

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,090
in assets progressively and all that

46
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:56,429
other kind of good stuff but there is a

47
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,079
separate aspect of the asset system that

48
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,118
was not just about streaming that we've

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,519
been working on lately and what we want

50
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:04,349
to do is we want to explore that now

51
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,000
because that's a pretty important part a

52
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:07,890
pretty important thing that we were

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,050
trying to accomplish and so we want to

54
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,750
kind of look at that and and see if we

55
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,450
can start to define it a little more

56
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,469
rigorously

57
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:20,018
so if you remember what we were talking

58
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:21,848
about was how we could go about and I

59
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,739
sort of proposed this tag system that we

60
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:26,949
put in there how we could go about

61
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,659
classifying assets in ways and where the

62
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:31,869
engine could use those assets without

63
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:34,060
really knowing the specifics of what it

64
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,189
was doing and the reason that that's

65
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,959
interesting is because what we'd like to

66
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,449
be able to do is have the engine just

67
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,430
sort of talk in a general way about what

68
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:45,969
it is looking for in terms of a

69
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,489
particular asset like i need a hero you

70
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:50,259
know sprite here and I need them to be

71
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,640
like pointing upwards or something

72
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:54,578
because the hero's moving upwards or

73
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,409
something like this right it'd be nice

74
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,269
to be able to say that from the engine

75
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:01,030
into the asset system and then the asset

76
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,709
system go and get whatever the most

77
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,269
appropriate asset is for that thing and

78
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,610
there's a lot of reasons why you might

79
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,129
want to do it this way one of the big

80
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,900
reasons is because you can add assets

81
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,489
after the fact and not have to do any

82
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,010
additional work in the code to make the

83
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,360
game a little bit richer so for example

84
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:18,489
let's say that we had some way of

85
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,620
telling the asset system which direction

86
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,969
the hero was facing and it would return

87
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,639
the sprite that most closely matched

88
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,979
that direction well once you do that in

89
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,980
the future you can always put in more

90
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,789
facing directions for the hero and

91
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,379
everything will just magically work

92
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:33,669
right the game just gets a little more

93
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,019
fidelity at that point and you didn't

94
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,048
have to do any more work in the engine

95
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,700
right and so rather than have to write

96
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,200
that code everywhere in the engine where

97
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,879
every place in the engine where we might

98
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,548
be doing something where there could be

99
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,229
lots of there could be different numbers

100
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,310
of art assets depending on how much art

101
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,048
we have finished and all those other

102
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,340
sorts of things rather than have to do

103
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,840
to get all the time if we can just put

104
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,879
that into the asset system it's a lot

105
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,060
more useful there because then everybody

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,439
who ever asks for an asset can ask for

107
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,629
it in a way where it's not talking about

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,759
specific asset but rather a family of

109
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,250
assets and it can trust the asset system

110
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,439
to return back to it whatever asset is

111
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,568
most appropriate then as the pack file

112
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,979
gets more assets in it the game just

113
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:18,069
gets richer and you don't really have to

114
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:20,560
do any additional work right so that's

115
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:23,889
kind of handy it also helps during

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,449
development because for example let's

117
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,899
say that yangshin hasn't drawn a

118
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:29,839
particular thing yet

119
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:31,849
but I need to test that thing I can

120
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,649
always have a way of asking the asset

121
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,840
system for it and having the asset

122
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,819
system just return me something close

123
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,179
that's like some other thing that hasn't

124
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:43,310
you know that that's any asset pack file

125
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,319
but isn't exactly the right thing and

126
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,060
then I can still test out everything

127
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,459
with that and then later when she

128
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,470
actually delivers whatever the stuff is

129
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,939
that was for that that new thing that

130
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,440
was added it just goes into the asset

131
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,850
system and then suddenly you know the

132
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,579
game has the right graphics right and

133
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,500
there isn't like this huge stall of me

134
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:01,788
having to wait for her to give me back

135
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,620
the thing before I can implant it or any

136
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:05,719
of this sort of sort of stuff right so

137
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,250
it helps kind of like with that

138
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
pipelining that's really important

139
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,129
because you never want the artist to be

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,300
waiting on you or you to be waiting on

141
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,370
the artist that you can avoid it you'd

142
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,379
always rather just be able to develop at

143
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,060
full speed and as things come together

144
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,098
they just get used and you don't have to

145
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,399
really worry about those sort of

146
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:23,870
dependency as much so what I kind of

147
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,149
proposed for this was an asset tag

148
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,220
system where basically we have any given

149
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:30,439
asset in the game does have a primary

150
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,889
type and that is just whatever the ass

151
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,360
the asset generally is to the engine so

152
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,829
if the engine tends to think about

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,120
things in terms of like oh there's a

154
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:39,889
hero and there's this and there's that

155
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,780
then those are representing the types

156
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,610
and those are the things where we know

157
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:46,369
specifically we want to get back a thing

158
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,979
of this type right so if we ask for hero

159
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,389
we want to get back a hero right but

160
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:51,859
then everything else underneath there

161
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,658
are is kind of saying maybe we could get

162
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,069
that out of the concept of a bunch of

163
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:57,168
tags which are like IDs paired with

164
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:00,228
values and those IDs would be things

165
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:02,629
like oh this is you know a thing that

166
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:04,098
says you know for a lack of an example

167
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,658
like say the gender of the hero like

168
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:08,930
leisa you wanted to have like a male and

169
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:11,689
female versions of the hero right well

170
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,939
maybe you have an asset tag ID that's

171
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:15,978
like gender and then you would just put

172
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,779
in there you know you'd assign number

173
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:19,370
values to them like you know zeros mayl

174
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,478
one is female or something like this I

175
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,509
don't know and hey then you could even

176
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,430
represent as you know anything in

177
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,168
between genders if you wanted to write

178
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,939
maybe maybe not all the creatures in

179
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:30,348
this game have a binary gender right

180
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,939
maybe it's a more progressive game and

181
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,769
and creatures in this game can have

182
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:35,329
mixed genders or transition between

183
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,000
genders or do all sorts of other things

184
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,259
right well then the engine only has to

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,408
know about that and it can just go ahead

186
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,918
and say that and then

187
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:45,658
nobody's drawn a female hero yet then it

188
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,158
would just return a male hero if that

189
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,238
was what we had in there like the one

190
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,649
that's in there currently although I'll

191
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:51,899
be honest with you are I feel like our

192
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,639
guy's a little kid he's cut you no he's

193
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:55,050
not he's somewhat of androgynous you

194
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,329
know he's not strongly Mia but he sees

195
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,759
you know sort of mail so we have you

196
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,050
know that in there I've it asked for a

197
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,239
female protagonist there wouldn't be one

198
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,769
yet so it would return anything I'm

199
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:06,688
sorry but it so we return the closest

200
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:08,489
match which would be the male 1 but that

201
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:11,610
if in the future you drop in a female

202
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:13,109
hero now you have that ability for the

203
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,389
asset system to pick that so when

204
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,329
someone picks female hero as their hero

205
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:21,119
they will get back the right set of art

206
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:22,918
assets right and so that's kind of the

207
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:24,449
idea right and the same goes for other

208
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,038
properties like if I have grass and I

209
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,509
want you know tall grass and short grass

210
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,368
I can have an ID that's like the

211
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:30,899
tallness of something and then I could

212
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:32,039
put in like zero for the shortest one

213
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,110
for the highest and everything in

214
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:35,818
between and it'll just you know at first

215
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,158
that there's only one type of grass I

216
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,079
always get that asset back but then as

217
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,938
more grasses go in I'll start to get

218
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,069
back different grasses based on that

219
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:50,309
number that I put in right and so that

220
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:52,019
all seems pretty reasonable but you know

221
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:54,269
is it enough do we have to do more i

222
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:55,499
don't know let's let's so you know I

223
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:58,348
feel like what we're supposed to do this

224
00:07:55,499 --> 00:08:00,959
week I start playing with this see what

225
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:03,028
we can represent with it and try to play

226
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,860
around with some of those sort of some

227
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:06,990
of those characters characteristics that

228
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,149
I think we might want to have of the

229
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,588
asset system and see if we can make it

230
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,769
work now we already made it work with

231
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:14,968
arrays which was the simple case you

232
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,168
notice that we don't have any of the Ray

233
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,998
types in here anymore we just ask them

234
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,769
directly from the asset system and so

235
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:22,649
you could always dump more of something

236
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:23,879
in and that just works currently but now

237
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:25,168
what we want to do is start to talk

238
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,629
about some of the more structural

239
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:28,948
aspects and so we do have one example of

240
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:30,088
that which is our hero bitmaps and

241
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,308
that's the thing that we want to start

242
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:33,958
looking at today so here is our hero

243
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:35,908
bitmaps thing and you can see that the

244
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,408
way that this typically works currently

245
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:42,808
is there's three parts to a hero there's

246
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:45,688
the head the cape and the torso and so

247
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:49,980
there's two things that we might want to

248
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:52,819
try and tackle here and I'm not one

249
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,980
hundred percent certain which

250
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,290
you know which of these two we actually

251
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,810
necessarily want to use and I'm not sure

252
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:01,549
how far we want to go down one of the

253
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:04,039
past necessarily but I'll just sort of

254
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:06,319
briefly discuss them so you can get an

255
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,759
idea of what I'm talking about so

256
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,700
there's two ways we can go about doing

257
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,970
this there is one way which is that the

258
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,460
asset system itself has the capability

259
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,940
of exposing information such as what

260
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:23,030
constitutes a hero right in other words

261
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,060
it's entirely possible for us to say the

262
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:29,149
engine doesn't really know specifically

263
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:32,599
what makes up a hero and in fact it asks

264
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:37,970
the asset system give me back a hero and

265
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,139
tell me what parts it has right so

266
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,639
that's like doesn't have a head doesn't

267
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:42,769
have a cape does neva torso that sort of

268
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,929
stuff right the other way of doing

269
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,610
things is the engine is always the thing

270
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:47,899
that nose and it asks the asset system

271
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:53,149
to give it back the individual pieces

272
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:54,949
right and so these two ways of doing

273
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,439
things obviously have different benefits

274
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,259
and trade-offs and stuff like this what

275
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,850
I'm thinking as I say it I feel like our

276
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,830
game is probably going to be the kind of

277
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,080
one where the game engine decides and

278
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,090
just ask the asset system directly

279
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,560
because since it's a procedurally

280
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,970
generated game what that means is we

281
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,489
probably don't want to be asking the

282
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,649
asset system what constitutes a hero we

283
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,230
will probably randomly roll what

284
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:19,519
constitutes a hero or have different

285
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,240
unlocks that determine what constitutes

286
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,340
a hero and then that hero is dictated to

287
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,200
the asset system which is required to

288
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,019
give back the assets that will form that

289
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,629
procedurally generated entity not the

290
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,639
other way around so what I suspect would

291
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:36,740
happen here is that what we would want

292
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,629
to do is say that maybe the parts of the

293
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:48,970
hero are additional things that that

294
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:53,629
sort of get gets specified right okay

295
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:57,350
so here's the problem that we have for

296
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:59,419
every one of these things we have sort

297
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,899
of an additional we have a choice of

298
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:05,389
whether we put the asset type you know

299
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,990
whether the heroes head is an asset type

300
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:11,840
or whether it's a tag right underneath

301
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,269
the that hero type and what I think

302
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,100
would be relatively straightforward is

303
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:17,629
if we make sure that everything that the

304
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,350
engine thinks about specifically is

305
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:24,110
typically going to be in a type ID right

306
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:27,110
and the reason I say that is because if

307
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,940
I asked for a hero head you can you can

308
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,490
give me any number of heads from the

309
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,950
asset pool like a male or female head or

310
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,389
a you know a skinny head or a wide head

311
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,250
a fat head all those sorts of things

312
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,500
right but you need to give me back ahead

313
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,940
you can't really substitute the head

314
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,009
with something that's not a head like

315
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,300
you can't give me the torso in place of

316
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:46,939
the head it doesn't really make any

317
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:48,740
sense so that to me seems like it's not

318
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,270
really a tag situation that seems to me

319
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,820
that it's more of a specificity

320
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:56,449
situation right so it seems to me that

321
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:01,250
we want like asset head asset cape asset

322
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:04,790
torso right that seems to me like

323
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:07,789
probably what I want right and then when

324
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:11,179
I asked and these are probably like well

325
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:12,799
you know what honestly I suppose now

326
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,419
that I think about it I don't even know

327
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,629
if they're they're necessarily specific

328
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:20,509
to the hero like pretty much you know

329
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:23,389
anything could have a cape right I mean

330
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,950
at some level I don't know that we need

331
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:28,250
to split hairs about what kind of cape

332
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:32,900
it is so I might just say that we've got

333
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:35,179
you know maybe even child head for human

334
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:38,029
head I don't even know what to say about

335
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:39,379
that maybe it's just head yeah I don't

336
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,860
know I'm just going to leave it as just

337
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:45,860
head for now so those are new asset

338
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,360
types that we could ask about and then

339
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,669
the other question is well with the way

340
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,259
we did hero bitmaps right we've got

341
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,579
those hero bitmaps for four different

342
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:54,620
facing directions that's why there are

343
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,090
four of them here and the facing

344
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,039
direction to me that does seem like a

345
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,110
tag ID thing right because what

346
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,429
direction it's facing you could give me

347
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,070
back something facing the wrong

348
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,379
direction

349
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,820
as a stand-in for the direction that I

350
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:08,009
actually want and furthermore if my

351
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,390
directions are very precise I don't

352
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,519
really need you to give me back a head

353
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:15,659
that's pointing exactly like say 63

354
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,419
degrees off off right or something like

355
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:19,889
that you could give me back a head that

356
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,449
was pointing just somewhere anywhere

357
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:24,029
close to there and that would be

358
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,250
sufficient so I feel like for our asset

359
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:28,379
tags we can now start to think about

360
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,240
what that might be we've got this asset

361
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,639
tag here for example we could have a

362
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,590
facing direction and that's something

363
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,080
that seems pretty clear about what that

364
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,399
would be right that would be something

365
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,090
and I guess I could put a note here that

366
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,789
this is like the angle in radians off of

367
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:47,670
do right you know right so like like the

368
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:51,719
you know the mathematical sort of

369
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:54,000
circular Sam and facing direction so now

370
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,879
let's try you know given just that very

371
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,919
simple experiment let's try to encode

372
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,960
our hero into the asset system so that

373
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:04,919
it's no longer a special purpose thing

374
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,440
that sort of happens out here that you

375
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,509
know in a sort of way that we had a

376
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,460
special case for heroes let's see if we

377
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:15,269
can do it in a way that doesn't require

378
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,740
any of that special casing at all and so

379
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,500
what I want to do now is I want to

380
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,990
introduce some way of course of actually

381
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,580
passing what you want for the asset tags

382
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,289
and the way that I think that I'm going

383
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:30,960
to do that is probably with large with

384
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:32,399
wide vectors at first maybe we won't do

385
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,290
this later but you know we're going to

386
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,100
say so what I'm going to I'm going to

387
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:40,529
call this here an asset vector and an

388
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,460
asset vector is just going to be a giant

389
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:47,789
set of real 32s right that's all of the

390
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,990
possible asset tag types that we had in

391
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:53,519
here like so right and so when you

392
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,100
create one of these asset vectors you

393
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,389
can essentially go ahead and make it an

394
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,129
asset vector full of all these reels

395
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,480
whether this gets a little bit too

396
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:02,370
unwieldy and whether we need to store

397
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,409
them sparsely I will worry about later

398
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,460
and so for right now I'm just going to

399
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,929
the simplest possible thing and

400
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,750
introduce that and this will basically

401
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:11,879
be a way of me saying that I want to

402
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,909
pick an asset type based on something

403
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,840
that isn't random right and so let's go

404
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:18,360
ahead like I said

405
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,060
try to write the rusev code first I had

406
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,610
already put in that sort of pic asset

407
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:25,049
function I don't know where that guy

408
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:29,340
ended up actually being I think he's in

409
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:30,659
here here we go pick best so what I want

410
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,399
to do is I want to go ahead and write

411
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:34,889
that you can see right here that we've

412
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,569
got this random asset from and so what I

413
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:38,549
want to do is make this basically be the

414
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,140
same thing where I've got a sort of a

415
00:15:38,549 --> 00:15:42,419
random essa friend but now I want to do

416
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:47,399
something that's like a match asset from

417
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:51,479
or something like this right or best

418
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:54,360
match asset right and so what I'll do is

419
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:58,800
I'll pass something like one of these

420
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:02,789
asset tag vectors right we go and this

421
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:04,109
is like the desired characteristics so

422
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,279
this is the you know the match but in

423
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,750
fact I guess I already got it laid out

424
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:14,429
here right so we have an asset vector

425
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:16,860
like so an asset vector here so I pass

426
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:19,709
in what I want to match how I want to

427
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,399
wait those matches and then I can just

428
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:25,019
say well we've got the game assets I've

429
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,519
got the type of the asset that I want

430
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,439
and instead of passing that random

431
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,329
series I'm going to pass those match

432
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,980
vectors and then let's see if we can

433
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:35,190
implement that with our asset system

434
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,870
right and so any cuz you can see we like

435
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,400
I said remember when we wrote this what

436
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,100
we do is we just loop through the assets

437
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,189
that we have and we see which one of

438
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,960
them has tags that matches the closest

439
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,280
is possible to our match vector weighted

440
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,769
by whatever the weights are and i'll

441
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,879
talk about that maybe a little bit more

442
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,019
after we implement this for those of you

443
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,210
who don't really understand how that

444
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:56,250
works i'll try to give you a little bit

445
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,750
more information about that since we

446
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,269
never really talked about in detail when

447
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:06,390
i wrote that sort of as an exploratory

448
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:09,990
function okay so basically we want to do

449
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,670
exactly the same stuff here right this

450
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,740
is exactly the startup that we're going

451
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,539
to use we want to grab out whatever that

452
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,130
asset is and then assuming that there

453
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,649
are some assets we're going to take a

454
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,400
look at all of the assets and serious

455
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,230
own so instead of doing it like this we

456
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,670
actually want to do is do a for I loop

457
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,039
here now where I'll go ahead and do

458
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,450
Asset index equals whatever the first

459
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,240
one is and I guess we don't even need

460
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:37,309
that that for loop anymore because we're

461
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,120
just going to loop you know sort of

462
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:42,470
between the the balance here so there we

463
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,989
go I'm going to start with this asset

464
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:48,559
index I'm going to loop until the the

465
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:52,309
end of this particular asset and off we

466
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,700
go now every time I encounter one of

467
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:57,440
these assets right I'm going to take a

468
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,340
look at that asset and I'm going to loop

469
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,529
through the flags and I'm going to do

470
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:08,240
that exactly how we did it here right

471
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:10,730
and so what I need to do is find out

472
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,710
where those flags are and i believe the

473
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,380
asset itself tells me right that's the

474
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,940
way it should work we've got the asset

475
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,620
type which told us all the assets we

476
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,090
should consider and then breathe asset

477
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:23,859
we have all the tags week should

478
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:23,859
consider so there's our first tag index

479
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:29,659
excuse me there's that first tag index

480
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:36,349
there's the one passed the last tag

481
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:38,390
index so and for each one of those we're

482
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,309
going to grab out that asset tag which

483
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:44,930
again is just off of our our global tags

484
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:46,190
array so for each one of those tanks in

485
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,990
the asset system we're going to take a

486
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,960
look at the match vector we're going to

487
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:56,990
subtract it from the actual value that

488
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,970
the tag has and that's basically the

489
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:02,359
difference between what we wanted and

490
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:05,630
what this particular asset prescribes

491
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:08,779
and then we're going to wait that by

492
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,670
multiplying it by whatever the the

493
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:13,490
weight vector is for that that

494
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,980
particular tag that gives us total

495
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,620
weighted diff and so each time through

496
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,220
the asset every time we check an asset

497
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:23,959
if the diff that we come up with here is

498
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:27,289
better than whatever our current best is

499
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,049
then we will go ahead and save that as

500
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:32,690
as the resulting asset right and i think

501
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,430
that's basically all we need to do i'm

502
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,779
going to go ahead and make this look

503
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,060
like that there we go we don't really

504
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,460
need best index we only need to save

505
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,669
best if because the result itself will

506
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,180
carry

507
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,000
the return value so let's go ahead and

508
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,320
compile that and see if I did anything

509
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,880
stupid there oh I forgot these are now

510
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:58,289
Dottie's there we go I should say arrow

511
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,550
ease and that is a best match routine

512
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,839
that loops through all the assets now

513
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:02,639
it's not particularly smart it's not

514
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,199
accelerated very well so it's got to do

515
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,420
a lot of work to check all these and

516
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,710
that may be a problem for us so that's

517
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,110
something that we definitely have to

518
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,480
think about and when we start to do a

519
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,909
little bit more profiling and stuff like

520
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,430
that in the future we may have to start

521
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,259
to think about how we want to make this

522
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,190
stuff run faster but again we're not

523
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,289
going to worry about that until we

524
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,460
actually have some indication that it's

525
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,049
going to be a problem because otherwise

526
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,840
we're just spending time in the wrong

527
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:29,909
place potentially so there we go that's

528
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,699
something that does what we needed to do

529
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:36,450
and so now let's take a look at actually

530
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,340
calling that best match asset from you

531
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,160
know some code that was actually using

532
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:44,009
the hero bitmaps right so let's let's

533
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,480
assume just start off with go handing

534
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,940
and turning off those here a bit maps

535
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,120
entirely so that we just don't have them

536
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,670
anymore right and so we can see everyone

537
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,529
who's trying to use them and here you go

538
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,870
you can see us grabbing the hero bitmaps

539
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:00,480
out here and if we take a look at what

540
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:03,179
happens with those here a bit maps you

541
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,700
can see that they they get I guess they

542
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:10,230
get used here both by the the familiars

543
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:15,390
and here by the by the hero it looks

544
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:18,349
like yeah the familiar and the Monstar

545
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,150
are only drawing the torso and the head

546
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:24,179
what I might do just for the moment I

547
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,070
might go ahead and disable the familiar

548
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,680
and the Monstar so that we only have to

549
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:32,759
work with one person which is this guy

550
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:36,690
right and and see how we would go about

551
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:39,180
specifying this stuff here well you know

552
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,590
what actually now that I think about it

553
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,590
no we don't really have to do that

554
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:48,299
that's actually probably premature what

555
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,769
I could do instead there's a pretty easy

556
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,799
way to port this now that I think about

557
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:54,369
it all we really have to do is take this

558
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,139
out

559
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:57,369
and you know make this back into

560
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:01,630
something that only i think it was

561
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:02,949
originally in handmade dot H anyway I'm

562
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,809
just going to go ahead and make one of

563
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,430
those there and instead I'm just going

564
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:10,089
to say that there's a bitmap ID in each

565
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:13,120
of these right and we'll call this hero

566
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:16,709
bitmap IVs right then in here what i can

567
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:19,689
do is where we were getting them before

568
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,789
where we do here a bit maps and we we

569
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:24,160
look up that facing direction right i'm

570
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:30,490
just going to say okay here's our hero

571
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:33,700
bitmap IDs right and that i will

572
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,710
actually set each of these members to be

573
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,019
the appropriate what the ID should be

574
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,029
for the facing direction by calling the

575
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:41,980
asset system right here so i can

576
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:45,700
basically emulate exactly the way that

577
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,410
we were doing this before right and so

578
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,660
what i want to do here is call that new

579
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,400
function that we made and you know like

580
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,558
i said write the usage code first i want

581
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,059
to make sure before i go down this path

582
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:56,889
any further I want to make sure that

583
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:58,869
it's convenient to use this function so

584
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,300
let's take a look and see if it actually

585
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:04,689
does things the way that I want it to do

586
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:08,079
it so we've got our trans state assets

587
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,640
we have our asset type ID which in this

588
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:14,759
case is going to be you know like the

589
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:17,440
head and so on so there's our asset head

590
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,119
then we have our match vector in our

591
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,710
weight vector and those are going to be

592
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,689
basically the same for the head decay

593
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,090
from the torso at the moment so i'll

594
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:28,390
just go ahead and make those and then

595
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:32,049
use them in each case right so let's go

596
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:35,950
ahead and do best match asset go best

597
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:39,039
match asset best match asset so we have

598
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,970
head cape or so and that's really all we

599
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,279
need let's take a look here set top down

600
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:51,069
a line we don't really want that anymore

601
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:54,759
that is not at all what we want let's go

602
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:59,769
ahead and keep that let's see and so

603
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:03,910
asset vector match vector so ass

604
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:07,190
effector weight vector so what I want to

605
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,710
do here I want I'm not sure

606
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,240
how exactly I want to set these it's a

607
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:16,279
little bit confusing because I haven't

608
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,990
really thought it through too much I'm

609
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:22,339
going to do this in a very simplistic

610
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,809
way at the moment so we're going to kind

611
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:26,000
of want to work with these guys a little

612
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:30,349
bit more to figure out exactly what we

613
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,599
want to do but for now yeah we're just

614
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:38,269
going to do the simplest possible thing

615
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:39,639
and and just directly set the values but

616
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:42,319
i think i'm going to want some helper

617
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,810
functions for this eventually is it

618
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,039
empty facing direction is that the is

619
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:49,879
not the appropriate and i'm actually

620
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:54,259
even know let's see the military to yet

621
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,390
so that's fine alright so I want the

622
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:59,329
weight right now oops I've got these

623
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,630
backwards I want the wait to just be one

624
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:03,949
point ammo for right now and and I want

625
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,240
the facing direction to be the only

626
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,880
thing that we're matching against so

627
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,490
there we go and when I'm calling these

628
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,220
guys here I need to pass the address

629
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:19,849
because that's a pointer based value so

630
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:24,920
there we go oops and let's see and these

631
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:26,929
are now dots so there we go and none of

632
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,519
the two overloads right because that's

633
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,500
not address anymore it's just a bitmap

634
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:37,700
ID so let's do that and that and now we

635
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,500
should be ported ok perfect so now what

636
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,090
I'm expecting to happen now is is

637
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,650
absolutely nothing like we shouldn't see

638
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:44,209
anything because of course we haven't

639
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,720
actually set up any of those asset

640
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,180
tables so what we want to do now is go

641
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,150
ahead and set up those asset tables and

642
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,560
see how they work so here we are in the

643
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,060
part where we would have to start

644
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,649
setting those up right and you can see

645
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:59,509
that we've kind of got this stuff

646
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,430
happening here so what we'd want to do

647
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:03,710
is we want to go ahead and do a begin

648
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,509
asset type and we'd want to say that

649
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,309
we're going to set you know like for

650
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:11,150
example the cape and then we do an end

651
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:12,950
asset type and you know I could go ahead

652
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,940
and grab the right Cape in here right

653
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,360
and just add that in there oops add

654
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,360
bitmap asset

655
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:27,019
assets like so and now we'd have the

656
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:29,809
cape in there and it would just always

657
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:32,000
pick the right word facing cape right so

658
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:34,099
anytime you ask for a cape you're going

659
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,480
to get the right word facing kate right

660
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,829
because that's the only asset that's in

661
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,710
there so it doesn't matter what tags you

662
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:41,178
specify you'll always get that one and

663
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,149
similarly I could do the exact same

664
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:48,350
thing for everything else on the Kiro

665
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:51,500
right we've got the head and asset type

666
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:53,000
assets and again this code I don't care

667
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,798
about it all really because this is not

668
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,138
code will ever actually use in the real

669
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:59,839
game this code right here is just to

670
00:26:57,138 --> 00:27:01,729
build the asset list as if it had

671
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,158
already been built in an asset pack file

672
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,019
so this is really just whatever it takes

673
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,429
to get something in there because it's

674
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,409
really all the query code and stuff that

675
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:11,240
we care about we don't care about at all

676
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:14,149
the building code here because that will

677
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,620
never run at runtime at all that'll be

678
00:27:14,148 --> 00:27:20,479
something that's done it is an offline

679
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:23,658
process so there we go so let's see if I

680
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,720
specify these now we should get a

681
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:28,549
complete hero facing to the right like

682
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,970
so oh and hey we also get the familiar

683
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:33,950
head which is also good right now we

684
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,259
have a problem here which is that we

685
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,509
have not done our top down alignment

686
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:41,089
stuff for these guys yet and so we need

687
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:44,898
to pass in that and as well as like a

688
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:47,808
sort of a v2 thing there right as a

689
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:52,038
thing that specifies that and I'm not

690
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:54,319
sure how we want to do that exactly I

691
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:55,879
guess I can just do the divide I guess I

692
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,138
could what I did before if i remember

693
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,059
correctly as i went in and actually

694
00:27:57,138 --> 00:28:00,528
inspected what they all were seems a

695
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:02,210
little bit tedious maybe we'll leave

696
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:03,528
that for a little bit later and focus on

697
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:08,778
so what we're doing here and then I'll

698
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:11,630
deal with that a little bit later on all

699
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:13,099
right so now what I want to do is I want

700
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,899
to be able to start adding in the

701
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,918
different types of assets for the head

702
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:17,239
here are the different facing direction

703
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,278
so I'd like to do is make the head go

704
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,899
different directions so I don't want to

705
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,380
do is I want to be able to make the head

706
00:28:20,898 --> 00:28:27,048
go right I want to make the head be able

707
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,870
to go up or i guess i should say back

708
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:31,629
and in front right to represent that

709
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:37,239
sort of rotational

710
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:39,780
that rotation right and if i add all

711
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,130
those to the system then what we get

712
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,720
right is it just picks whatever the

713
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,550
first asset is because none of the other

714
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,740
assets will ever be a higher math in it

715
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:50,980
so what i need to do now is set those

716
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:53,170
assets to have some tags that are

717
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,860
actually going to distinguish them from

718
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:58,570
other things okay and so what I want to

719
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:00,849
do there is I want to be able to set

720
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:04,299
that asset tag for the facing direction

721
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:05,769
like so right I don't know that should

722
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:07,720
say asset tag or not but we'll just say

723
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:12,190
tag facing direction right I want to be

724
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,360
able to say tag facing direction and I

725
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,809
want to be able to set that basing

726
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,949
direction to something right now I don't

727
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:19,269
know what these are actually you know

728
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,529
these aren't actually angles yet because

729
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,789
i think the facing direction stuff is

730
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:24,910
still set to be integers in the ones

731
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:25,990
will have to line those up but this will

732
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,210
basically give me something that will

733
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,539
start to differentiate these assets by

734
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,019
adding these tags all right so i'm going

735
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:40,960
to go ahead and put that tag in here if

736
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:42,480
i do add tag add tag game assets this

737
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,490
right here is going to be the tag ID

738
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,920
that lets us know what type of tag we're

739
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,870
adding then we have the value which is

740
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,970
what it should be set to and what that

741
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:55,689
has to do is that has to insert a tag

742
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,900
into the tag table right and it's going

743
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:04,559
to have to know which particular asset

744
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:06,250
it was talking about right so since we

745
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,960
haven't ever done anything like this

746
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,119
before you'll notice we don't have the

747
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,569
right pointer in here we need a debug

748
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,469
asset in there for building and what

749
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:16,359
that's going to be is just the thing

750
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,789
that remembers whatever the last asset

751
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:22,599
was it whoa that we that we created

752
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:27,119
right like so and so as we do that I

753
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:31,869
will do an assert here right cert assets

754
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,759
this guy debug asset and whenever we

755
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:37,779
sort of end an asset type obviously

756
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:41,859
we'll also set that debug asset to 0 so

757
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:43,899
and that's all fine so when we go to add

758
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:45,459
a tag what we need to do is we need to

759
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,019
make sure that this axe

760
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,750
we get set in the proper way so what we

761
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:51,158
have here is we've got a you know much

762
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,000
like we had all that other stuff we want

763
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:56,919
a debug used tag count right and we want

764
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,919
that debug used CAD count to allow us to

765
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:02,259
continue to add tags right so we're

766
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,860
going to have an asset tag here where we

767
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:10,329
basically do assets tags Plus debug used

768
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:12,069
tag count + + right and that allocates a

769
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:13,298
new tag and again we would also want to

770
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:15,700
assert here it looks like I didn't

771
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:19,359
assert this one for some reason I would

772
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:22,480
I don't know why I'd like to assert but

773
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:25,269
we're actually in the reasonable range

774
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,849
right make sure that that one passed

775
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:30,759
last asset index is actually less than

776
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:32,709
the asset count total just again it's

777
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:34,929
not like this is really an issue at all

778
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,240
because this is stuff again that will

779
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:39,130
all be done offline but you know just

780
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,870
well we're it helps in debugging to

781
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,950
double-check that way you don't spend a

782
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:43,898
lot of time trying to debug something

783
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,278
that an assert could very easily have

784
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:47,619
caught right so sometimes it pays to

785
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,679
just throw in a few extra asserts in

786
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:52,629
there even if you don't think they're

787
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:54,399
particularly useful or even if you don't

788
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,409
think it's very important for the code

789
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,148
to be robust it's you know sometimes

790
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:01,570
you're just doing it to save yourself a

791
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:03,219
little bit of time right so let's go

792
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:05,528
ahead and do that we set this up now the

793
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,048
first tag index much like we were doing

794
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:10,659
here this sort of stuff we want this to

795
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:14,019
work exactly the same way so we set this

796
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:17,169
up to to initialize itself with

797
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:19,538
essentially a mill range right and then

798
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:21,850
every time we add a tag what we would

799
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:24,579
want to do is we would want to sort of

800
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:27,639
advanced that debug used tag count and

801
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:32,009
we also probably want to to take that

802
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:36,220
that debug asset and increase its one

803
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:37,929
pass last tag index right so we want to

804
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,538
increment both of those both the total

805
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:42,970
number of tags that we have written so

806
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:44,619
far and then also the you know for the

807
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,778
asset that we're actually adding them to

808
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:48,129
we want to expand its range as well so

809
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:50,950
that it knows that it has another tag

810
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,539
now once we have that tag we just set

811
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,330
the ID and the value and that's really

812
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:56,980
all that we need to do they're just

813
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:58,960
really nothing else that we're going to

814
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,000
do with the tags

815
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,390
so now that we've got that if we go

816
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,429
ahead and you know we really this end

817
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,990
asset type could probably is really

818
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:09,070
superfluous it's mostly just for error

819
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,970
checking now so we could actually get

820
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,950
rid of that if you want to doesn't

821
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,140
really do anything but that's separate

822
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,929
issue so in here you'll notice we don't

823
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,028
act we don't allocate any tags at the

824
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:21,100
moment you can see that the tag array is

825
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:22,390
totally not allocated so we would crash

826
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,709
pretty much immediately well we wouldn't

827
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,600
crash we desert that there's no room

828
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,340
left in the tag table so what I need to

829
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:32,199
do again is just allocate some room the

830
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:34,119
tag table for this test stuff so I don't

831
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,940
know how many of those going to be let's

832
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:37,918
just say that there is a bunch of them I

833
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,370
don't know how many there are but

834
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,899
doesn't really matter a lot the moment

835
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:45,219
and again we'll know the exact number

836
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:48,009
normally because we'll be loading enough

837
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:51,038
disk so that's really not an issue going

838
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:53,648
forwards so let's go ahead and set that

839
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,788
up and compile now we should probably

840
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:57,339
step through this and see that

841
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:59,950
everything's going this one run it ah

842
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:03,778
there we go so you can kind of see now

843
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:06,580
that we got exactly what we wanted right

844
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:10,000
you know those tags are now allowing the

845
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:12,098
asset system to match properly so now we

846
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,780
no longer specifically code anything

847
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,730
about how the facing direction stuff

848
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,619
works we just ask the asset system and

849
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,719
it returns one for us and as you can see

850
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:22,869
since we haven't added any other assets

851
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:24,730
for that cape and the torso they just

852
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:26,619
stay giving us back the one bitmap that

853
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,358
actually is added and so now without

854
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,649
again changing any other code this is

855
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:31,898
this kind of nice thing about the system

856
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:33,368
I can just kind of come in here and

857
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:36,279
pretend that you know if this was the

858
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:38,139
asset system I can just pretend that

859
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,909
what we did is we loaded you know the

860
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:44,019
new asset pack file that has this more

861
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:46,720
stuff in it right and and off we go so

862
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:48,608
if I if I actually define these guys so

863
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,658
that now all the directions of all the

864
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:55,179
stuff is in there you can see we've got

865
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,530
our hero back and now the other nice

866
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,088
thing too is our heroes going through

867
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,220
the asset system which means he's delay

868
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:04,809
loaded and all that other stuff so

869
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:07,239
that's all good news as well okay so

870
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:09,389
that's all cool tag matching is working

871
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,389
nicely

872
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,519
I do think however that this is not a

873
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,060
particularly good way of doing facing

874
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:23,989
direction I feel like facing direction

875
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:27,440
should be more you know more general

876
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:29,059
than that it just just doesn't seem like

877
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,380
a very good idea so what I want to do is

878
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:32,420
I want to take a look at where that

879
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,980
facing direction stuff is actually set I

880
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:39,079
want to maybe change that to something

881
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:42,019
that makes a little more sense so let's

882
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,179
take a look here we are in sim region

883
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:46,369
you can see that what we're doing here

884
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:47,719
is we're sort of taking a look at

885
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:50,420
whether we're you know where we're

886
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:52,250
moving in X or Y and we're encoding that

887
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,539
in there and I feel like maybe what we

888
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,909
would want to do here is just like an

889
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:58,130
atan two or something to figure out what

890
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:59,899
angle the hero is pointing and actually

891
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,119
use that as the facing direction that

892
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,650
way we could introduce diagonal sprites

893
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,569
if we wanted to in the future if we

894
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,980
decided that those were good idea or

895
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,130
other stuff like that it would just give

896
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:14,510
us a little bit more as you know

897
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:15,650
fidelity there in our in our you know in

898
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,280
our character sprites if that makes

899
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,320
sense now there is a there is something

900
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,490
that's a little bit nasty about that so

901
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,070
we do have to think about this a little

902
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:26,869
and this is I'm kind of glad that I

903
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:29,330
decided to do this because this brings

904
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:31,579
up a thing that we'd probably have to

905
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:34,670
support in our tag system that right now

906
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:35,750
we really aren't supporting right so

907
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,119
let's go ahead and talk about that

908
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,460
because it's it's a very interesting

909
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,799
point I think and and probably will have

910
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,050
some ramifications right in fact I think

911
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,039
someone actually mentioned this they

912
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,170
were like what you need to have

913
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:50,239
different matching functions and I said

914
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,590
well we don't know yet right and so

915
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,569
here's an example of where we might need

916
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,130
to have one I don't know this is exactly

917
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,180
what they meant but you know I think

918
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,079
they were asking along these lines

919
00:36:56,179 --> 00:37:02,929
anyway so let's say that what I want to

920
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,730
do is I want to match bitmaps against

921
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,349
the facing directions so here's like an

922
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,210
example of a facing direction right

923
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,949
here's another example of a facing

924
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,130
direction here's another direction

925
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:17,719
example of a facing direction right and

926
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,610
so in here what I do is I have you know

927
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,069
the different drawings of the guy and so

928
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:23,150
you know here he is facing that

929
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:25,460
direction

930
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,860
and here he is you know facing that

931
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,260
direction he's some kind of a fish mouth

932
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,269
thing I don't know what he is but that's

933
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,780
just what he is and here he is facing

934
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:39,469
that direction okay now if I encode

935
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:43,780
these by the angle right this is maybe 0

936
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:46,719
degrees this is something like you know

937
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:49,970
smay be 80 degrees don't actually know

938
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:53,269
and that's maybe something like I don't

939
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:56,649
know if that's 180 and that's 90 that's

940
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:59,809
going to be like you know ones let's

941
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:03,650
let's say that's 150 I don't really know

942
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:07,639
maybe 160 probably more like 160 degrees

943
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:09,050
so if I encode these by the angle and I

944
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,539
pull them out I'm going to get what I

945
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:13,670
want put in you know let's say 10

946
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:16,400
degrees and I'll get 0 properly it'll

947
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,860
match the closest i put in 75 degrees

948
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,539
that will match the closest i put in 125

949
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,670
degrees this will match the closest and

950
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:24,920
it's going to do roughly what i want to

951
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:28,309
do and that's good but i have a problem

952
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,610
and that is what happens when i go here

953
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:33,110
and i put in this angle right which is i

954
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,420
don't know exactly what it is but it's

955
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,579
something like 300 degrees what am I

956
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,079
going to get back right I want to get

957
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,610
back this guy because of the three

958
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,949
things that I put in the asset system

959
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:46,250
he's clearly the closest but the problem

960
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:50,500
is he's actually going to match this guy

961
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:54,050
because 300 is closest to 150 not zero

962
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:59,090
right and that's because this parameter

963
00:38:54,050 --> 00:39:01,730
is periodic right not monotonic right it

964
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:05,059
does not just keep increasing it wraps

965
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:07,610
around and in order to correctly obey

966
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:10,099
you know in order to correctly encode

967
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:14,510
that notion that this thing is wrapping

968
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:16,099
around I don't really have any way to to

969
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:18,530
do that with something that just matches

970
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:23,269
about based on the value the matching

971
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:25,160
code needs to do some logic to handle

972
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:27,500
the fact that it's periodic and match on

973
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:32,199
a periodic basis does that make sense

974
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,199
hopefully that makes some sense so yeah

975
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:40,208
that complicates matters a bit for us

976
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,499
right that makes things a little bit

977
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:44,169
more difficult because what we'd have to

978
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:48,368
do here is what we'd have to do is say

979
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:52,028
all right let's assume that you're going

980
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:54,729
to take these these things together we

981
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:56,889
would need to for every value pair that

982
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:59,318
you put in we'd first have to see

983
00:39:56,889 --> 00:40:02,199
whether they were a greater than 180

984
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:06,009
degrees apart and if they were we have

985
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:07,749
to like flip one of them right so in

986
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:09,309
other words flip is probably the wrong

987
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:12,998
word but basically what we need to say

988
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:15,429
is okay this is more than 180 degrees

989
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:19,988
apart so really this guy should not be

990
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:25,349
whatever angle he is he should be a 300

991
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:25,349
do you know he should be 360 degrees

992
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:31,808
plus whatever he was right so let's say

993
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:33,670
he was you know 10 degrees or something

994
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:35,679
like this but these guys are more than

995
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:38,679
360 degrees apart well I should go ahead

996
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:40,298
and map him by adding right that 360

997
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:42,099
degrees in there right or the other way

998
00:40:40,298 --> 00:40:44,679
I could do that is say the input when it

999
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:47,259
comes in if it's more than I'm going to

1000
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:48,939
go ahead and subtract 360 degrees from

1001
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:50,349
it which would bring it to be this would

1002
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:54,879
be negative 60 degrees which would make

1003
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:56,650
him mad zero closer again right so we

1004
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,509
need a little comparator in there and

1005
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,900
the only way that we would know how to

1006
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:03,130
do that comparison is if we knew / ID

1007
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,410
which ones are periodic and which ones

1008
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,449
weren't and that is kind of what I mean

1009
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:09,969
when I say we might need different

1010
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:11,528
comparison functions now at the moment

1011
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:13,719
it's totally fine because what we're

1012
00:41:11,528 --> 00:41:15,400
doing is we're just matching on a single

1013
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,438
value that kind of is set to something

1014
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,028
or it isn't but when we start talking

1015
00:41:17,438 --> 00:41:20,588
about those values that are going to be

1016
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:21,818
sort of periodic like that that's

1017
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:23,558
something that we have to think about in

1018
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:25,449
I don't know how many of these we would

1019
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:27,459
have but at the very least we know that

1020
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,349
many things will probably have a facing

1021
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,969
direction and that facing direction is

1022
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:34,829
definitely periodic right there's no

1023
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:34,829
question about that so

1024
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:41,349
that suggests to me that this is

1025
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,050
something that we would want to add

1026
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:48,130
that's just seems like what we would

1027
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:52,410
need right so I don't know let's go

1028
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:54,700
ahead and let's go ahead and try that

1029
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:57,339
let's get let's go ahead and play around

1030
00:41:54,699 --> 00:42:00,069
with that a little and see where we

1031
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,550
where we end up right so what I'm going

1032
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:05,230
to do here is I'm going to say okay

1033
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:07,900
let's go to handmade intrinsics I don't

1034
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:10,179
know if we have any tan too we do so the

1035
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,639
ATM to would let me get back with that

1036
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:14,679
angle actually is so what I could do

1037
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,170
here is say change to using the

1038
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:18,909
acceleration vector what i could do is

1039
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:21,490
say all right if that's what we wanted

1040
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:24,659
to do we can go ahead and say you know

1041
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:28,739
entity facing direction equals a tan too

1042
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:31,359
and it's going to be dpy DPX like so

1043
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:32,799
that's going to be that facing direction

1044
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,410
and I'm going to change that to now be a

1045
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,090
floating point value and this is just

1046
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:43,629
going to be else right so yeah something

1047
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:46,030
like that right so if I do that I need

1048
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:48,160
to go grab that facing direction and

1049
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:50,140
make that into something that's that's

1050
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,109
actually going to be a floating point

1051
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:55,809
value like so and now the facing

1052
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:57,309
direction is actually an angle and so

1053
00:42:55,809 --> 00:43:00,369
what I'd want to do is is actually

1054
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:03,250
specify these guys in the asset when I

1055
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:05,519
in the asset system when I actually and

1056
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:09,400
I won't need this cast anymore as well

1057
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:12,039
so so in the asset system what I want to

1058
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,990
do now is I want to change these to be a

1059
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:22,279
you know basically like you know angle

1060
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:27,469
right angle back

1061
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:32,960
angle left oops angle front something

1062
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:36,500
like that right so you know 0.0 F with

1063
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:41,570
angle right one point of F with angled

1064
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:46,599
back a two-pointer left with angle left

1065
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:48,650
and three point i left with angle front

1066
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:51,489
and so then i can just go ahead and

1067
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:55,430
define these angle right is I was 200

1068
00:43:51,489 --> 00:44:00,729
angle back is going to be a half pie

1069
00:43:55,429 --> 00:44:03,109
right angle left is going to be just pie

1070
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:06,679
in fact I could just make these all in

1071
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:08,930
terms of pies so on or do people like

1072
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:12,859
tau better I know a lot of people liked

1073
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:16,219
a better do we have a pie 32 or tau does

1074
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:22,370
anyone know do we have a tau what do we

1075
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:25,279
have do we have any of these at all can

1076
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:29,029
we seriously not even have a pie there

1077
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:35,840
it is there's our pie all right one

1078
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:39,410
point omf pie 32 + 1.5 f pi 32 all right

1079
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:42,260
so there's our angles they're in radians

1080
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:45,259
that's why it's a nope I half pi 1 pi

1081
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,600
1.5 pie as we go around the circle those

1082
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,540
specified now and so in theory this

1083
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:57,969
should probably maybe it will work I

1084
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:57,969
don't know so

1085
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:17,210
almost but not for down down does not

1086
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:23,890
work which is interesting to say the

1087
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:23,889
least I'm not entirely sure I know why

1088
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:41,179
yeah yeah I don't know why that would be

1089
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:45,079
messed up necessarily but it definitely

1090
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:48,559
likes to pick the the wrong facing

1091
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,980
direction there for our front guys and I

1092
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:54,860
am not exactly sure why that would be

1093
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:56,389
that is something because I you know I

1094
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,750
discussed the matching bug there but

1095
00:45:56,389 --> 00:46:02,839
that's matching that bug would only

1096
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:05,269
affect things that were sort of closer

1097
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,920
calls but down should match pretty much

1098
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:11,259
exactly and we that's not really a

1099
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:15,380
periodic issue or anything like that so

1100
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:17,540
yeah that's that's very weird and it

1101
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,789
looks like left is not working properly

1102
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:25,219
at the moment either so we got some

1103
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:27,460
weird got some weird stuff happening

1104
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,459
here

1105
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:35,769
yeah so I want to take a look at what's

1106
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:37,269
going on there to die so i'm going to

1107
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:40,210
take a look at first the entity facing

1108
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:43,150
direction stuff to see what that is

1109
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:48,730
actually going to be equal to velocity

1110
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:49,869
wise i guess i could also yeah that's

1111
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,090
what i'm going to do first I just want

1112
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:55,809
to take a look and see why it doesn't

1113
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:57,550
change at all so let's go ahead and take

1114
00:46:55,809 --> 00:47:00,039
a look at that first I want to see what

1115
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:05,769
we're actually getting here so let's

1116
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:09,730
take let's go ahead and open up file we

1117
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:18,039
want handmade sim region and I want to

1118
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:19,090
see see here I want to see you know what

1119
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:20,619
I don't even care i'm just going to

1120
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:28,780
search for a tattoo because that's got

1121
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:30,550
to find it there we go um alright I kind

1122
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,440
of was not expecting my aunt any

1123
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:36,820
entities to have a velocity at the

1124
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:39,039
moment oh man and their d normals oh

1125
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,640
well we're still in debug build so let's

1126
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,849
go ahead and turn that off first of all

1127
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:52,179
so we can view everything appropriately

1128
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:56,889
like so okay it's so much slower in in

1129
00:47:52,179 --> 00:48:01,179
debug mode it's crazy alright so here we

1130
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:05,039
go right I'm moving downwards now I flip

1131
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:10,589
over break in here let's take a look

1132
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:15,029
entity our DP is this the hero it is

1133
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:19,480
negative e so there's really no xcountry

1134
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:22,930
large y component negative 1.4 so that's

1135
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,750
that's a pretty huge negative Y so I

1136
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:27,399
would expect the entity facing direction

1137
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,739
to come out to be something reasonable

1138
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:35,440
here let's actually see if it does

1139
00:48:29,739 --> 00:48:40,779
negative 1.57 and so let's see what that

1140
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:47,380
what 1.5 f times 3.14 5 is

1141
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:53,050
like so that is not what I would have

1142
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:55,840
expected maybe my math is so rusty that

1143
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:59,680
I just am totally forgetting how to use

1144
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:05,140
my a tan to properly do I actually need

1145
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:08,769
to normalize these guys first I didn't

1146
00:49:05,139 --> 00:49:10,929
think that would have been the case so

1147
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:13,739
why would we come out so this is what

1148
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:18,309
actually would be facing downwards oh

1149
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:19,839
duh right so this is actually the

1150
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:22,150
periodic matching problem that I was

1151
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,610
just talking about never mind these are

1152
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:28,990
just right it just gave us the negative

1153
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:33,309
angle duh cuz 8 am-2 doesn't do 0 to 360

1154
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:36,639
it does- 182 positive 180 so that's this

1155
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:39,519
actually is exactly the bug all right so

1156
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:42,639
yeah this is exactly the bug I guess I'm

1157
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,380
glad that I'm glad that it was what I

1158
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,469
said we were going to have to do but I'm

1159
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:49,050
not glad that I was too dumb to

1160
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:51,719
immediately know that that would happen

1161
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:55,420
so yeah if we wanted to fix this right

1162
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:58,209
we could also go ahead and and right

1163
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:00,930
afterwards do like an empty you know if

1164
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:04,659
nad facing direction is less than zero

1165
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:10,449
entity facing direction equal you know

1166
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:12,609
plus equals 360 right so pi 32 2.5 32

1167
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:18,579
something like this and that would you

1168
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:21,430
know correct it back down i believe so

1169
00:50:18,579 --> 00:50:26,079
that we could just verify that it's

1170
00:50:21,429 --> 00:50:29,679
working still in the janky ur way I'll

1171
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:31,829
have to turn that off alright so there

1172
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:31,829
we go

1173
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:39,950
yeah so yeah so we do have the bug and

1174
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:41,750
that's good because now we would like to

1175
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:43,069
go ahead and fix that right we'd like to

1176
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,469
make it so that that can match on the

1177
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,960
periodic boundary and that everything is

1178
00:50:45,469 --> 00:50:50,179
fine and you can kind of see even right

1179
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,730
there I get a nice bug where it's not

1180
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:54,739
quite matching with zero properly like

1181
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:56,449
he's still gonna until I give him a

1182
00:50:54,739 --> 00:51:00,409
little bit of upwards velocity he still

1183
00:50:56,449 --> 00:51:02,989
matches more closely with the down value

1184
00:51:00,409 --> 00:51:05,449
because his velocity is probably still

1185
00:51:02,989 --> 00:51:11,809
pretty small in terms of upwards

1186
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:14,059
velocity right yeah alright so we have

1187
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:16,250
exactly that problem I think we can

1188
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:17,599
probably wrap it up for today because I

1189
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,130
feel like we've done basically

1190
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,588
everything that I want to do and so

1191
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:23,240
talking about how we want to handle

1192
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:26,179
those variable types will be the thing

1193
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:28,009
that will do will start on tomorrow like

1194
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:30,379
meaning how we want to add the tag types

1195
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:31,670
so that'll be that'll be our goal for

1196
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,940
tomorrow we'll be adding the tactic so

1197
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:38,000
i'll put that bug back in there unfix

1198
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,349
now so that it's more blatant and that's

1199
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,989
exactly what we'll do tomorrow as well

1200
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:43,309
go ahead and work on getting that

1201
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:44,629
correct because it shouldn't be too much

1202
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:48,108
work but I don't want to start a lot to

1203
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:50,900
take this it's kind of a new system all

1204
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:55,029
right so that sounds good let me go

1205
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:58,070
ahead and go over to the Q&amp;A here see

1206
00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:00,230
there we go so if you have any questions

1207
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:01,820
on what we did please make sure you

1208
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:04,730
prefix your colon question with two

1209
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:08,080
colon and then I will be able to see it

1210
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,079
and answer it

1211
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:22,730
Abner cumbre says it's a bit delayed so

1212
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,940
bear with us very well I will bear with

1213
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,940
you

1214
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:42,799
you

1215
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,560
repeating the question for the pre

1216
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:01,460
stream or that's not on topic let's see

1217
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:03,349
robot chocolate Dino could all tag

1218
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,780
matching be periodic and then we just

1219
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:13,369
make the period really large when we

1220
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:18,830
don't want it to wrap you know I like

1221
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:21,429
the sound of that i you may be onto

1222
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:21,429
something there

1223
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,889
I need to think about that a little more

1224
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,059
I'll think about that and tomorrow we

1225
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:38,949
will talk about that when we go to

1226
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:40,619
implement it we might be able to do

1227
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:44,078
something like that where all the tags

1228
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:46,358
are handled uniformly but they have sort

1229
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:49,060
of parameters that let a single set of

1230
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:51,598
quick math functions give us a bunch of

1231
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:56,068
options to play with along those lines

1232
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,068
that's a good idea robot chocolate Dino

1233
00:54:02,068 --> 00:54:06,429
the hero has separate bit mess for your

1234
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,960
sprites will this be a recurring thing

1235
00:54:06,429 --> 00:54:10,690
for other kinds of sprites in the game

1236
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,099
yes lots of the sprites will have

1237
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:15,369
different pieces so that they can kind

1238
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:18,220
of be animated like bouncy and I mean

1239
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:19,300
obviously you know just like every game

1240
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:21,039
you're going to be able to like get

1241
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,420
different capes or stuff right and so

1242
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:24,880
you want to be able to swap out

1243
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,950
different capes if you get like a new

1244
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,170
Cape that's you know magical or

1245
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:33,309
something right so you want to always

1246
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:35,710
have the ability to to have more

1247
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:37,980
granular control over what you're

1248
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,980
drawing

1249
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:44,529
you

1250
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:51,730
from a scale of 1 to 10 how dumb do you

1251
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:54,670
think windows API is the answer is you

1252
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:56,619
can't assign a single number because it

1253
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,240
depends which AP are talking about some

1254
00:54:56,619 --> 00:55:01,119
of the colonel AP is are very well

1255
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,319
designed you know so are you talking

1256
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,000
about those are you talking about

1257
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:07,530
Windows Event tracing which is probably

1258
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,789
the worst API ever designed like ever

1259
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:11,680
you know and so I think the answer could

1260
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:13,360
be a one or it could be a 9 or a 10

1261
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,730
depending on which part of the windows

1262
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,010
api you're talking about so I think it's

1263
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:21,099
impossible to sign a single number and

1264
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:22,510
that is not surprising because it wasn't

1265
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:25,029
like the windows api was written by one

1266
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,710
dude right the windows api is written by

1267
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,970
many people over many years and some of

1268
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,130
those people were very very good at what

1269
00:55:27,969 --> 00:55:31,239
they did and their api is probably are

1270
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,640
the ones that we look at and go okay

1271
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:35,139
that's pretty good api and then other

1272
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:37,269
people who had no idea what they were

1273
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:38,949
doing wrote stuff and you know those

1274
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:48,460
aren't and so that's just the way it

1275
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:51,460
goes for the getting the angle you want

1276
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,949
couldn't you just divide the angle by 45

1277
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:57,220
giving you a number to switch on you

1278
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:59,379
could go go a step further and take the

1279
00:55:57,219 --> 00:56:01,779
modulus of the number of angles you want

1280
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:03,490
uh no I don't want to do that anymore

1281
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,890
because the idea here is now the engine

1282
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:08,619
should ask for things directly without

1283
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:11,170
doing that it should just say here's the

1284
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:13,269
actual angle and then whatever the art

1285
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:15,039
asset pack happens to have in it it will

1286
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:17,800
get back the closest match that way if

1287
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:24,309
you you know add more art sprites to it

1288
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:26,080
it just gets smoother tau is clearly the

1289
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:30,369
superior constant please remove every

1290
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:34,059
instance of Pi in the code I guess you

1291
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:39,849
feel very strongly about that if you if

1292
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:42,699
you really want the the PI stuff to go

1293
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:47,819
away do we have a good where is a good

1294
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:50,710
tau out too many digits give me a good I

1295
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:53,309
don't want to do 2 times pi because then

1296
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:56,440
I'll lose a bit of precision potentially

1297
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:58,269
so give me give me the value of tab how

1298
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,150
come Google doesn't have the value of

1299
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:04,389
tau

1300
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:06,130
just should not just come up you know

1301
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:15,159
they have all those little drop downs

1302
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:18,900
and things that come up let's see so do

1303
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:21,819
we think we trust this source see here

1304
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:27,670
there's some towel that's more tail than

1305
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:31,750
we need so handmade dot cpp h platform

1306
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:39,369
whatever so here we go time to fine I'll

1307
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:44,079
32 six-point some like so so

1308
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:49,510
there's some tau and if you want to we

1309
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:55,119
can go ahead and replace the places

1310
00:57:49,510 --> 00:58:03,430
where it makes sense let's see so here's

1311
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:06,369
tau tau tau tau so you cleaned up a

1312
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:10,358
bunch of two point I was there right Hey

1313
00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:11,829
look Tahoe that's why tau is better

1314
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:13,809
sometimes it's just because a lot of

1315
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:17,139
times you're talking about 30 60 degrees

1316
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:19,079
so it's just cleaner oh and look at that

1317
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:21,639
we already were doing one of those

1318
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:25,598
reentry sort of things to burn train

1319
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:27,779
right so there's that tau and then

1320
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:37,119
here's this Taos so we have tau 32

1321
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:39,750
tattoo right now 32 to 32 and that's

1322
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,750
probably it

1323
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:49,449
so yeah there you go

1324
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:59,969
what is your opinion on people who use

1325
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:02,429
spaces instead of tabs i think spaces

1326
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:05,219
are good I don't think tabs are a very

1327
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:07,230
good idea they're kind of a half

1328
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:08,879
implemented feature and usually when you

1329
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:11,420
try to use a half infinite feature it

1330
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,420
goes poorly

1331
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:29,909
why did you use a tangent of the angle

1332
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:35,519
for determining the asset so the reason

1333
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:38,549
is because what I need to do right what

1334
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:41,309
I have is I have a direction vector

1335
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:46,530
right and so this is my velocity right

1336
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:49,970
or DP as we call it right the Delta of

1337
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:52,470
my position so i know that vector and

1338
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:55,949
what I want to do is I want to be able

1339
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:58,199
to look up based on that I want to be

1340
00:59:55,949 --> 01:00:00,598
able to look up at aren't asset now I

1341
00:59:58,199 --> 01:00:02,129
don't want to look up the artists at by

1342
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:05,190
two independent numbers like I don't

1343
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:08,730
want to look it up by a DP DX and a DP

1344
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:10,889
dot why because I really only care about

1345
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:13,409
the direction this vector is heading I

1346
01:00:10,889 --> 01:00:15,210
don't care about its actual magnitude or

1347
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:17,068
anything like that right so what I

1348
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:20,429
wanted to do is I want to encode this

1349
01:00:17,068 --> 01:00:24,210
into one float right one floating point

1350
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:25,679
value and so the way I can encode the

1351
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:28,500
direction of vector and flowing x value

1352
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:30,088
is using an angle right obviously an

1353
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,730
angle is a really easy way I can just

1354
01:00:30,088 --> 01:00:35,460
say okay wherever this vector was I just

1355
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:39,088
wanted you to give me an angle that says

1356
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:44,429
how far off of you know off of the sort

1357
01:00:39,088 --> 01:00:47,369
of the x axis that is right so the way

1358
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:49,980
that you convert a vector into an angle

1359
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:53,789
is by using the arctangent right because

1360
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:56,250
if you look at what happens if i draw in

1361
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:58,858
some arbitrary vector here i know that

1362
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,780
the vector has an X component right and

1363
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:03,119
it has a y component and what I want to

1364
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:05,339
do is I want to find this theta right I

1365
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,740
want to find find out what theta is I

1366
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:09,838
want to know what that angle is well as

1367
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:13,798
you know from grade scroll trigonometry

1368
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:17,009
right tangent of theta is actually equal

1369
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:21,088
to this Y over this X right it's the

1370
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:24,510
sign over the cosine of that angle right

1371
01:01:21,088 --> 01:01:26,429
and so what I want to do is I want to do

1372
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:28,890
the inverse of that right I know the Y

1373
01:01:26,429 --> 01:01:30,539
in the X and I want the theta so instead

1374
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:32,460
of tan what I want to do is do the

1375
01:01:30,539 --> 01:01:34,529
inverse tangent right you could think of

1376
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,990
applying the inverse tangent function to

1377
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:39,990
both sides of this equation I

1378
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:45,299
get inverse tangent of tangent equals

1379
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:47,189
inverse tangent of Y over X right so

1380
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:50,300
inverse tangent and tangent cancel and I

1381
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:54,059
just get theta equals tangent inverse of

1382
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:57,510
Y over X right and so what I could do is

1383
01:01:54,059 --> 01:02:00,929
I could call 8am right I could say give

1384
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:02,430
me the a tan of Y over X I could I could

1385
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:04,829
do that right that's one way I could

1386
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:09,359
have done it but what happens there if i

1387
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:12,690
call a tan of the quantity y over x the

1388
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:14,880
problem is the signs disappear so i end

1389
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:17,130
up with you know if it was negative Y

1390
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,329
over negative x right and think about

1391
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,650
what these mean let me just draw them

1392
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:22,170
out for you just so you're totally clear

1393
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:25,050
on this right here's something with

1394
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:27,409
positive x positive Y right here's

1395
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:31,170
something with negative x negative

1396
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:33,449
positive Y right here's something with

1397
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:35,190
positive x negative Y and here's

1398
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:40,949
something with negative x negative Y

1399
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:43,099
okay all of these have exactly the same

1400
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:45,989
x and y values other than their sign

1401
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:47,880
okay all of these could be like you know

1402
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:49,829
this could be 1 comma 1 and this could

1403
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,750
be negative 1 comma 1 right and this

1404
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:55,469
could be negative 1 negative 1 and this

1405
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:57,869
could be one negative one okay so now

1406
01:02:55,469 --> 01:03:00,118
when I asked for the tangent well I

1407
01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:02,430
wanted two very different values here I

1408
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:05,280
wanted that value for this vector I

1409
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:09,029
wanted that value for this vector right

1410
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:13,260
I wanted that value or negative this

1411
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:16,019
value for that vector etc etc right but

1412
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,720
with a tan it would have no idea which

1413
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:21,480
one of those I met right if I passed it

1414
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,459
X a positive x over positive Y or

1415
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,769
negative x over negative why it's the

1416
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:28,740
same result the division is the same

1417
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:31,590
right negative 1 over negative 1 is 1

1418
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:33,569
and 1 over 1 is 1 they're the same so it

1419
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:36,690
has no idea which of these two vectors

1420
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:38,670
I'm talking about right so it just gives

1421
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:40,740
me back a representative angle that's

1422
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:43,200
what could have had that tangent and

1423
01:03:40,739 --> 01:03:45,299
it's the wrong actual angle for our

1424
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:48,779
purposes because we care about what

1425
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:50,960
quadrant the vector was in not just how

1426
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:53,460
much the deflection was off of

1427
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,960
access right because basically what

1428
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,909
that's doing is it saying well you know

1429
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,009
what I don't care whether you're talking

1430
01:03:56,909 --> 01:04:00,659
about this deflection off the negative

1431
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:02,400
access or this deflection of the

1432
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:03,868
positive axis I'm just going to give you

1433
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,970
back what the theta would have been in

1434
01:04:03,869 --> 01:04:07,410
either case that's not what i want i

1435
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:11,278
want you to differentiate between those

1436
01:04:07,409 --> 01:04:12,899
right so ATM two is a much more powerful

1437
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:14,699
and useful function for computer

1438
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:18,000
graphics because what it does is it

1439
01:04:14,699 --> 01:04:20,548
takes both the why and the x and it uses

1440
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,869
their respective signs to properly give

1441
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:27,000
you the angle that relates to the vector

1442
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:29,640
that you actually passed in and not just

1443
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,278
a example theta that would have worked

1444
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:36,808
for a deflection off of the closest

1445
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:39,650
access rather than the universal x axis

1446
01:04:36,809 --> 01:04:39,650
x positive axis

1447
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:55,150
how many spaces two three or four I use

1448
01:04:51,969 --> 01:04:57,069
four spaces for my indentations but you

1449
01:04:55,150 --> 01:05:06,910
know you should use whatever you want to

1450
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:08,380
use we implement asset loading priority

1451
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:09,969
for example the player should probably

1452
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:12,010
load first that you're not invisible in

1453
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:13,929
the beginning I don't know that will

1454
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:15,910
implement asset loading priority but

1455
01:05:13,929 --> 01:05:18,339
what we will do is will pre will

1456
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:19,960
prefetch stuff so what we'll do is we'll

1457
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,090
like try to start the asset loading

1458
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,590
happening long enough before we need

1459
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:27,450
assets to make it so that they don't

1460
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:27,450
they aren't missing when we need them

1461
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:36,309
would it be a good idea to switch to

1462
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,660
using matrices for rotation so further

1463
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:44,529
down the line it's easier to implement

1464
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:48,460
scale and transform um so I'm not sure

1465
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:51,490
what you mean by that right now we

1466
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:53,409
basically do use matrices we just never

1467
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:56,529
called them that like we have an x-axis

1468
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:57,609
and y-axis and they can be scaled and

1469
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:59,320
that's how we're doing rotations so

1470
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:03,280
we're not actually using angles for

1471
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,990
rotation if that makes sense if you're

1472
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,340
just talking about this encoding this is

1473
01:06:04,989 --> 01:06:09,189
just encoding for the asset lookup

1474
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:11,620
system and no I definitely don't think

1475
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:13,539
we should use matrices for the asset

1476
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:15,699
lookup system because then you're trying

1477
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:16,840
to match on four tags instead of one tag

1478
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:18,279
just to figure out what direction

1479
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,840
something's going which doesn't really

1480
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,150
make much sense especially because you

1481
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,039
probably want the scale and the rotation

1482
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:25,539
to be separate matching which means you

1483
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:26,769
don't want them to be miscible if you

1484
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:28,119
don't want them representing the same

1485
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:29,530
point you want separate quantities for

1486
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:32,460
how big something is versus what

1487
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:32,460
direction is facing

1488
01:06:39,949 --> 01:06:45,210
maybe this is something I missed out on

1489
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:47,099
but are using CMOS 8 into yes right now

1490
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:50,820
we have not replaced the sea runtime

1491
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:52,739
libraries math functions that's kind of

1492
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:57,059
a topic that I'm not sure what exactly

1493
01:06:52,739 --> 01:06:58,259
will do there I'll do it on stream but

1494
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:01,039
that's nothing going to be something

1495
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:03,870
that not everyone probably cares about

1496
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:07,079
but basically what we'll do is we'll go

1497
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:08,909
ahead for our 8am two will actually

1498
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:12,960
implement a little mathematical guy who

1499
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:17,009
does the atan2 in simdi right so

1500
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:19,199
probably you know it'll do a four wide

1501
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:20,910
atan2 probably as well I don't know if

1502
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,679
we'll ever actually care about that but

1503
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:26,539
really like our 8 am-2 will probably

1504
01:07:22,679 --> 01:07:26,539
operate on four values at once as well

1505
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:37,440
all right so due to e3 looks like it's

1506
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:41,699
probably a slow day I'm guessing at what

1507
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:43,710
happened why does my weird my hex chat

1508
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:45,779
says there are no operators on the

1509
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:48,590
channel and there's only one person the

1510
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:56,780
channel which is me and yet I see stuff

1511
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:59,930
streaming by so yeah anyway so I think

1512
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:04,680
now would be a good time to call it and

1513
01:07:59,929 --> 01:08:07,259
yeah we'll be back tomorrow still in the

1514
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:09,750
middle of III madness I'm sure but we'll

1515
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:11,160
be back tomorrow to go ahead and talk

1516
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:13,590
about how we want to do periodic

1517
01:08:11,159 --> 01:08:15,690
matching asset tags but it looks like

1518
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:17,789
things are going pretty well here that

1519
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:19,800
was pretty easy and now we've got a

1520
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:21,359
system where we can dump assets in that

1521
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,760
have properties and those properties we

1522
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:24,750
properly obeyed so that's a good thing

1523
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,250
so thank you everyone for joining me for

1524
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:27,270
another episode of handmade hero it's

1525
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,399
been a pleasure coding with you as

1526
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:30,930
always if you would like to follow along

1527
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:32,099
with a source code at home you could

1528
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:33,720
always pure to the game and it comes

1529
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,690
with the source code you can do that at

1530
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,770
handmade here org and then you can go

1531
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:41,338
ahead and download it every night after

1532
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:42,750
I'm done if you want to ask questions we

1533
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:44,130
do have a place for that there's a forum

1534
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:46,680
site which has a place to ask questions

1535
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:48,359
i answer and other people answer on

1536
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,039
there it's also got ports to mac and

1537
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,750
linux from the members of the community

1538
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:52,640
so if you're trying to do that follow

1539
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,960
along an anon window

1540
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,760
platform that's a good good thing to

1541
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,380
start with there's also a patreon page

1542
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,390
you want to support this video series

1543
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,369
that's a very nice thing to do and we

1544
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:03,140
have a subscription there you can you

1545
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:04,220
can pledge to and we also have a tweet

1546
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,020
bought that tweet the schedule do so if

1547
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:09,110
you want to catch the series live that's

1548
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:11,240
the thing to check out for now have fun

1549
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:12,799
with all of the e3 craziest that's going

1550
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:15,769
on I hope see you guys back here

1551
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:18,199
tomorrow same time same place 5 Pacific

1552
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:22,970
5 p.m. pacific daylight time on twitch

1553
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:24,260
and and yeah we'll be right back with

1554
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:25,850
our asset stuff which seems to be going

1555
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,110
pretty well so I feel like we should

1556
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,300
probably be able to wrap it up fairly

1557
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:31,670
quickly and maybe we can spend the rest

1558
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:33,020
of the week just looking at how we want

1559
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:34,850
our asset files to be structured and

1560
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:39,010
stuff like that so thanks everyone for

1561
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:39,010
tuning in and I will catch you tomorrow
