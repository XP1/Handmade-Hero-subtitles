1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,778
all right hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,820
handmade hero the show where we

3
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,949
temporarily are not actually coding game

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,929
from scratch because I am on RS I leave

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:19,039
at the moment problem hands what can you

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,089
do something's got to solve it

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,789
unfortunately I don't know enough about

8
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:26,429
neurological things to fix it but

9
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,300
hopefully it will get better and we'll

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:34,049
see anyway point being while I am on

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,359
sort of a no typing hiatus I do however

12
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:37,709
feel like it's worth streaming because

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,409
people have questions and I can answer

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,149
those questions so we've got some and

15
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:49,229
I'm going to do exactly that so here's a

16
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,808
question that comes in from trev Newt

17
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,839
they said what are the pros and cons of

18
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:57,119
baking assets like images into your

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,420
executable rather than shipping them

20
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,488
separately and loading them dynamically

21
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:07,049
and what I would say about that is

22
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:09,329
really there's none I guess is what I

23
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,799
would say and so let me go over that

24
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:14,908
process a little bit for you if it just

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,250
to just to give you a little bit of a

26
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:25,770
feel for it so on the disk right here is

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:28,590
my executable right see if I can there

28
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:30,239
we go so here's my executable on the

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,829
disk so this is you know this is my this

30
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,899
is my hard drive here and on the disk

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,908
right I've got this executable and

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,899
basically the way this is structured

33
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,820
right is you know it's a bunch of binary

34
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,349
data but at the top there is some

35
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,179
information that says like what the

36
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,618
sections are and what kind of executable

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,868
it is and that sort of stuff that

38
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,819
windows it's a specific specific format

39
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,250
that windows uses to store its xq Dolson

40
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,500
and there's actually two of them there's

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,319
one for 32-bit X's and there's one for

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,078
64-bit xes so actually they kind of

43
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,898
revved the format in a pretty major way

44
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,250
when they went to 64-bit but anyway

45
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,810
that's neither here nor there point

46
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,909
being the XE has some information and

47
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,379
then it's got stuff usually they're

48
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,789
called like segments

49
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,979
they'll be called like the code segment

50
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:19,229
data segments things like this there's

51
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,209
pieces of this executable and in those

52
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:23,159
pieces of the executable the this thing

53
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,290
at the top there's often things that say

54
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,879
like what's what's there or you know

55
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:28,590
there'll be other things that affect it

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,030
like a relocation table that does

57
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,460
dynamic link loading that sort of thing

58
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,919
and so really all that we're talking

59
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,530
about here is if I want to store an

60
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:39,509
image does it go in another file right

61
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,159
so here is you know my image file over

62
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:44,069
here let's go in another file does it go

63
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,270
in the executable right so what's the

64
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:49,680
actual difference between these two

65
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:56,670
things okay one is a you know the

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:58,050
executable is already open right you

67
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:00,239
don't have to get a new handle to it

68
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,280
there's no chance it could fail there's

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,900
no chance that you can't read from it

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,060
right so it's sort of a little more

71
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,800
fault tolerant in the sense that it's

72
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,050
already open you know it's there and

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,390
it's already you know linked up to you

74
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,670
so getting the image out is you know a

75
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,439
basically a known quantity someone would

76
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:24,239
have to hack the executable to break

77
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:29,069
that right and number two is it might be

78
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:34,230
slightly faster in some cases right

79
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:36,750
because the the linker pre will pre

80
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,489
insert the offset to the image into your

81
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,340
code assuming that some of you compiled

82
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,140
into your code and so that you know

83
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,969
maybe it saves you a little bit of work

84
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,429
but we're talking like a little little

85
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,349
bit of work right like not probably

86
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,900
something you would ever care about so

87
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:57,269
okay yeah you know those are some pluses

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,950
but that's really about it on the whole

89
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,490
there really isn't much of a difference

90
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,509
so I I don't consider that a

91
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,180
particularly important thing now there

92
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,979
is one fringe benefit which is the user

93
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,780
can't screw up if the user wants to move

94
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,069
an executable and all the data is also

95
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,870
in the executable they can just move the

96
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,989
eggsy around and that works nowadays

97
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,060
users don't tend to do that anymore and

98
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,889
so they don't even really know about

99
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,449
executables you know most users they're

100
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,250
just kind of like running something

101
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,719
through steam or download something

102
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,639
through an app store or whatever so you

103
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,090
know it's even less important now that

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,500
it would have been in the past so let's

105
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:36,529
talk about perhaps a more interesting

106
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,529
issue which is do I want this or this

107
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,279
right so here's my image file right and

108
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:47,459
this maybe has a bunch of images in it

109
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,649
so maybe I've got a b c d e f or

110
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,989
something my images and then here i've

111
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:56,250
got the same images but they're in

112
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,780
separate files so let's talk about the

113
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:04,168
difference between basically like packed

114
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:06,259
files and separate files right so that's

115
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:08,430
a perhaps more interesting difference

116
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,800
than the executable one because the

117
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,840
executable one is like there's really

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,449
not that it's that there's not a lot of

119
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:16,739
compelling reasons why you ever would

120
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,829
care to put something a text readable

121
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,750
it's just not that necessary there's not

122
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:23,490
a lot of pros to it but there are some

123
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,279
pros and cons between these two and

124
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,639
that's actually worth noting and so the

125
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,739
reason for that is that a packed file

126
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,709
requires a lot less negotiation with the

127
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,680
operating system to use and that's

128
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,269
actually somewhat important every time I

129
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,788
want to load an image file from a

130
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:43,288
separate image every time I want to load

131
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,000
an image from a separate image file I

132
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:46,740
have to go through the operating system

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,538
and it has to do a tremendous amount of

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,990
work I'm going to pass you know like

135
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:53,189
filename dot PNG or something and it's

136
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,139
going to have to go through and figure

137
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:57,149
out okay what directory structure i'm

138
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,060
going in look for a match for this name

139
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,889
find that match open it up generate a

140
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,629
handle insert a thing into the handle

141
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,310
table you know like blah blah blah blah

142
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,589
blah blah blah there's a tremendous

143
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:12,509
amount of work that has to go on here

144
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:14,219
and when you're talking about having

145
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,110
hundreds or thousands of files that

146
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,419
might have to get open that's just a lot

147
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,830
of unnecessary traffic back and forth to

148
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,219
the operating system a lot of

149
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:24,779
unnecessary work in the operating system

150
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,690
that that really just did not need to

151
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:30,059
happen right it also limits the number

152
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,819
of options that you potentially have for

153
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,370
overlapping that because you know

154
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,360
something like an open call might not be

155
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,800
very easy to over

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,030
lap in terms of multi-threading you may

157
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,069
have to create a separate thread to

158
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:43,138
babysit the open call blah blah blah

159
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:46,310
blah blah there's there's a whole bunch

160
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,930
of extra stuff that happens here so

161
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,120
packed files there is a pretty good

162
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,490
argument for a packed file is very nice

163
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,288
because you open it once and then all

164
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,598
you have to ever issue to the operating

165
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:59,158
system from then on is just offset reads

166
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:00,209
you just say I want to read this much

167
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:03,629
from here just like we're doing in

168
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:07,049
handmade here and so having a small

169
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,699
number of large packed files is usually

170
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,829
a better idea for most operating

171
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,348
circumstances then lots and lots of

172
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:14,668
separate files and so typically when you

173
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:18,389
ship you want to go with something more

174
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:20,519
like this than something like this for

175
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,110
that reason and typically it's not too

176
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:30,688
hard to patch these if you want to patch

177
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:33,479
them you can design your pact file

178
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:34,468
format to allow easier patching or you

179
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:35,519
can do sort of some of the stuff we

180
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:37,259
don't have in here where you can just

181
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,109
allow it to drop in another pack file

182
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,520
and then maybe make some rules about how

183
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,169
pack files take precedence over each

184
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,459
other for example so then the things you

185
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:46,799
want to update or just in here or

186
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:51,689
whatever so there's a number of ways I

187
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,819
think that you could probably make

188
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,680
packing work just as easily I'm sorry

189
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,939
make patching work fairly easily in a

190
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,278
pack file if you're if you're just a

191
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,778
little smart about it than the

192
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:03,930
circumstance that you might see here

193
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:06,149
with the with the separate files we're

194
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,500
obviously patching works as easily as

195
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:10,918
possible there because you can always

196
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,709
just you know replace a particular file

197
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,508
but there's just a lot of drawbacks so I

198
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,739
would say typically you know you should

199
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,408
be able to sign your pack file format so

200
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,639
that patching isn't too hard so that

201
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:23,718
basically you know changing one thing

202
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,949
doesn't change the entire file right and

203
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:28,579
then and then I think pack files are

204
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,579
pretty clear choice

205
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,879
dracut once you return to coding episode

206
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,349
streams would you recommend new

207
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,250
followers tune in even though they

208
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,680
haven't caught up with everything the

209
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,809
archive uh that's really for you to

210
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,609
decide I mean basically people can watch

211
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,649
I would just recommend watching couple

212
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,839
streams seeing whether you get anything

213
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:58,019
out of it or whether it's just not

214
00:08:51,839 --> 00:09:00,660
useful for you to have you know whether

215
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,039
it's you know not useful for you to see

216
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,409
it if you're not all caught up or

217
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:09,870
whether it is so I would say it's

218
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:10,980
something that you probably have to you

219
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,709
know it's funny you'd probably have to

220
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,909
decide for yourself in so first I meant

221
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,828
using the built in windows voice

222
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:18,208
recognition stuff to primary okay that

223
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:19,948
would be kind of funny if we tried to

224
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:22,049
use voice activated programming to

225
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:30,149
program handmade hero we probably should

226
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:32,338
try that at some point do you think you

227
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,509
could create an in-depth video post on

228
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,620
iocp at some point in the near future

229
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:36,300
I'm having a bit of trouble

230
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,549
understanding their amazing us not

231
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,139
really I like I said I'm pretty full up

232
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:44,370
with work right now and not being able

233
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:47,039
to be uncertain about the cities of the

234
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,909
hands I I really can't do anything other

235
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,909
than what i'm doing right now

236
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:59,889
elvin good evening sensei so weird to be

237
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,778
called sensei I hope your hand is

238
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,309
feeling better today I salute your

239
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:04,659
positiveness in handling the situation I

240
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:06,039
would totally freak out if that happens

241
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:09,759
to me without programming I'm

242
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:12,069
practically useless yeah I mean I could

243
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,669
not agree more it's it really is very

244
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,620
very frustrating to me and it upsets me

245
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:21,669
because it's really all I need is for my

246
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:25,539
hands to function well hmm basically

247
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:28,360
like like you know from here up used to

248
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:30,099
be functioning well you know I could be

249
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,700
in a wheelchair and I wouldn't really

250
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,330
affect my enjoyment of life hardly very

251
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:42,460
much but losing use of a hand is pretty

252
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:44,200
devastating so you know it is hard to

253
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,009
keep a positive to keep a positive

254
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,190
outlook on it it's true and you know I

255
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:54,819
do what I can but it's it's a it's lame

256
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,080
it's really really lame and I wish

257
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:01,120
someone would solve these problems

258
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:04,060
because I feel like you know it's it's a

259
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,129
problem when we have people who are able

260
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:10,139
to program and want to program and are

261
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:15,189
slowed down or even stopped because of

262
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:18,159
stupid biomechanical problems like get

263
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,560
me a better interface to a computer why

264
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:25,449
am I even using these right it's just

265
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:27,399
dumb so yeah I wish they would sell hard

266
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:34,600
up and solve that so I could use

267
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:36,549
something else um let's see dan golf

268
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,009
after fiction technology what are some

269
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:41,919
candidates for other problems projects

270
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:43,838
worth your time um I haven't really

271
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,939
talked very much about anything after

272
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,280
that yet i would say that i'm trying not

273
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,290
to be too forward looking with things

274
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,149
like that because like I said especially

275
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:55,019
when you think about you know how easy

276
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,740
it is to be taken out of the game

277
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,120
interactive fiction is really the thing

278
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,169
that I would like to make sure that we

279
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,360
solve at Molly and if we do that i'll be

280
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:06,939
very satisfied and if I could still

281
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,360
program after that time then I'll pick

282
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,360
something else

283
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,539
pragma script will there ever be good

284
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,430
real-time global illumination I don't

285
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:21,110
know probably because it's a very

286
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:23,269
separable problem you know at the limit

287
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,769
you can have every you know pixel

288
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,740
rendered by a different computer and

289
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,980
then you can afford to do a full-on you

290
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,460
know ray trace I mean if you imagined

291
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,730
having you know a 64,000 core computer

292
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,870
or something it would scale relatively

293
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,909
well and then you would just basically

294
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,919
have the memory distribution problem

295
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:44,509
would be mostly what you'd have to deal

296
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,699
with is just how do they all access the

297
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:49,819
information so you know could it happen

298
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:53,060
probably i don't know how likely it'll

299
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:57,260
be aight i don't know but it could

300
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:59,059
happen it could happen proton gaming why

301
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:01,639
are companies so hard with junior

302
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:02,929
developers in the interview process make

303
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,159
it very difficult for unexperienced

304
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:08,539
coders who got a job probably because

305
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,370
there's just a lot of bad programmers

306
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:14,449
out there and they're nervous about it

307
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:16,909
and they don't know what to do to you

308
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,410
know they're misguided in their approach

309
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,029
to finding good programmers you can't

310
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,759
blame them for not wanting bat programs

311
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:27,079
but programmers are really bad to work

312
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:29,179
with and they ruin everything so you

313
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,070
know they're they're trying to not have

314
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,239
that happen and then the lowest part is

315
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,410
oftentimes they're actually bad

316
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,610
programmers so now you've got a bad

317
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:36,019
programmer who's thinking they're

318
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,220
preventing a bad parent for getting

319
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,340
hired but actually they're just a bad

320
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:45,560
programmer which is always hilarious but

321
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:47,240
you know what do you do x13 pixels is

322
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:51,769
Martin still putting the videos up on

323
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:54,769
BitTorrent sync I don't know what he's

324
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,779
doing I have no idea I still copy

325
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,480
anything i post to the YouTube I copy it

326
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,679
into the shared directory for him

327
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,570
whether he runs a bit torncek I don't

328
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:07,699
know he was doing that other goodness of

329
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:10,190
his heart and you know if he doesn't

330
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,980
want to do it anymore you know I don't

331
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,270
blame him but if someone does want to

332
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,970
take over that for him if he doesn't

333
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,970
want to do it anymore I I could get the

334
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,250
video I could set someone up else up so

335
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:29,259
they could get those videos

336
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:30,879
a junkie suited for you could try

337
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:32,889
something like Qigong Chinese health

338
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,360
exercise which could help with RSI and

339
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,580
creating good posture nice thought yeah

340
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,279
I actually I don't know about that

341
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,629
specifically but I do I am going to try

342
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,189
to work on we're trying to do one thing

343
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,419
a time here just for testing purposes

344
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,370
and just to be kind of like a little

345
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:48,279
more systematic but it but I am going to

346
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,779
try adding some exercise routines just

347
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,529
general exercise routines into my day

348
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,659
because that's something I really need

349
00:14:53,529 --> 00:15:00,220
to do anyway and I'll be trying to do

350
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:01,659
some of that for sure do you ever wonder

351
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,759
if a game you're playing will turn into

352
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:05,860
frog fractions to with a crazy twist I

353
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,259
find myself wondering this often no I

354
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,690
probably should be wondering that but no

355
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,819
i have not word one did that yet in

356
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,350
Janeiro for some reason i remember you

357
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,150
saying there were changes coming to

358
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,230
hammer here at org forums that i

359
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:22,539
remember correctly and do you have any

360
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:23,860
update on the current status um yes so i

361
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:25,959
am not making a change the handmade hero

362
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,820
forms it's just that the people who are

363
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,950
doing handmade dev wrote a bunch of

364
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,320
forum stuff that's in testing right now

365
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,870
and when they're happy with it the

366
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,360
handmade hero forums will kind of flip

367
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,100
over to those and they're a lot better

368
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,659
at least i thought they were you know

369
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,190
everyone has their preferences i'm sure

370
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:46,719
but the they're just they're just better

371
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,060
in my opinion and so it'll switch over

372
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,550
to that when they're ready and that's

373
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,889
not i don't i have nothing to do with

374
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:55,539
that process I just said it I don't like

375
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:58,088
running forums I don't like writing web

376
00:15:55,539 --> 00:16:00,129
things period so I just like if you guys

377
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,500
want to run the forums have them and

378
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:04,330
they were like yeah so they've got some

379
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,309
plan for that and I don't know when

380
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,460
that'll be but that's that's what that

381
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:08,459
is

382
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:16,099
Danny wag what is the Intel Architecture

383
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:19,639
Singh on your desktop oh this is from

384
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:23,959
earlier in the streams this thing are

385
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,609
you talking about or this one so I can

386
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,588
tell you what they both are they're both

387
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:30,559
very important and things you should

388
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:32,419
know so the Intel intrinsics guide is a

389
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:34,038
website that's awesome we use it on the

390
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:35,239
stream when we do optimization and

391
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:37,369
basically what it lets you do is search

392
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:40,099
for things like its search for the

393
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:41,720
instructions so if you don't know what

394
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:44,449
the intrinsic SAR intrinsics are

395
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,859
basically compiler things that tell the

396
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:47,618
compiler that you'd like it to generate

397
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:50,179
a specific assembly instruction for you

398
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:52,129
and so you can use that to access the

399
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:54,978
simdi instructions and among other

400
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,629
things on on Intel hardware and but

401
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,919
there's a lot of intrinsic SAT this

402
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:00,259
point and they get hard to remember

403
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:02,208
what's what and so you can use this is

404
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,639
pretty efficient you can check like I'm

405
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:06,168
programmed for sse2 that's my target so

406
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:08,928
I want to see like everything that's

407
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,759
that and below let's say and then you

408
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:13,429
can search like oh show me the functions

409
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:17,269
that have ad in them like so that has an

410
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:19,939
ad or something that has a load that

411
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,500
does right and it just makes it really

412
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,179
easy because there's just a lot of them

413
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,709
and it makes it really easy to kind of

414
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,980
come see what they all are so it's a

415
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,330
really nice it's a really nice resource

416
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,889
it was actually I didn't even know about

417
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:32,388
someone recommended it on stream when I

418
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:33,408
was looking them up manually and they

419
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:36,019
were like hey you know there's a great

420
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:38,570
web page design yeah there is so that

421
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:40,128
was pretty cool then the the intel

422
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:41,329
architecture manual this thing could

423
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:43,339
download you can download this from

424
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:45,888
intel's websites free it's a you know

425
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:48,798
it's a publicly available thing and what

426
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:50,508
this is is this is their manual for for

427
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,109
the x86 architecture which at this point

428
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:55,970
is the x64 architecture and what it's

429
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:58,219
got is basically all the information

430
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,500
that you need to know about how the

431
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,569
instruction set is meant to work so you

432
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,429
can go see like what the rationale for

433
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:06,740
these things is and how they were meant

434
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:08,538
to work and what how you know what their

435
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,819
general operating modes are all those

436
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:13,220
sorts of things there's even simps up in

437
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:14,658
here about you know like how the cpu

438
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,639
just generally does what it does with

439
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:20,059
the different the 64 verse 32 bit memory

440
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:22,158
model all that stuff right and so when

441
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,148
you're curious to learn how the chip

442
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,759
does what it does

443
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:30,528
um from a specification standpoint not

444
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,509
from a hardware standpoint because it's

445
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:34,398
not about that but from a specification

446
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,899
standpoint this is a great place and

447
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:37,308
it's got you know like the system

448
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:38,628
programming guide in here tells you

449
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:40,128
about stuff that you might want to know

450
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:42,769
if your program like an operating system

451
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:44,418
like how interrupts work those are not

452
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:46,759
things that users ever really deal with

453
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,109
but the OS programmers deal with so it's

454
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,308
just got a lot of great information and

455
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,989
something that everyone should be

456
00:18:49,308 --> 00:18:53,178
familiar with because it can answer a

457
00:18:50,989 --> 00:19:01,038
lot of questions for you if you have a

458
00:18:53,179 --> 00:19:03,528
specific question about the chip girl

459
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,509
and abloom have you ever been to GDC yes

460
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:10,278
the first GDC I attended was in 1997 and

461
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:18,019
I attended it up until about two

462
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:21,108
thousand two maybe three I don't know if

463
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:24,469
I went in three and i believe i went in

464
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:25,728
four and five to just just for hosting

465
00:19:24,469 --> 00:19:32,149
the programmers challenge i didn't

466
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:33,769
really do anything else but related

467
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:36,408
bloom why is all your such disaster even

468
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:40,788
on windows I don't know man people over

469
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:42,200
complicating things i I don't know the

470
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:44,479
same region all hardware is a disaster

471
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,249
is because the driver layer gets all

472
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:50,808
super complicated and people refuse to

473
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:53,210
keep things simple what you know I've

474
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:54,918
never been a device manufacturer I never

475
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,269
worked at NIH p I don't know how it gets

476
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,979
out of control i think it's like bad

477
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:00,259
decisions on microsoft side bad

478
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:02,479
decisions on the HD side they can pound

479
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:04,159
they grow and compound and people get

480
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:05,778
bad ideas and then those bad ideas

481
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,820
become initiatives and you know it's

482
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:10,368
like suddenly you're looking at a USB

483
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:12,288
spec that's 700 pages long and there's

484
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:18,218
like 400 pages of audio spec and there's

485
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:18,219
like this is what like so i don't know

486
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:24,869
huber caleb don't install our programs

487
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,920
typically bake information about the

488
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,569
program they are installing into the

489
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,050
eggsy is that how its lawyers are

490
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:34,649
typically done on the windows yes so

491
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:36,000
typically what happens and and I could

492
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,310
show you guys how to do this it's it's

493
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,660
not hard in fact that you if you've

494
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:44,819
watched the series you already pretty

495
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:47,029
much know house so there's two ways you

496
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:51,089
can actually approach this this problem

497
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:52,740
and and that is like okay so you know

498
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:54,389
that you've got the linker right we've

499
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,109
talked about this way way back the early

500
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:01,650
days of handmade hero and so what

501
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:03,479
happens is into the linker you're and

502
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,540
you're shoving a bunch of like obj files

503
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,960
right and the linker is going to output

504
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,789
an executable okay just like the kind we

505
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,279
just talked about and so we've got these

506
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:16,259
obj files there but it can also grab

507
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,910
resource files right it can grab stuff

508
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,069
like images or whatever and it can link

509
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,870
them in and so like the windows has like

510
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:23,759
the resource compiler it produces res

511
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:26,189
files with like of your icons or things

512
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,140
like that so you can get data in there

513
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,700
even if the data wasn't in an object

514
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,500
file you can actually package in other

515
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,910
things and then the linker outputs an

516
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,799
executable that has that stuff in

517
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,090
Microsoft format with tables that say

518
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,430
where it is and blah blah blah blah blah

519
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:42,869
blah right great whatever however

520
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:45,330
there's another thing you could do which

521
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,439
is once you have your executable let's

522
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:48,329
say you just make an executable with

523
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,340
this process you don't put anything else

524
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:52,649
in it it's just code and now you're like

525
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,730
well is there any way I could put a

526
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,550
bunch of data in there like for example

527
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,130
if this was an installer could I put all

528
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,389
the data all the install packages and

529
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,710
the executable that I'm actually

530
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,700
installing could I just shove all that

531
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,470
stuff in there because the neck see

532
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,150
obviously those installer packages are

533
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,190
just one x z so how does that work and

534
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,620
the answer is yes absolutely trivial

535
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,240
trivial this it's super super stupid

536
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:14,369
simple the dumbest thing you could have

537
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,370
possibly imagined all you have to do is

538
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:19,889
just take make a program you make a

539
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,209
little program you can even do this see

540
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,759
runtime library just a straightforward

541
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,890
basic C program doesn't even require any

542
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:29,009
Windows platform layer nothing just a

543
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,490
basic c program can do it all you do is

544
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:34,759
you f read your executable right so you

545
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:37,680
read this into memory

546
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:41,309
very straightforward you then open a new

547
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:46,049
file you know some new XE that you

548
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:47,700
create and UF write it boom okay so now

549
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:51,539
I've ever written this out I took my old

550
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,809
executable I wrote it here then I F read

551
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:58,500
my data files that freedom one at a time

552
00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:00,899
and i append them so now my eggsy just

553
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,460
grows and grows i just add on to the end

554
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,220
add on to the end add on to the end

555
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,319
right so I'm just f writing I f read in

556
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,910
a new file I f write it so I just F read

557
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,490
every file on my distribution and I

558
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:14,400
afraid it to the end until I have a

559
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,890
giant executable where the first part is

560
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,160
my executable and everything that comes

561
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:24,509
after it are all my data files right

562
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:28,560
make sense then what I do is at the very

563
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:31,079
last thing I put a footer and the footer

564
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:36,119
is just like our header for our asset

565
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:38,730
tables but at the end then when the

566
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,159
executable loads the executable that I

567
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,870
actually wrote this one here all it

568
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,759
needs to do is when I wrote it it just

569
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:47,879
needs to have up some code in it that

570
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:51,410
opens its own self it's just F opens

571
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:54,930
itself right and looks at the last n

572
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:57,509
bytes reads the footer out of the last n

573
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,370
bytes that footer just has the whole

574
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:01,019
directory structure everything it needs

575
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:03,089
to grab stuff out and then it just uses

576
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:05,190
that as its asset pack file from now on

577
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:07,199
right so you can actually just do that

578
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,309
if you want to write and you can build

579
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,569
in the slaughter that way or you can

580
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:10,889
build a game that way that's just an

581
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:13,649
executable with a bunch of files you

582
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:17,070
just totally do that there's no reason

583
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,360
to really what you can and if you're

584
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:22,250
trying to make an installer then you do

585
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,250
have a very good reason to and you could

586
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:39,990
uh q colon is making an interesting game

587
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,028
AI considered a very hard problem or are

588
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,700
people just lazy I see most games come

589
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:48,750
with terrible AI these days why does it

590
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,528
seem we're going backwards um I'm really

591
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,599
the wrong one to answer that question

592
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:54,089
not because I couldn't say some things

593
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,558
about it game AI but actually because I

594
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:59,548
just don't play that many games that are

595
00:24:55,558 --> 00:25:02,629
AI centric in that way you know like if

596
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:05,660
you're talking about why can't I play

597
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,400
a wire the enemy players in like

598
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,810
civilization five stupid or something

599
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,100
I'd be like I don't know because I never

600
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,539
played sinless civilization five so I

601
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:19,009
I'm afraid I can't give you a whole lot

602
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:22,430
of I got nothing useful to say I got

603
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:23,960
nothing garland abloom is there any

604
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:27,340
difference between xing installers and

605
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,660
msi installers yes I believe there is

606
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:32,149
eggsy installers are actually code

607
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,470
that's actually running that's it's just

608
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,140
running the code that's at the front of

609
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,059
that file and MSI installer actually

610
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,800
requires windows to do the installation

611
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:42,019
so it's more like a data file if I

612
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,589
remember correctly it's not actually

613
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:47,660
it's not self it doesn't contain

614
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:49,970
everything in and of itself which is why

615
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,380
they often don't work like I've had tons

616
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,549
Emma sighs the judges actually don't

617
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,050
straight up don't work because the

618
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:55,639
Machine didn't have the right stuff

619
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:58,849
installed to run the msi which is

620
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,290
hilarious so yeah msi's i think are

621
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:02,569
actually a lot more error-prone than

622
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:04,180
eggs ease because they actually aren't

623
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,919
just a self-contained thing that works

624
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:10,250
they're like this weird microsoft hybrid

625
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,470
thing that requires microsoft's code to

626
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,650
do the right thing with it that's my

627
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:18,289
recollection anyway that said I don't

628
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:22,009
really remember this the specifics of it

629
00:26:18,289 --> 00:26:24,700
so maybe that's complete nonsense that's

630
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:24,700
my recollection

631
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:31,839
really 91 I'm a doctor but couldn't it

632
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,788
be that the wrist braces you are using

633
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,878
you use actually make your muscles in

634
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:40,869
that part weaker uh yes it definitely

635
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:42,428
could be and what I can say is that the

636
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:45,038
wrist braces were very effective for

637
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:48,399
most of my life like 10 years or so of

638
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,970
programming and so I know that they were

639
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,558
very good for a certain set of things

640
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,169
but they may not really have been a

641
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,538
great idea and maybe I should stop using

642
00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:01,210
them and that is one thing that we will

643
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:02,740
be testing I think what I may for all I

644
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,110
know the only thing they really did for

645
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,878
me to was keep my hands warm and so one

646
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:08,199
thing I was thinking is going to just a

647
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:09,788
hand warmer thing because sometimes that

648
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,960
helps with like arthritic tens and I see

649
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:17,919
things is to keep it warm and so we'll

650
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:21,850
see but yes it is absolutely possible I

651
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:28,840
don't know if it's likely or probable

652
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:30,428
but yes Gary Johansson possibly to to

653
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,898
give a question but is there an ideal no

654
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,940
strategy to make a natural language

655
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:36,008
processing system eg you type english

656
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:41,080
and that parses into actions that are

657
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:46,089
enacted by a program um I am NOT up on

658
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:47,230
the state of the art I used to be about

659
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:51,778
10 years ago I couldn't told you a

660
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:55,139
better answer the answer used to be that

661
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:58,000
the current best stuff was statistical

662
00:27:55,138 --> 00:28:01,418
so the best stuff that they had for

663
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,278
processing natural language was they

664
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:08,590
would take giant corpuses of language

665
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:10,500
that had been annotated so example

666
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:12,878
there's a wall street journal corpus

667
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,558
that has like tons and tons and tons of

668
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:17,500
wall street journal articles that have

669
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:19,839
been hand annotated by linguists with

670
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,509
what the parts of speech were and stuff

671
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,668
like this and so they were able to do

672
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:26,740
statistical using that as sort of like a

673
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:29,169
date of mine they were able to do

674
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,599
statistical analyses on it to like help

675
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:33,460
inform the decisions because the problem

676
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,079
with parsing English right is that you

677
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,308
end up with the situation where you kind

678
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,408
of need world knowledge to make the

679
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:39,579
right decision and programming the world

680
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:41,080
knowledge in is hard

681
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,699
and so they were using statistics to

682
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,009
kind of overcome that they were saying

683
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,390
well if it usually means this then in

684
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:47,980
the presence of these other things then

685
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,710
i'll soon then that's the truth blah

686
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,210
blah blah right and so that used to be

687
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,170
whether that's the case now I don't know

688
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,170
I haven't looked at it in a while

689
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,490
caricature Hanson we could do an

690
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,009
experiment where you tell us what to

691
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,019
make a new review we could that's not a

692
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:07,450
bad idea that's not a bad idea we'll see

693
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:09,430
what happens like i said i'll try maybe

694
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,990
to you know this week and next week

695
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,519
we'll do you know will do no typing

696
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,779
streets with them well i'll see I'm

697
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,940
hoping maybe at that point I'd be ready

698
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:23,589
just to start going again but if I'm not

699
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:25,539
then we'll we'll get more creative sss

700
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:28,359
McGrath have you spoken to chris

701
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:30,609
crawford about it i'm assuming that the

702
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:35,469
it is interactive fiction technology I

703
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:37,659
don't know and the answer is yes I did

704
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:49,269
speak to him about it I spoke to him

705
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:50,800
about it in 1999 I want to say and while

706
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:53,289
there is a gigantic story there that I

707
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,440
will probably tell someday let's simply

708
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:58,990
say that key and I share literally zero

709
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,400
of the same opinions about how

710
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:05,920
interactive fiction technology should

711
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:08,259
work like literally zero and I'll leave

712
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,880
it at that imminent threat how would you

713
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:11,559
describe your learning curve over your

714
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,270
decades of program experience for me no

715
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,159
matter how long I do something I always

716
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:17,589
seem to look back to where I was a year

717
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:22,420
before and feel like there was much less

718
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:27,939
competent version of myself um I would

719
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:30,789
say that's very accurate yes uh yeah I

720
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,950
mean I would agree with that basically

721
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,589
what I have found is that it probably

722
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,650
looks a little something like this for

723
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:37,649
me

724
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,640
we're like you you sort of grow very

725
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,830
rapidly for a time and then at some

726
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,830
point you hit like a language asymptote

727
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:58,310
which is like you're never going to get

728
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,379
any better than C++ like forget it C++

729
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:04,339
is just fundamentally limited and so

730
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,140
it's just a problem right and so to

731
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:09,379
really like the next time I'll be able

732
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:13,670
to do this again again soon in my hands

733
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:16,280
hold out is is one I fully switch over

734
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,170
to my own stuff because right now I have

735
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,119
like a hybrid better programming thing I

736
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,430
feel like when I finally switch over to

737
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:25,129
something that's completely custom no

738
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:27,080
more C++ i'll be able to do this again

739
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:29,570
but until then I think I'm pretty much

740
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:35,659
just like this is the c++ standards

741
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:37,279
committee right being basically

742
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,320
preventing me from ever getting any

743
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:50,480
better because they won't give me

744
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:52,789
anything useful to use have you played

745
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,870
starship titanic i thought that had

746
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:56,809
quite a cool interactive conversation

747
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:59,809
thing especially for a 1998 game I don't

748
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:01,069
think so insofar as I may have missed

749
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:05,119
that one because it doesn't ring a bell

750
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:06,859
and I try to play that's that's maybe a

751
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,429
little late for my time which may be why

752
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:12,259
I missed it could you send me a link to

753
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,700
that email me a link to that if you get

754
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:16,369
a chance if it's like on gog or

755
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,470
something i'll go check it out elvin

756
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:20,629
related to the question about embedded

757
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,220
resources versus external ones I had an

758
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,440
idea of using a meta program to load a

759
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,180
model during a preprocessor step and

760
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,440
spit out the code that assigns of

761
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:36,440
vertices directly to an array etc do you

762
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:39,590
think that's useful in any way um not

763
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:44,710
really because the code necessary to do

764
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:46,759
that is going to be a lot more uh oh

765
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,079
well if you're just talking about trying

766
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:49,759
to bake it in then yeah it could be

767
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,439
useful i mean people do that for fonts

768
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,579
right if you're talking about baking it

769
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,250
into the executable by put

770
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:56,960
in an array yeah if you want that model

771
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,009
to just be in your code for some reason

772
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,960
where you don't want to load it out of a

773
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,788
file ever and you want it to just sort

774
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,829
of get loaded as part of the executable

775
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:05,269
maybe for reliability purposes so you

776
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:07,369
know it can never get separated it

777
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:09,500
always has to be there for some reason

778
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:12,288
people did with fonts like the font that

779
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,769
you need to use say to print out can't

780
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:17,269
load asset file for example might need

781
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:19,220
to be baked into the executable because

782
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:20,538
what if you can't let the asset file you

783
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,308
can't get a font out of it to display

784
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:25,429
the error message that says that you

785
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:26,569
can't load the font right so if you're

786
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,460
not a system like windows where you

787
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:30,408
could just use a message box or

788
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,940
something and have windows deal with it

789
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:33,139
if you're on some platform where you

790
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,639
have to do everything yourself you could

791
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:36,528
see why you might need to bake something

792
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:40,119
in because if the asset fells not there

793
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:40,119
how do you report it at that point right

794
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:47,809
see voucher might be jumping the gun

795
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,009
since we haven't gotten the shaders but

796
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm having trouble with them in my

797
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:52,759
renderer am I supposed to save the

798
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,250
attributes and shader programs across

799
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:57,349
draw calls or reinitialize each time

800
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,730
seems like you went to a lot of trouble

801
00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:00,469
to remove the transient arena from the

802
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:04,069
OpenGL renderer so things can't be

803
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,240
pushed from there so i guess i'm not

804
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:08,539
sure exactly what you're asking in

805
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,119
opengl there's there's more than one way

806
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:13,940
that it happens there's things called

807
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,169
SSB OS there's things called ubos and

808
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:21,648
there's things that are just uniforms

809
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:23,690
and the answer to what your how it's

810
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:24,888
going to work depends on that if you're

811
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:29,559
just talking about setting uniform

812
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:32,030
variables then the shader program oh

813
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:35,289
wait are you talking about actually

814
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,290
there's the program handle

815
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:43,230
I'm not sure what you're talking about

816
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,760
but I guess what I would say here is

817
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,800
what you want to do for shaders is they

818
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,389
need to be saved so they are going to be

819
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,399
an asset class and what I would say is

820
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,588
you're going to have to wait till we do

821
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,500
our final pass because we got to go do

822
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:58,059
our texture download stuff that way that

823
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,619
that works will probably be roughly how

824
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:02,920
the shaders should work meaning it's

825
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:05,740
stored it is stored and you only want to

826
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,510
build the shader once attributes you

827
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:10,059
have to switch often so you can't

828
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:11,140
necessarily build those in but if you're

829
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:12,940
talking about just the attribute

830
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:14,079
locations and yeah all that chefs forget

831
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,809
stored you only want to do it once

832
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,130
because it doesn't change sorry I think

833
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:19,239
I got confused I wasn't sure what you're

834
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,858
asking I think I know what you're asking

835
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:23,799
now the answer is yes you want to save

836
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:26,650
it because it costs compiling costs a

837
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,450
lot so you don't once you want to allow

838
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,710
the GL to compile your shader once you

839
00:35:28,449 --> 00:35:32,098
don't want to do it every frame that's

840
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,099
real bad

841
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:51,940
so what PDF figure is that that is

842
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:54,909
sumatra PDF all right only two minutes

843
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:59,920
left here two minutes left what do we

844
00:35:54,909 --> 00:36:02,529
got elven why is it and c++ that people

845
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,809
always like to do many compilation units

846
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,048
one for each CPP file is it just because

847
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:16,660
of how vigil to your bill works um I

848
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:18,759
don't know I really don't I think it's

849
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:20,338
cuz of a misguided impression that

850
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,890
keeping things separated by file

851
00:36:20,338 --> 00:36:27,308
logically per class has some kind of

852
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:28,328
conceptual purity to it but really all

853
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:34,150
they're doing is making their build

854
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:36,099
times awful so having lots of files is

855
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,660
something you only do if you haven't

856
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,619
actually sat down to do the work of

857
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:42,368
figuring how to make your turnaround

858
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:46,059
time low in my opinion and keeping your

859
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:47,769
build working efficiently because even

860
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:50,260
if you want to do incremental

861
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:54,280
compilation you don't want them that

862
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,900
small because you almost always when you

863
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,640
touch a header file end up having to

864
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:04,298
compile multiples of them right and so

865
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:06,308
it it's not a very good idea in my

866
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:07,780
opinion but yeah it's somehow it got

867
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:16,059
into people's heads and that's what they

868
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:17,470
do let's see Cuba Caleb won't antivirus

869
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:19,150
get finicky with you writing to the end

870
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:22,959
of an exit doesn't that also break code

871
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:24,579
signing so yeah i mean like i said i'm

872
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,460
not advocating that you do that i'm just

873
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:29,109
saying that you can antivirus programs

874
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,490
might get finicky with you writing to

875
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:32,108
the end of an XE but that's okay because

876
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:33,909
you're doing that or you're dead machine

877
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:35,558
you could just turn the antivirus off so

878
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:37,838
it's only the reading that happens on

879
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,609
the client side so that's fine as for

880
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,139
breaking code signing I don't know it

881
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:44,250
depends on the codes it depends on which

882
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,250
coats on you're talking about

883
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:04,089
let's see I'll take one more question

884
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:20,210
keeper caleb is it practical to roll

885
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:21,500
your own see runtime yes it is from what

886
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,849
I've gathered there seems to be a lot of

887
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,469
problems that sort of thing of course

888
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,239
mms has the audacity of shipping

889
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,889
compatible versions of the CRT on

890
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,229
different versions of Windows anywhere

891
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:32,599
comes to this ah static linking solves

892
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,210
that problem for you that's why we do it

893
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:39,710
on Hamid hero but yeah at Molly we ship

894
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:43,760
without the CRT now so our game our game

895
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:45,679
runs no no crg and I ship granny granny

896
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,390
had an OCR key option as well when i

897
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:55,399
shipped out a trad that was always no

898
00:38:47,389 --> 00:38:56,599
CRT for for all that stuff yeah moondog

899
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,090
afford to have you considered guests

900
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,679
program is for the interim if like i

901
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:02,840
said if i have to if it goes more than a

902
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:05,539
month of me not be legit than then I'll

903
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,369
will do something i'm not sure what but

904
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:11,509

i need to do you know to be honest it

907
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,019
doesn't really bother me if if my hands

are numb or something even so it's

909
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:21,889
really just verifying that i'm not going

910
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:24,380
to lose use of the hands by using them

911
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:25,819
is really all i need to get that's

912
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,809
