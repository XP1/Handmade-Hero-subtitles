00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,730
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,750
here oh sure we could a complete-game

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,250
live on stream we are really going to

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,250
just be continuing the work that we did

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,160
last weekend we implemented the

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,618
beginning of octahedral light Maps for

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,969
our game I guess I don't know that we

8
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:25,589
want to call them at people light maps

9
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:30,210
we maybe we should call them octahedral

10
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:33,570
light probe maps or light probe storage

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,189
and we need to sort of push forward on

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,369
that there's two things that we want to

13
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,558
do today if we can one is to sort of

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,109
debug the code a little bit because we

15
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,890
just kind of threw it in there it's

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:49,289
probably typos there's probably mistakes

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,960
and the other thing we want to do is we

18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,359
have to tighten up the actual meaning of

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,969
the map and how it's used so right now

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,920
what we did is we just threw in a

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,429
packing of the maps that I think is ten

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,338
by ten right now and that is an 8 by 8

23
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:08,489
map plus a one pixel border around the

24
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:10,650
map obviously there's a one pixel border

25
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,269
on each side which ends up being plus

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,770
two so that's why it's not nine by nine

27
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,560
it's ten by ten because this is a one

28
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,090
pixel border all the way around but at

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,700
the immediate moment we're not actually

30
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,159
doing that we're just using the full ten

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,129
by ten and so we also need to kind of

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,618
tighten up that idea and move to

33
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:31,709
actually properly aligning all of our

34
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:33,629
ways that we work with the texture to

35
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:35,578
sample into it properly so right now

36
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,750
it's not really correct the way that

37
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,129
we're doing that so we want to kind of

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:44,609
tighten that up today so accounting for

39
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:47,129
the one pixel offset and all that and we

40
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,739
also need to copy right we need to place

41
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:51,420
the proper values into those border

42
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:55,618
pixels so that's another thing we have

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,689
to do once we do all of that work we're

44
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,340
going to have to then and this will

45
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:00,929
probably start tomorrow because they

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,630
don't we'll probably need all of today

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,250
to just make that stuff work once we do

48
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,030
that we also need to do one other thing

49
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,469
and that is we need to start

50
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,500
streamlining the process of working with

51
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,879
these maps and probably moving to some

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,469
kind of scheme where we just only have

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,939
one of them in memory and update it

54
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,159
directly and that sort of stuff because

55
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,050
there's a lot of business going on right

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,120
now and we're not gonna be able to

57
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,310
afford that like these octahedral maps

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,460
are actually pretty big they store the

59
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,270
light mapping for the probes at a pretty

60
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,040
high resolution compared to something

61
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:38,340
like the low res voxel version we were

62
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,500
using before and so in order to sort of

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,789
move towards a an actual finished

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,009
version which is what we're trying to do

65
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:46,500
here I think we probably want to change

66
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:49,649
to a system where we're directly

67
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,680
operating on a single octahedral atlas

68
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,230
and every time we take a ray cast we

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,760
just blend that in directly I don't

70
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:58,889
actually think that'd be that hard to do

71
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:13,738
and so I think that's probably what we

72
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:17,569
want all right so I'm gonna go ahead and

73
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,640
get started if I go ahead and switch to

74
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:24,629
handmade hero here what you can actually

75
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,768
see is that if we run the game and mind

76
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,199
you we're not actually doing any

77
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,659
lighting right now so if I go ahead and

78
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:35,250
switch over here to remedy and load up

79
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:37,709
the renderer here we're not actually

80
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,049
doing any use of the lighting so you

81
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,900
kind of see that the game itself is

82
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,030
unlit at the moment and that is

83
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,840
intentional but we are actually writing

84
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,209
into the light map it's out the storage

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,370
for these probes it does actually it

86
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:57,689
actually does exist so we have those

87
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,049
probes stored and at each location in

88
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,719
the voxel we are saving out one of those

89
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:06,659
octahedral maps so what we want to do

90
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:11,280
here I think is start to view that we

91
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:14,340
viewed it inside the actual the capture

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,100
like we looked at render doc and we saw

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,319
that but we'd like to be able to see

94
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,500
that light map more specifically and

95
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:25,168
right now we can't so what we might want

96
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,579
to do and I guess nowadays I suppose

97
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:28,560
since we did the work of doing

98
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,810
reloading I could probably just leave of

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,430
the actual renderer core we can probably

100
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,490
leave this up and just and just work

101
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,340
with it here if I go to the renderer the

102
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,218
opengl side of things when we're

103
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:45,209
actually in the middle of the render

104
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:47,519
loop here and we do bind these images

105
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:49,769
and send down the updated voxel

106
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,899
information we should be able to just

107
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:55,529
draw what they look like directly on the

108
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,000
screen you know having some we know like

109
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,348
what their dimensions are right so we

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,829
should be able to go ahead and actually

111
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:03,360
just like draw the to light map textures

112
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:06,810
so that we can see what they look like

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,750
and if you go and look at what we've got

114
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,060
here as far as that's concerned you can

115
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,680
see that we've got you know a thing at

116
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,050
the end where we resolve our def peels

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,240
so at some point right we finish up in

118
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,788
the use program begin use program and we

119
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,639
finish up by doing a bind frame buffer

120
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:28,500
and doing a final blit to the screen and

121
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,629
that final stretch is the thing that

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,610
does that right you can see we have the

123
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,360
color handle here and we do all this

124
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,449
nonsense right and I think if I'm not

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,389
mistaken we should probably be able to

126
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,038
when we do that final stretch we should

127
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,788
be able to put some debug code in here

128
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,649
that just goes ahead and outputs our

129
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:51,689
octahedral light map out to the screen

130
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,929
in some kind of way that we can

131
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:58,319
visualize and so if we take a look at

132
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:02,550
the final stretch call so if I if I look

133
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,439
at this final stretch what you can see

134
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,240
here is there's just a thing which says

135
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,639
look here's where we're gonna put it and

136
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,939
here's the texture lookup that we're

137
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,310
gonna have and so I think if I'm not

138
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:17,908
mistaken I should be able to literally

139
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:22,709
just do some extra passes here right so

140
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:25,468
when we do the the use program begin use

141
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:29,968
program and through this line of code

142
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:31,889
here I feel like the GL draw arrays call

143
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:34,620
that we're issuing here after the bind

144
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:38,848
texture I feel like we should be able to

145
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,079
just do that more than once right so you

146
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:43,259
know we've we've

147
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,149
found an array this this draw triangle

148
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,658
strip here it's gonna draw one quad

149
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:51,299
right and the quad it's gonna draw is

150
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:55,438
whichever one we've lined up as being

151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:59,158
the active quad so I think and let me

152
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,590
just double check this is true I think

153
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:06,538
it's whatever sort of texture array

154
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:09,929
we've armed and I don't know so let me

155
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:12,658
see I don't see us explicitly putting

156
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,788
that in here so I'm assuming and this is

157
00:07:12,658 --> 00:07:17,009
kind of taxing my memory a little bit

158
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:21,389
but I'm assuming that you know in the

159
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:22,800
the the use program begin news program

160
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:26,340
and sort of things

161
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,848
we're probably setting up that program

162
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:32,668
information so like if we go look at at

163
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:34,918
where that is on here let me see we get

164
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:37,948
resolved exceed lighting we don't have

165
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:41,549
one for that one right and so when we do

166
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:48,330
the use program begin for the final

167
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:50,759
stretch program which it looks like yeah

168
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:54,810
just looking at it so it's gonna be like

169
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,759
one of these common calls here and if

170
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,699
you look you can see that if there's a

171
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,449
you know we we've enabled these vertex

172
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,400
attribute arrays right and we don't

173
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,088
actually set anything other than the

174
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,818
offset so we're not actually specifying

175
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:15,060
an actual array anywhere we're just sort

176
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:19,500
of turning them on in here and so

177
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,848
whichever one is is whichever one was

178
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,588
last in there is the one that we're

179
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:24,810
gonna use how come I can't oh because

180
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,848
I'm already in there so my question is

181
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,709
just like when did we setup that for

182
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:33,028
that whatever buffer has the for for the

183
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:35,458
triangle strip whichever one has the

184
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:38,309
four pieces in it at some point we had

185
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:40,649
to actually enable that one and I'm just

186
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,929
not sure when we actually did so you can

187
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,379
see here we set up the frame buffer and

188
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,419
all that stuff oh here it is here it is

189
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:52,528
so this GL bind buffer screen fill

190
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,179
vertex buffer fat right there so if we

191
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:58,559
take a look at that screen fill vertex

192
00:08:54,179 --> 00:09:00,509
buffer I'm gonna go ahead and pull that

193
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:06,689
out so if we take a look at the screen

194
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:08,039
fill vertex buffer like right here you

195
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,050
can see that we've got one that just

196
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,740
fills the whole screen with whatever the

197
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:15,539
map is and we sort of want basically

198
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,639
like a debug version of that so that we

199
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:21,500
can draw whatever we're looking at you

200
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:25,860
know so we want to draw our octahedral

201
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:29,068
light information into a map using some

202
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,649
pre coded coordinates here and we know

203
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:34,620
the resolution of our octahedral map

204
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:38,370
because we sort of packed it in a

205
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:43,230
particular way so we know that it's sort

206
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:46,259
of long and it's it's sort of wide and

207
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,750
not it not as tall as it is wide it

208
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,970
would normally be because everything in

209
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:56,100
it is a symmetric dimension right it's

210
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:58,440
all ten by tens and it's you know the

211
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,379
lightness so I think it's 32 by 32 by 32

212
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,240
s worth of 10 by 10 s so it's a cube but

213
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:05,578
we had to like unwrap the cube so we

214
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,490
unwrapped the cube in the width

215
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:13,708
direction so we effectively have instead

216
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:16,139
of 132 wide we have 32 times 32 wide and

217
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:21,389
then just 32 tall of these 10 by tens

218
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:24,389
and so we kind of need to make a version

219
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:26,730
of these vertices that we can use that

220
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,919
will just have around for this the

221
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,519
purpose of doing one of these light map

222
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,620
debugs

223
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,379
and so in here I'm just gonna say like

224
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,600
light map debug buffer or something like

225
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:38,730
this so that we can generate something

226
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,670
that will fill this properly and and

227
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,620
look at it and if you look at what's

228
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:46,259
happening here you can see this fills

229
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,149
the whole screen by starting off at the

230
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:51,750
X that's so this is the left edge of the

231
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:54,089
screen and 1.0 would be the top I guess

232
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,220
so I don't really know why we chose this

233
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,880
whining but we did and then we go from

234
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,589
oh you know why because it's a it's a

235
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,389
try strip so we had to do try strip

236
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,340
order so we started off in the upper

237
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,350
left corner we went down to the

238
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,450
left corner we go over to the lower

239
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,700
right corner and we go up to the top and

240
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,410
so we still basically you know want to

241
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,370
do essentially the same thing probably

242
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:19,289
but we're looking at something that if

243
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,639
you look at it if we look at its aspect

244
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:23,730
ratio oops I promised I wouldn't use

245
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,059
calc in a more speed crunch we're

246
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,700
looking at something that's 32 by 32

247
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:34,769
across but only 32 high right so it's

248
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:38,670
aspect ratio is 32 to 1 so we want to

249
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,470
actually have a height that's going to

250
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:43,919
be proportional if the width of this

251
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,850
thing was to right or 1 I don't know

252
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,860
whether we want it to stretch all the

253
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,659
way across or only half the screen maybe

254
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,990
we only want it to stretch on across

255
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:54,809
half the screen so if it was negative 1

256
00:11:51,990 --> 00:12:00,029
to 0 let's say then we would only want

257
00:11:54,809 --> 00:12:01,949
it to be 0.03 1 to 5 high right and we

258
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,799
probably want like two of these so that

259
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:09,360
we can do the depth map and because we

260
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,740
have a depth map and a color map so if

261
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,950
we did it that way we would have two of

262
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,110
these one for each right and so if we

263
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:19,110
just go ahead and think about how we're

264
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,419
gonna make these work we can just say

265
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:25,440
all right let's suppose that we're just

266
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:27,479
gonna go and do negative 1 to 0 so we're

267
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,570
going from the left edge of the screen

268
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:35,810
to the middle and then instead of going

269
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:38,340
to 0 to 1.0 let's just go to oh you know

270
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:40,859
well I mean you know there's no point me

271
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:44,070
type in the sand we'll just create the

272
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:49,200
actual value which is like the height

273
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:51,840
value here or maybe we'll say the top P

274
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,250
or something and so I want to start at

275
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:59,970
negative 1.0 and then I want to go up

276
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:03,120
exactly that 1 over 32 so that gets me

277
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,810
you know up to the top of the where

278
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,730
where it should be

279
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:07,679
if the aspect ratio were correct for

280
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,230
this thing so then here I'm just gonna

281
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:13,250
call this my top P or tough why might be

282
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,250
a better way to say it right

283
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:21,299
and that would allow me to draw things

284
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,459
that wouldn't occupy the whole screen so

285
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,338
that I can just slap some debug stuff up

286
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:30,088
there and I think that's all I really

287
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:34,410
need to do I want to have two of these I

288
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:38,009
suppose I could just do this right which

289
00:13:34,409 --> 00:13:43,409
is to say that I'll put another one in

290
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:45,000
here that goes from zero to one and they

291
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:46,559
can just both sit there and I'll just

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,750
use different parts of the vertex erase

293
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,299
should be fine right

294
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,839
and once I specify this I think I'm good

295
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:57,929
to go so I don't know when this gets

296
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,579
sent down it's OpenGL in it so it should

297
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:02,068
only have to happen the first time which

298
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:04,019
I think is good I guess that does you

299
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:06,120
know do we actually call up and chi'lan

300
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,399
it again I don't think we do so I take

301
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,110
it back because this is initialization

302
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,750
time we don't rebind these buffers maybe

303
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,818
we should because then they would work

304
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,769
during a reload but so anyway I'm gonna

305
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:18,828
go ahead and and recompile it this way

306
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm gonna need some place to remember

307
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:24,239
that light map buffer so you can kind of

308
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,778
see in here we have the screen fill

309
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,899
buffer is is gluant we remember so we're

310
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:33,480
gonna want to remember the light map

311
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:38,009
debug buffer as well has an extra

312
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,170
capital u there and I think that's all

313
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,509
we should really need and then we can do

314
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:45,328
at the end we can use that buffer tube

315
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:48,539
lit the two textures and onto the screen

316
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:52,649
and see what they look like so now

317
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:54,599
inside the OpenGL code here we just go

318
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,970
down where we were using the program

319
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,589
here we can do it inside here because

320
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,720
we're using the same program so we don't

321
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,459
need to redo that so we can just do

322
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,750
effectively like something like this

323
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:10,739
right we should be able to say all right

324
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:13,980
let's just rebind the the vertex array

325
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,028
that we're using so it here where we did

326
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,879
the bind buffer we'll switch to our

327
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:22,679
light map debug buffer and then in here

328
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,659
where we do our bind texture stuff we

329
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,519
can say all right we're not going to use

330
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:29,129
this anymore we're going to use our

331
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:33,269
light map values our light map textures

332
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:38,490
and so we know that those are or should

333
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:44,519
be yeah right here so we've got the

334
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:48,568
Atlas handle for the colors and the

335
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:52,188
Atlas handler handle for the depth like

336
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:54,899
so and we're gonna need here a way of

337
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:56,969
picking out different ones so I believe

338
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,159
this is the initial element index I'm

339
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,629
gonna double check I assume it is so I'm

340
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:03,000
assuming all we need to do is that but

341
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:04,409
you know I don't remember the specifics

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,208
of the drawer raise call at the moment

343
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:08,719
so I'm gonna go ahead and look at up on

344
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:11,518
docks GL to make sure that I'm not

345
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,569
totally wrong about that because there's

346
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,308
other things that could be could be an

347
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:17,639
offset a byte offset or whatever right

348
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:22,078
so it's a gluant for the first and it

349
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,129
says starting index right so assuming

350
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:24,629
that we're doing a drawer array is

351
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:26,100
Collin not drawing an indexed array is

352
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:28,889
called and it should just be the fourth

353
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,790
one of the vertices and that should draw

354
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:34,470
both of them I think so let's take a

355
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:38,480
look and see if that does anything for

356
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,480
us and we'll go from there

357
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:48,480
all right so we are actually seeing some

358
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:50,578
of the information on here but you'll

359
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,220
notice that it doesn't it's not doing

360
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:55,979
what I had wanted it to do right it's

361
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,970
clearly drawing on the full screen and I

362
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,209
wanted it to draw on the I only wanted

363
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,019
it to draw a part of the screen so

364
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:06,119
looking at what's happening there you

365
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:08,970
can see doing an array buffer bind here

366
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:12,479
of the light map debug buffer and then

367
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:15,899
me trying to do my two draws and I'm not

368
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,078
actually sure why that would have

369
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:21,658
happened like I feel like that should

370
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,639
have worked okay but I'm not I'm not

371
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,380
sure why so let's go ahead I probably

372
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,350
just passed the wrong thing or something

373
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,659
so let me go ahead and look at the call

374
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:34,019
that actually initialize those so if I

375
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:36,230
go to light map debug buffer and look

376
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:38,099
here at what happened let me just see

377
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,650
what the problem is

378
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:44,019
so we Jen the buffer we

379
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:47,320
bind the buffer we send down these

380
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:48,369
vertices and these are the UV

381
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,409
coordinates so they shouldn't have

382
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:53,250
changed these are the positional

383
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,250
coordinates and

384
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,288
I'm not really sure like I don't

385
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:14,570
actually see why that would immediately

386
00:18:12,288 --> 00:18:19,638
be a problem it looks sort of like it's

387
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:22,849
not actually using the bind buffer here

388
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:25,788
so I'm wondering if for some reason I'm

389
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:29,298
not finding it

390
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:32,869
oh so here's a question it may be that

391
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:37,778
you can't swap a bind buffer without

392
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:40,250
recalling the vertex attribution calls

393
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:43,069
I'm not sure about that

394
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,378
we could test it pretty easily so I

395
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:47,359
suppose I just should but then we'll

396
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:50,599
have to look at why so I just gonna see

397
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:53,508
if this is true if I use program end

398
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:58,369
here change the bind buffer and then

399
00:18:53,509 --> 00:19:05,298
restart the program I'm wondering

400
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:07,969
whether or not that changes anything yes

401
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:10,339
so that does right and you can see those

402
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,399
textures are down in the correct place

403
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:15,138
now so that's a little weird and I guess

404
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:16,729
I don't know why so I kind of want to

405
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:18,918
take a look and see is that actually

406
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,480
what the expected behavior would be and

407
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,870
maybe it is and that's fine but I'm just

408
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,480
a little bit weirded out by that so does

409
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:29,778
that imply that basically these calls

410
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,019
are gonna bind that buffer whatever

411
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:34,730
buffer was active at the time and it

412
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:36,798
doesn't matter if you try to switch the

413
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,889
buffer out it won't actually take a new

414
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,048
one that appears to be the case which is

415
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:44,628
a little bit weird because these calls

416
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:46,429
don't actually need that right they're

417
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:50,658
just these are just specifying a vertex

418
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:52,399
format but you know I don't know it

419
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:54,470
looks like maybe that's exactly the case

420
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:57,558
it doesn't matter I'm fine with it that

421
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,269
way but anyway now we can sort of see

422
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:02,058
when we run the game we can see that

423
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,220
we've got both of those textures down

424
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:06,138
there

425
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:10,129
and I you know if I had to argue I'd say

426
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:13,058
that does look about 32 times longer

427
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:15,798
than it is wide now we have a problem

428
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:18,079
which I can see here it's just it's too

429
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,819
much data right that it's so tiny that

430
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,329
it's impossible to actually see what's

431
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:24,450
going on

432
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:26,129
in that texture so I guess I'm not sure

433
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,169
that this will actually help we may need

434
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,929
to look at like a subset of it right

435
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:33,750
like we may need to just focus on a part

436
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:36,809
that's that's significantly smaller so

437
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,319
that we can see anything I'm not sure

438
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:42,119
what the best way to do that would be

439
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:45,950
but anyway we now have that part working

440
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:50,729
so if I actually go and change what that

441
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:52,080
you know what that amounts to so that we

442
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,529
maybe make it a little bit higher and

443
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,879
change the UV coordinates I don't know

444
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:59,970
that seems like the only thing we could

445
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,460
really do here to help so if we wanted

446
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,589
to do that what we could do is draw like

447
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,470
a fairly significantly a much smaller

448
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:09,329
subset of this thing so what I could say

449
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,160
is like all right there's a UV dimension

450
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:14,779
and we're gonna like shrink down how

451
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,779
much of this texture we're drawing right

452
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:24,418
so I'm gonna go ahead and say maybe this

453
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:26,190
will be something that specifies both of

454
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,460
these and then I'm here I'll just say

455
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:32,308
like look UV well these are the zero I

456
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:36,960
guess is an offset so maybe we'll say

457
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:39,480
something like this UV min UV max so

458
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,700
that I don't have to specify each of

459
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,289
these individual coordinates so I'm

460
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,769
going to just say all right this is UV

461
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:55,109
min X in both of these and then this is

462
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:57,869
UV max X and then this is UV min Y in

463
00:21:55,109 --> 00:22:04,048
both of these oops sorry

464
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:06,000
human X in both of these and UV max X in

465
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:09,298
both of these and then in these we'll

466
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,630
just have UV min Y and she that's max

467
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:20,160
sorry give you even why max Y you've

468
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:22,669
even in Y and each of these is just

469
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,669
going to be

470
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:33,139
adjustable now oops and that way I can

471
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:35,930
say look we're gonna pick out a smaller

472
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,470
subset of this thing and I kind of I

473
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,840
think I want to focus mostly on the you

474
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,799
know center of the thing because we're

475
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:47,689
gonna be trying to center the voxel

476
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,450
around us so I want to try and pick a

477
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:53,210
location in the map that has something

478
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:57,470
to do with the center now we know we

479
00:22:53,210 --> 00:23:00,049
unwrapped it XY wise so I guess it's

480
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,420
pretty hard for us to really pick out

481
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:04,700
the center in any meaningful way but we

482
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,230
can at least do up-and-down we can pick

483
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,860
out the center so we can pick out the

484
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:12,740
center Z at the very least so maybe we

485
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:14,299
say look the Z Center would put us

486
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,960
somewhere like let's suppose we went

487
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:20,750
like that so we had like you know or

488
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,120
maybe even something like that

489
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:27,500
so we're just talking about a very

490
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:29,629
narrow part of the map and then if we

491
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,720
wanted to here like let's suppose that

492
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:34,640
we were doing sort of a square so if we

493
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,920
were doing a square part of the map well

494
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:43,550
we know that again this map is going to

495
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,950
be 32 right the the UV coordinates are

496
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:50,389
normalized from 0 to 1 but the map

497
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:53,690
itself is not uniform like it's not

498
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,759
square right so if we wanted to have a

499
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:01,820
part of the thing that would correspond

500
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:05,299
to this it would have to be 32 times the

501
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:08,480
span here in order to get a square part

502
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:11,180
of it out and so if I take a look I

503
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,089
guess that means I want to know

504
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:18,230
where's P crunch so if we said look we

505
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:21,019
have looking at this it's 0.1 so 0.1

506
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,750
times 32 is too much so I guess we want

507
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:26,000
this to be even smaller right so maybe

508
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:30,559
we say something like look it's it's

509
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,259
something like this so now it's just

510
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:40,460
point O to maybe even that so now it's

511
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:43,910
just like 0.01 right Supes so it means

512
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:48,049
that we only need to cover point 32 in

513
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:55,070
the x-direction to capture that much Y

514
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:55,460
right just I'm making this up as I go

515
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,500
along

516
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:01,789
right but basically that means like it's

517
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:09,440
point one six radius so if we were point

518
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:11,779
O 5 minus 0.16 right and 0.05 plus two

519
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,220
point six the problem is that straddles

520
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,990
the boundary so I think we probably

521
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,339
actually want to be more like that I

522
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,980
mean it really I don't even know where

523
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:20,169
we want to be in the map XY z-- but you

524
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,400
know off we go

525
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,930
so we can do something like that and

526
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,269
then all we would do here is just say

527
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,070
look at that point the top Y is gonna be

528
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:30,440
zero so we're gonna actually draw a

529
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:32,480
square now and off we go

530
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,430
so I think that's all we really need to

531
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,140
do to see a more representative part of

532
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,730
the map unfortunately you know like I'm

533
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,259
not sure again because it's a lot of

534
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,900
data there I'm not sure how to display

535
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:44,089
it at the moment in any particularly

536
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,600
useful way you can see now we're looking

537
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:50,750
at a more perhaps zoomed in in the

538
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:53,230
region of it it looks a little weird I'm

539
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,579
not sure why we're seeing the kind of

540
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,339
stipple we're getting there it may be

541
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:59,929
because the format of the texture we're

542
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:01,339
like I don't know why we're seeing

543
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,750
exactly what we're seeing there so we're

544
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:07,039
gonna have to look at that a little bit

545
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,269
more closely it looks stretched as well

546
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,740
in a way that doesn't make a lot of

547
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:13,639
sense to me so I think these are not

548
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,319
quite correct at the moment we are now

549
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,730
drawing a square though right because

550
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,559
top Y is zero

551
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,509
I mean well let me put it this way if

552
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,579
you look at this thing

553
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:24,140
it should be roughly square of course

554
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:25,000
it's not really I guess that's because

555
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,490
the

556
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,349
this is not quite a square this is

557
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,180
sixteen by nine so as these will be

558
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:34,119
sixteen by nine as well so let me make

559
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,880
those square uh for lack of a better

560
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:41,559
term because again these are also

561
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:46,050
coordinates that are the coordinates in

562
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:48,129
this case are also going to be

563
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:50,440
interpreted normalized over the screen

564
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,500
which we know is sixteen by nine so we

565
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,420
would want the them to have a 16 by 9

566
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,869
aspect ratio for these coordinates as

567
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,340
well so when adjusted they'd work out so

568
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:03,399
what I probably want to do here is say

569
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:11,379
alright where are we going to in X so

570
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:14,470
we've got like a max X here and this

571
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:18,520
width when we do this max X or maybe I

572
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:22,269
could even say this is X dim right so

573
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:25,629
I'll just write these in terms of some

574
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:31,690
starting location and then like an

575
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:39,670
addition so well actually probably more

576
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:41,500
like that and so now if we did X theme

577
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:43,360
equals one we get back the same thing

578
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,190
but if we do X them equal something

579
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,659
that's aspect ratio appropriate we'd

580
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,279
shrink these down to a square so that

581
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,310
we're at least looking at the the right

582
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:55,539
aspect ratio for a square slice of the

583
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:57,250
texture and so in that to that end right

584
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:58,930
and maybe I want this to be even a

585
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:03,369
little bit fancier so maybe I want this

586
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:05,320
to be like 1.0 minus X 10 so that like

587
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:12,129
the middle of the screen is a gap you

588
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:14,109
know what I'm saying oops and so then if

589
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,730
I said all right let's make X dim like I

590
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:19,909
said one if I did that correctly

591
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,910
[Music]

592
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:28,680
there we go I should get the same thing

593
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:32,370
and then if I change it so that I'm

594
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,380
actually looking at a next M of a value

595
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:38,250
that's properly adjusted for sixteen by

596
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,810
nine then what I should be able to do is

597
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,119
get those to both be squares that are

598
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:43,379
bound to the edge of the screen so

599
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,659
there's a square on the left side and a

600
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,400
square on the right side that are at the

601
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,250
edges of the screen but don't extend all

602
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,830
the way to the middle and in order to do

603
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:55,109
that like again I know that this is

604
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:58,019
going to be proportional to sixteen by

605
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:01,199
nine right because that's the resolution

606
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:04,349
that we're rendering at so I know that

607
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,730
the if I assume that we're doing one you

608
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:11,279
know zero to one on why I want to do

609
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:16,319
something that's 16 times but divided by

610
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:22,609
nine that in X and I don't actually want

611
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:27,149
it to not sure how to say this properly

612
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:30,750
so we know that on the screen we're

613
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:33,900
drawing one in Y but that one in Y is

614
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,970
proportional to the nine and we have

615
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,800
something that wants that is going to be

616
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:41,430
interpreted proportional to the 16 right

617
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:44,849
so this is going to want to be inverted

618
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:53,400
I need to draw this out because I'm

619
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:54,779
explaining this very poorly you know

620
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,410
I'll be honest I don't know where the

621
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:57,410
pen minute there it is

622
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:25,418
all right so if we have our screen and

623
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:27,730
it looks like this then what we're doing

624
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:29,860
is we're specifying coordinates that are

625
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,620
interpreted on a screen that we know is

626
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:36,099
sixteen by nine right

627
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:39,969
and right now what we're doing is we if

628
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:42,359
we specify one here and here which is

629
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,548
what we're doing a length of one right

630
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,678
then what we're gonna do is this length

631
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:48,460
is going to be effectively one times

632
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,919
nine

633
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,090
right and this length is gonna be one

634
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:55,809
times 16

635
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:58,779
but we want them to be equal right so in

636
00:30:55,808 --> 00:31:01,058
other words we want to take and say look

637
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:04,808
we know we're doing one times nine and

638
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:08,710
so we want to say what would the value B

639
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:10,329
for our width where width times 16 is

640
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:16,058
going to be equal to one times nine

641
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:17,408
right so if the width times 16 I'll just

642
00:31:16,058 --> 00:31:21,970
write this in math now

643
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:26,020
so if 16 W equals nine then I want W to

644
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:30,009
equal 9 by 16 right does that make sense

645
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:32,650
and so if we look back at what we're

646
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:34,000
doing here that's why I was going to say

647
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,669
like we invert this and I was trying

648
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,529
explain why and that's why because what

649
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:40,419
we're actually doing it although it

650
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:43,089
seems like the X should be 16 by 9

651
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:44,919
because X is the 16 side and Y is the 9

652
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:47,079
side what's happening is they're getting

653
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,909
multiplied by those values when they

654
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,769
actually go to get rendered so we're

655
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:54,429
trying to like undo the multiplication

656
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:56,829
right we're trying to reverse the 16 by

657
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:59,320
9 multiplication that's happening during

658
00:31:56,829 --> 00:32:01,750
rendering as it blows it out to a screen

659
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:04,000
of that size so in theory if I invert

660
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,069
that fraction I should now get something

661
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,480
that does the correct like fractional

662
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:12,339
difference between those two and there

663
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,250
we go so now we're drawing actual

664
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:16,750
squares and now we just have to figure

665
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,349
out why we're you know we're obviously

666
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:22,538
not putting very good we're not we're

667
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:24,428
not properly selecting those UV

668
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:27,528
coordinates at all at the moment

669
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:30,590
and we gotta go see why I may have made

670
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:33,380
the same mistake when we did the

671
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:35,808
textures like I should have had a wider

672
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:42,889
version in Y right like I think what I

673
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:46,548
did is when we yeah so look here this is

674
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:52,819
the wrong way round right I needed to

675
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:55,429
make it so that this was taking a like

676
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:57,829
larger section and I think I probably

677
00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:00,080
did it the opposite way that I should

678
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:01,939
have right it needs to take a smaller

679
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:06,230
section because the texture is bigger I

680
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,629
think that's again not explaining it

681
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:11,360
very well but we're trying to grab a

682
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:15,949
piece of a texture that's very wide but

683
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:18,168
very short and when we go to grab it

684
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:21,679
what I did was I said like oh we're

685
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:25,429
gonna grab a point oh one size slice in

686
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,750
Y out of the texture or in V depending

687
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:29,298
how you know why are V depending on you

688
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,308
want to think about it and so I need to

689
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,599
do one that's 32 times larger in the in

690
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:34,038
the X direction because the texture is

691
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,558
three times larger but it's the opposite

692
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:39,109
stru right because the texture is 32

693
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,569
times larger that means that whatever UV

694
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:45,319
coordinates we pick we're gonna be

695
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:49,519
getting 16 times more up sorry 32 times

696
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:51,798
more of that thing then we would have

697
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,579
gotten with the same slice in Y so we

698
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:58,548
actually want it to be 1/32 of the

699
00:33:55,579 --> 00:34:01,609
amount we pick here so actually I could

700
00:33:58,548 --> 00:34:04,069
definitely have done this the other way

701
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:08,239
round and said oh all right so if we

702
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:10,279
take a point 1 there it's not going to

703
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,259
be x 32 to get the other one it's gonna

704
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,819
be divided by 32 to get the other one

705
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,020
and that's the value we're actually

706
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:19,250
gonna use there right um so that's

707
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:21,289
actually what I should have done and

708
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,588
that was just me kind of having a brain

709
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:26,690
fart I often have that problem like it's

710
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:29,148
it's just you're thinking about the

711
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,220
ratio one way but the ratio actually

712
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:33,378
think goes the other way because you're

713
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:35,539
you know it's being multiplied by that

714
00:34:33,378 --> 00:34:36,889
thing so you're like undoing the

715
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:39,259
multiplication and

716
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,109
if you do the multiplication the same

717
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,760
way then you're actually like doubling

718
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,460
the problem or squaring the problem when

719
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,320
you look at it so I think that's now the

720
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,030
correct way to look at it

721
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,519
and we might have to try and find a way

722
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,410
to grab enough of the image now to make

723
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:56,420
it make sense obviously that's a pretty

724
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,809
small section of it so maybe we'll try

725
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:02,269
to to to make that a little bit wider

726
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:06,349
let's write this proportional so let's

727
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:08,599
just say like V span and let's say that

728
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:09,440
we want a V span of like well we'll

729
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:11,360
start with the whole thing

730
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,849
we'll say 0.5 and then we'll narrow it

731
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,849
down as we need to go so we'll say 0.5

732
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:21,799
which means that this is - the V span

733
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:25,610
this is plus the V span and that would

734
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:31,160
take the whole thing and then we can

735
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:36,079
just do you span and the you span like

736
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:37,699
so can just be proportional to the V

737
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,739
span in fact of the way that I said so

738
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:43,449
it can just be the V span divided by 32

739
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:47,799
and that should give us a proper square

740
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:50,809
subsection of it assuming I don't

741
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,519
accidentally capitalize the letter and

742
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:53,380
once we have that we should be good to

743
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:57,500
go

744
00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:01,579
right so let's go ahead and run it there

745
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:05,570
we go so now we can actually see part of

746
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:07,190
our light map here and I'd like to try

747
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,230
and get a part of it that we actually

748
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:13,000
visually see you know I can see there

749
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:16,130
that we're getting it what I might do

750
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,199
because there's no reason not to is if

751
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,090
we go back and you take a look at what's

752
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:23,809
happening here where we do the gen

753
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:26,600
before bind buffer here if I were to

754
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:28,630
just move this out so you know let's

755
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:33,920
suppose that I just took this thing and

756
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:38,180
I said okay you know here's here's the

757
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,880
part that gens the buffers and in fact

758
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:43,639
you know what let me just do it this way

759
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:47,119
so if I just said all right here's the

760
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:49,069
part that gens the buffer so here's one

761
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,829
gen buffer call here's another gen

762
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:53,340
buffer call

763
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:56,460
these two I can just run anytime I want

764
00:36:53,340 --> 00:37:00,320
so if I was to move these into the part

765
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,320
where we do our change settings call

766
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:11,639
this if I did these here then I believe

767
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:15,780
I would just be able to like you know if

768
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:22,319
I do this I believe at that point I

769
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:24,510
would just be able to hot code reload

770
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,220
this part because it would run anytime

771
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:31,860
we reloaded the code right so I'm pretty

772
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:34,289
sure that if I start off now with a

773
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,900
fresh compile having moved that into the

774
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:40,650
part where the we do it every time we

775
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:43,530
change the settings if I run it now and

776
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:45,269
then I go here and start mucking with

777
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:49,769
those values I think they should update

778
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:51,869
right in real time so if I wanted to

779
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,460
change the V span to like zoom in on

780
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,679
this let's say so let's say I doubled

781
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,710
the V span I think after that compiles

782
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,149
done it should just like change in when

783
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,690
we run it and you can see that it did

784
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,579
right so there there it is so that will

785
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,769
allow me to kind of focus in on a value

786
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:11,730
that a part of the texture that I want

787
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:14,489
to see and so since we have the UV min

788
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,740
Max part of this happening right what

789
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:18,569
I'd like to do is change this to a

790
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:21,839
vector equation so I can basically say

791
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:25,110
like UV Center here or something and

792
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:29,610
then the UV min max can just be like UV

793
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:31,890
Center mine you know minus UV span and

794
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:35,579
I'll just make those two values be part

795
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:38,509
of a vector right so if we look at what

796
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:41,558
that would do I just say UV span

797
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,559
[Music]

798
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,689
that's the dimension there you either

799
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:52,079
use man and the Beast fan bound into a

800
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:55,889
vector and then the center at the moment

801
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,319
is 0.25 0.5 so if I delete this out and

802
00:38:55,889 --> 00:39:00,960
I just make this UV Center plus UV span

803
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,550
and minus UV span like so now we can

804
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,490
just set the center to look at whatever

805
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,320
part we actually want right and if I was

806
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:09,179
super motivated I could even make that

807
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,620
just be like a debug value or something

808
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:12,149
that we move around but we've never

809
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,279
really gotten the debug system into a

810
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,410
particularly good place so it's more

811
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,330
annoying than it should be but let's

812
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:20,129
just try this so let's suppose I look at

813
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:22,590
apart slightly to the left does that

814
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,690
move this into focus a little bit more

815
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,519
for us so that that's in the center and

816
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,159
you can see now it sort of is right and

817
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:32,550
as I move you know through this thing

818
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:35,879
you can see how those octahedral

819
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:43,039
lighting results are kind of being

820
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:43,039
modified as I move around see I'm saying

821
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,370
and I want to zoom in probably just a

822
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,679
little bit more and Center it just a

823
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:54,750
little bit more so you know you can see

824
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:56,669
it's kind of like needs to be moved over

825
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,710
the right a little bit more and it needs

826
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,950
to be moved like up a little bit as well

827
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:03,900
so you know probably want to do

828
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:06,059
something like that I guess I don't know

829
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,450
or am I going the wrong way on why there

830
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:14,219
aren't V I should say yeah I think I am

831
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:18,019
so let's say that's 3/5 and instead of a

832
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:18,019
point 4 or 5 we'll say like five

833
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:35,618
and still so probably want to say that

834
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:40,058
not sure exactly what that center value

835
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:43,419
for X should be there there we go that's

836
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:45,159
pretty darn close so you're looking at

837
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:46,088
that part you can kind of see how it

838
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:49,539
goes right

839
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:52,028
as I'm hopping through it and I might

840
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:54,880
want to zoom it a little more on that so

841
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:57,668
if we took the V span and doubled that

842
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,459
to zoom in on just the center part of it

843
00:40:57,668 --> 00:41:04,179
I think that would probably be good

844
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:08,259
right so now we can really look at that

845
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:11,139
octahedral light map and you know

846
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:15,639
looking at it I guess what I would say

847
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:20,288
is it's kind of hard for me to to really

848
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:22,328
tell it's not obviously wrong but I'm a

849
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:29,829
little nervous that the unwrapping is

850
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:33,880
still not quite correct right like I'm

851
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:37,659
not sure about that it's nice that we

852
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,838
can see it certainly but I'm just I'm

853
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:43,419
just not necessarily sure that that

854
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:44,679
we've got that unwrapping right and part

855
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,719
of the reason for that is you can just

856
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:50,349
see that there's sort of some weird I

857
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,759
mean you know it's possible that those

858
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:56,409
are in the right place with that that

859
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:58,539
doesn't feel quite Congress to me it

860
00:41:56,409 --> 00:42:00,519
seems like it's always kind of out on

861
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:01,989
the corners maybe a little bit more than

862
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,088
it should be I'm not

863
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:05,999
I don't work with octahedral maps it's

864
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:09,369
the first time I've ever looked at them

865
00:42:05,998 --> 00:42:11,138
so it could just be my unfamiliarity

866
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:17,499
with them that this is what they should

867
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:20,489
look like generally but I I don't I

868
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:20,488
don't think so

869
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:36,149
I think there's probably still someone

870
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:38,730
ramping bugs in there all right

871
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:41,990
but either way that's good like I'm I'm

872
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,400
pleased with that because you know we're

873
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:47,608
we're in a pretty good shape here as far

874
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,579
as like being able to see at least

875
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:52,769
something that that's going on I will

876
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:55,259
say it's not completely wrong like it

877
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:57,869
definitely looks like ok but it's it's

878
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:01,290
just I'm not 100% convinced of of the

879
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:03,660
accuracy there and there's a couple of

880
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:08,608
things that we can do sort of to fix

881
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:10,940
that and here's what I would propose so

882
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:13,199
I think what I want to do before I

883
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:17,309
correct any of the errors that we have

884
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:20,250
yet like not using the border and so on

885
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:22,799
I want to go test that octahedral

886
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:27,150
mapping carefully and so what I'd like

887
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:30,180
to do is I'd like to go and right into

888
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:35,070
the octahedral map using the octahedral

889
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:40,829
unwrapping of the map in such a way that

890
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:43,950
I put each octant of the octahedron on a

891
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:46,619
separate color so I can then look at the

892
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:50,279
octahedral map and actually see whether

893
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:52,769
my sphere octants are going into the

894
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,000
locations that I think they should be

895
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:59,250
going into and more importantly whether

896
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,960
they're at the place in the map that I

897
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,150
think they should be based on those

898
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,369
quadrants I think that's something we

899
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:08,160
probably wanted to do now in order to do

900
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:12,588
that I want to be able to turn off the

901
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:16,739
blending on these maps so when we go

902
00:44:12,588 --> 00:44:19,139
look at the that code there it you can

903
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,118
see we've got sort of this stuff for

904
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:23,190
real like hey here's you know whether

905
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,820
this thing is linear or clamped to edge

906
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:30,420
or whatever else and if you look at this

907
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:32,280
what I would like to do here is do the

908
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,280
same trick I just did because I want to

909
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,310
be able to switch these between

910
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,769
blended in linear anytime I want to so I

911
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:44,610
don't want to have to restart the game

912
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:47,730
to turn off blending on my light map so

913
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:49,500
if we take change to settings and we go

914
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,800
in and do basically exact same things so

915
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,079
exactly like this here where we set

916
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,539
those textures you can see here for

917
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:00,480
example we're setting some min filter

918
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:02,279
mag filter stuff for like you know MIT

919
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:08,579
maps and whatever I want to do exactly

920
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:10,920
that same thing for this stuff excuse me

921
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:14,969
so I want to go ahead and and bind the

922
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:19,200
the light color Atlas and then I want to

923
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:21,779
set its parameters here right and I want

924
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:24,809
to go ahead and so that this is really

925
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:27,000
only doing just it's not setting the

926
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:28,500
parameters it's doing just the actual

927
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,960
creation of the texture that we don't

928
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,780
want to change and then I'm gonna do the

929
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,480
same thing with the depth handle and

930
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,310
that way we can play with these as much

931
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,710
as we want we can change what they do

932
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:42,779
and how they do them so if I want to

933
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:45,240
change one of these I can easily do it

934
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:47,310
and what here what I'll say is maybe

935
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:52,159
we'll have a blend mode here so we'll

936
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:57,409
say like okay there's like a Atlas or

937
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:59,549
light blending equals and I can just do

938
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:02,699
you know maybe I should say light

939
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,710
sampling and that way I can just change

940
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:07,199
that one variable and then all of my

941
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:10,860
sampling will change anytime I want it

942
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:13,679
to so if I go ahead and run that what

943
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,599
should happen now is any time the that

944
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,940
code

945
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:19,769
anytime we recompile that code we should

946
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,840
change the blending so right now you can

947
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:25,079
see it's very smeary it's doing linear

948
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,730
sampling so what I want to do now is see

949
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:28,980
if I can make it so that if I switch to

950
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:34,289
nearest this will turn into a pixelated

951
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:38,340
display and it did so that's better for

952
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:40,739
debugging you know I'd rather see the

953
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,780
pixelated version so I know like what

954
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:46,019
kind of resolution there is in there and

955
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,880
I'm not trying to figure out what is a

956
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:50,278
pixel and what is just a blend between

957
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,108
two pixels so that allows me to see

958
00:46:50,278 --> 00:46:53,880
specifically what we're storing and

959
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:54,960
that's what I want now by the way I

960
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,309
should mention this entire time the

961
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,588
reason this one over here is completely

962
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:00,690
red is because we're not using the depth

963
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:04,108
channel at all right we're not that we

964
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:05,460
have a depth texture for our light

965
00:47:04,108 --> 00:47:07,409
mapping and we're just not doing

966
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,608
anything with it that's intentional and

967
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:11,399
we're you know we're gonna leave it that

968
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:14,278
way until we actually get the rest of

969
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,430
this working so I want to go do bug this

970
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:19,588
part now and see what I can see about

971
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:22,318
that so if we go to where I'm actually

972
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:24,420
writing into that in the lighting test

973
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:27,088
you know I'm I'm just dumping down some

974
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:29,670
values based on preconceived notion of

975
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:32,909
where a light would be and you can see

976
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:34,920
in here right so if we take a look at

977
00:47:32,909 --> 00:47:37,469
where we're writing into it here's the

978
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:41,220
light voxel information where we where

979
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:43,139
we put that stuff so for each one of

980
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:46,288
these what I'd like to do is say all

981
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:48,900
right when we do a write in here we're

982
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:52,109
gonna do a unit vector from octahedral

983
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:54,630
here and what I want to know is for each

984
00:47:52,108 --> 00:47:56,130
one of these and I can't really test the

985
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,200
reverse yet because I'm not really doing

986
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:00,690
the reverse version but for this when we

987
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:03,659
say unit vector from octahedral what I

988
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:05,970
want to do is let's turn off the part

989
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:09,358
where we actually do any lighting so

990
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:13,048
let's just turn that right on off and

991
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:15,028
what I want to do instead is place some

992
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:18,568
code in here that will set the light

993
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:21,268
color to a known value so for example if

994
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:25,440
I was to set this to let's say blue

995
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:28,889
right then I should now see all blue on

996
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,338
the left side of my image right so there

997
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:33,808
it is and obviously we're not setting

998
00:48:32,338 --> 00:48:35,068
the depth to anything at the moment so

999
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:37,559
it's just gonna come out black over

1000
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:39,480
there and that's fine too so now what I

1001
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,150
could do is say all right let's take a

1002
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,909
look at when we get back the unit vector

1003
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:47,099
from octahedral here let's see what it's

1004
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:51,989
telling us these sample directions are

1005
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:57,480
and so if I was to create like a pretty

1006
00:48:51,989 --> 00:49:00,389
simple sort of little like decoder here

1007
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,358
and I said take the sample Direction and

1008
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:09,028
take a look at the absolute value of the

1009
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:11,038
X right and if the absolute value of the

1010
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:20,518
X Direction is greater than the absolute

1011
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:24,210
value of the Y direction and the Z

1012
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:26,368
Direction right so it's the maximum one

1013
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,500
it's it's the maximum value of the

1014
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:36,450
values that we have is that parenthesize

1015
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:38,009
properly know if it's the maximum value

1016
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:41,879
that we have we'll set it to one thing

1017
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:45,900
right if it's if it's not you know we'll

1018
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:51,778
check the other way around and then

1019
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:53,430
we'll check the final way right so this

1020
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:56,639
is basically saying like we'll just look

1021
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:58,858
at which one is highest and so if the X

1022
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,768
is highest then what we'll do is we'll

1023
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:06,239
set the X equal to we'll set the red

1024
00:50:01,768 --> 00:50:07,709
right channel the green channel or the

1025
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,108
blue channel based on which one's

1026
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,579
highest and now what we haven't done is

1027
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:13,018
differentiated between the positive and

1028
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,630
negative quadrants which we would like

1029
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:18,139
to do but for right now we're not going

1030
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:23,190
to do that we're just going to look and

1031
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:24,808
what we see if we look here is I don't

1032
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:28,679
know you know I'm not sure I could

1033
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:30,778
really call that correct but at the same

1034
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:32,278
time it's not obviously wrong either

1035
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,949
right like it's a little bit hard to

1036
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:36,798
tell so I'm gonna go ahead and finish

1037
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:39,298
that part and see I'm gonna different

1038
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:43,230
differentiate between the positive and

1039
00:50:39,298 --> 00:50:45,239
negative halves of these so I'm gonna

1040
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:51,409
say look if sampled or X is less than

1041
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:55,288
zero right then I'm gonna do dark blue

1042
00:50:51,409 --> 00:51:00,199
otherwise I'm gonna do Oh actually you

1043
00:50:55,289 --> 00:51:00,200
know what well no

1044
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:07,190
right so now dark will be positive and

1045
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,979
I'm sorry dark will be negative and

1046
00:51:10,889 --> 00:51:15,739
light will be positive of each of the

1047
00:51:13,978 --> 00:51:25,228
values

1048
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:33,329
there's the green version sorry blue

1049
00:51:25,228 --> 00:51:35,429
version here and off we go

1050
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:37,140
so yeah so if the absolute value of the

1051
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:39,389
x-coordinate is greater than both the

1052
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:41,368
absolute values of the y&amp;z then we will

1053
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:43,469
color it red and we'll use a dark red

1054
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:46,979
for negative and a bright red for

1055
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:48,659
positive if the Y is greater than the X

1056
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:52,048
and the Z then we will do the same thing

1057
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:54,208
with green and if the Z is greater than

1058
00:51:52,048 --> 00:51:56,038
the X and the y then we'll do the other

1059
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,808
one right and I could have just done an

1060
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:00,420
else here I suppose because we know that

1061
00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:05,849
basically like you know I mean maybe

1062
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:07,920
this is the smarter thing to do right

1063
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:09,390
so we'll just get a blue in the case

1064
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,420
where you know neither of the other two

1065
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:14,068
were true at that point we should be

1066
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,670
able to see if this thing looks like an

1067
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:20,579
octahedron or what right and so looking

1068
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:25,139
at it here you know that that's not

1069
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:29,219
correct you know this this doesn't quite

1070
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:32,639
look like an octahedral map to me and so

1071
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:35,400
I think we've got a bug somewhere now it

1072
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,679
doesn't necessarily mean that we have a

1073
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:40,048
bug here you know for all I know this

1074
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,129
thing's writing into the thing wrong you

1075
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:44,759
know what I mean like this could be

1076
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:47,818
wrong right I'm going to look at the

1077
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:48,420
octahedral mapping first and see but I

1078
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:50,308
guess

1079
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,539
one way to test this as well would be if

1080
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:53,910
we now that we know that we're not

1081
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:56,039
seeing quite acht quite an octahedron

1082
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:57,929
what I could do is just say look well

1083
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:59,999
let's see if we're actually writing into

1084
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:02,129
this thing and the pattern we think so

1085
00:52:59,998 --> 00:53:05,308
if I set the light coordinate here what

1086
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:06,809
I could do is say look we know we've got

1087
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:08,789
two T X in the T Y and we know they're

1088
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:12,290
based on these values so let's just see

1089
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:15,680
what happens if I do TX /

1090
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:16,730
whatever this thing is right and and in

1091
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:17,868
fact you know what I don't even need to

1092
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,699
do that because we've already got it

1093
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:31,039
it's the O XY here that we're feeding in

1094
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:34,730
so let's just draw the yo XY and we'll

1095
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:39,019
draw the O XY as sort of a you know in

1096
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:42,530
red getting increasingly bright from

1097
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:44,480
left to right and blue I'm sorry green

1098
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:48,680
getting increasingly bright from up to

1099
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:51,289
down and so if we look at that what we

1100
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:53,868
can sort of see here is like at least

1101
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:56,059
nominally it sort of looks correct now

1102
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:57,500
there's some issues here so I'm not

1103
00:53:56,059 --> 00:54:00,230
really willing to say that this is

1104
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,690
correct because if you look at what

1105
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:06,710
we're getting if we look at these values

1106
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:08,300
a little bit more closely and you know

1107
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:10,340
we could zoom in even further on this

1108
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:13,550
for our purposes here so like you know

1109
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:23,570
let me go over to where we're specifying

1110
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:25,880
the the zoom so in here let's let's say

1111
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:27,230
that we want to keep this span around

1112
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,369
for a little bit but I'm gonna go ahead

1113
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:33,760
and zoom in like way in for a second

1114
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:39,400
just to visualize this more carefully

1115
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,400
right all right maybe not that far

1116
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:51,049
try that one more time so what you can

1117
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:55,340
see about this is I'm expecting or was

1118
00:54:51,050 --> 00:55:00,710
expecting to see a 10 by 10 right and if

1119
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:01,608
I look at the red I see 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

1120
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:08,858
8 9

1121
00:55:01,608 --> 00:55:08,858
ish I mean you know 1 2 3

1122
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:17,400
yeah I think you could make an argument

1123
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:19,559
pretty easily for 10 there you know what

1124
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:28,320
these are from negative 1 to 1 though so

1125
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:30,029
I guess I need to do this so maybe

1126
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,930
that's all that was

1127
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,930
hold on one second

1128
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:49,868
am I wrong about that right these are

1129
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:54,840
negative one to one so if I undo that

1130
00:55:49,869 --> 00:56:07,680
transform that doesn't look right at all

1131
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:10,920
the green is like Fulbright oh yeah

1132
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,919
sorry about that

1133
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:21,849
all right so if I look at this right

1134
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:25,659
what I'm trying to say here is I see

1135
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:30,280
this value looking like what I would

1136
00:56:25,659 --> 00:56:34,509
expect so 10 across but this is not

1137
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:36,670
looking at all like what I expect and so

1138
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,410
I've got some kind of a bug in there

1139
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:40,889
like I'm not understanding what's

1140
00:56:38,409 --> 00:56:46,079
happening with like the T Y value and

1141
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:48,670
I'm not sure why right and pun intended

1142
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,650
and so I need to figure out what's going

1143
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:53,829
wrong there and it could be that this

1144
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,660
packing here is wrong and it's kind of a

1145
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:57,338
mess so I could totally see that being

1146
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:59,920
the case so maybe we need to take a

1147
00:56:57,338 --> 00:57:03,130
second and actually figure out what the

1148
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,680
heck we want to do here for writing into

1149
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:08,230
these packed versions a little bit more

1150
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:10,509
cleanly but it really looks like we've

1151
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,519
got the Y wrong because our X values

1152
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:16,119
line up exactly the way I would expect

1153
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:17,889
them to and our Y values totally don't

1154
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:20,800
they look doubled up so it looks like

1155
00:57:17,889 --> 00:57:23,139
for example if I had to guess it looks

1156
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:27,970
like we're advancing the wrong amount

1157
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:30,639
for the next sheet or something so

1158
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:32,169
basically like we're we're not going

1159
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:36,219
where we should go for any particular

1160
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:39,700
cell right so if you look at what we're

1161
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:42,159
doing here this L index C is supposed to

1162
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:46,750
pick out like a particular pixel so that

1163
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:50,409
has to be able to map directly from a

1164
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,469
particular voxel location into where

1165
00:57:50,409 --> 00:57:53,539
that would go

1166
00:57:51,469 --> 00:58:02,108
in the texture right I mean that's

1167
00:57:53,539 --> 00:58:04,759
what's supposed to be happening here and

1168
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:06,199
we don't have to care about Elland XD at

1169
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,700
all because we're not debugging that

1170
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:09,578
texture and it's just the exact same

1171
00:58:07,699 --> 00:58:11,689
look up with a different variable anyway

1172
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:13,550
so I think what we want to do here is

1173
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,260
figure out what this equation actually

1174
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:16,970
should look like and try to make sure

1175
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,589
that it's actually right instead of

1176
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:21,199
being kind of messed up which appears to

1177
00:58:18,588 --> 00:58:23,980
be at the moment so if we take a look at

1178
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:26,059
what our parameters here actually are

1179
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:31,369
these parentheses don't really do

1180
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:33,440
anything right so so this is what we're

1181
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:36,650
actually looking at these are our actual

1182
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,869
you know parameters and if you look at

1183
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,940
how much we're going for each sheet in Z

1184
00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:47,329
we're basically saying look it's we're

1185
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:49,909
doing one entire voxels sheet times the

1186
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:55,150
size of each of the the lightmaps

1187
00:58:49,909 --> 00:59:05,299
and that seems like it makes sense for y

1188
00:58:55,150 --> 00:59:10,838
we're going let me rearrange this so for

1189
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:16,460
a while sheet we're moving down

1190
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:19,909
essentially that's saying we're gonna

1191
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:29,088
move down one complete dimensions worth

1192
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:34,098
of little squares right which also seems

1193
00:59:29,088 --> 00:59:38,349
reasonable for X we're moving by this

1194
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:38,349
dim and that

1195
00:59:49,480 --> 01:00:00,619
I'll be honest this doesn't really make

1196
00:59:52,090 --> 01:00:03,769
correct sense so no I mean I guess that

1197
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:05,630
does I mean yeah it does

1198
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:08,329
so basically like we start out moving by

1199
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:10,220
just however wide it is because for each

1200
01:00:08,329 --> 01:00:11,090
X voxel we have to go one whole sheet

1201
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:17,059
right

1202
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:20,210
and the TX there is you know mmm that's

1203
01:00:17,059 --> 01:00:24,590
moving by pixels so we go up one level

1204
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:28,070
and we now have to move by whatever the

1205
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:29,750
dimension of the voxel is but we also

1206
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:33,980
have to move by the dimension of the

1207
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:37,099
actual squares right so you're gaining

1208
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:39,769
like both of those on the voxel side of

1209
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:41,118
things I don't think this would have to

1210
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,009
do it because we're not packing them

1211
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,460
that way

1212
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:48,050
40y we need to move down by whatever the

1213
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,730
dimension of the thing is times the hot

1214
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:54,500
dim as well right I mean that does make

1215
01:00:49,730 --> 01:01:05,869
sense for each pixel wide we wise one we

1216
01:00:54,500 --> 01:01:09,710
need to go so that does seem right but

1217
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:14,000
again no you know what it's gonna be the

1218
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:20,530
this dimension is going to be sort of

1219
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,530
wrong because you still have to move

1220
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:31,170
yeah you know what I mean just looking

1221
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:41,160
at I still and I still I still don't see

1222
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:43,110
the bug there I mean it looks alright to

1223
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:47,009
me because another way to say this would

1224
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:57,630
just be look this is the amount we're

1225
01:01:47,010 --> 01:02:00,980
moving in y-you know we have to compute

1226
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:05,750
a y-coordinate and an x-coordinate the

1227
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:07,889
x-coordinate is ya is going to be

1228
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:09,360
obviously just like if you're trying to

1229
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:10,650
move a pixel at a time which would be

1230
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:20,420
this then it's not it's going to be

1231
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:25,289
unadulterated just happens by you going

1232
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:27,389
ten pixels over right so as far as X

1233
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:31,380
motion is concerned we are literally

1234
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:34,739
just talking about this right that's how

1235
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:37,740
we move in X and so anywhere that you

1236
01:02:34,739 --> 01:02:39,509
ever want to be XY z-- is literally just

1237
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:43,769
that there's nothing else that happens

1238
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:47,670
in X right for Y motion we kind of have

1239
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:52,289
a weird situation because Y motion is

1240
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:55,019
actually going in X in a sense because Z

1241
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:59,369
is how we laid out our sheets so in

1242
01:02:55,019 --> 01:03:03,840
order to move in why there's two things

1243
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:07,710
you have to do and you is because the

1244
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:10,380
actual squares are laid out in the UV as

1245
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:13,800
a square it means that when you move a

1246
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:16,410
pixel Y you have to actually just go by

1247
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:19,980
the entire length of the texture right

1248
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:22,829
and so I think that's the part that's a

1249
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:25,889
little confusing so in order to move the

1250
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:27,599
entire length of the texture well Z

1251
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:31,400
moves by the entire length of the

1252
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:33,449
texture by using hot dim times öktem

1253
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:37,710
right the entire length of the texture

1254
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:38,759
is going to be the x times the Y times

1255
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:44,010
the ox

1256
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:50,580
dim right so it's going to be it's going

1257
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:54,360
to be to move one pixel in Y you do have

1258
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:59,099
to move by the total number that there

1259
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:03,450
are times how many each the size of each

1260
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:05,869
one to get one y over and you're going

1261
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:10,139
in X at that point right you're going

1262
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:18,929
laterally and then in order to go an

1263
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:21,269
entire Y sheets worth of those like t y

1264
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:23,819
yeah so the part that I'm Trever back my

1265
01:04:21,269 --> 01:04:27,719
head around so T Y actually needs to be

1266
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:30,080
doing this totally differently like this

1267
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:30,079
is not

1268
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:54,900
this is still not correct let me just

1269
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,559
make sure I got this right

1270
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,559
so

1271
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:15,560
this is definitely correct this is

1272
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:18,619
moving by the number of those that are

1273
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:24,289
on one entire x sheet and it's moving

1274
01:05:18,619 --> 01:05:26,259
that number over that is wrong so this

1275
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:29,119
is the part that's wrong

1276
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:31,160
the reason it's incorrect is because

1277
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:33,969
there are many Y's next to each other

1278
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:41,210
and we need to account for those so

1279
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:43,069
actually this would only account for the

1280
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:45,500
number that there were in X so we're

1281
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:48,620
really that is actually what has to

1282
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,389
happen right it needs to account for the

1283
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:57,109
number there are an X and the number

1284
01:05:50,389 --> 01:05:59,690
there are and Y so yeah I believe that's

1285
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:03,820
actually how this needs to get encoded

1286
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:07,579
and well actually that's not true so I

1287
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:09,410
believe that's the first part of how it

1288
01:06:07,579 --> 01:06:14,659
asks get encoded right that has to

1289
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:17,359
happen that's how you move in into Y if

1290
01:06:14,659 --> 01:06:18,769
I nerf out these for a second because I

1291
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,230
want to think about this separately I'm

1292
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:23,119
curious is that now actually at least

1293
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:28,880
properly stepping through and I don't

1294
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:31,699
know how would I see that for some

1295
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,500
reason I don't see this doesn't seem to

1296
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:36,609
be changing it all which seems odd

1297
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:39,500
because given the fact that I'm

1298
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:41,750
manipulating how we're writing these out

1299
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,010
I suppose that maybe because it's

1300
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:47,360
writing to a different area or something

1301
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:49,130
so let me restart here and just see what

1302
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,760
we get we should get like nothing ill or

1303
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,760
something right yeah

1304
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:07,960
I'm gonna take the whole V fan just so I

1305
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:12,909
can see where that's writing now all

1306
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:15,490
right and so now I'm not seeing anything

1307
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:17,649
on here I'm gonna try the upper corner

1308
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:20,739
of that as well so when we're looking in

1309
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:23,380
here I'm gonna look when we take the UV

1310
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:27,219
span I'm gonna I'm sorry when we take

1311
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:36,789
the UV Center I'm going to re set the UV

1312
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:38,409
Center to be like the UV span like so so

1313
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:43,750
this would take the corner of the

1314
01:07:38,409 --> 01:07:46,328
texture the mid corner all right and so

1315
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:48,338
here you can see writing into the

1316
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:51,880
texture and now by the way it looks

1317
01:07:48,338 --> 01:07:55,389
correct right so if i zoom in on that

1318
01:07:51,880 --> 01:08:01,329
now from where we are I'll go back to

1319
01:07:55,389 --> 01:08:02,889
the zoomed version and it's only writing

1320
01:08:01,329 --> 01:08:04,990
one row which is how many I thought it

1321
01:08:02,889 --> 01:08:06,639
should right now we can see that we're

1322
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:10,539
actually writing we're you know our

1323
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:13,299
indexing is correct to this thing and so

1324
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:15,159
then if I go in here and say alright how

1325
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,569
do I start extending this out two more

1326
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:18,430
of these so that I could fill the next

1327
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:21,850
row I've got to make sure these things

1328
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:25,088
are indexing correctly so let's start

1329
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:28,420
with why now and remember no matter what

1330
01:08:25,088 --> 01:08:30,759
I do to Y in theory I should not be able

1331
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:34,690
to fill in another row because Y exists

1332
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:39,460
on only one row so each time we move in

1333
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:44,528
why I need to go hot dim times acht dim

1334
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:47,469
over right and this I think is wrong

1335
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:49,239
because this is not part right like

1336
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:51,819
think about what this is doing I'm

1337
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:54,759
saying I'm stacking these in the Y

1338
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:57,969
direction I'm sorry in the X direction

1339
01:08:54,759 --> 01:09:00,250
so that I have one row and then the next

1340
01:08:57,969 --> 01:09:02,230
row is just next to that row on the same

1341
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:05,619
row right so even though these are

1342
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:07,568
multiple rows logically I'm packing

1343
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:10,189
multiple rows together so I don't

1344
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:12,869
actually involve this part at all right

1345
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:14,669
moving by the voxel just moves by

1346
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:18,689
however many of these things you had to

1347
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:20,639
do to get to the next one so we're still

1348
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:25,399
going in Y at that point and we don't

1349
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:30,838
square our X our X pixel value like that

1350
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:32,278
oops so now if I look I should still

1351
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:35,278
have the same thing and I do which is

1352
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:38,460
actually good and so now all we need to

1353
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:40,230
do is move in Z and so Z is the first

1354
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:43,920
time we're actually gonna say look

1355
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:46,709
alright we need to move we know that

1356
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:50,520
each row is hot dim times hot been long

1357
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:55,800
and we also know that we need to skip

1358
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:59,369
over the öktem times the öktem because

1359
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:03,090
we are moving by entire squares now so I

1360
01:09:59,368 --> 01:10:04,710
think that's the entire equation that

1361
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:06,179
was a real Mindbender it shouldn't have

1362
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:08,460
been but it was just because I'm not

1363
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:12,020
used to packing a voxel into a square

1364
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:15,929
like that and so that looks much more

1365
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:17,550
valid all right so now if I can go back

1366
01:10:15,929 --> 01:10:19,380
thanks to our structured art we've

1367
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:21,420
eliminated one of our problems here now

1368
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:23,130
if I go back and take out the line where

1369
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,480
we switch UV centers I can go back and

1370
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:27,139
look at the place I was looking at

1371
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:30,059
before and hopefully now I'm gonna see

1372
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:31,139
the same thing so now everywhere should

1373
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,580
look like these little squares and it

1374
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:35,969
kind of does and that's what we wanted

1375
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:38,309
so now having gotten that bug out of the

1376
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:40,618
way we can switch back to looking at the

1377
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:43,560
view this way and see if we see anything

1378
01:10:40,618 --> 01:10:46,109
different now with setting our

1379
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,960
structured colors up here right so I'm

1380
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:54,469
entering this back on and turn this part

1381
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:57,989
off like so and now I should get

1382
01:10:54,469 --> 01:11:01,109
something in terms of where the how the

1383
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:06,928
octahedron looks right and so if we look

1384
01:11:01,109 --> 01:11:10,488
at how this is structured yeah like do I

1385
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:15,270
think that looks like an octahedral map

1386
01:11:10,488 --> 01:11:19,218
I mean it doesn't obviously not look

1387
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:23,650
like an octahedral map but I'm not

1388
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:25,750
really super confident

1389
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:28,089
what I'd like to start doing because

1390
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:31,810
it's hard for me to see which part of

1391
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:33,789
which this is I would like to go ahead

1392
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:39,970
and make it so that I'm actually gonna

1393
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:41,890
try to use the correct sampling here so

1394
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:45,340
when we go through and we're looking at

1395
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:48,430
T X T y what I want to do is actually

1396
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:52,029
only write into the places where we were

1397
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:59,460
supposed to write so instead of doing

1398
01:11:52,029 --> 01:12:10,420
this I'm gonna actually do this right

1399
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:14,140
and that way we will no longer be let me

1400
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:16,690
rephrase that I want to write only into

1401
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:18,970
the interior without using without using

1402
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:21,129
the edge pixels that we left to because

1403
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:23,199
we're going to copy those in later so

1404
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:25,180
when we actually go through these I want

1405
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,699
to effectively write into just the

1406
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:37,150
narrow part here so what I wanted to do

1407
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:39,819
is say look let's create something that

1408
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:43,569
only fills in the interior square like

1409
01:12:39,819 --> 01:12:45,729
so and we're never going to touch those

1410
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:46,840
edge pixels right those edge pixels are

1411
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:51,399
going to be like a totally different

1412
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:52,960
thing right and I'm then gonna go in

1413
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:56,619
maybe an add a pass that actually fills

1414
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,960
them right so now I can see what this

1415
01:12:56,619 --> 01:13:00,849
thing actually looks like right to see

1416
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,090
to what I sent it looks like an

1417
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:05,440
octahedral map at all and one of the

1418
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:07,510
things that I'm noticing curious just

1419
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,609
looking at it it kind of looks like

1420
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:11,350
maybe it's sort of like an octahedral

1421
01:13:09,609 --> 01:13:13,359
map but it's sort of off like I wonder

1422
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:16,110
if maybe the input here is a little bit

1423
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,109
off

1424
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:32,529
I mean I'm not entirely sure

1425
01:13:42,738 --> 01:13:48,138
I might go in and step it through this

1426
01:13:45,738 --> 01:13:51,229
code and look at what these oxly values

1427
01:13:48,139 --> 01:13:56,199
are just to satisfy myself that there's

1428
01:13:51,229 --> 01:13:59,178
no funny business going on but it looks

1429
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:02,268
it looks a little off like it shouldn't

1430
01:13:59,179 --> 01:14:07,489
probably have its center line like that

1431
01:14:02,269 --> 01:14:11,269
its symmetry looks a little bit broken

1432
01:14:07,488 --> 01:14:12,979
and while the fact that it's an eight by

1433
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:16,340
eight means that its symmetry isn't

1434
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:19,069
going to be perfect and that's okay it

1435
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,748
does make me a little concerned so I

1436
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:25,759
just want to I just want to kind of get

1437
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:29,828
that I want a little bit more assurance

1438
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:33,110
that there isn't something busted there

1439
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:36,229
before I go any further I'm gonna go to

1440
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:38,868
debug mode in remedy I'm going to ask it

1441
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:40,968
to stop the code at the point where

1442
01:14:38,868 --> 01:14:42,679
we're passing on those values and I just

1443
01:14:40,969 --> 01:14:45,050
want to see what the ranges of the

1444
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:46,670
values that we're passing right and I

1445
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:50,538
want to satisfy myself that they make

1446
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:58,690
sense so I'm gonna go to the watch

1447
01:14:50,538 --> 01:15:01,840
window here I'm gonna see what we get so

1448
01:14:58,689 --> 01:15:05,928
negative one is what I would expect

1449
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:11,828
stepping through these yeah exactly so

1450
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:18,980
I'm missing my last value right and I

1451
01:15:11,828 --> 01:15:20,029
guess I'm not sure oh it's you know what

1452
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:23,748
this is the problem right there

1453
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:27,649
so I was right I mean to the extent that

1454
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:30,229
we can call me being right today I mean

1455
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:32,960
I was wrong when I wrote the code this

1456
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:37,609
is supposed to go up to this value and

1457
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:44,809
include it right so we want this code to

1458
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:47,268
actually still look like it did that was

1459
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:48,288
just kind of an oversight in which

1460
01:15:47,269 --> 01:15:52,159
values we were supposed to be

1461
01:15:48,288 --> 01:15:53,960
considering so you know if we're going

1462
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,009
to the light color lookup squared dim

1463
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:59,158
minus one here we would need to

1464
01:15:56,010 --> 01:16:02,809
actually include that value if we ever

1465
01:15:59,158 --> 01:16:14,399
wanted this part to actually work right

1466
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:18,900
and so I think so I think that means

1467
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:20,518
this needs to subtract three right it

1468
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,198
needs to subtract the two that we've

1469
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:24,119
pulled off the edges and then one

1470
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:27,118
because we want to divide out to one

1471
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:29,788
exactly and so I think that's what we

1472
01:16:27,118 --> 01:16:35,009
need to do in order to get this lining

1473
01:16:29,788 --> 01:16:36,448
up I think right and that's starting to

1474
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:38,579
look actually a lot better I know it

1475
01:16:36,448 --> 01:16:40,408
looks a little worse inside here but

1476
01:16:38,578 --> 01:16:42,509
it's it's more symmetric now and these

1477
01:16:40,408 --> 01:16:45,210
are gonna be rounding error issues

1478
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:47,159
anyway in here not super concerned about

1479
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:49,230
those at the immediate moment this is

1480
01:16:47,158 --> 01:16:53,638
starting to look correct because these

1481
01:16:49,229 --> 01:17:00,448
blue parts here right just in terms of

1482
01:16:53,639 --> 01:17:01,590
how this is set up the way that the we

1483
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:02,638
probably want to try and color these a

1484
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,929
little differently I guess is the way I

1485
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:06,719
would say it because the way the

1486
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:10,880
octahedral mapping works is it's going

1487
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:15,389
to have you know things based more on

1488
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:17,819
whether or not you you know X or u plus

1489
01:17:15,389 --> 01:17:19,288
V is greater than 1 or less than 1 to

1490
01:17:17,819 --> 01:17:20,429
say whether you're outside of the octave

1491
01:17:19,288 --> 01:17:21,420
so it's not gonna produce a knock that's

1492
01:17:20,429 --> 01:17:22,559
gonna produce more like this

1493
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,130
checkerboard that we're actually seeing

1494
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:28,670
so that's actually fairly encouraging

1495
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:31,319
all right so I'm gonna go ahead now and

1496
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:33,239
verify that I can actually produce sort

1497
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:35,099
of an octahedron so what would we do

1498
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:39,678
here if we wanted to actually produce

1499
01:17:35,099 --> 01:17:46,469
you know an octahedron let's start by

1500
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:50,940
switching between the 0 the sample

1501
01:17:46,469 --> 01:17:53,069
direction 0 in one case right so let's

1502
01:17:50,939 --> 01:17:54,988
say that our light color is going to be

1503
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:56,460
you know 4 on the top of that of the

1504
01:17:54,988 --> 01:17:59,819
octagon or the bottom of the octagon

1505
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:02,750
we're gonna set our blue channel to 1 or

1506
01:17:59,819 --> 01:18:02,750
0 or something right

1507
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:10,349
so I'm gonna get rid of this for now

1508
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:13,948
and I'm gonna just just set the sample

1509
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:16,440
oops set the light C equal to a positive

1510
01:18:13,948 --> 01:18:20,159
or negative there and then what I'm

1511
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:25,469
gonna do is say look let's see which of

1512
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:32,639
the X quadrants were on let's see how do

1513
01:18:25,469 --> 01:18:35,069
I want to do this yeah I mean I think I

1514
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,449
think I can set these to just be you

1515
01:18:35,069 --> 01:18:51,840
know I mean I guess what I'm saying is

1516
01:18:36,448 --> 01:18:58,259
can I just do this can I just look at my

1517
01:18:51,840 --> 01:19:00,480
my quadrants and take a look at the

1518
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:02,219
light that way because that should give

1519
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:06,269
me something roughly resembling an

1520
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:09,810
octave octahedral map and we'll see

1521
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:12,780
where it goes so if we take a look here

1522
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:15,660
at what we're filling in you can kind of

1523
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:18,090
see that's a little bit wonky so you

1524
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:20,099
know we've got something that roughly

1525
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:23,489
resembles an octahedral map but it's not

1526
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:27,840
quite so the actual sample directions

1527
01:19:23,488 --> 01:19:30,439
here if the X was positive I measured it

1528
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,440
on it this way

1529
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:40,539
so yeah we take a look here if the X was

1530
01:19:38,289 --> 01:19:42,579
positive we're gonna see red and what

1531
01:19:40,539 --> 01:19:46,390
we're seeing here is that for some

1532
01:19:42,579 --> 01:19:48,609
reason as we get up to the top the X is

1533
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:50,890
not positive and I'm not sure why is

1534
01:19:48,609 --> 01:19:57,489
that because the X is zero there you

1535
01:19:50,890 --> 01:20:00,789
know perhaps I suppose we can figure it

1536
01:19:57,489 --> 01:20:04,479
out maybe by doing that just to see what

1537
01:20:00,789 --> 01:20:06,819
we get there yeah so basically like the

1538
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:08,859
X is positive what we're seeing is like

1539
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:12,579
the X is positive here in the octahedral

1540
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:16,779
map but also all through there and here

1541
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:19,539
and I'm not sure that that's correct if

1542
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:21,939
I remember correctly the way that like

1543
01:20:19,539 --> 01:20:24,039
you know if we just looked at the blue

1544
01:20:21,939 --> 01:20:28,119
you know like let's suppose that we made

1545
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:36,010
it a little easier on ourselves and

1546
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:37,750
knocked out the red and the green if we

1547
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:40,960
just looked at the blue what we would

1548
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:43,479
expect to see is only the this part

1549
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,529
would be in and the outside part would

1550
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:49,869
all be out basically right and that

1551
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:50,380
looks correct like that seems right to

1552
01:20:49,869 --> 01:20:53,880
me

1553
01:20:50,380 --> 01:21:00,460
so that part of the octahedral mapping I

1554
01:20:53,880 --> 01:21:05,739
mean seems right to me for the other

1555
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:08,529
part of the octahedral mapping let's

1556
01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:10,449
just take a look at the X so now what

1557
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:13,719
we're saying is this is the X side of

1558
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:17,880
the cube and I don't know that I believe

1559
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,880
that those should be set like that

1560
01:21:18,689 --> 01:21:26,049
the X is 0 through here so I guess maybe

1561
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:30,570
that's okay like we're saying that's

1562
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:30,570
actually equal to 0 literally right

1563
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:40,600
so I guess I might believe that too and

1564
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:42,819
now if I go through and just say like X

1565
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,320
and Z if I take a look at the Y I always

1566
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:49,210
try to see the same thing basically like

1567
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:51,519
this top part yeah so I can believe it

1568
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:53,230
I'll be honest I could believe it I

1569
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,500
could believe that we've got it going

1570
01:21:53,229 --> 01:22:00,639
now I don't want to say that with 100%

1571
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:03,520
confidence but I'm willing to believe

1572
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:07,329
that's more or less a correct octahedral

1573
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:11,170
map at that point so let's go ahead and

1574
01:22:07,329 --> 01:22:12,670
turn back on our actual lighting so that

1575
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:15,699
we can see what it looks like now that

1576
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:20,050
we've done that amount that limited

1577
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:22,079
amount of debugging and we'll see how it

1578
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:22,079
goes

1579
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:37,630
there we go all right so why can I not

1580
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:40,270
Oh cuz we're in debug mode my bad debug

1581
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:43,300
mode is very slow still because entirely

1582
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:45,130
the lighting good all right so now let's

1583
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:50,829
go ahead and take a look at how this

1584
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:58,119
this these maps look we may have to zoom

1585
01:22:50,829 --> 01:23:00,489
out a little bit now on them and I'll be

1586
01:22:58,119 --> 01:23:02,829
honest that looks a lot better right you

1587
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:05,139
see it kind of moving around sort of as

1588
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:06,819
if a light source were unwrapped into

1589
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:11,770
that octahedral no I mean I feel just a

1590
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:13,210
lot better about that in terms of the

1591
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:17,430
likelihood that now we're actually

1592
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:17,430
mapping the octahedral properly right

1593
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:25,630
I mean I just feel much better about I

1594
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:28,149
think you know those I thought there

1595
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:30,100
were bugs in there there were now it's

1596
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:32,170
looking a lot less like there's any bugs

1597
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:36,450
like that doesn't look super bugging me

1598
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:42,340
I'm gonna pop out a level here of

1599
01:23:36,449 --> 01:23:48,929
resolute zoom on the so so you know go

1600
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:51,789
back to maybe sort of the further up

1601
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:56,770
looking at a larger cross-section of the

1602
01:23:51,789 --> 01:24:02,680
map there and just see if that seems to

1603
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:06,640
continue to make sense so you know I'm

1604
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:09,450
I'm thinking that's not bad I'm thinking

1605
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,450
that's not bad right

1606
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:21,119
I'm pretty happy with that let's go

1607
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:24,930
ahead and go do a quick QA but I think

1608
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:27,119
we're good for today right Myra am I am

1609
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:35,159
I right on time so wait what would we

1610
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:36,630
use sir if we start at 12 no no wait

1611
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:38,430
we've got more time what time do we

1612
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:41,159
start here nine three mister okay okay

1613
01:24:38,430 --> 01:24:44,070
okay no I've got more time so great so

1614
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:46,559
let's go ahead and finish up the writing

1615
01:24:44,069 --> 01:24:51,359
side of the code and because now what we

1616
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:53,730
should be able to do is go in and do our

1617
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:56,130
copy right so we should be able to do

1618
01:24:53,729 --> 01:25:00,119
our copy back where we say look let's

1619
01:24:56,130 --> 01:25:01,800
just take those corner pixels and copy

1620
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:03,420
them in the other thing we could do is

1621
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,770
actually use the lighting now which I

1622
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:07,289
guess we could do maybe we'll throw that

1623
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:10,170
in because we have a little bit of time

1624
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:11,159
maybe maybe we'll do that if if we take

1625
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:13,859
a look at what would have to happen

1626
01:25:11,159 --> 01:25:16,470
there in our Z bias program we basically

1627
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:19,380
need to do the same stuff that we're

1628
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:23,520
doing in the main app right we need to

1629
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:25,739
be able to sample the lighting in the

1630
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,770
fragment shader which is gonna take a

1631
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:31,260
bunch of work right so if we take a look

1632
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:33,480
at what's going on in here and you know

1633
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:35,369
I really wish we could see this as

1634
01:25:33,479 --> 01:25:39,029
actual code you know regular code it

1635
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:40,739
would be nice I feel like we could

1636
01:25:39,029 --> 01:25:43,109
probably make that work in for coder at

1637
01:25:40,739 --> 01:25:44,670
some point but basically something where

1638
01:25:43,109 --> 01:25:47,789
we could just say like look just indent

1639
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:50,159
this like normal code right like you

1640
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:52,409
know take a take a look at what the

1641
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:54,630
value is here and we could say you know

1642
01:25:52,409 --> 01:26:06,239
hey for coder if you see a here doc

1643
01:25:54,630 --> 01:26:07,800
that's basically that right indent it

1644
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,989
normally because it would help a lot

1645
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:12,060
right for us to be able to read this

1646
01:26:09,989 --> 01:26:13,920
stuff and there's no reason we can't

1647
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:15,800
just do it that way it's just a question

1648
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,210
of for code or just needing to know that

1649
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,590
which I don't know if it's possible or

1650
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:22,289
not and on the gallons watching today

1651
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:25,670
but I do feel like that's something that

1652
01:26:22,289 --> 01:26:30,649
would be cool to have at some point

1653
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:34,199
yeah anyway uh so if we take a look in

1654
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:39,539
the main code here what's gonna happen

1655
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:42,899
is we do a you know a some like call to

1656
01:26:39,539 --> 01:26:45,000
get the lighting and then we multiply by

1657
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:46,349
that lighting and if you look at what

1658
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,859
happens to the sunlight call we just

1659
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:53,130
don't do anything currently right you

1660
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:57,689
know nothing happens now we know our

1661
01:26:53,130 --> 01:27:00,500
voxel uvw and our relative position in

1662
01:26:57,689 --> 01:27:02,879
the voxel and all that garbage right

1663
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:06,060
so we basically know how we would go

1664
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:08,880
about starting to look up this stuff but

1665
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:11,190
what we don't know at the moment is like

1666
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:13,260
how we actually would go about taking a

1667
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:15,929
voxel sample for each of these and what

1668
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:19,560
we're going to have to do right is we're

1669
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:22,650
going to have to produce our own manual

1670
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:25,140
sampling of the you know we're gonna

1671
01:27:22,649 --> 01:27:28,019
have to take eight samples ourself and

1672
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:29,940
blend those eight samples together now

1673
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,980
that's not horrible or anything right

1674
01:27:29,939 --> 01:27:35,329
it's it's not bad that we have to do

1675
01:27:31,979 --> 01:27:39,209
that but that is what we have to do and

1676
01:27:35,329 --> 01:27:42,899
so if we go in here and start to do that

1677
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:47,850
what we would need to do is find what

1678
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:51,059
the the eight corner voxel locations are

1679
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:53,490
two sample between and in order to do

1680
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:57,240
that we would take this voxel UVW

1681
01:27:53,489 --> 01:28:01,920
multiply it by the number of voxels per

1682
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:04,859
side to figure out where we are right so

1683
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,569
when we take the voxel relative P and

1684
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:08,339
multiply it by the inverse dim what

1685
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:11,119
we're gonna get is like something where

1686
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:13,770
we want to basically do like a floor a

1687
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:16,710
multiplied by the size and floor to

1688
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:18,570
figure out what voxel cell is like the

1689
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:21,210
bottom corner of us and then we're gonna

1690
01:28:18,569 --> 01:28:24,509
want to find the like upper corner and

1691
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:26,760
so on now if we just pass the voxel

1692
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:29,820
dimension in here which we can do right

1693
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:31,680
like we can just do a pound define for

1694
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:36,479
this right we can just say like pound

1695
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:38,490
define light lookup Fox lignin and

1696
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:44,129
that's just that's just a

1697
01:28:38,489 --> 01:28:46,920
you know a value we should be able to

1698
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:48,390
multiply to find what those voxel

1699
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,369
parameters are and then we should be

1700
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:53,039
able to take those samples using like a

1701
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:54,750
utility function so if we want to in

1702
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:59,310
here we should be able to say something

1703
01:28:54,750 --> 01:29:03,210
along the lines of all right voxel you

1704
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:06,720
know address or voxel I or something

1705
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:10,590
right that's just gonna be whatever the

1706
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:13,050
UVW was times whatever the heck this

1707
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:15,090
thing is right and I guess since we're

1708
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:18,270
in shader land we can actually just do a

1709
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:22,680
straight multiply like this and it

1710
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:26,520
should just work I think that gives us

1711
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:29,070
the actual voxel index and when we have

1712
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:34,380
the voxel index what we want to do then

1713
01:29:29,069 --> 01:29:36,329
is find the corners right so the corners

1714
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:44,279
are pretty easy to understand right

1715
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:54,439
there just like this sort of thing right

1716
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:54,439
so we've got that oscillating down and

1717
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:05,609
if we just pick out each possible

1718
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:08,369
additive permutation so going 1 in X 1

1719
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:11,429
in Y and 1 in Z in the voxel if we just

1720
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:13,739
do all the permutations of that that's 8

1721
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:15,930
right 2 to the third we get eight

1722
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:17,550
permutations those are the eight corners

1723
01:30:15,930 --> 01:30:19,260
of the voxel that we need to look up

1724
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:22,590
we've done this before it's nothing

1725
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:24,800
special right so if we want to take our

1726
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:27,060
light samples at each of those locations

1727
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,960
then we need to actually have some

1728
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,850
utility if I'm just going to take a

1729
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,159
voxel index look up where the light

1730
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:35,329
actually should be and give us back

1731
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:37,529
something we can actually use right now

1732
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:38,909
because we're gonna want to look up two

1733
01:30:37,529 --> 01:30:40,949
things we're gonna want to look up a

1734
01:30:38,909 --> 01:30:42,779
depth and a color and we want both of

1735
01:30:40,949 --> 01:30:44,670
the things then we want them both to

1736
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:46,349
come out I'm gonna go ahead and say we

1737
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:50,539
probably just want to do something where

1738
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:53,010
we actually call the sunlight function

1739
01:30:50,539 --> 01:30:57,170
we want to call like a function on each

1740
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:57,170
of those so like we want to do like a

1741
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:03,479
like an accumulate call or something

1742
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:07,829
like this right like we want to be able

1743
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:21,029
to do something where we're summing up

1744
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:22,769
these as we go and what we're going to

1745
01:31:21,029 --> 01:31:24,899
use here to figure out where in the

1746
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:27,480
voxel we actually go is gonna be like a

1747
01:31:24,899 --> 01:31:29,909
voxel look up UV that's for the the

1748
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:31,199
actual sub square and that's gonna be

1749
01:31:29,909 --> 01:31:33,389
based on the normal we're trying to

1750
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:36,710
sample we don't want to unwrap that

1751
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:40,230
every time so we want like an octahedral

1752
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:42,270
on you know we want to do that unpack at

1753
01:31:40,229 --> 01:31:44,159
some point and we're gonna want to pass

1754
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:47,310
that into the accumulator so that it can

1755
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:50,010
sample based on the direction it's

1756
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:54,840
supposed to actually be looking you know

1757
01:31:50,010 --> 01:32:04,409
I'm saying it's like what's the lighting

1758
01:31:54,840 --> 01:32:06,090
in that direction ah and I think I think

1759
01:32:04,409 --> 01:32:10,470
that's mostly all this would have to

1760
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:14,039
look like right and so each of these is

1761
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:16,530
going to want to do a sample into the

1762
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:18,060
voxel it's gonna give us back like a I

1763
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:19,800
guess we could do the accumulation here

1764
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:22,170
where it's just gonna give us back

1765
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:24,270
whatever the lighting was from that

1766
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:27,149
thing and we're gonna multiply it by

1767
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:29,070
some weighting value right like we're

1768
01:32:27,149 --> 01:32:32,159
just gonna be doing like well what's a

1769
01:32:29,069 --> 01:32:34,710
voxel it's it's one of you know if we're

1770
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:36,630
summing these things together

1771
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:38,970
oh well no we're not we're gonna need to

1772
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:41,000
do the trilinear blend now that I think

1773
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:44,520
about it so we're gonna actually want

1774
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,470
this to be getting the values out of

1775
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:51,860
these from a try linear blend it's not

1776
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:54,780
going to want to do the accumulation now

1777
01:32:51,859 --> 01:32:57,119
there's a slight issue here which is

1778
01:32:54,779 --> 01:33:01,679
that when we're doing the blend I'm not

1779
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:04,130
sure I'm not sure where we take the

1780
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:05,780
depth into account because we'll have

1781
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:08,270
depth and we'll say I guess could we

1782
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:18,319
have seen it or not and you know I don't

1783
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:19,520
really know we should probably go back

1784
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:21,408
and look at the original paper for how

1785
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,900
to do the sampling there what they think

1786
01:33:21,408 --> 01:33:24,948
a good way to do it is but I'm just I'm

1787
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:26,809
trying to figure out how this code

1788
01:33:24,948 --> 01:33:29,238
should work ideally what we would do is

1789
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:32,810
we'd get back the depth we get both back

1790
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:34,549
both of the things I'm just not sure how

1791
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:36,590
you actually structure that in a shader

1792
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:39,529
like in C we just create a struct and

1793
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:41,210
we'd return it in a shader you can sort

1794
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:46,309
of do that but I'm not sure to what

1795
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:49,069
extent you can actually do that Oh duh

1796
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:50,989
you know what we'll just use a v4 so do

1797
01:33:49,069 --> 01:33:52,130
RGB and we'll stick in the a we'll stick

1798
01:33:50,988 --> 01:33:54,289
the depth that way we don't have to

1799
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:56,480
worry about can you declare structures

1800
01:33:54,289 --> 01:33:58,219
and shaders in in GLSL 3 which I don't

1801
01:33:56,479 --> 01:33:59,928
know if you can eventually you know in

1802
01:33:58,219 --> 01:34:01,760
later shader versions you definitely can

1803
01:33:59,929 --> 01:34:04,579
- don't know about 3

1804
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:14,360
all right so we'll just say like this is

1805
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:16,519
sample s 0 0 0 right and this way we can

1806
01:34:14,359 --> 01:34:18,889
just write down what these are so we're

1807
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:30,830
saying like look it's something like

1808
01:34:18,889 --> 01:34:33,560
this I guess so we've got all the

1809
01:34:30,829 --> 01:34:36,550
samples coming out that way and this

1810
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,550
will just be like

1811
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:54,609
so we'll get all the lighting out that

1812
01:34:52,359 --> 01:34:56,529
way and that'll be a fairly simple

1813
01:34:54,609 --> 01:34:58,988
lookup once we have the octahedral

1814
01:34:56,529 --> 01:35:00,759
unwrapping it's basically just figuring

1815
01:34:58,988 --> 01:35:02,408
out where in the voxel you are or where

1816
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,998
in the texture sheet you are pulling out

1817
01:35:02,408 --> 01:35:06,368
the value and giving it to us that's all

1818
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:08,708
it has to do and it could do both of the

1819
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:10,448
samples and pack them together and then

1820
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:15,099
all we need to do is actually do our

1821
01:35:10,448 --> 01:35:17,649
lerp so we have our vox uvw here what we

1822
01:35:15,099 --> 01:35:19,659
don't know is where you actually are in

1823
01:35:17,649 --> 01:35:23,679
it so when we actually do this light

1824
01:35:19,658 --> 01:35:26,288
lookup voxel dim times the uvw here

1825
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:30,849
right this thing when we do this vox i

1826
01:35:26,288 --> 01:35:37,859
we want to floor that but if we also

1827
01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:39,819
want to know you know so I guess this is

1828
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:41,498
actually how you would sort of do it

1829
01:35:39,819 --> 01:35:48,188
right we would get the I Vic 3 out of

1830
01:35:41,498 --> 01:35:50,288
that but anyway so you want to floor

1831
01:35:48,189 --> 01:35:52,150
that and this is actually going to be we

1832
01:35:50,288 --> 01:35:55,300
want both of these so we want to store

1833
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:58,629
what the offset was where we were in the

1834
01:35:55,300 --> 01:36:01,958
actual texture there and so where we

1835
01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:04,569
were like in the actual voxel and so I'm

1836
01:36:01,958 --> 01:36:06,399
gonna like call this like Vox relative

1837
01:36:04,569 --> 01:36:09,340
or something so we've done would say Vox

1838
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:11,618
our you know - equals fox I so that way

1839
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:13,659
we have the relative coordinate and the

1840
01:36:11,618 --> 01:36:15,339
like absolute coordinates we know like

1841
01:36:13,658 --> 01:36:20,168
the fractional part and the non

1842
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:23,229
fractional part right we'll put the

1843
01:36:20,168 --> 01:36:25,408
unwrapping here when we do this we'll

1844
01:36:23,229 --> 01:36:29,110
have the information we actually need to

1845
01:36:25,408 --> 01:36:32,768
look up into the light location I would

1846
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:33,880
think and we can probably do this in a

1847
01:36:32,769 --> 01:36:36,010
better way because these would all be

1848
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,418
fixed offsets so we can probably as

1849
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:38,949
compute those offsets ourselves and

1850
01:36:37,418 --> 01:36:40,238
speed up this routine so this this is

1851
01:36:38,948 --> 01:36:41,738
not gonna probably the way we want do it

1852
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:43,748
eventually but just to keep things a

1853
01:36:41,738 --> 01:36:46,299
little bit simpler and then we'll

1854
01:36:43,748 --> 01:36:48,458
actually do the blend here so we're

1855
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:52,149
gonna call this the result will return

1856
01:36:48,458 --> 01:36:53,500
this result and here in the result call

1857
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:55,329
what we want to do is

1858
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:58,960
is actually take all of these values and

1859
01:36:55,329 --> 01:37:01,029
and blend them together right so it's

1860
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,899
gonna be one of these heinous lerp sorts

1861
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:09,460
of things but we can do it sort of in in

1862
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:17,019
stages right so we can take and create

1863
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:19,029
some interim values here and I don't

1864
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:21,220
really remember did we define the lerp

1865
01:37:19,029 --> 01:37:26,409
ourselves I don't even remember how we

1866
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:28,329
did this stuff yeah we did so we made

1867
01:37:26,409 --> 01:37:29,529
our own lerp ATB so we can just go ahead

1868
01:37:28,329 --> 01:37:31,449
and write this the way we would normally

1869
01:37:29,529 --> 01:37:33,399
write it because we made a macro that

1870
01:37:31,449 --> 01:37:36,609
turns it into a shader speak as

1871
01:37:33,399 --> 01:37:37,629
necessary so we can make these lerp and

1872
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:39,939
basically what we're going to do is

1873
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:41,710
remove one dimension each time I mean

1874
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:44,139
that's all we're doing here right so s

1875
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:47,710
zero zero zero we want to remove the

1876
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:51,450
variants on Z so we've got two right and

1877
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:51,449
in each one of these is just going to do

1878
01:37:53,520 --> 01:38:03,010
each one of these is just going to do

1879
01:37:55,569 --> 01:38:06,039
one of these right so that would remove

1880
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:07,360
one dimension out each time and which

1881
01:38:06,039 --> 01:38:09,789
dimension we're going to use right so

1882
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:13,239
well it's just Z so we know that the the

1883
01:38:09,789 --> 01:38:15,819
Vox our Z is the value that tells us how

1884
01:38:13,239 --> 01:38:18,849
much Z we should blend right how much we

1885
01:38:15,819 --> 01:38:20,679
should blend to the the next z1 and then

1886
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:28,840
we can do the same thing to take the the

1887
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:31,119
last dimension out of it right so now

1888
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:39,699
we've got the same thing we've got you

1889
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:42,760
know 0 0 and 0 1 and 1 0 and 1 1 and

1890
01:38:39,699 --> 01:38:47,079
that would you know be removing the Y

1891
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:49,539
dimension and then the final one for the

1892
01:38:47,079 --> 01:38:52,659
light sample is just blending those two

1893
01:38:49,539 --> 01:38:54,850
together on X and then we've got our

1894
01:38:52,659 --> 01:38:56,139
result if we want it now eventually

1895
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:57,400
we're gonna want to do more stuff here

1896
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,770
cuz we're gonna have we're gonna

1897
01:38:57,399 --> 01:39:00,789
actually want to do the reflection

1898
01:38:58,770 --> 01:39:04,480
probably in a in a smarter way

1899
01:39:00,789 --> 01:39:07,130
or you know whatever the diffuse blend

1900
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:09,179
and and all that nonsense

1901
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:13,680
so I don't know exactly what we're gonna

1902
01:39:09,180 --> 01:39:16,170
want to do here with respect to that and

1903
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:20,190
if we look at how this is working right

1904
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:26,460
so this is the reflection vector but you

1905
01:39:20,189 --> 01:39:28,769
know if the surface is very diffused

1906
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:30,090
it's just gonna be reflecting general

1907
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:31,500
lighting so we may want to also do some

1908
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:33,210
things where we control like the MIPS

1909
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,380
sampling of this thing so we've got a

1910
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:36,449
bunch of stuff we're probably gonna want

1911
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:38,699
to play with for right now though let's

1912
01:39:36,449 --> 01:39:41,789
just say we're gonna take the reflection

1913
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:44,429
vector and we're gonna unwrap it and use

1914
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:47,489
that for the lighting so we would need

1915
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:49,200
our octahedral where we say look we've

1916
01:39:47,489 --> 01:39:52,949
got a unit vector and we need to put it

1917
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:56,550
into octahedral space so we're

1918
01:39:52,949 --> 01:39:59,729
effectively gonna have to do this right

1919
01:39:56,550 --> 01:40:02,610
now in order to do this we don't have to

1920
01:39:59,729 --> 01:40:05,459
do it as badly as we were doing it

1921
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:11,009
before right we can actually be a little

1922
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:13,140
bit more clever here because we have the

1923
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:15,360
ability to do like swizzles and stuff so

1924
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:17,820
instead of having to do the stuff we

1925
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:23,059
were doing before we could do this more

1926
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:27,899
compactly if we want to so first of all

1927
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:30,830
we can do here where we say like here's

1928
01:40:27,899 --> 01:40:36,829
the ox right so we take the one norm

1929
01:40:30,829 --> 01:40:36,829
that's going to be taking the R vector

1930
01:40:36,949 --> 01:40:42,179
and then we're gonna say all right let's

1931
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:44,340
go ahead and divide that out that gives

1932
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:46,170
us effectively the result so that's what

1933
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:49,020
we wanted and then all we really have to

1934
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:51,770
do is say oh well though we do have to

1935
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:56,340
do a thing where we we take whatever the

1936
01:40:51,770 --> 01:41:00,900
the when the Z is negative right we have

1937
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:04,640
to then say okay let's update the XY to

1938
01:41:00,899 --> 01:41:04,639
be equal to this equation right

1939
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:19,140
so then what we need to say is our ain't

1940
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:23,130
if the Z is negative we're going to have

1941
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:24,630
to take the sign of the thing that we

1942
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:26,369
were talking about before it doesn't

1943
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:28,050
matter which side the signs will be the

1944
01:41:26,369 --> 01:41:30,720
same because this won't change the sign

1945
01:41:28,050 --> 01:41:32,760
so we can take the sign either of acht

1946
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:35,550
or of our I don't think it matters which

1947
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:38,970
one and so maybe we'll take the sign of

1948
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:40,289
our might be the better way to do it

1949
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:43,050
and then we want to take the absolute

1950
01:41:40,289 --> 01:41:47,579
value of the octahedral sample so that

1951
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:49,739
should be acht I believe and this should

1952
01:41:47,579 --> 01:41:57,930
be what we actually want to produce

1953
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:59,639
right so we want to take the absolute

1954
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:03,000
value and then we want that sign of I

1955
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:09,710
don't know that we have an ability to do

1956
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:12,539
sign of in the way that we would need to

1957
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:16,500
right maybe I might have to put this

1958
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:19,319
back sign of in this case is supposed to

1959
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:22,710
produce positive or negative it's never

1960
01:42:19,319 --> 01:42:27,179
supposed to produce zero and I don't

1961
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:32,670
actually know what the definition of

1962
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:38,789
sign of is there like I don't really

1963
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:45,560
know what GLSL defines that to be like

1964
01:42:38,789 --> 01:42:45,560
what is it so if we look

1965
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:52,079
yeah like sign up doesn't really help us

1966
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:56,039
because or the one that they have the

1967
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:58,500
sign call will will incorrectly produce

1968
01:42:56,039 --> 01:43:01,909
zero when we didn't actually want it to

1969
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:01,909
do that right

1970
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:16,670
so I guess we will have to implement

1971
01:43:13,789 --> 01:43:19,609
that ourselves unfortunately I don't

1972
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:23,179
know and we can look in fact I think we

1973
01:43:19,609 --> 01:43:27,639
actually saw this if we go back and look

1974
01:43:23,179 --> 01:43:32,750
at the actual values that rupes in the

1975
01:43:27,639 --> 01:43:35,900
reference version so we downloaded the

1976
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:39,399
light probe part here and in the

1977
01:43:35,899 --> 01:43:43,879
supplement that gave the code right and

1978
01:43:39,399 --> 01:43:53,779
the code for the octahedral wrapping and

1979
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:55,550
unwrapping was in here did we aim you

1980
01:43:53,779 --> 01:44:03,109
know what I think we maybe had to look

1981
01:43:55,550 --> 01:44:05,590
it up in yeah I think we maybe looked it

1982
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:05,589
up in here

1983
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:19,500
yeah so this is how they implemented it

1984
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:23,170
right and if you look at what they did

1985
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:27,609
you can see that they had to write this

1986
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:29,680
themselves and so I don't think they

1987
01:44:27,609 --> 01:44:32,079
would have done that if there was a

1988
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:36,250
convenient if the GPU actually had a

1989
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:39,189
call for that thing I don't think they

1990
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:42,369
would have done that so my assumption

1991
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:44,589
here is that we just have to write it

1992
01:44:42,369 --> 01:44:46,630
ourselves right because it doesn't look

1993
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:52,150
like there's any way to do it otherwise

1994
01:44:46,630 --> 01:44:54,300
so they need like sign of you know we

1995
01:44:52,149 --> 01:44:57,539
need we need to do it ourselves

1996
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:57,539
like this

1997
01:45:13,479 --> 01:45:20,919
and I think that's just the way it's

1998
01:45:16,449 --> 01:45:24,159
gonna have to be right so I don't know

1999
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:27,190
if they've got sign of if we define sign

2000
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:31,659
of in here so we have sign and we

2001
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:35,979
defined that as sign and our sign of is

2002
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:38,920
not that right and it doesn't work the

2003
01:45:35,979 --> 01:45:42,009
same way so we kind of need that to be

2004
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:45,119
like that this is actually sign or zero

2005
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:49,320
in a sense and we don't really want that

2006
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:53,019
so let's see what else we got here

2007
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:55,210
all right let's try to debug that shader

2008
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:56,520
we got a few minutes actually so we

2009
01:45:55,210 --> 01:45:58,989
don't really have any minutes left but

2010
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:02,050
let's just try to get the compile errors

2011
01:45:58,988 --> 01:46:03,609
out of it how about that so let me go

2012
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:07,720
ahead and take a look at what the errors

2013
01:46:03,609 --> 01:46:18,579
are here in the program of this this

2014
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:30,780
will be what fragment errors absolute

2015
01:46:18,579 --> 01:46:35,649
value let's go ahead and get that

2016
01:46:30,779 --> 01:46:39,329
straightened out sample lighting that's

2017
01:46:35,649 --> 01:46:39,329
true we haven't done that yet

2018
01:46:47,929 --> 01:47:11,550
so here's sample lighting maybe

2019
01:46:58,198 --> 01:47:12,629
something like that seems reasonable not

2020
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:17,520
sure we're actually gonna put in here

2021
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:20,699
but I suppose right now if I just stuff

2022
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,500
it with white we will at least not ruin

2023
01:47:20,698 --> 01:47:34,908
our rendering because it'll just light

2024
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:34,908
with nothing all right what else we got

2025
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:54,500
undefined variable Vox eye is that true

2026
01:47:41,698 --> 01:47:54,500
that is true I agree

2027
01:48:00,828 --> 01:48:06,509
all right and so now in theory we've

2028
01:48:04,828 --> 01:48:09,658
actually got this set up and so tomorrow

2029
01:48:06,509 --> 01:48:12,019
we'll go to QA for now but tomorrow we

2030
01:48:09,658 --> 01:48:14,788
should be able to move over into

2031
01:48:12,019 --> 01:48:19,048
actually sampling these and seeing what

2032
01:48:14,788 --> 01:48:21,478
we can get out of them pretty happy with

2033
01:48:19,048 --> 01:48:22,889
that we're in good position we had a

2034
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:25,829
bunch of bugs I knew there were bugs we

2035
01:48:22,889 --> 01:48:28,859
got rid of them so we'll be in good

2036
01:48:25,828 --> 01:48:30,868
shape to like get some more bugs out

2037
01:48:28,859 --> 01:48:32,159
tomorrow because now we're gonna have to

2038
01:48:30,868 --> 01:48:33,088
get the lighting sampling working and

2039
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:34,948
I'm sure that'll be a little bit buggy

2040
01:48:33,088 --> 01:48:37,288
too but we'll we'll get there slowly but

2041
01:48:34,948 --> 01:48:40,728
surely all right let's go ahead and go

2042
01:48:37,288 --> 01:48:40,728
to quick QA I don't got any

2043
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,590
up the cooter was asking if I could show

2044
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:39,659
the octahedral map with linear blending

2045
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:42,060
sure let me go run it again all right so

2046
01:49:39,658 --> 01:49:43,408
here's an active object let's get to a

2047
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:48,150
position where it's relatively good so

2048
01:49:43,408 --> 01:49:50,988
there's a you know there's an octahedral

2049
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:53,368
map area you can you can pretty much see

2050
01:49:50,988 --> 01:49:57,868
that it's you know doing something

2051
01:49:53,368 --> 01:50:00,089
probably correct I mean you know I'm not

2052
01:49:57,868 --> 01:50:04,259
confident we completely debug this thing

2053
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:07,650
yet to say the least but I'll go in here

2054
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:12,780
now and I'll switch from you know over

2055
01:50:07,649 --> 01:50:22,500
to the linear so if we go down to how

2056
01:50:12,779 --> 01:50:29,670
we're doing our our filtering so here's

2057
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:31,170
linear in a second there you go and you

2058
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:33,359
know there's not a huge difference right

2059
01:50:31,170 --> 01:50:38,300
obviously it's just it's just smooth it

2060
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:42,649
I mean it's pretty small texture so but

2061
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:42,650
it's exactly what we would expect to see

2062
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:46,789
and we'll switch back

2063
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:27,130
can you say a few words about octahedral

2064
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:29,408
mapping there's not a lot to say about

2065
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:32,380
it if you just go back and read this

2066
01:51:29,408 --> 01:51:34,089
watch the streams where we implemented

2067
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:39,340
it it's pretty easy to understand but I

2068
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:42,519
mean this is the diagram this is it in a

2069
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:46,739
nutshell it takes a sphere it Maps it on

2070
01:51:42,519 --> 01:51:49,989
to a square you can think of it as first

2071
01:51:46,738 --> 01:51:52,478
sort of shrink wrapping the sphere onto

2072
01:51:49,988 --> 01:51:54,879
an octahedron so to tetrahedrons one

2073
01:51:52,479 --> 01:51:57,630
facing up when it facing down and then

2074
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:00,519
just unwrapping so that the top part of

2075
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:02,650
you know the part that's facing up the

2076
01:52:00,519 --> 01:52:05,229
top hemisphere comes into this middle

2077
01:52:02,649 --> 01:52:07,179
part here and then the bottom part is

2078
01:52:05,229 --> 01:52:18,039
just unfolded so that it has somewhere

2079
01:52:07,179 --> 01:52:19,359
to go right that's it um kind of off

2080
01:52:18,038 --> 01:52:20,889
topic have you ever been at a point

2081
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:24,458
where you thought that programming might

2082
01:52:20,889 --> 01:52:28,179
not be the right thing for you yeah sure

2083
01:52:24,458 --> 01:52:32,170
and I would say I currently think it's

2084
01:52:28,179 --> 01:52:34,328
not the right thing for me I really love

2085
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:39,510
programming I think it's it's awesome

2086
01:52:34,328 --> 01:52:39,509
and I love doing it I still pretty much

2087
01:52:39,538 --> 01:52:45,458
enjoy anytime I'm actually programming I

2088
01:52:42,538 --> 01:52:48,309
would say that doing it as a job is just

2089
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:51,538
a really bad idea these days there

2090
01:52:48,309 --> 01:52:55,269
there's absolutely no interest in the

2091
01:52:51,538 --> 01:52:58,658
current computing landscape there's

2092
01:52:55,269 --> 01:53:02,320
absolutely no interest in doing a good

2093
01:52:58,658 --> 01:53:04,958
job there's no interest in trying to

2094
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:06,788
make good computers there's no interest

2095
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:08,439
in trying to make good operating systems

2096
01:53:06,788 --> 01:53:13,689
there's no interest in trying to make

2097
01:53:08,439 --> 01:53:17,408
good tools and so I would say probably

2098
01:53:13,689 --> 01:53:21,189
95% of what I do is just cleaning up

2099
01:53:17,408 --> 01:53:23,379
other people's crap I get to actually

2100
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:27,669
program things that I actually wanted to

2101
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:32,439
program so rarely and it's really really

2102
01:53:27,670 --> 01:53:34,809
sad and so I would say that that I don't

2103
01:53:32,439 --> 01:53:37,179
think I ever really had much of a doubt

2104
01:53:34,809 --> 01:53:41,500
or and still don't that I love

2105
01:53:37,179 --> 01:53:43,719
programming and love doing it you know I

2106
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:47,050
think you could make the analogy to to

2107
01:53:43,719 --> 01:53:49,599
probably any other industry at some

2108
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:56,980
point that industry becomes like so

2109
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:58,480
distorted and useless that you know it's

2110
01:53:56,979 --> 01:54:03,428
it's not really about the thing that

2111
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:10,948
it's nominally about and I guess I would

2112
01:54:03,429 --> 01:54:13,868
say if you loved cooking but the only

2113
01:54:10,948 --> 01:54:19,118
way to get paid cooking was to work at

2114
01:54:13,868 --> 01:54:21,158
McDonald's then at some point you might

2115
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:26,679
be asking yourself why you're doing it

2116
01:54:21,158 --> 01:54:28,929
right because it's not really cooking I

2117
01:54:26,679 --> 01:54:30,250
mean it technically is like technically

2118
01:54:28,929 --> 01:54:34,000
if you recommend Alice you are cooking

2119
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:36,819
but you're not really doing the thing

2120
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,859
that you would call cooking if you were

2121
01:54:36,819 --> 01:54:44,769
talking about it separately and so

2122
01:54:40,859 --> 01:54:48,069
that's the modern programming industry

2123
01:54:44,770 --> 01:54:49,750
right the modern program industry is all

2124
01:54:48,069 --> 01:54:52,090
programmers effectively are now working

2125
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:54,429
at McDonald's they like to pretend that

2126
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:57,520
they're not but they are and so what

2127
01:54:54,429 --> 01:55:01,420
you're doing is not programming it's you

2128
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:04,360
know taking a chicken patty out of a

2129
01:55:01,420 --> 01:55:06,609
freezer it's already been fried you're

2130
01:55:04,359 --> 01:55:09,639
putting it into a microwave and pushing

2131
01:55:06,609 --> 01:55:11,198
a button and you're not even putting in

2132
01:55:09,639 --> 01:55:13,809
the time you're just pushing the button

2133
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:16,149
that says chicken patty out it comes and

2134
01:55:13,809 --> 01:55:19,029
you put it in a wrapper the wrapper is

2135
01:55:16,149 --> 01:55:22,448
on a stack that you grab and then you

2136
01:55:19,029 --> 01:55:28,509
hand it to a customer right and so at

2137
01:55:22,448 --> 01:55:33,908
that point you're just like I mean so

2138
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:36,579
yeah you could try to and and I do try

2139
01:55:33,908 --> 01:55:42,038
to then say all right I'm gonna go spend

2140
01:55:36,578 --> 01:55:44,170
the time to build my own like you know

2141
01:55:42,038 --> 01:55:46,658
I'm gonna go learn to be a carpenter so

2142
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:48,289
I can build an actual place that's not a

2143
01:55:46,658 --> 01:55:50,119
McDonald's and then I'm gonna

2144
01:55:48,289 --> 01:55:51,470
figure out how to build like a stove and

2145
01:55:50,119 --> 01:55:53,989
put that in there and like all this

2146
01:55:51,470 --> 01:55:55,130
stuff right and start a farm to actually

2147
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:58,130
make the ingredients so that I can

2148
01:55:55,130 --> 01:56:00,920
actually then cook again right and you

2149
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:03,440
know I tried to do that but at some

2150
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:07,760
level it's like kind of a bit Sisyphean

2151
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:09,259
and at some part when you're right in

2152
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,329
the middle of it you kind of go why am i

2153
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:12,680
doing all like I don't really want to do

2154
01:56:11,329 --> 01:56:14,210
all this stuff you know I don't want to

2155
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:15,770
write an operating system or I didn't

2156
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:18,230
really want to write a standard library

2157
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:20,630
or something or I didn't want to or in

2158
01:56:18,229 --> 01:56:23,029
case of you know someone like Jonathan

2159
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:25,190
Blow it's like maybe he does enjoy

2160
01:56:23,029 --> 01:56:27,469
making a language but it's sometimes

2161
01:56:25,189 --> 01:56:29,899
it's also why the heck does he have to

2162
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:31,730
make a language like he's one of the I

2163
01:56:29,899 --> 01:56:34,039
mean I'm one of these like the greatest

2164
01:56:31,729 --> 01:56:37,099
game designer of all time I mean he's

2165
01:56:34,039 --> 01:56:38,659
certainly from my perspective the tubes

2166
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:41,420
got to make a programming language I

2167
01:56:38,659 --> 01:56:44,720
mean good on him for doing it but come

2168
01:56:41,420 --> 01:56:46,250
on I mean how much wasted intellectual

2169
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:47,600
power is going to this stuff because the

2170
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:50,810
people who were supposed to be doing the

2171
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:53,120
stuff just didn't care right or suck and

2172
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:55,460
so at some level it's just really it's

2173
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:59,539
really sad and so I definitely feel like

2174
01:56:55,460 --> 01:57:01,489
I'm in that place and I you know I am

2175
01:56:59,539 --> 01:57:03,050
and not a game designer or any of that

2176
01:57:01,489 --> 01:57:04,729
stuff so it's not like my talents are

2177
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:06,949
being wasted like they are with John's

2178
01:57:04,729 --> 01:57:08,449
maybe and waste is the wrong word cuz he

2179
01:57:06,949 --> 01:57:11,750
probably will design a cool language but

2180
01:57:08,449 --> 01:57:15,529
it's like a ton of potential there's a

2181
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:17,300
ton of games you won't play because you

2182
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:19,369
know the people who make all of this

2183
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:20,779
stuff suck and John's spending his time

2184
01:57:19,369 --> 01:57:22,430
figuring out how to do stuff like get

2185
01:57:20,779 --> 01:57:24,439
Visual Studio to install properly and

2186
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:27,950
replacing the programming language you

2187
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:29,029
know I'm saying and so I think it's a

2188
01:57:27,949 --> 01:57:30,500
really depressing time to be a

2189
01:57:29,029 --> 01:57:32,090
programmer it's horrible if you actually

2190
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:32,989
care it's a great time to be a

2191
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:34,460
programmer if you just want a job

2192
01:57:32,989 --> 01:57:36,829
because there's a ton of jobs and they

2193
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:38,600
pay really well so if all you want to do

2194
01:57:36,829 --> 01:57:40,279
is make some money it's a great time to

2195
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:41,660
be a programmer if you really love

2196
01:57:40,279 --> 01:57:44,710
programming it's a terrible time to be a

2197
01:57:41,659 --> 01:57:44,710
programmer that's how I'd say

2198
01:57:49,340 --> 01:57:55,260
have you ever used or heard of spherical

2199
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:56,430
gaussians before I have heard of them

2200
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:57,840
before I have never worked them before

2201
01:57:56,430 --> 01:58:00,600
was exactly the same aspherical

2202
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:02,220
harmonics so my understanding is

2203
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:04,110
spherical harmonics versus spherical

2204
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:05,730
gaussians the difference there is

2205
01:58:04,109 --> 01:58:09,289
basically what's the basis function that

2206
01:58:05,729 --> 01:58:13,379
you're going to apply to the sphere to

2207
01:58:09,289 --> 01:58:15,899
project your functions on right so you

2208
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:17,640
have some lighting functions I mean

2209
01:58:15,899 --> 01:58:18,750
usually they're discrete so it's calling

2210
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:21,900
a function maybe it's wrong room you

2211
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:25,170
have a lighting set of lighting samples

2212
01:58:21,899 --> 01:58:26,929
and you want to project those onto the

2213
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:29,460
sphere and potentially compress them

2214
01:58:26,930 --> 01:58:30,840
circle harmonics are you know Fourier

2215
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:33,210
style so they're gonna be like sine

2216
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:36,239
cosine lobe shape things that are

2217
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:37,590
defined over the sphere right circle

2218
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:39,000
gaussians although I've never looked at

2219
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:40,829
them I assume are just Gaussian

2220
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,720
functions on a sphere right because why

2221
01:58:40,829 --> 01:58:44,970
not I mean you can you can use any basis

2222
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:46,170
function you want they don't even have

2223
01:58:44,970 --> 01:58:48,390
to be orthogonal right you can define

2224
01:58:46,170 --> 01:58:50,520
anything you want as functions on a

2225
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:52,610
sphere and you can decompose functions

2226
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:54,810
on the sphere into those basis functions

2227
01:58:52,609 --> 01:58:55,859
so my assumption would just be that

2228
01:58:54,810 --> 01:58:58,190
that's what they are but I've never

2229
01:58:55,859 --> 01:59:00,659
looked at them before so I don't know

2230
01:58:58,189 --> 01:59:02,939
you know I wouldn't be in a position to

2231
01:59:00,659 --> 01:59:04,139
talk about trade-offs between say why

2232
01:59:02,939 --> 01:59:06,000
would you use a spherical harmonic

2233
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:08,400
function instead of a spherical Gaussian

2234
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:13,939
function because not having work with

2235
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:16,979
them either myself I I just don't have I

2236
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:18,960
just don't have any intuition for you

2237
01:59:16,979 --> 01:59:20,699
know where they go wrong I'm sure

2238
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,869
there's reasons why you would use one of

2239
01:59:20,699 --> 01:59:23,789
the other otherwise you wouldn't have

2240
01:59:21,869 --> 01:59:28,710
them but you know I'm the one person

2241
01:59:23,789 --> 01:59:30,390
asked i remember we moved away from

2242
01:59:28,710 --> 01:59:31,680
manual try linear filtering on vox

2243
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:33,090
samples because it was a lot of texture

2244
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:35,820
bandwidth how is this better than the

2245
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:39,960
old approach so actually this is really

2246
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:40,920
pretty interesting as an approach I'm

2247
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:44,609
pretty excited about it

2248
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:50,850
so if you remember correctly we were

2249
01:59:44,609 --> 01:59:54,089
previously saying that we had our so

2250
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:57,090
previously we're saying look we're gonna

2251
01:59:54,090 --> 01:59:59,010
have to have six textures and each of

2252
01:59:57,090 --> 02:00:00,480
those textures we're going to have to

2253
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:02,610
sample

2254
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:04,739
our selves right so we had each of the

2255
02:00:02,609 --> 02:00:08,699
six directions was sort of I think what

2256
02:00:04,739 --> 02:00:10,319
we had stuffed in there and I it was a

2257
02:00:08,699 --> 02:00:14,279
lot of texture bandwidth to blend those

2258
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:15,539
first and then look at the results it

2259
02:00:14,279 --> 02:00:18,359
wouldn't be a lot of texture bandwidth

2260
02:00:15,539 --> 02:00:20,699
to just blend the thing first and

2261
02:00:18,359 --> 02:00:24,000
produce one vector sample and then

2262
02:00:20,699 --> 02:00:26,099
return it right but even doing that

2263
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,930
would have required us to sample at

2264
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:28,760
least three of the directions and blend

2265
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:31,050
them together

2266
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:33,570
the thing about octahedral Sammy that's

2267
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:35,820
so nice is the texture card does that

2268
02:00:33,569 --> 02:00:39,449
first blend for you so imagine you're

2269
02:00:35,819 --> 02:00:41,699
gonna do one trilinear blend well you

2270
02:00:39,449 --> 02:00:43,909
know that's going to be for lips to lips

2271
02:00:41,699 --> 02:00:46,500
one lerp right

2272
02:00:43,909 --> 02:00:50,849
now if you had to do that on six

2273
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:54,149
directions that's six times those seven

2274
02:00:50,850 --> 02:00:58,770
lips right six times seven is twenty too

2275
02:00:54,149 --> 02:01:02,129
much stuff on the other hand if you

2276
02:00:58,770 --> 02:01:04,830
blended first well now you still have to

2277
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:06,810
take at least three samples of each of

2278
02:01:04,829 --> 02:01:11,609
the voxels blend those together and then

2279
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:13,710
do the seven lips right and so you still

2280
02:01:11,609 --> 02:01:15,929
have three times seven with the

2281
02:01:13,710 --> 02:01:18,060
octahedral sampling it's just one times

2282
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:22,430
seven you look up and you let the

2283
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:32,430
bilinear blend do the lerp do the first

2284
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:35,280
smush down for you right so it is very

2285
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:37,380
nice it takes out one entire step of the

2286
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:42,000
process for us which is great both in

2287
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:47,670
terms of making it simpler but also in

2288
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:51,649
terms of of less work like less actual

2289
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:51,649
GPU work so it's faster to I would think

2290
02:01:54,420 --> 02:01:59,460
do you think step back step X times 2

2291
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:04,170
minus 1 could be faster than our current

2292
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:14,250
sign implementation I would seriously

2293
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:16,109
doubt it I mean you know I'd have to

2294
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:17,369
think pretty hard about it and obviously

2295
02:02:16,109 --> 02:02:18,929
you'd want to time it if you actually

2296
02:02:17,369 --> 02:02:22,590
cared about the performance of that

2297
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:25,440
particular thing but you know if you

2298
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:27,000
take a look at that where was it as a

2299
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:29,359
biased program here if you take a look

2300
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:33,380
at what we wrote

2301
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:38,670
so that sign up function right is

2302
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:42,449
compare and then select so you're

2303
02:02:38,670 --> 02:02:43,289
talking about two instructions to

2304
02:02:42,449 --> 02:02:45,449
implement this

2305
02:02:43,289 --> 02:02:48,269
whereas what you're talking about is 3

2306
02:02:45,449 --> 02:02:52,829
it's at least step a multiply and

2307
02:02:48,270 --> 02:02:57,120
subtract so pretty sure it'd be hard to

2308
02:02:52,829 --> 02:02:59,220
beat this is there a reason you think

2309
02:02:57,119 --> 02:03:01,470
step x 2 minus 1 was faster maybe I can

2310
02:02:59,220 --> 02:03:03,300
answer it better that way why is the

2311
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:05,130
depth not red squares I think that's

2312
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:06,750
just cuz we haven't actually touched

2313
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:08,039
that part of the routine I can go ahead

2314
02:03:06,750 --> 02:03:12,779
and fix that for you if it's bugging you

2315
02:03:08,039 --> 02:03:14,819
I don't I don't mind I agree that might

2316
02:03:12,779 --> 02:03:18,119
be kind of annoying so if you take a

2317
02:03:14,819 --> 02:03:20,489
look here you can see we've got the

2318
02:03:18,119 --> 02:03:23,489
original set of vertices X stuff here

2319
02:03:20,489 --> 02:03:25,590
and then we've got this one I didn't

2320
02:03:23,489 --> 02:03:26,789
really look at what this was set to it

2321
02:03:25,590 --> 02:03:29,779
looks like it's drawing in the right

2322
02:03:26,789 --> 02:03:34,800
place so let me just see if we got the

2323
02:03:29,779 --> 02:03:38,399
UV x' set up correctly here looks like

2324
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:40,980
we do so I don't know if it's possibly

2325
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:46,379
possibly a problem where we didn't

2326
02:03:40,979 --> 02:03:51,149
submit the texture properly or dimension

2327
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:53,670
it properly I'm not sure we should look

2328
02:03:51,149 --> 02:03:56,420
at that because this looks like it's 16

2329
02:03:53,670 --> 02:04:00,600
by 9 again which suggests to me that's

2330
02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:02,190
something's a little off right but I

2331
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,510
don't know I would I'd like to look at

2332
02:04:02,189 --> 02:04:05,069
that a little bit later if you don't

2333
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:07,230
mind I'd rather not get into it now

2334
02:04:05,069 --> 02:04:08,159
because it's the pre but yeah we would

2335
02:04:07,229 --> 02:04:09,629
like to fix that

2336
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:11,039
it doesn't look like it's anything

2337
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:12,630
obviously wrong so I think it's probably

2338
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:16,890
there's probably something broken about

2339
02:04:12,630 --> 02:04:19,109
it right I think you just didn't play

2340
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:21,210
the fix oh right that's a good point

2341
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:23,939
we're not actually writing into it

2342
02:04:21,210 --> 02:04:41,279
correctly yet are we so so we wouldn't

2343
02:04:23,939 --> 02:04:43,949
expect to be right like this oops so

2344
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:46,500
this code here right this is correct but

2345
02:04:43,949 --> 02:04:48,479
this is not so I'm assuming that if we

2346
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:49,619
just did this maybe that would be

2347
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:50,669
sufficient I don't actually know that

2348
02:04:49,619 --> 02:04:53,640
that's true maybe we might have other

2349
02:04:50,670 --> 02:05:02,670
problems in there but yeah if we just

2350
02:04:53,640 --> 02:05:04,470
changed it to octi dim here that that

2351
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:10,710
might be all all that's wrong I don't

2352
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:13,199
actually know so yeah I think that was

2353
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:14,609
all that was wrong since we don't right

2354
02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:17,989
into those pics fit yeah so that was

2355
02:05:14,609 --> 02:05:20,099
that was it thanks for reminding me that

2356
02:05:17,989 --> 02:05:21,779
we were not writing anything into there

2357
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:23,460
yet but we were using the index is wrong

2358
02:05:21,779 --> 02:05:31,559
so even though we were just writing read

2359
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:32,670
it was it was incorrect do you have any

2360
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:34,020
opinion on potential new computing

2361
02:05:32,670 --> 02:05:35,550
devices or platforms ie mobile

2362
02:05:34,020 --> 02:05:38,300
operations of tablets and devices or

2363
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:40,770
anything interesting going on no I

2364
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:41,940
haven't seen anything interesting if

2365
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:43,650
anything it's less interesting because

2366
02:05:41,939 --> 02:05:46,619
there are things that devices that are

2367
02:05:43,649 --> 02:05:47,609
made to be more locked down usually what

2368
02:05:46,619 --> 02:05:50,970
do you think of Carmack working on

2369
02:05:47,609 --> 02:05:56,880
general AI I don't really have a thought

2370
02:05:50,970 --> 02:06:00,600
on it I mean Carmack's even older than I

2371
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:03,989
am so at this point I feel like at the

2372
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:07,079
point in the career at his at the point

2373
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:09,029
he is in his career I mean you know how

2374
02:06:07,079 --> 02:06:10,229
much programming do any of us have left

2375
02:06:09,029 --> 02:06:13,469
he should just be doing whatever he

2376
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:16,500
wants so I think if he's interested in

2377
02:06:13,470 --> 02:06:17,789
doing AI that's what he should do I mean

2378
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:19,819
you should do what's interesting to him

2379
02:06:17,789 --> 02:06:26,960
you know

2380
02:06:19,819 --> 02:06:29,809
I mean already you know made a bunch of

2381
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,220
significant impacts on the world not

2382
02:06:29,810 --> 02:06:33,260
just the programming industry but you

2383
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:34,490
know I mean he's more than made his mark

2384
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:36,130
he should just be do he should just be

2385
02:06:34,489 --> 02:06:48,079
doing whatever he wants

2386
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:49,400
if he elects he should be doing it some

2387
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:51,559
people already mentioned this but it'd

2388
02:06:49,399 --> 02:06:52,849
be cool to see more handmade chats talks

2389
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:54,770
with guests as siddur estimate of the

2390
02:06:52,850 --> 02:06:56,840
data compression topic Charles yeah I I

2391
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:59,360
do agree with that I probably wouldn't

2392
02:06:56,840 --> 02:07:01,909
do it though is the bi-linear sampling

2393
02:06:59,359 --> 02:07:03,769
from the octahedral map exact then or is

2394
02:07:01,909 --> 02:07:05,769
there some distortion due to the way we

2395
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:07,970
are mapping the sphere in two dimensions

2396
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:08,990
yeah I mean of course there's there's a

2397
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:10,190
distortion the distortion is

2398
02:07:08,989 --> 02:07:11,899
specifically the projection

2399
02:07:10,189 --> 02:07:18,739
it's the projection from a sphere to an

2400
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:20,269
octahedron so so I'm not I'm not sure to

2401
02:07:18,739 --> 02:07:22,510
me about that it's I wouldn't

2402
02:07:20,270 --> 02:07:26,210
necessarily say that the bi-linear part

2403
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:28,640
specifically is a distortion because

2404
02:07:26,210 --> 02:07:31,250
it's hard to claim that by linear in

2405
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:35,119
particular is distortion but just the

2406
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:37,850
map itself is a distortion right so by

2407
02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:39,769
definition the octahedron itself is

2408
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:41,810
under sampling certain parts of the

2409
02:07:39,770 --> 02:07:46,550
sphere and over sampling other parts of

2410
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:53,950
it and you know I don't I don't know

2411
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:56,449
that there's any particular reason why

2412
02:07:53,949 --> 02:08:02,500
you would blame the bilinear for being

2413
02:07:56,449 --> 02:08:02,500
somehow worse or whatever right

2414
02:08:08,720 --> 02:08:12,600
we'd ever consider doing a tutorial on

2415
02:08:11,069 --> 02:08:15,899
testing for something like a library

2416
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:21,030
where it's important to be thorough yeah

2417
02:08:15,899 --> 02:08:23,670
I mean there probably be some parts on

2418
02:08:21,029 --> 02:08:31,409
testing in the course when I release the

2419
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:38,000
course math Damon says I thought ours

2420
02:08:31,409 --> 02:08:38,000
might be scalar but was just a guess I

2421
02:08:38,029 --> 02:08:44,969
thought ours might be scalar but was

2422
02:08:40,979 --> 02:08:57,839
just yes I don't know what that means

2423
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:59,940
I thought ours might be scalar I'm sorry

2424
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:02,850
I don't know everything in this in this

2425
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:10,889
shader is scalar so I'm not sure what

2426
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:12,210
that means can if Allah says what other

2427
02:09:10,890 --> 02:09:13,800
than the games at my rocket are you

2428
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:15,300
working on referring to the cleaning up

2429
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:16,949
other people's mess you said earlier

2430
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:21,449
maybe I misunderstood well I mean but

2431
02:09:16,949 --> 02:09:23,489
everything right so anything you're

2432
02:09:21,449 --> 02:09:24,899
doing today when you make a game is

2433
02:09:23,489 --> 02:09:26,729
cleaning up someone's mess almost

2434
02:09:24,899 --> 02:09:29,789
exclusively like the amount of time you

2435
02:09:26,729 --> 02:09:32,279
spend on the game is almost zero or

2436
02:09:29,789 --> 02:09:35,250
vanishingly close to it I mean it

2437
02:09:32,279 --> 02:09:38,759
doesn't matter what part you look at

2438
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:42,119
it's someone else's mess you have

2439
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:43,860
artists how do they make stuff well like

2440
02:09:42,119 --> 02:09:46,380
in our case they make it in Photoshop

2441
02:09:43,859 --> 02:09:47,579
Photoshop sockem pleat disaster loses

2442
02:09:46,380 --> 02:09:49,109
most of the information you would

2443
02:09:47,579 --> 02:09:50,939
actually want but there's not much we

2444
02:09:49,109 --> 02:09:53,339
can do about it it writes out a file

2445
02:09:50,939 --> 02:09:54,389
format that's garbage that doesn't have

2446
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:56,340
a lot of the stuff that you actually

2447
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:58,619
need it doesn't really allow you to

2448
02:09:56,340 --> 02:10:01,680
clean the annotate things so all of that

2449
02:09:58,619 --> 02:10:03,840
stuff is tiff we have to work around we

2450
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:06,240
work on file systems that don't properly

2451
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:09,869
track changes so I have to write tools

2452
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:13,920
that do all of that work you don't have

2453
02:10:09,869 --> 02:10:16,680
any way in most things to cleanly like

2454
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:22,109
set up you know servers or stuff like

2455
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:23,850
this using shared net shared drives

2456
02:10:22,109 --> 02:10:25,049
networks don't work properly we have to

2457
02:10:23,850 --> 02:10:26,340
keep our machines disconnected from the

2458
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:27,930
internet because otherwise Windows 10

2459
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:30,360
ruins them all the time

2460
02:10:27,930 --> 02:10:32,340
our Wacom drivers I had to recently

2461
02:10:30,359 --> 02:10:34,380
figure out how to get Anna's machine to

2462
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:35,730
stop pausing for several seconds all the

2463
02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:37,260
time it turns out it's because Wacom

2464
02:10:35,729 --> 02:10:39,359
drivers we're trying to spy on you now

2465
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:41,070
and they send information back to HQ and

2466
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:42,479
of course our machines aren't plugged to

2467
02:10:41,069 --> 02:10:46,259
the Internet so that was causing a stall

2468
02:10:42,479 --> 02:10:48,209
like I mean all my I spend all my time

2469
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:50,430
working around the fact that nobody

2470
02:10:48,210 --> 02:10:56,850
makes anything that doesn't suck anymore

2471
02:10:50,430 --> 02:10:58,619
right and you know eventually someday

2472
02:10:56,850 --> 02:11:00,450
maybe I'll have made enough stuff that

2473
02:10:58,619 --> 02:11:03,739
like and in some cases I do you know

2474
02:11:00,449 --> 02:11:07,439
like I do think we've made some progress

2475
02:11:03,739 --> 02:11:08,670
at Mali for example like nowadays I'm

2476
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:10,259
completely insulated from anything

2477
02:11:08,670 --> 02:11:11,550
Microsoft does like it doesn't matter

2478
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:15,090
what Microsoft does Microsoft could

2479
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:17,369
completely crap up everything now and it

2480
02:11:15,090 --> 02:11:20,670
would be okay we don't use their SDKs we

2481
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:22,800
don't use any parts of their IDE we

2482
02:11:20,670 --> 02:11:25,199
don't even really need their compiler

2483
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:28,050
although we can use it but we kept like

2484
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:33,630
a isolated copy so we don't update it

2485
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:35,550
right and so like you know I'm working

2486
02:11:33,630 --> 02:11:40,289
on getting us to a point where less and

2487
02:11:35,550 --> 02:11:43,409
less things are important but it's hard

2488
02:11:40,289 --> 02:11:45,510
right and so most of the work that you

2489
02:11:43,409 --> 02:11:48,689
do nowadays just does not involve

2490
02:11:45,510 --> 02:11:51,510
programming game it's working around all

2491
02:11:48,689 --> 02:11:54,419
of the disastrous crap that has been

2492
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:57,570
crapped out and is getting worse by the

2493
02:11:54,420 --> 02:12:01,230
day whether that's Photoshop or Windows

2494
02:11:57,569 --> 02:12:04,590
or the compiler or you know the debugger

2495
02:12:01,229 --> 02:12:06,539
thank God you know George wrote a new

2496
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:07,980
debugger otherwise I don't know what

2497
02:12:06,539 --> 02:12:09,659
we'd do

2498
02:12:07,979 --> 02:12:11,429
probably I'd be writing debugger right

2499
02:12:09,659 --> 02:12:13,170
now right it's like it's that bad and

2500
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:15,680
what and the editor was the same way I

2501
02:12:13,170 --> 02:12:18,149
had to write my own editor basically and

2502
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:20,930
you know thank God Allen made for coders

2503
02:12:18,149 --> 02:12:23,429
so I had something to start with right

2504
02:12:20,930 --> 02:12:25,409
but it's ridiculous that that's the case

2505
02:12:23,430 --> 02:12:27,659
I mean it's ridiculous that Emacs is

2506
02:12:25,409 --> 02:12:30,920
what it is now right and I had to switch

2507
02:12:27,659 --> 02:12:30,920
from it because it's such a pile

2508
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:56,190
quicksearch says step X might be

2509
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:58,288
hardware-accelerated it works on v2 and

2510
02:12:56,189 --> 02:13:02,819
his branchless not sure how impactful it

2511
02:12:58,288 --> 02:13:04,889
actually is so I think I would just take

2512
02:13:02,819 --> 02:13:07,948
a second to say you're probably not

2513
02:13:04,889 --> 02:13:10,859
thinking about shader code properly at

2514
02:13:07,948 --> 02:13:14,299
that point so first of all everything in

2515
02:13:10,859 --> 02:13:16,819
a shader is hard for accelerated right

2516
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:20,929
so really what we're talking about is

2517
02:13:16,819 --> 02:13:24,768
what is it doing nothing works on a v2

2518
02:13:20,929 --> 02:13:27,658
there's no such thing as v2 s on a GPU

2519
02:13:24,769 --> 02:13:30,929
what a v2 actually is is just two scalar

2520
02:13:27,658 --> 02:13:32,488
ops right and so it's important when

2521
02:13:30,929 --> 02:13:35,130
you're looking at scalar is to

2522
02:13:32,488 --> 02:13:44,759
understand that scalars themselves are

2523
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:47,219
not so a GPU goes wide by looking at

2524
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:50,369
multiple pixels at a time or multiple

2525
02:13:47,219 --> 02:13:53,788
fragments it doesn't go wide by working

2526
02:13:50,368 --> 02:13:57,868
on vectors right so when you say v4 in a

2527
02:13:53,788 --> 02:14:01,828
shader it's not operating on a v4 it's

2528
02:13:57,868 --> 02:14:04,380
four separate scalar operations one for

2529
02:14:01,828 --> 02:14:07,408
the X 1 for the Y 1 for the Z 1 for the

2530
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:10,170
you know W and what's happening is it's

2531
02:14:07,408 --> 02:14:12,808
doing 16 or 32 of those at a time

2532
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:16,769
because it's doing 16 pixels at a time

2533
02:14:12,809 --> 02:14:18,869
or 32 pixels at a time right so there's

2534
02:14:16,769 --> 02:14:22,139
no such thing as if something that

2535
02:14:18,868 --> 02:14:24,479
operates on a v2 it's all just scalar

2536
02:14:22,139 --> 02:14:28,710
code and it goes wide by going pixel

2537
02:14:24,479 --> 02:14:31,529
wide right it's not operating on a v2

2538
02:14:28,710 --> 02:14:34,319
there's that's no such thing so what

2539
02:14:31,529 --> 02:14:36,210
you're trying to do is minimize the

2540
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:39,389
number of actual operations that have to

2541
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:42,269
happen it doesn't matter how wide they

2542
02:14:39,389 --> 02:14:45,779
appear to you because skate shaders are

2543
02:14:42,269 --> 02:14:47,940
always full width they never go under

2544
02:14:45,779 --> 02:14:51,118
the width of a you know a 4 by 4

2545
02:14:47,939 --> 02:14:57,598
fragment or a 4 by 4 fragment block or

2546
02:14:51,118 --> 02:15:00,359
whatever they're doing right so take

2547
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:02,730
that one part the second part where you

2548
02:15:00,359 --> 02:15:05,578
say branchless again doesn't really

2549
02:15:02,729 --> 02:15:08,968
apply to shaders so the way that shaders

2550
02:15:05,578 --> 02:15:11,009
is there predicated there are such

2551
02:15:08,969 --> 02:15:12,929
things as branch testing in shaders but

2552
02:15:11,010 --> 02:15:15,119
they're only to test around large blocks

2553
02:15:12,929 --> 02:15:16,770
of code and only if none of the things

2554
02:15:15,118 --> 02:15:19,828
that are being processed go through that

2555
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:22,020
block so if you have something where

2556
02:15:19,828 --> 02:15:26,158
you're either doing one thing or another

2557
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:27,659
thing always so every possible thing

2558
02:15:26,158 --> 02:15:30,179
that goes through this code will either

2559
02:15:27,658 --> 02:15:34,439
get a negative one or a one based on the

2560
02:15:30,179 --> 02:15:37,050
value that is always branch this anyway

2561
02:15:34,439 --> 02:15:39,178
what it will do is it will say here's

2562
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:42,029
the values for the one thing so one one

2563
02:15:39,179 --> 02:15:43,139
one one one one here's the value other

2564
02:15:42,029 --> 02:15:46,050
thing negative one negative one negative

2565
02:15:43,139 --> 02:15:48,900
one negative one and all it will do is

2566
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:51,420
say issue the comparison which then

2567
02:15:48,899 --> 02:15:55,170
produce a mask value and the mask value

2568
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:57,929
just says alright I've got 16 pixels so

2569
02:15:55,170 --> 02:15:59,730
I'm sixteen wide for each pixel I did

2570
02:15:57,929 --> 02:16:02,279
the comparison and just built the mask

2571
02:15:59,729 --> 02:16:04,109
zeroes for ones that worked ones for

2572
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:05,880
ones that are sorry ones for places

2573
02:16:04,109 --> 02:16:12,779
where it was true zeros for worse false

2574
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:17,520
right and then it just uses that mask to

2575
02:16:12,779 --> 02:16:20,729
and to select right between the two

2576
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:23,010
possible outcome values so it's always

2577
02:16:20,729 --> 02:16:25,138
branchless to do the question mark

2578
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:26,730
operator right all you're doing is just

2579
02:16:25,139 --> 02:16:28,380
saying it converts it and then does a

2580
02:16:26,729 --> 02:16:31,078
select on the two values one for each

2581
02:16:28,380 --> 02:16:35,130
pixel so what we wrote is both

2582
02:16:31,078 --> 02:16:36,779
branchless and full-width already does

2583
02:16:35,129 --> 02:16:39,000
that make sense it screws you understand

2584
02:16:36,779 --> 02:16:41,340
that difference because you don't want

2585
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:45,439
to think about v2s as of unit of

2586
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:49,549
computation in a GPU because it's not I

2587
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:49,550
think it's important to remember that

2588
02:16:53,239 --> 02:16:57,539
did you get any traction or 30 million

2589
02:16:55,469 --> 02:16:58,559
line problem video in terms of people

2590
02:16:57,540 --> 02:17:01,381
line to collaborate with better

2591
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:02,939
programming of the Harvard directly from

2592
02:17:01,380 --> 02:17:07,739
software people sure but never from

2593
02:17:02,940 --> 02:17:09,510
anyone hardware side I enjoyed your talk

2594
02:17:07,739 --> 02:17:11,130
on epi designed by see that it's 15

2595
02:17:09,510 --> 02:17:13,020
years old to have your thoughts changes

2596
02:17:11,130 --> 02:17:15,630
it's still the model you follow yeah I

2597
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:19,649
mean I might have a little bit more to

2598
02:17:15,630 --> 02:17:21,239
say but honestly I in a rare instance of

2599
02:17:19,649 --> 02:17:22,591
foresight I would say that pretty much

2600
02:17:21,239 --> 02:17:26,100
everything I said in that talk is just

2601
02:17:22,591 --> 02:17:30,059
right I mean it it seems to just be true

2602
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:34,260
I don't know if it will ever be wrong

2603
02:17:30,059 --> 02:17:36,239
because it's just like yep they just

2604
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:42,120
seemed to be fundamental principles at

2605
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:43,979
some level and you know you might change

2606
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:45,780
a few things about some of them in

2607
02:17:43,979 --> 02:17:49,079
certain languages where you have access

2608
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:51,480
to a few features right so you know in

2609
02:17:49,079 --> 02:17:56,190
places where closures or something are

2610
02:17:51,479 --> 02:17:57,449
more common you you may end up thinking

2611
02:17:56,190 --> 02:17:59,100
about the flow control part a little bit

2612
02:17:57,450 --> 02:18:02,790
differently right but for the most part

2613
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:04,319
I think that just I got lucky and it

2614
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:08,040
turns out that those things are more

2615
02:18:04,319 --> 02:18:09,360
timeless than a lot of the things that I

2616
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:10,740
mean probably look back that I said are

2617
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:15,569
probably just nonsense but that one

2618
02:18:10,739 --> 02:18:19,440
seems pretty pretty relevant we're gonna

2619
02:18:15,569 --> 02:18:19,921
find concrete resource on QT lighting no

2620
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:23,399
idea

2621
02:18:19,921 --> 02:18:26,280
I don't really know even what that means

2622
02:18:23,399 --> 02:18:27,869
you mean just like if you wanted to

2623
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:41,820
apply the lighting equations but not in

2624
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:43,500
three demand that software generally

2625
02:18:41,819 --> 02:18:45,091
sucks what do you think you're letting

2626
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:46,680
get to you too much there's something to

2627
02:18:45,091 --> 02:18:48,750
say about staying positive side the mask

2628
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:50,790
yeah you know if I had a paycheck I'd

2629
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:53,130
stay positive but at least for the time

2630
02:18:50,790 --> 02:18:55,381
being where you know it's very stressful

2631
02:18:53,130 --> 02:18:57,059
for me trying to manage lots of projects

2632
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:58,229
and and looking back and realizing that

2633
02:18:57,059 --> 02:19:00,209
I'm spending most of my time trying to

2634
02:18:58,229 --> 02:19:01,649
clean stuff up that had nothing to do

2635
02:19:00,209 --> 02:19:04,289
with what I was trying to do it's it's

2636
02:19:01,649 --> 02:19:06,170
it's no it's it's not I don't really

2637
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:13,400
know of a way to stay positive it's

2638
02:19:06,170 --> 02:19:14,478
point where soon the major changes you

2639
02:19:13,399 --> 02:19:18,590
have made to four code are worth

2640
02:19:14,478 --> 02:19:19,429
mentioning I don't I'm sorry don't know

2641
02:19:18,590 --> 02:19:22,069
what that means

2642
02:19:19,429 --> 02:19:26,750
I streamed when when Alan and I were

2643
02:19:22,069 --> 02:19:28,189
doing the the four coder jams and and he

2644
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:29,808
put in all the changes like all the

2645
02:19:28,189 --> 02:19:31,760
changes I asked for that I worked with

2646
02:19:29,808 --> 02:19:33,049
him on and and I did some of the changes

2647
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:35,750
and then submitted them back there he

2648
02:19:33,049 --> 02:19:38,209
did them all so the new for coder has

2649
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:40,159
all the things that that I had changed

2650
02:19:38,209 --> 02:19:42,289
so all the stuff I do on stream now is

2651
02:19:40,159 --> 02:19:43,939
all in for coder now like the jumping to

2652
02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:45,620
functions and highlighting by type

2653
02:19:43,939 --> 02:19:47,960
correctly and all that stuff that's all

2654
02:19:45,620 --> 02:19:50,410
in there now all the hooks are there I

2655
02:19:47,959 --> 02:19:52,489
don't know if the default has

2656
02:19:50,409 --> 02:20:02,629
implementations in the custom part for

2657
02:19:52,489 --> 02:20:04,159
all of that but you can do it so is it

2658
02:20:02,629 --> 02:20:06,199
possible implement the idea of a dynamic

2659
02:20:04,159 --> 02:20:08,270
language without garbage collection sure

2660
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:11,860
I mean what what difference does garbage

2661
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:11,860
collection make to die Nant to dynamism

2662
02:20:33,959 --> 02:20:40,000
when is the CE course coming out I'm not

2663
02:20:37,149 --> 02:20:43,390
sure hopefully soon like I said a couple

2664
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:45,729
months hopefully it'll be on steam

2665
02:20:43,390 --> 02:20:48,340
you'll be able to buy it I don't know

2666
02:20:45,729 --> 02:20:49,689
what the price would be like I said I

2667
02:20:48,340 --> 02:20:51,851
pretty sure will be less than the course

2668
02:20:49,690 --> 02:20:53,230
of cost of like a triple-a game so you

2669
02:20:51,851 --> 02:20:55,601
know something less to six something

2670
02:20:53,229 --> 02:20:57,840
less than sixty bucks but I don't know

2671
02:20:55,601 --> 02:20:57,840
how much

2672
02:21:08,101 --> 02:21:11,971
can you elaborate on the issue si made

2673
02:21:10,351 --> 02:21:14,190
with tying type strongly with operations

2674
02:21:11,970 --> 02:21:15,659
yeah I mean it's just you can see it as

2675
02:21:14,190 --> 02:21:18,181
a problem when you start working with

2676
02:21:15,659 --> 02:21:19,649
intrinsics right like if you want to add

2677
02:21:18,181 --> 02:21:23,040
two things together did you want a

2678
02:21:19,649 --> 02:21:26,479
saturating ad or an unsaturated ad or a

2679
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:30,181
signed ad or an unsigned ad you know

2680
02:21:26,479 --> 02:21:32,640
saying that a thing is an signed or

2681
02:21:30,181 --> 02:21:34,681
unsigned type well it's not stored

2682
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:38,850
differently so really what you're saying

2683
02:21:34,681 --> 02:21:41,101
there is when I do an ad or a subtract I

2684
02:21:38,851 --> 02:21:42,239
don't care which one it is because they

2685
02:21:41,101 --> 02:21:45,690
should be the same on signed or unsigned

2686
02:21:42,239 --> 02:21:47,579
but when I do like a multiply I want you

2687
02:21:45,690 --> 02:21:49,681
to do a sign multiply versus an unsigned

2688
02:21:47,579 --> 02:21:56,670
multiply or something like that or when

2689
02:21:49,681 --> 02:21:57,870
you do a great when I do a that's right

2690
02:21:56,670 --> 02:22:00,351
I'm looking for when I do a comparison

2691
02:21:57,870 --> 02:22:03,660
like greater than or less than right

2692
02:22:00,351 --> 02:22:05,551
it's got to be changed so like certain

2693
02:22:03,659 --> 02:22:07,890
operations have to change or shift would

2694
02:22:05,550 --> 02:22:10,079
be a better example so I want to do a

2695
02:22:07,890 --> 02:22:13,970
shift well did you want an arithmetic

2696
02:22:10,079 --> 02:22:16,500
shift or a logical shift right and so

2697
02:22:13,970 --> 02:22:18,629
it's just not appropriate because

2698
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:20,851
depending on the algorithm you don't

2699
02:22:18,629 --> 02:22:22,409
know just because I said I wanted to

2700
02:22:20,851 --> 02:22:24,960
think about this thing is signed most of

2701
02:22:22,409 --> 02:22:26,670
the time well sometimes I don't and it

2702
02:22:24,959 --> 02:22:28,260
just I would rather be able to reclaim

2703
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:29,489
Lee read code without to put caste

2704
02:22:28,261 --> 02:22:31,739
everywhere that I'd rather just be able

2705
02:22:29,489 --> 02:22:32,699
to say look this is a sign shift this is

2706
02:22:31,739 --> 02:22:35,069
an unsigned shift

2707
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:37,920
that's what I'd rather say and then if I

2708
02:22:35,069 --> 02:22:39,840
want to say default this thing to always

2709
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:42,210
using this kind of shift maybe that is a

2710
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:44,880
nice time saver but I don't like the

2711
02:22:42,209 --> 02:22:47,100
idea that everything always got tied to

2712
02:22:44,879 --> 02:22:48,720
the type because it doesn't actually

2713
02:22:47,101 --> 02:22:50,489
work that way in practice when you're

2714
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:52,560
actually trying to optimize code you

2715
02:22:50,489 --> 02:22:58,649
know I don't know just it's hard to

2716
02:22:52,560 --> 02:23:03,000
explain but how many people pre-order

2717
02:22:58,649 --> 02:23:04,261
the source code I don't know it's send

2718
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,431
I'll makes it really hard to figure that

2719
02:23:04,261 --> 02:23:06,989
out you have to go in and like spend

2720
02:23:05,431 --> 02:23:11,011
seven years waiting for it to like sum

2721
02:23:06,989 --> 02:23:12,840
up values and stuff it's not mini it's

2722
02:23:11,011 --> 02:23:15,000
it's not I don't think it's any it's not

2723
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:19,979
more than like 10000 I'll put it that

2724
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:22,110
way so it's not that many more than I

2725
02:23:19,979 --> 02:23:24,420
would have thought I mean it's you know

2726
02:23:22,110 --> 02:23:25,950
I don't know might be like 7000 or

2727
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:29,909
something it's more than I would have

2728
02:23:25,950 --> 02:23:34,730
ever thought before the game was out but

2729
02:23:29,909 --> 02:23:34,729
yes it's not like particularly many know

2730
02:23:34,909 --> 02:23:38,851
if Sindel can do is to be shady is there

2731
02:23:37,229 --> 02:23:39,930
a plan to switch platform so people will

2732
02:23:38,851 --> 02:23:43,230
still be able to get it if something

2733
02:23:39,931 --> 02:23:44,761
happens um I don't really know what to

2734
02:23:43,229 --> 02:23:56,399
do about it to be completely honest with

2735
02:23:44,761 --> 02:24:00,239
you I might try to move it to steam I I

2736
02:23:56,399 --> 02:24:05,850
don't know it's been very hard to find

2737
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:07,860
good distribution platforms so I really

2738
02:24:05,851 --> 02:24:09,721
just don't know I wish there was a

2739
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:11,940
better place to but I would like to move

2740
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:17,879
it off of Sandow

2741
02:24:11,940 --> 02:24:19,500
I wouldn't call sundial shady I would

2742
02:24:17,879 --> 02:24:23,720
just say send Al's kind of more or less

2743
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:25,829
defunct I mean they just they are pretty

2744
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:27,511
antiquated now in terms of the features

2745
02:24:25,829 --> 02:24:33,209
they support it's just it's just not a

2746
02:24:27,511 --> 02:24:36,560
good e-commerce platform so I don't

2747
02:24:33,209 --> 02:24:40,439
actually know what to do about that

2748
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:42,261
longer term I would like to use epic

2749
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:45,000
store Steam or something like that

2750
02:24:42,261 --> 02:24:46,620
because that handles distribution much

2751
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:50,310
more cleanly it has a much better

2752
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:52,230
downloads it keeps it up to date for you

2753
02:24:50,310 --> 02:24:55,409
you know send L doesn't do that

2754
02:24:52,229 --> 02:25:02,670
send al can't keep it up-to-date it also

2755
02:24:55,409 --> 02:25:04,649
can't handle huge stuff you know I don't

2756
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:07,530
know so you know someday I might just

2757
02:25:04,649 --> 02:25:09,329
knock on the door of the valve guys to

2758
02:25:07,530 --> 02:25:11,909
be like hey man is it ok if I do this

2759
02:25:09,329 --> 02:25:13,470
because it's not really a game right now

2760
02:25:11,909 --> 02:25:16,829
and I don't really want to call it early

2761
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:18,959
access because it's not right I only

2762
02:25:16,829 --> 02:25:20,101
allow the pre-orders because people want

2763
02:25:18,959 --> 02:25:23,369
to be able to follow along with the

2764
02:25:20,101 --> 02:25:24,780
source code and it's not early access

2765
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:28,200
it's not a game that I expected to be

2766
02:25:24,780 --> 02:25:30,630
playing right now right so I don't know

2767
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:32,521
but I could ask them to what extent you

2768
02:25:30,629 --> 02:25:33,390
know they could tell me something that

2769
02:25:32,521 --> 02:25:39,690
it would work there

2770
02:25:33,390 --> 02:25:41,129
I don't know but yeah I'd like to move

2771
02:25:39,690 --> 02:25:43,739
to something better I just don't know

2772
02:25:41,129 --> 02:25:45,149
how and if we did that it would be

2773
02:25:43,739 --> 02:25:47,521
pretty easy because I could just issue

2774
02:25:45,149 --> 02:25:53,869
everyone on send out a steam key to go

2775
02:25:47,521 --> 02:25:59,579
unlock it on Steam or something right

2776
02:25:53,870 --> 02:26:02,070
and I think that would just work for

2777
02:25:59,579 --> 02:26:03,870
everyone who is able to go use steam I

2778
02:26:02,069 --> 02:26:06,000
don't know what I do about people who

2779
02:26:03,870 --> 02:26:07,650
couldn't because it's possible that

2780
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,420
certain people can't get access to steam

2781
02:26:07,649 --> 02:26:15,140
who could have gotten access to a cendol

2782
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:15,140
download but

2783
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:32,770
what are the challenges is finding good

2784
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:35,590
distribution platforms I mean it's

2785
02:26:32,770 --> 02:26:37,450
pretty obvious right I mean you want an

2786
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:39,370
online store to function relatively like

2787
02:26:37,450 --> 02:26:41,530
steam I want to be able to have an

2788
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:43,720
account somewhere I want to be able to

2789
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:45,190
buy something I want to be able to have

2790
02:26:43,719 --> 02:26:47,829
it installed on my machine and kept up

2791
02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:51,310
to date automatically I want that thing

2792
02:26:47,829 --> 02:26:54,000
to handle taxes properly and payment

2793
02:26:51,309 --> 02:26:58,629
methods properly right compliance and

2794
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:01,000
filing and remittance or that you know

2795
02:26:58,629 --> 02:27:02,829
and then that doesn't exist steam is

2796
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,510
really all you got

2797
02:27:02,829 --> 02:27:05,978
the epic store may be to a certain

2798
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:07,149
extent but a fourth episode doesn't even

2799
02:27:05,978 --> 02:27:13,269
run on Linux and Mac as my understanding

2800
02:27:07,149 --> 02:27:16,770
I don't think so I don't care about Mac

2801
02:27:13,270 --> 02:27:18,790
anymore max over like I've officially I

2802
02:27:16,770 --> 02:27:20,800
based on what Apple's done lately I've

2803
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:21,910
said like apples over like I will never

2804
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,699
support Mac ever again

2805
02:27:21,909 --> 02:27:25,899
but Linux is an open platform I think it

2806
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:27,010
should be supported especially at

2807
02:27:25,899 --> 02:27:28,420
something like handmade here where we're

2808
02:27:27,010 --> 02:27:29,680
teaching how to program I want to

2809
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:33,309
support Linux so I want something it

2810
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:35,670
runs on Windows and Linux you can buy

2811
02:27:33,309 --> 02:27:38,319
something on there it distributes it out

2812
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:43,569
keeps it saying keep track of that you

2813
02:27:38,319 --> 02:27:44,879
owned it all that stuff and there and if

2814
02:27:43,569 --> 02:27:47,340
that's it as far as I know it's team

2815
02:27:44,879 --> 02:27:49,329
farms there's literally no nothing else

2816
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:52,930
so you can either put something a theme

2817
02:27:49,329 --> 02:27:57,789
or you can and that's it and even steam

2818
02:27:52,930 --> 02:27:59,649
isn't perfect because steam itself also

2819
02:27:57,790 --> 02:28:02,260
doesn't really support an easy way to

2820
02:27:59,649 --> 02:28:06,520
get into the ecosystem so somebody who

2821
02:28:02,260 --> 02:28:09,880
doesn't already run steam it's very hard

2822
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:13,390
to sell someone something and then just

2823
02:28:09,879 --> 02:28:15,219
have it download steam right they first

2824
02:28:13,389 --> 02:28:16,989
have to like create a steam account and

2825
02:28:15,219 --> 02:28:19,269
go through this process you really want

2826
02:28:16,989 --> 02:28:20,949
it the reverse way round you want it so

2827
02:28:19,270 --> 02:28:22,750
they can just go to my website hit by a

2828
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:24,670
handmade hero and then it says alright

2829
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:26,709
here's you download steam here's the

2830
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:28,389
download and what would you like your

2831
02:28:26,709 --> 02:28:32,549
username to be that's what you want it

2832
02:28:28,389 --> 02:28:34,689
to do but it doesn't have that right and

2833
02:28:32,549 --> 02:28:35,949
so that would be really nice as well

2834
02:28:34,690 --> 02:28:37,420
because especially we're talk about

2835
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:37,771
selling other things like you know we

2836
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:41,030
saw

2837
02:28:37,771 --> 02:28:45,450
comic book at Molly rocket well no one

2838
02:28:41,030 --> 02:28:48,271
buys comic books with that in that way

2839
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:50,280
right like they don't first open up

2840
02:28:48,271 --> 02:28:53,761
steam to buy their comic book or even

2841
02:28:50,280 --> 02:28:55,980
have one of those right so you you need

2842
02:28:53,761 --> 02:29:08,700
the same you have the same problem you

2843
02:28:55,979 --> 02:29:09,810
know yeah HIO it has its own issues as I

2844
02:29:08,700 --> 02:29:11,370
mentioned at the start of the stream

2845
02:29:09,810 --> 02:29:12,720
where I couldn't even buy for coder

2846
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:14,730
today because it said my credit card was

2847
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:15,659
declined and then I called my credit

2848
02:29:14,729 --> 02:29:19,829
card and they said it never even

2849
02:29:15,659 --> 02:29:22,710
attempted to charge so each i/o is kind

2850
02:29:19,829 --> 02:29:25,979
of a bug riddled mess I guess I would

2851
02:29:22,710 --> 02:29:27,899
also say I don't know to what extent

2852
02:29:25,979 --> 02:29:31,079
HIO actually handles tax compliance

2853
02:29:27,899 --> 02:29:33,210
properly but I suspect not really the

2854
02:29:31,079 --> 02:29:36,380
same is true of Gumroad so Gumroad

2855
02:29:33,210 --> 02:29:39,659
doesn't handle tax compliance properly

2856
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:41,100
they can trim it like so there's a

2857
02:29:39,659 --> 02:29:43,681
concept called merchant of record and

2858
02:29:41,101 --> 02:29:46,141
basically if the place doesn't order a

2859
02:29:43,681 --> 02:29:47,521
merchant of record ability then you just

2860
02:29:46,140 --> 02:29:50,220
don't want to use them so Gumroad

2861
02:29:47,521 --> 02:29:51,601
doesn't itch thought IO doesn't send out

2862
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:53,970
doesn't you basically just don't want to

2863
02:29:51,601 --> 02:29:55,501
use this because it means that you will

2864
02:29:53,970 --> 02:29:58,140
have to handle the tax compliance

2865
02:29:55,501 --> 02:30:00,120
yourself now some places claim to sort

2866
02:29:58,140 --> 02:30:03,300
of do something for you like Gumroad in

2867
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:05,971
inter Toyota oh I believe both claim to

2868
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:08,399
handle that Moss and they do but the

2869
02:30:05,970 --> 02:30:10,140
problem is VAT Moss is only one of many

2870
02:30:08,399 --> 02:30:11,159
taxes that you have to comply with and

2871
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:12,600
they don't comply with any of the other

2872
02:30:11,159 --> 02:30:14,789
ones Gumroad

2873
02:30:12,601 --> 02:30:19,040
in particular doesn't handle sales tax

2874
02:30:14,790 --> 02:30:21,570
in for state sales tax properly they

2875
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:24,391
claim to sort of handle it but actually

2876
02:30:21,569 --> 02:30:25,890
it's incorrect so they violate I checked

2877
02:30:24,390 --> 02:30:27,270
and their way of handling it violates

2878
02:30:25,890 --> 02:30:30,869
Washington state law they don't even

2879
02:30:27,271 --> 02:30:32,971
know that but it does and because

2880
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:38,780
there's certain RCW requirements about

2881
02:30:32,970 --> 02:30:42,300
how tax has to be listed on invoice so

2882
02:30:38,780 --> 02:30:45,120
this stuff isn't a joke tax compliance

2883
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:46,560
is incredibly complicated there's very

2884
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:48,631
few people who do it properly if you

2885
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:51,110
don't want to be basically breaking the

2886
02:30:48,630 --> 02:30:52,459
law it's very hard

2887
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:55,700
right now I'm doing most of it myself

2888
02:30:52,459 --> 02:30:58,669
with sundial and it's just not worth it

2889
02:30:55,700 --> 02:31:03,530
I'm happy to give valve 30% to do that

2890
02:30:58,670 --> 02:31:05,210
for me what I love to pay epic only 15%

2891
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:07,489
or whatever it is that they take to do

2892
02:31:05,209 --> 02:31:09,709
it for me yes but currently you can't

2893
02:31:07,489 --> 02:31:11,750
you can't just put stuff on the epic

2894
02:31:09,709 --> 02:31:16,339
store that doesn't work yet

2895
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:18,530
so you know Amazon would be great if

2896
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:22,639
Amazon had the ability to do digital

2897
02:31:18,530 --> 02:31:24,380
distributions well great they don't so

2898
02:31:22,639 --> 02:31:26,979
it's not really an option but if Amazon

2899
02:31:24,379 --> 02:31:29,299
had shipped a quality client like Steam

2900
02:31:26,979 --> 02:31:30,859
which it's crazy to call steam a quality

2901
02:31:29,299 --> 02:31:32,750
client because steams not that good but

2902
02:31:30,860 --> 02:31:37,521
hey it's way better than the stuff

2903
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:40,489
that's out there otherwise you know so

2904
02:31:37,521 --> 02:31:43,280
I'm hoping at some point these things

2905
02:31:40,489 --> 02:31:45,590
get into some kind of a war I would love

2906
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,600
to see steam versus epic really get

2907
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:49,219
heated because I think the quality would

2908
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:51,200
go up dramatically and then I just use

2909
02:31:49,219 --> 02:31:52,699
one or the other or both for everything

2910
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:54,771
and that would be fantastic

2911
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:58,340
we're just that's not the world we're

2912
02:31:54,771 --> 02:32:03,370
living in I don't think GOG lets you put

2913
02:31:58,340 --> 02:32:03,370
anything up there but games does it

2914
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:14,720
you might be able to get permission the

2915
02:32:13,219 --> 02:32:17,779
people at Epic or running the adjuster

2916
02:32:14,719 --> 02:32:22,099
are good people yet no I totally believe

2917
02:32:17,780 --> 02:32:24,920
they are good people I emailed Tim

2918
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:27,470
Sweeney actually about this while back I

2919
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:30,200
basically said like hey you guys should

2920
02:32:27,469 --> 02:32:33,799
do direct ecommerce here's the reasons

2921
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:36,740
why he never applied so probably just

2922
02:32:33,799 --> 02:32:38,569
went in the trash I mean he probably has

2923
02:32:36,739 --> 02:32:50,360
so many emails he's not gonna bother

2924
02:32:38,569 --> 02:32:52,369
looking at one for me no steam doesn't

2925
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:55,280
have any requirements to put DRM into

2926
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:57,050
any program at all most games on Steam

2927
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:58,579
now just don't even have DRM I think

2928
02:32:57,049 --> 02:32:59,809
it's mostly like big Triple A games it

2929
02:32:58,579 --> 02:33:02,780
would but if you buy an indie game on

2930
02:32:59,809 --> 02:33:04,189
Steam I think most important that box so

2931
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:07,220
like for handmade hero we just wouldn't

2932
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:08,989
check that box right so you know we just

2933
02:33:07,219 --> 02:33:11,029
install the source code along with the

2934
02:33:08,989 --> 02:33:12,770
game and if you just hit the open local

2935
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:14,300
files door it would just open up with

2936
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:16,399
all the files right there just like it

2937
02:33:14,299 --> 02:33:19,579
is right now and download the zip so

2938
02:33:16,399 --> 02:33:22,309
steam totally works for handmade hero

2939
02:33:19,579 --> 02:33:24,200
purposes and I just wouldn't check the

2940
02:33:22,309 --> 02:33:26,539
DRM box and there'd be no issues right

2941
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:27,890
it used to be this team was DRM that I

2942
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:29,230
really didn't like that they got rid of

2943
02:33:27,889 --> 02:33:32,329
that so I have no problem with it now

2944
02:33:29,229 --> 02:33:38,239
like Steam just works and anyone can be

2945
02:33:32,329 --> 02:33:40,520
on it now 100 bucks right so I think

2946
02:33:38,239 --> 02:33:42,709
seems great I wish they didn't take 30%

2947
02:33:40,520 --> 02:33:45,260
I think it's maybe a little bit high at

2948
02:33:42,709 --> 02:33:47,269
the same time like YouTube takes 50% and

2949
02:33:45,260 --> 02:33:53,680
twitch takes 50% so they're not the

2950
02:33:47,270 --> 02:33:53,680
worst right so I don't know

2951
02:34:05,521 --> 02:34:12,880
yeah I like I give Tim Sweeney like

2952
02:34:09,271 --> 02:34:14,681
major major props for doing the epic

2953
02:34:12,879 --> 02:34:17,020
store because as far as I'm concerned

2954
02:34:14,681 --> 02:34:21,460
like he really just it's just a giant

2955
02:34:17,021 --> 02:34:23,440
headache for him I mean they do not need

2956
02:34:21,459 --> 02:34:26,529
the money even a little bit right like

2957
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:30,271
fortnight made infinite money Tim

2958
02:34:26,530 --> 02:34:34,090
Sweeney does not have to care about a

2959
02:34:30,271 --> 02:34:36,761
single dollar ever again right but he

2960
02:34:34,090 --> 02:34:38,710
did the epic store anyway and I honestly

2961
02:34:36,761 --> 02:34:40,870
truly believe that he didn't do the epic

2962
02:34:38,709 --> 02:34:42,339
store because he wanted money I think he

2963
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:45,221
did the epic store because he really

2964
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:49,360
didn't like the fact that people didn't

2965
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:50,890
have any other options but steam I mean

2966
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:52,450
I really do think that's why I did it I

2967
02:34:50,890 --> 02:34:54,399
don't think he did it because he needed

2968
02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:57,460
the money or not needed the money I

2969
02:34:54,399 --> 02:34:59,859
wanted the money because for tonight you

2970
02:34:57,459 --> 02:35:01,180
know made so much money that there's

2971
02:34:59,860 --> 02:35:03,069
just I mean in he and he was wealthy

2972
02:35:01,181 --> 02:35:06,460
even before that so I really just think

2973
02:35:03,069 --> 02:35:08,619
honestly he did it just to do something

2974
02:35:06,459 --> 02:35:12,609
good which is crazy I think that's what

2975
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:15,730
they did and so I think that was awesome

2976
02:35:12,610 --> 02:35:17,650
I mean that's like if it ends up being

2977
02:35:15,729 --> 02:35:21,310
the case that the epic store becomes

2978
02:35:17,649 --> 02:35:23,681
fairly reputable and people use it and

2979
02:35:21,310 --> 02:35:26,590
it becomes you know more refined and

2980
02:35:23,681 --> 02:35:28,870
works well and all that stuff I think it

2981
02:35:26,590 --> 02:35:33,940
would create a really strong incentive

2982
02:35:28,870 --> 02:35:35,801
for both epic and valve to improve the

2983
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:38,380
quality of digital distribution models

2984
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:39,699
and that is awesome because valve

2985
02:35:38,379 --> 02:35:42,220
totally was not

2986
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:46,360
I mean steam is basically exactly what

2987
02:35:42,220 --> 02:35:48,159
it was when it started it just has not

2988
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:50,351
had the kind of attention paid to it

2989
02:35:48,159 --> 02:35:51,819
that it should have had and I think

2990
02:35:50,351 --> 02:35:56,739
pretty much the reason for that it just

2991
02:35:51,819 --> 02:35:58,779
doesn't have the competition right I

2992
02:35:56,739 --> 02:36:00,879
mean there's an plenty of incentive

2993
02:35:58,780 --> 02:36:02,920
there for valve to maintain it there

2994
02:36:00,879 --> 02:36:04,899
isn't really any incentive there for

2995
02:36:02,920 --> 02:36:07,210
them to push it forwards and explore all

2996
02:36:04,899 --> 02:36:09,970
the possibilities and like make great

2997
02:36:07,209 --> 02:36:11,199
improvements because everyone has to

2998
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:14,159
sell their game on Steam so it just

2999
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:14,159
doesn't matter right

3000
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:22,300
is there anything I've seemed to improve

3001
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:24,940
totally yeah there's so many things you

3002
02:36:22,299 --> 02:36:29,469
can improve on steam the steam Kline

3003
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:32,380
itself is very hard for non you know

3004
02:36:29,469 --> 02:36:35,679
expert users it's it's just really

3005
02:36:32,379 --> 02:36:36,819
obtuse I mean I get lost in there

3006
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:38,649
sometimes trying to figure out what the

3007
02:36:36,819 --> 02:36:41,680
heck I'm doing and look where my stuff

3008
02:36:38,649 --> 02:36:44,520
went the usability needs a massive

3009
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:47,530
overhaul like a massive massive overhaul

3010
02:36:44,521 --> 02:36:49,989
the purchase flow is terrible if you

3011
02:36:47,530 --> 02:36:53,351
don't already have steam getting you

3012
02:36:49,989 --> 02:36:56,860
onto the platform doesn't work they

3013
02:36:53,351 --> 02:36:59,920
really need a smooth end-user purchase

3014
02:36:56,860 --> 02:37:03,460
flow so they need to have it so that if

3015
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:05,649
I put up my website and I'm selling

3016
02:37:03,459 --> 02:37:07,959
handmade hero and somebody who doesn't

3017
02:37:05,649 --> 02:37:09,459
have steam comes and buys it it should

3018
02:37:07,959 --> 02:37:11,049
be like they click the button it just

3019
02:37:09,459 --> 02:37:12,279
pops up a little thing they put in their

3020
02:37:11,049 --> 02:37:14,229
credit confirmation just like it is now

3021
02:37:12,280 --> 02:37:15,880
then it says great here's your download

3022
02:37:14,229 --> 02:37:18,729
and you download steam right there and

3023
02:37:15,879 --> 02:37:20,649
it knows what you purchased and it comes

3024
02:37:18,729 --> 02:37:22,779
up and has you creates the account right

3025
02:37:20,649 --> 02:37:23,709
it should be super smooth that's not

3026
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:25,870
what happens right now you have to

3027
02:37:23,709 --> 02:37:27,609
create a steam account first you have to

3028
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:30,430
use their website for the purchase it's

3029
02:37:27,610 --> 02:37:33,550
just there's so many things that they

3030
02:37:30,430 --> 02:37:36,040
could do to make it a much stronger

3031
02:37:33,549 --> 02:37:38,170
ecommerce platform and they're not doing

3032
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:41,220
those things and again because they

3033
02:37:38,170 --> 02:37:41,219
don't have to write

3034
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:04,710
all right last question what are your

3035
02:38:02,489 --> 02:38:06,479
thoughts on undefined behavior I think

3036
02:38:04,709 --> 02:38:08,939
if you have a spec that has undefined

3037
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:13,229
behavior in it then you don't have a

3038
02:38:08,940 --> 02:38:15,960
spec full stop so like the fact that C++

3039
02:38:13,229 --> 02:38:17,189
and C call those things specs but they

3040
02:38:15,959 --> 02:38:19,340
have undefined behavior in them I

3041
02:38:17,190 --> 02:38:22,159
wouldn't call them specs I'd call them

3042
02:38:19,341 --> 02:38:25,229
ideas about how a language might work I

3043
02:38:22,159 --> 02:38:27,209
mean not to put too fine a point on it a

3044
02:38:25,229 --> 02:38:29,761
spec should have literally no undefined

3045
02:38:27,209 --> 02:38:32,550
behavior and I know that people think

3046
02:38:29,761 --> 02:38:35,130
that maybe that's sort of an absurd

3047
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:37,050
thing to say because oh wait well what

3048
02:38:35,129 --> 02:38:38,189
about you know when you want to be able

3049
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:40,680
to support something like floating-point

3050
02:38:38,190 --> 02:38:41,700
operations but you don't know what kind

3051
02:38:40,681 --> 02:38:43,051
of floating-point operation thing

3052
02:38:41,700 --> 02:38:45,811
there's gonna be your if you don't know

3053
02:38:43,050 --> 02:38:47,010
like what the kind of hardware is that

3054
02:38:45,810 --> 02:38:49,379
implements this thing and so

3055
02:38:47,011 --> 02:38:51,810
optimization bubble-butt know that is

3056
02:38:49,379 --> 02:38:57,060
not what that means undefined behavior

3057
02:38:51,810 --> 02:38:59,369
is a cop-out where you haven't specified

3058
02:38:57,060 --> 02:39:01,860
what the programmer can expect when you

3059
02:38:59,370 --> 02:39:04,950
easily could have for example instead of

3060
02:39:01,860 --> 02:39:08,420
saying that a unsigned 64-bit integer

3061
02:39:04,950 --> 02:39:12,511
overflow in C is undefined behavior say

3062
02:39:08,420 --> 02:39:14,341
when you put that in a piece of code the

3063
02:39:12,511 --> 02:39:17,159
compiler will generate the code that

3064
02:39:14,341 --> 02:39:19,579
would work if it simply did the basic ad

3065
02:39:17,159 --> 02:39:22,890
that the Machine normally does right now

3066
02:39:19,579 --> 02:39:25,500
it's not overly specific behavior but

3067
02:39:22,890 --> 02:39:28,229
it's not undefined you have defined what

3068
02:39:25,500 --> 02:39:30,360
the programmer can expect but whenever

3069
02:39:28,229 --> 02:39:32,159
you say a behavior is undefined you've

3070
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:38,431
made what is effectively an unworkable

3071
02:39:32,159 --> 02:39:40,649
spec it's not a spec right and so as far

3072
02:39:38,431 --> 02:39:42,899
as I'm concerned if you produce the spec

3073
02:39:40,649 --> 02:39:46,229
with undefined behavior as a specified

3074
02:39:42,899 --> 02:39:47,909
category you're not done yet I don't

3075
02:39:46,229 --> 02:39:52,170
consider it a specification I consider

3076
02:39:47,909 --> 02:39:54,181
it an aspirational fantasy period

3077
02:39:52,170 --> 02:39:55,681
because there's never an excuse friend

3078
02:39:54,181 --> 02:39:58,471
just finding if you can always specify

3079
02:39:55,681 --> 02:40:01,170
what the programmer can expect even if

3080
02:39:58,470 --> 02:40:03,359
you can't tell them what that is ahead

3081
02:40:01,170 --> 02:40:04,649
of time you can tell them how to know

3082
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:07,591
when they actually go to use it because

3083
02:40:04,649 --> 02:40:09,629
you can just say it will do whatever the

3084
02:40:07,591 --> 02:40:12,420
underlying machine does or something

3085
02:40:09,629 --> 02:40:14,129
right you can always say that you don't

3086
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:15,960
have say unbind because undef' I

3087
02:40:14,129 --> 02:40:17,398
behavior gives the compiler vendor the

3088
02:40:15,959 --> 02:40:24,029
opportunity to screw you and guess what

3089
02:40:17,398 --> 02:40:25,170
they always do always is there an

3090
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:31,560
advantage to having undefined behavior

3091
02:40:25,170 --> 02:40:33,569
no there's no advantage whatsoever the

3092
02:40:31,559 --> 02:40:34,859
advantage that is claimed is more

3093
02:40:33,569 --> 02:40:38,489
flexibility for the compiler vendor

3094
02:40:34,860 --> 02:40:40,050
that's never good flexibility in a

3095
02:40:38,489 --> 02:40:41,639
compiler vendor is horrible because it

3096
02:40:40,049 --> 02:40:43,739
means that from version to version or

3097
02:40:41,639 --> 02:40:44,969
from compiler to compiler the programmer

3098
02:40:43,739 --> 02:40:47,750
doesn't know what's gonna happen that's

3099
02:40:44,969 --> 02:40:47,750
never good

3100
02:40:53,889 --> 02:41:09,099
all right I'm gonna head and wrap it up

3101
02:40:55,689 --> 02:41:11,290
a lot of windows open today huh thank

3102
02:41:09,100 --> 02:41:12,430
you everyone for joining me for another

3103
02:41:11,290 --> 02:41:14,109
episode of hand made here outs and a

3104
02:41:12,430 --> 02:41:16,120
pleasure coding with you as always if

3105
02:41:14,109 --> 02:41:18,100
you would like to follow along this

3106
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:19,600
series at home you can always go to

3107
02:41:18,100 --> 02:41:21,908
handmade hero org and preorder the game

3108
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:24,520
it comes with the source code so if you

3109
02:41:21,908 --> 02:41:27,639
want to follow along at home you can do

3110
02:41:24,520 --> 02:41:30,579
so I will be back here tomorrow for a

3111
02:41:27,639 --> 02:41:31,599
little bit of fun with the ocular number

3112
02:41:30,579 --> 02:41:33,189
we'll finally get to sort of play around

3113
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:34,779
it I think that'll be interesting and

3114
02:41:33,189 --> 02:41:37,479
I'm pretty happy the direction it's

3115
02:41:34,779 --> 02:41:38,680
going I think we're getting to the light

3116
02:41:37,478 --> 02:41:40,629
at the end of the tunnel here I'm pretty

3117
02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:43,930
happy about it so hopefully we'll have

3118
02:41:40,629 --> 02:41:46,389
some good lighting soon and maybe we'll

3119
02:41:43,930 --> 02:41:48,579
see the first it's the first little

3120
02:41:46,389 --> 02:41:49,750
glimmer of that tomorrow that's it for

3121
02:41:48,579 --> 02:41:52,029
today hope see you back here tomorrow

3122
02:41:49,750 --> 02:41:53,799
till then have fun for everyone and I

3123
02:41:52,029 --> 02:41:56,130
will see you on the Internet take it

3124
02:41:53,799 --> 02:41:56,129
easy everybody
