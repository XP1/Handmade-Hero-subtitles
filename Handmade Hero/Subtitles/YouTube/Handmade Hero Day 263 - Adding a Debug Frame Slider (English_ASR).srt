1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,230
start recording yeah alright starting

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,968
pretty late today it's a half hour in

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,320
there's not gonna be any Q&amp;A at the end

4
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:15,539
of this just that's just the way it is

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,480
welcome everyone to handmade hero show

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,849
recode a complete game live on stream

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,240
today I want some more programs some

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,449
more profile UI I want it and I'm going

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:32,460
to get it with or without you so buckle

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,710
up to 63 is the day number so 262 source

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,450
code is what you want to start with if

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,259
you're trying to follow along at home

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,629
and I hope you are because why am I even

14
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:45,628
streaming this if you aren't I have no

15
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:51,238
idea right it's a good question it's a

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:54,448
very very good question here is the

17
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,729
handmade hero code base here is me

18
00:00:54,448 --> 00:01:01,558
running it here is me opening the

19
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:03,898
profile window here is what I want what

20
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,359
I want now is some buttons up here I

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,250
want some buttons that I can push like a

22
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,109
back button like right now I can drill

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,868
down into something and I can see what's

24
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:14,069
going on but I can't actually get back

25
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,228
to where I was because I don't have a

26
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,269
back button I need a back button I want

27
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,310
to be able to switch between frame the

28
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,170
per frame view and this view which we

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,570
could trivially do if we had a button so

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,549
I want that as well so I want some

31
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,618
buttons up here that's one thing I want

32
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,990
and another thing I want is I want some

33
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,790
buttons down here that go with this

34
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:36,149
piece of information and maybe I want to

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,829
move these to the top as well but I want

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,020
some buttons that allow me to like pause

37
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,639
the stream so you know cuz this is like

38
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:43,978
running in real time I want me to pause

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,649
and we've got many frames of back data I

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:50,879
want to be able to go back to previous

41
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,090
frames so that I can you know see what

42
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,089
they were

43
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:02,100
you feel me dog so let's just let's do

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,189
that let's make that happen let's make

45
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,599
it happen bro you know I'm saying you

46
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:07,978
know just like sometimes you just got to

47
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:15,000
go to the gym you just got a lift and

48
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:18,269
have protein powders or powder your

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,620
protein I don't really know what bros do

50
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:25,590
I I feel like they probably have a lot

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:31,200
of protein in the mix in there somewhere

52
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:37,709
so that's good and they do like squats

53
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:39,959
or something so that's good maybe I

54
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:43,080
don't really know point being I'm gonna

55
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,370
make this stuff happen and the bros can

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,690
join us or not you know it's not my

57
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,060
problem I don't care

58
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:50,159
here we go I wanna move this stuff for

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,780
the top so basically we have the main

60
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,459
menu stuff drawing I don't even know why

61
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,310
we call it a main menu at this point old

62
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,509
legacy naming that's the kind of stuff

63
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,530
that we don't often get a chance to

64
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,879
clean up on the stream but that I would

65
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,039
probably clean up in real life when I

66
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,530
have lots of hours to program and I'm

67
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:10,979
not talking assessing Lee so this stuff

68
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:12,329
here this this menu obviously for we

69
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:14,729
would probably want to make sure that

70
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:17,370
our main menu starts after our debug

71
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:21,899
text happens and so what I'd want to do

72
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,849
I think is there's the @y thing that we

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,400
have in here I'd want to make sure that

74
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,650
that gets picked up so after we do these

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,689
these debug text lines I want to make

76
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,609
sure that gets picked up so I don't

77
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:33,930
actually remember I'll be completely

78
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:40,920
honest with you I don't even remember

79
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:42,920
what where this thing starts it looks

80
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,268
like it starts at the trees UIP

81
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,849
in this case we're just drawing each

82
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,409
individual tree and so I suppose what

83
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,388
we'd have to do to do that is just put

84
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:53,818
the tree move the tree down a certain

85
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,859
amount now when I now that I think about

86
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,750
that I suppose that's probably dumb

87
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:59,609
because why would be special case these

88
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,379
I have no idea why we would special case

89
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:04,409
these when we could just make these be

90
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,120
things that you control that seems like

91
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,219
a way more obvious thing to do so

92
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,819
probably what we want to do is just say

93
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,408
hey

94
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:13,560
get rid of these all together right

95
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:15,328
throw them up in the debug element you

96
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,459
know printout nonsense that we've got

97
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:21,600
where we're printing out different kinds

98
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:25,098
of elements in here so because we've got

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,280
like the the profile graph nonsense

100
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:32,909
happening where is that at where am i

101
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,439
search at this thing right so here we

102
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,849
are in draw element we've got a bunch of

103
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,348
different elements we can draw I think

104
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:39,180
what I'd rather do is just say you know

105
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:42,560
what let's just make these the elements

106
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:47,160
right so now I've got you know in here

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:51,680
I've got last frame or something

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,419
last frame info I don't know right

109
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,699
something like this and then we just

110
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:58,560
like print that out and and that way it

111
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,478
can just be its own little special sauce

112
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,780
thing that happens in there and

113
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,098
similarly we could have this be I don't

114
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,239
know what this would be this would be

115
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:11,240
like

116
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,228
debug memory info or something like that

117
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,079
I don't know

118
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:19,908
bla bla bla and that's you know how

119
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,779
that's gonna go and it's good and

120
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:24,079
everyone loves it

121
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:26,418
so all we need to do is tie that into

122
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,329
our system you can see here where we've

123
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:32,389
kind of got this layout stuff where we

124
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:35,180
can do the various things with with

125
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:37,519
debug event printout what I want to do

126
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,959
here is be able to lay out one of these

127
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:44,568
elements I don't actually know if it

128
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:46,728
seems to me like this is a little bit

129
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:49,039
long in the tooth like this is probably

130
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:51,110
something we should make really a little

131
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,149
more easy to do because we don't really

132
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,250
have anything in particular that's

133
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:57,318
that's complex about this right we once

134
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,779
we have a piece of text we get its size

135
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,629
we produce the dimensions for it we lay

136
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:05,388
out an element for it right and then we

137
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:09,169
we print it out and it seems to me like

138
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:11,150
that is something that we probably want

139
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:13,430
to wrap right there's no reason not to

140
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:14,989
wrap that so I'm gonna go ahead and make

141
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:21,288
utility for that

142
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:27,620
that's just internal like you know basic

143
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:32,930
text element typing typing is difficult

144
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,728
sometimes so something like this and

145
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,199
then we would just pass in what those

146
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:40,930
things are so we you know we have the

147
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,930
text we know we've got the debug state

148
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:48,610
and then we need that layout so we need

149
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,610
to get grab this guy right here

150
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:55,528
and it looks like actually we don't need

151
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,179
the debug state it looks like that we

152
00:06:55,528 --> 00:07:03,769
wrapped that it looks like that's in

153
00:06:57,178 --> 00:07:06,418
here so that's fine so we do the layout

154
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:08,879
we need to provide an item interaction

155
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:11,579
and that's just a thing like this sort

156
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,009
of thing that I suppose we should

157
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,478
probably just pass in because different

158
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,369
people will have different ones of those

159
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,228
and they may want to make different ones

160
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:22,080
but other than that I think that's it

161
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:24,149
right everything else here is pretty

162
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:29,908
much just by you know just goes by the

163
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:31,379
book we'll pass a color but we will make

164
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,668
it white by default so that if you don't

165
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:40,649
actually want to pass color you don't

166
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:42,448
have to and I think that's it so I'm

167
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:47,129
gonna try before I do anything else I'm

168
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,759
gonna try making this work like so no

169
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:52,468
not like that

170
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,899
I so need a new version of for coder

171
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:57,598
with with better indentation I actually

172
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,999
licensed the source code to it so I may

173
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,588
just go do that it's like one of the

174
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,149
only things that I noticed day-to-day

175
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:08,899
now it's like that in the auto expansion

176
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:13,228
other than that like I literally I

177
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:15,478
literally have not yeah it's just it's

178
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:17,068
great I'm so excited about this text

179
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,618
editor and the fact that it's programmer

180
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,209
1c is so good yeah but I want to fix

181
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:22,379
that indentation it's I think it would

182
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,389
be pretty easy to fix too but you can

183
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,009
just see how it picks wrong stuff a lot

184
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,300
of times I'm not quite sure why but I'm

185
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:30,360
pretty sure if I win the source code it

186
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,800
would not it would not be hard to find

187
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,688
because it's pretty close and a lot of

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,399
times it's right it just it looks like

189
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:37,679
it doesn't understand multi-line things

190
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,318
so basically like it'll get the

191
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,049
indentation of this okay I would prefer

192
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:44,849
it to be lined up to the parentheses but

193
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,429
it picks that which would be fine but

194
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,199
the next line if there's stuff here it

195
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:51,778
often times gets wrong and I don't know

196
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:53,578
why right like if this is a comma or

197
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,230
maybe now I don't know I to be honest I

198
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:58,109
really don't know what the circumstances

199
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,319
are like there you go so I don't know

200
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,339
why it decided to do it there right and

201
00:09:01,318 --> 00:09:03,370
so there's just some things like that

202
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,620
that seem like

203
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,539
I don't know they seem like it would

204
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,879
take very little time for me to fix them

205
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:12,219
so I'm interested in looking that

206
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,500
because if I could fix those I think

207
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,850
this in my mind anyway it goes from

208
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,070
being an alpha to being basically

209
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,830
shipped like I'm like it does everything

210
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:25,870
I need

211
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:28,870
alright so let's see if that works which

212
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,259
I don't know if it will and I'm gonna

213
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:37,539
have to if these guys out obviously for

214
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:42,600
the time being here so if that works for

215
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:42,599
printing our menu nice text reloading

216
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:49,960
yeah okay if that works then we should

217
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,319
be able to use it for these as well now

218
00:09:49,960 --> 00:10:01,330
so these guys can just be can basically

219
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:05,950
just do this and I guess they don't need

220
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:09,580
to pass the the color because we are

221
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:12,940
just vanilla white at this point sounds

222
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:25,830
like some really bad Disney movie so

223
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:31,380
yeah that's just text and text like so

224
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:34,600
and actually we don't need that at all

225
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:39,070
and so now I think all we need is to

226
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:42,909
have these particular doodads defined

227
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,980
right so in our grand list of things I

228
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,659
guess this would be an interface and our

229
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,610
grand list of things that you can add in

230
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:51,159
the debug system you can now add some

231
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:59,440
more things here like debug memory infos

232
00:10:51,159 --> 00:11:02,829
and stuff like that and the threat

233
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,360
interval graph stuff you can see that we

234
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,620
do that here where we do like debug

235
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,950
threading of 'la graph we do this thing

236
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:13,830
I think what we want to do is say debug

237
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:15,379
you know UI or something or debug UI

238
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,709
thing

239
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:21,229
UI elements and then in here we would

240
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:26,598
just pass the type so we'd say like oh

241
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:33,259
you know I whatever you want that one to

242
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:36,169
be we'll do it right and so this will

243
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,209
just be like some name that you're

244
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:41,749
trying to pass to it and then we'll

245
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:43,698
build it and it'll be great and it's

246
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:48,859
just awesome and it's fine and

247
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:53,688
everyone's loves it like that movie with

248
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:55,489
like Lindsay Lohan and the car so we can

249
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:59,118
go ahead and just make this one work

250
00:11:55,489 --> 00:12:02,059
like that so instead of the old waiver

251
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:03,439
we're calling it we can call it this way

252
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:04,818
and you see why I did this right I don't

253
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:06,558
want to have like a separate function

254
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:08,598
for each of those when I already have to

255
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:09,978
type an identifier in to define them I

256
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:12,408
might as well just pass the identifier

257
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:15,169
right and I only need to make a special

258
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:16,068
one of these if for some reason in the

259
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:20,958
future right

260
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:23,658
I needed to pass different sorts of

261
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,278
parameters or do other fussing but I

262
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:27,019
don't really need to do that here so I

263
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,759
might as well just make it one function

264
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:32,119
that can generate any one of our special

265
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,499
elements so now I do that we don't

266
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:36,859
actually have anything in particular

267
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:42,970
here that I I guess that I would put but

268
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:42,970
like in the last frame or I don't know

269
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:51,350
but anyway now you can see we've got

270
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:53,088
these guys in here so we now have the

271
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,428
profile which we did before and now we

272
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:58,069
also have that the old data that we that

273
00:12:55,428 --> 00:13:00,649
we wanted that now puts us in an

274
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:06,259
excellent position to generate some more

275
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:08,479
UI controls which is also what I want so

276
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:11,239
if you take a look at well you know it's

277
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,179
kind of interesting here though why are

278
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:16,249
those in the wrong order do we do with

279
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:19,278
some kind of a push down for when we add

280
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:22,908
things to a set because correct me if

281
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:26,239
I'm wrong but they go in reverse order

282
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:28,759
of where they are and I don't know why I

283
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,030
feel like we must have decided to do

284
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,590
like

285
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:39,100
singly-linked list there that doesn't do

286
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:39,100
push on end that's my assumption anyway

287
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,129
yum-yum-yum yeah yeah yeah yeah let's

288
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:50,000
find out that's a little meow song for

289
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:53,389
you I hope you enjoyed it so what we

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,720
want here is we want the place where we

291
00:13:53,389 --> 00:14:02,179
do the get element for event or whatever

292
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,440
it's called like get element from it

293
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:09,829
that's it get element from event yet

294
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,860
element from event there it is

295
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:16,730
so when we do add element to group right

296
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:20,080
here I'm wondering is that a singly

297
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:29,230
linked thing that's happening here

298
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:32,180
d-list insert mr. d-list insert yeah man

299
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,090
that's a problem you guys know I'm

300
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:37,789
saying check it out check it out right

301
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:41,750
there see see how that works that

302
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:44,179
inserts at the head of the list right

303
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,789
you know I'm saying it says that the

304
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:50,449
next thing is the first thing in the

305
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:53,089
list so all we need to do is do like the

306
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,890
same exact thing like exact mr.

307
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:58,160
exactness com

308
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:02,750
it's a wonderful company series see

309
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:06,110
funded for 11 billion dollars is what we

310
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:09,740
need to do here is say like okay what we

311
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:12,919
actually want is we want to link up to

312
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,799
the sentinals previous so that we are

313
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:18,289
now the last thing so our prior link

314
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:21,109
will be whatever was the previous last

315
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:24,139
link and our next link will be this one

316
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,789
and then we just go in and set the those

317
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,519
two to point back to us and we're done

318
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:31,490
right so same same bit for finishing up

319
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,120
but otherwise a little bit different

320
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,120
there so

321
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,170
could just do as last right and so if we

322
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,879
do insert as last now those things will

323
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:46,389
go in the order we said and I want them

324
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:49,929
to go in the order that we said right

325
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:52,600
because I feel like that's just just

326
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:54,879
better because inside one of these I

327
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,810
want them to be accurate now we still I

328
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,490
don't think create these in that order

329
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:02,409
probably right because that be in a

330
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,419
different place add group to group is

331
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:06,069
using that as well so we might as well I

332
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,689
don't think we ever really want them to

333
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,890
be out of order we don't our reverse

334
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,630
order we'd always want to be same order

335
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,620
so I feel like this is actually the

336
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:15,220
right cuz this is the order they

337
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:19,389
actually appeared in the program okay so

338
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:24,070
that seems good to me right that seems

339
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:26,110
like some sexy hiking right there so I'm

340
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,620
gonna go ahead and go ahead and keep

341
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:34,300
that so now I want to add a little bit

342
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,940
of I want to add a little bit of special

343
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:40,479
sauce in here I want to sauce this up

344
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,250
and so what I'm gonna do is before what

345
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,440
we were doing is we're always viewing

346
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,509
the most recent frame but what I'd

347
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,790
rather do is have a like you know

348
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:52,149
viewing frame ordinal or something like

349
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:54,039
this and by default we could have the

350
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:57,129
viewing frame ordinal always track the

351
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:59,079
most recent frame ordinal but then if

352
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:01,870
you like scrub you could view a

353
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,120
different one right and so what I'm

354
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,910
gonna do is I'm gonna make a way for us

355
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:09,819
to edit the viewing frame ordinal first

356
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:13,060
or release just display it and then put

357
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,379
in the pause and then come back and have

358
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:19,389
everyone tie into the viewing frame

359
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:21,610
ordinal does that make sense i sweared

360
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,320
it seriously guys that it better make

361
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:25,869
sense because it was so straightforward

362
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,099
what I just said I don't even want to

363
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,389
hear it that's not man I mean look at

364
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,609
the chat I don't even want to know if

365
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,350
that's not make sense to you because it

366
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:36,579
better make sense to you so what I'm

367
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:39,009
gonna put in here is a frame slider or

368
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:42,609
something like that we're gonna call it

369
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:45,279
a frame slider okay frame slider is what

370
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:46,899
it is and if you don't want a frame

371
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,899
slider then maybe you should have picked

372
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,420
a different program

373
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,530
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a

374
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:58,070
debug data block here for no reason and

375
00:17:53,529 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm gonna call that like rate our debug

376
00:17:58,069 --> 00:18:04,279
control mmm

377
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,340
right and in there I'm gonna make some

378
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:10,250
of these UI elements I'm gonna make this

379
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:12,769
frame slider I wonder if our UI element

380
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,680
I wonder if I wasn't maybe a little bit

381
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:17,420
of premature pants on this and really

382
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,049
you should be able to just do UI element

383
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:25,400
without putting anything after it you

384
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:26,720
know what I'm saying but I don't know

385
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,380
I'm gonna keep doing that for no

386
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,029
apparent reason because I can and so

387
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:39,370
we'll put the debug frame starter in

388
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:41,269
there and maybe we'll have a debug thing

389
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,529
you know what just gonna called you by

390
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:44,509
frame slider that's it that's all

391
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:47,019
they're gonna be and if you want more

392
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:49,400
than that well you're gonna have to go

393
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:55,460
download the source code and add it

394
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:59,440
because you know that's your problem so

395
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,179
if we go to debug go back to debug here

396
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm gonna go ahead and add that in as

397
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:08,360
one of the things we can draw so in cure

398
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:11,379
where we do that's not good not not what

399
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:13,339
I wanted not what I wanted to do

400
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,600
switching to modal editing has been

401
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:16,730
pretty tricky for me I don't I don't

402
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,589
mind telling you it's been a lot better

403
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,539
than for coder than it wasn't Emacs but

404
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:23,000
it's still pretty rough on me because

405
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,500
I'm not used to it compared to non modal

406
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,660
which is how I've been programming for

407
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:31,670
30 years so anyway here in this this

408
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,140
little doodad I'm gonna implement one of

409
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,179
these frame sliders and in order to

410
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,420
implement a frame slider really all I

411
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:40,940
have to do is make one of these but you

412
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,289
can kind of I guess sighs but I don't

413
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,750
know that I really want this to be

414
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:46,549
sizable I think I might just want it to

415
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,558
be a fixed size and that fixed size

416
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:50,899
probably should depend to be honest with

417
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,369
you on the width of the window but I'm

418
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,030
not really caring so much about that

419
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:58,089
sort of thing at the moment so you know

420
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:01,089
you're just gonna have to live with that

421
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:01,089
and

422
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:08,910
you're gonna live with that so happy

423
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:13,019
birthday and you know that's there you

424
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:18,180
go so I'm gonna actually look at this as

425
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:21,059
an inline block and in fact we're gonna

426
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,620
use that instead so cuz I don't actually

427
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,909
need any of the graph stuff I don't need

428
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,389
to make a type for the frame slider

429
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,769
because it's always gonna be it's just a

430
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:31,230
two actually I guess to be honest with

431
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,160
you we don't even need settings for this

432
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,410
thing because it doesn't have any

433
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,390
settings it's just a little UI element

434
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,540
that allows you to control the frame and

435
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:44,100
so at the moment I guess really all I

436
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:49,309
need to do is is have that have one of

437
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:49,309
those dims where where are you mr. Jim

438
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:57,480
no no there it is

439
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:00,119
so the inline-block thingy I just need

440
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,599
to have one of these dims that we set

441
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:07,259
manually and so you know it's 1800 by I

442
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:09,240
don't know 32 we'll find out and then

443
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,309
when we do begin element rectangle and

444
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,440
element this time I'm not actually gonna

445
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:15,599
do anything in there it just nothing

446
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,350
happens it's just gonna make that and

447
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:21,839
it's gonna be fine don't worry about it

448
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:24,569
it's not sizable so it's just gonna be

449
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:28,139
that that specific size that it is and

450
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:31,049
then what I can do is say well I'll go

451
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,770
ahead and draw the flame frame slider so

452
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:36,180
draw frame slider or something like this

453
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,279
and I'll basically do the exact same

454
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,789
thing I did with the profiler right I'll

455
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:44,730
say here's here's all the stuff we were

456
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:47,849
doing so that you can do whatever you

457
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,819
want to do with it but but then I'll

458
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:53,699
implement it up in its own function for

459
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:56,189
now just to keep that switch statement a

460
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,529
little more clear so you don't have to

461
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,029
read too far through it I don't always

462
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,829
do that sometimes I like the switch

463
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:05,220
statements to get long it depends on my

464
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:08,389
mood and what the code is so anyway

465
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,390
here's draw frame slider

466
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:14,519
and the first thing that I want to do in

467
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:19,348
draw frame slider is I really really

468
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:21,118
really want to draw this like basically

469
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:23,458
I the same kind of grid that we were

470
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:25,858
drawing before so draw frame bars

471
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:27,570
actually is is almost exactly what I

472
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:29,668
want so I'm gonna start with this code

473
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:31,700
and basically chop a ton of it out if

474
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:40,320
that makes sense

475
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:41,729
what I actually want is yeah so yeah so

476
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,158
what I actually want to do is say okay

477
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:47,308
there's there's no mouse stack at the

478
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,659
moment we are gonna fill in the

479
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:49,499
rectangle it's not going to be called

480
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,239
profile rect

481
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:52,828
obviously it's I think we'll just call

482
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:56,838
it element vector or maybe I'll call it

483
00:22:52,828 --> 00:22:59,278
like total wreck totally wrecked man

484
00:22:56,838 --> 00:23:02,759
like after we went to the gym into the

485
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:05,969
squat so it's totally wrecked so anyway

486
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:10,999
then we come through here and we don't

487
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:14,249
actually need to do any of sort of the

488
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:20,069
element stuff but we need to do the

489
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:23,459
frame index stuff right so this is all

490
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:27,538
not necessary none of this is relevant

491
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:32,149
it all does not matter blah blah blah

492
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:32,148
blah blah blah blah blah but this does

493
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:38,778
right so yeah

494
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:52,480
wait what was that annex what did that

495
00:23:45,609 --> 00:23:55,058
say bar what all right so this is gonna

496
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:01,620
step us through each of the individual

497
00:23:55,058 --> 00:24:01,619
bars and this I don't care about at all

498
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:07,298
so this min X and this the the min max

499
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:10,239
are always going to be the same as well

500
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:14,109
right so the min axe is always going to

501
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:21,159
be whatever the total wrecked min X was

502
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:22,538
and we don't need this and the max X is

503
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,750
always gonna be whatever so we're just

504
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:28,179
we're just doing literally the the you

505
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,859
know a square sort of thing well Mona so

506
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:32,140
every square but a little rectangle for

507
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,949
every frame just striped across a bar

508
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,299
that's it

509
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,960
that's the whole thing we're doing

510
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:40,028
nothing else so then we have the same

511
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,778
construction where we do the outline and

512
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:46,000
all that is exactly the same the color

513
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:48,398
in this case I don't know what I want to

514
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,079
be but you know it could be white or it

515
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:55,569
could be a gray maybe it should be more

516
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:56,918
of a gray something like that and then

517
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:59,678
we we would still do it is in a

518
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,750
rectangle but at the moment you know I'm

519
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,309
not really gonna use that we're gonna

520
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,240
probably implement some code there in

521
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:06,269
just a second

522
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,190
but at first I just want this to be

523
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:12,720
working properly for drawing a little

524
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:17,558
thing that we could use for frames

525
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:23,649
that's total recluse well total total

526
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:25,740
rect viewing element is in fact yeah in

527
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:31,209
fact you know what there is no element

528
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:34,339
is there wait but now I can just pass

529
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:44,450
the regular element

530
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:50,750
yeah what is the problem

531
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:54,289
layout element to debug element what are

532
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:59,569
you talking about what are you even

533
00:25:54,289 --> 00:26:01,220
talking about right now oh that's yeah

534
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:03,549
all right yep it's time don't worry

535
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,589
about it little parameter masking there

536
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:10,099
it's alright don't worry about it

537
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:14,119
it's done and this is layout element

538
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:17,059
okay so in theory now maybe I'll have

539
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,889
something if I didn't totally mess it up

540
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:21,559
and it turns out I did totally mess it

541
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:24,430
up so that's great nice working rhetoric

542
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:27,980
you're off the team

543
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:31,070
so here's a frame slider I seem to be

544
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,539
only drawing the very first one that's

545
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,619
probably because if you want something

546
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:37,639
to happen every time three or four a

547
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:39,589
loop one here's a protip crow tip number

548
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,040
three program for 30 years so take me

549
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:45,349
take my word on this it helps to put it

550
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,849
inside the loop tends to get called more

551
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:48,740
when you put it in there so there's

552
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:51,039
actually what I wanted for my frame

553
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,039
slider

554
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:04,839
that's what we're going for okay I feel

555
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:08,019
like that maybe too many frames too many

556
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,750
frames but you know what are you gonna

557
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:14,558
do sometimes you have too many frames

558
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:18,579
too many frames too many frames too many

559
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,649
frames too many frames too many frames

560
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:28,649
so the next thing I want to do is I want

561
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:31,000
to make one of these things solid and

562
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,540
the one that I want to be solid

563
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,099
is the one that we're viewing I want to

564
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:40,569
make if if this is the frame that well

565
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:43,149
okay you know what I'm not even gonna

566
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:46,450
say stuff because words are difficult

567
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,259
and they have vocabularies with them and

568
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,429
letterings

569
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:54,339
and stuff and so what I actually just

570
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:58,929
want to do is this right I basically

571
00:27:54,339 --> 00:28:01,869
want to you know say you know are we

572
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:03,610
gonna highlight this thing and then I'm

573
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:06,000
going to check it against some of these

574
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:08,709
things so it's like if the frame index

575
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,069
happens to be you know the viewing frame

576
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:13,929
ordinal then I want to highlight it

577
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:22,509
right and I'm gonna set the highlight

578
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:26,169
color so the viewing frame the one that

579
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:29,500
we're currently looking at I'm gonna

580
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:35,620
make that be yellow because yellow is

581
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:39,519
the color of urine which is an essential

582
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:43,979
byproduct and Gandhi drank it supposedly

583
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:47,079
I wasn't there that's just what I heard

584
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:53,860
and obviously he liberated India from

585
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:55,869
the British and so pretty much as far as

586
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:57,819
science is concerned that means if you

587
00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:01,418
would like to liberate your country from

588
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:03,599
an oppressive occupant which at this

589
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:05,590
point honestly is probably my country

590
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:08,798
because that's the sort of thing we do

591
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:10,679
apparently we can't manage to stay home

592
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,089
ever

593
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,880
you should drink your own urine because

594
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:20,939
that's what we've got to go on so the

595
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,960
most recent frame to the viewing frame

596
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:27,690
will be yellow the most recent frame and

597
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,350
like the collation frame will be I think

598
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:33,600
maybe some color that shows that you

599
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:38,279
can't look at that one like that'll be

600
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:42,359
red you know the oldest frame I don't

601
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:45,629
know that we super care about too much

602
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:48,209
but I'll make that one green and the

603
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,650
most recent frame

604
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,630
well actually the most recent frame I

605
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,330
guess I'll make B green and then the

606
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,700
oldest frame I'll make be sort of a

607
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:59,549
darker green that's what I'll do

608
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,200
and so all I want to do here is say

609
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,940
let's pick out what those ordinals are

610
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,529
we're already updating them but then

611
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,940
what I want to do is say if I wanted to

612
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:08,160
highlight one of those ordinals so I

613
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,570
could see it during the sweeps if that's

614
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,390
true then I'm gonna go ahead and just

615
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:14,639
like draw the rectangle with a solid

616
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,800
backing so that it's like very clearly

617
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,400
there and I'm going to draw it in the

618
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,859
high colour that we've set above and I

619
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,580
want this to be visible so I need to

620
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:28,589
draw it kind of on the upper layer right

621
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,909
and I think we can even I think we can

622
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:31,079
do stuff like this I don't really know

623
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:37,050
if we can but I think we can

624
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:39,210
so viewing frame ordinal these all have

625
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,069
to be off of the debug state and why I

626
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,789
didn't do that to begin with I don't

627
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:43,919
know

628
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:46,409
probably it was your fault on the stream

629
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,980
somehow you weren't paying attention and

630
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:52,890
then that happened so here's debug

631
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,809
control now and you can kind of see

632
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:58,140
what's happening there right it's it

633
00:30:54,809 --> 00:31:00,450
looks more or less exactly like what we

634
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,070
would expect we don't have a way to

635
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,809
pause debug yet which is what we want to

636
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,339
do but you can see basically you've got

637
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:06,539
the red frame which is the frame that's

638
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:08,129
being collated you've got the green

639
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,450
frame right behind it which is the most

640
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,040
recent one and you've got that other

641
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,490
green frame that shows like this is

642
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,990
where debug data starts now if I'm not

643
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,509
very much an error

644
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,519
I just want to visually show you

645
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,419
something here and I'm gonna explain it

646
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,288
and it's probably not going to happen

647
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:26,859
that's what happens when I explain

648
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:28,839
strings downstream but what you can see

649
00:31:26,858 --> 00:31:33,720
here is that we've got per frame arena

650
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:35,888
space remaining we've got tons and so

651
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,329
you know and I think now that I think

652
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:39,398
about it I don't think we'd sink enough

653
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:41,798
events to make it happen so I think I

654
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:44,048
probably can't show you this but I'll

655
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:45,878
just say this I'll say what would happen

656
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:48,509
if we could make it happen which I don't

657
00:31:45,878 --> 00:31:50,469
think we can but we could go force it to

658
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:52,720
we've got per frame arena space

659
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,879
remaining right now of a hundred and

660
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,589
thirty megabytes

661
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:58,480
now what that means is that we're

662
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:01,509
storing right we've got frame arrays

663
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,878
that are 206 frames long and what that

664
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:06,639
means is that we will store 256 frames

665
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:08,888
of data if we have enough space to store

666
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:11,229
them but if we started sinking so many

667
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:13,628
debug events per frame that we actually

668
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,249
didn't have enough memory to store 2056

669
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:17,528
back frames then what would happen is we

670
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:21,368
store less back frames and what you

671
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:23,019
would see at that point is the red which

672
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:26,168
is what's being synced now what's being

673
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:28,239
collated now and the green right before

674
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:29,889
it would start to diverge and you would

675
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:32,288
have a gap of frames that were

676
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:33,998
essentially not valid they just had

677
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:36,190
nothing in them so if you viewed them

678
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:38,108
you just get nothing it would say there

679
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,970
was nothing happened because that's data

680
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:42,849
that's been freed so when we switch to

681
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,950
the game you can now see that we start

682
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:46,569
using up a lot more space but

683
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,538
unfortunately we don't use up enough

684
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:51,548
more to get down to zero now what we

685
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:53,169
could do is we could artificially limit

686
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:56,558
the amount of memory the debug system

687
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:58,419
actually has to work with and then I

688
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:03,878
could show you that happening in

689
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:05,499
practice so here is you know some sub

690
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:07,988
sub arena stuff right so I'm going to

691
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:12,339
switch this to some testing where here

692
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:15,190
we have what is this 128 K of memory

693
00:33:12,339 --> 00:33:17,168
that's not very much so maybe let's just

694
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,528
give it let's give it eight megabytes of

695
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:22,899
memory to store debug information in

696
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:25,720
okay so it's fixed to storing that's how

697
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:27,428
much you're giving the system to work

698
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,808
with and you can see right here that

699
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:30,999
number going down

700
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:34,089
then it plateaus and that's because like

701
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:35,740
I said it's only sorting 206 frames back

702
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:37,058
and the reason we did that is because we

703
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,888
you know we used to have it so just

704
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:41,499
stored as far back as it could but I

705
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:44,408
wanted to have some fixed arrays that we

706
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:46,509
could jump around in quickly and see you

707
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:49,570
know not have to traverse linked lists

708
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:52,620
all the time to get to get to them okay

709
00:33:49,569 --> 00:34:04,808
so let's say we jump into the game now

710
00:33:52,619 --> 00:34:08,888
yikes is that really true so that that

711
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:12,519
is a little concerning that means that

712
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:15,990
the number of things that were stored in

713
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:22,989
this frame and the number that we freed

714
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:26,828
were not coincident which is not good to

715
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:30,250
say the least right this is an assertion

716
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:35,139
that I added too because we we record

717
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:38,469
every time we use one of the every time

718
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:43,030
we allocate a storied event to put it in

719
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:45,219
there and when we free a frame we expect

720
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,970
that the the number of reads should

721
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:54,158
match what I don't know yeah and when we

722
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:56,289
well you know what I don't know I don't

723
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,619
know one one slight piece of information

724
00:34:56,289 --> 00:35:03,099
that I should check first which is that

725
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:06,670
when we call free frame we don't

726
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:10,300
necessarily clear that data so I think

727
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:15,099
what I probably want to do is move this

728
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,680
up to here where we say after we free a

729
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:21,068
frame we always zero it because if we

730
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,598
tried to free a frame twice that would

731
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:23,980
actually happen I don't think that

732
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,750
should ever happen and I don't think

733
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,530
that was the bug there but it just it

734
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,329
occurred to me

735
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,700
so before I start debugging I want that

736
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:34,450
to be fixed if that makes sense because

737
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:37,269
I'll forget so when we take this frame

738
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:38,980
and we after we think we're finished

739
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:41,679
with it I'm just want to wipe it out so

740
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,199
that there's nothing left in it

741
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:47,549
okay so now let's see I want to see why

742
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:47,549
that is because that should not happen

743
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,880
interesting so I guess that was actually

744
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,030
the bug when we tried to free the frames

745
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,730
twice that's weird

746
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:00,519
alright so let's watch this happen in a

747
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:07,210
little more detail here right so I'm

748
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:09,699
gonna bolt out of here and the run so

749
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,869
here we are tracking and we've got if we

750
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:13,299
take a look at how much memory we've got

751
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:14,440
we still have seven Meg's free now we're

752
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,240
gonna dive into the thing where we start

753
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,550
sinking just a ton of debug frames a

754
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,309
slept ton of debug data every frame so I

755
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:24,100
hit the spacebar and you can see it

756
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:26,949
right there how it starts to to fall

757
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:29,710
backwards right and now we have the case

758
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:32,859
where this range right here is actually

759
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:34,690
the only valid part right

760
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,789
it's it's only between there and there

761
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,639
that actually has debug data and we

762
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:43,320
don't have any from the read forward to

763
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:43,319
here that makes sense

764
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:51,519
so yeah I'm not sure that's probably I'm

765
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:53,920
not super I don't again if this were not

766
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,800
on stream I would probably go

767
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,019
investigate that double free because I

768
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,660
feel like I don't super understand why

769
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:03,489
free frame was getting called on a frame

770
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:05,769
that had already been freed and so I

771
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:08,319
feel like that's probably a bug since it

772
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:11,710
isn't the debug code and we are on

773
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,260
stream I'm not gonna do that but I'm

774
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:19,650
just gonna point that out

775
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:22,870
I would ordinarily go do it so anyway

776
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,579
what I wanted to say was like I think I

777
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:26,289
gave this sort of speech a while back

778
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:28,809
where I was like on stream I tend not to

779
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:31,239
debug things nearly as thoroughly as I

780
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:33,719
normally would to try to keep things

781
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:37,179
sort of more coherently together and

782
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:39,039
basically like you know I try to remind

783
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:42,759
people of that because in general I

784
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:44,289
would not want you to be as lacs about

785
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,030
pursuing those things if you were

786
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,800
actually working eight hours a day on

787
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:50,680
programming you should not be doing that

788
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,180
really but I don't know any way to not

789
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:54,000
do that because I'm stream it would be

790
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:55,449
very it would be even harder to follow

791
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,519
what it is that

792
00:37:55,449 --> 00:38:00,099
doing day-to-day if I jumped around as

793
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:03,550
much as I normally would in that case so

794
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:05,500
just keep that in mind so anyway on the

795
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,090
frame slider here after we draw it what

796
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:12,639
I would like to do now is make it so

797
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:16,300
that I can set you know the like I'd

798
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:17,949
like to set that the value of like if

799
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:22,120
you click in there I want to be able to

800
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:29,079
set that as an interaction and so if I

801
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:39,400
go to debug interface dot H and we look

802
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:41,710
at it like it's in here then what I want

803
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,550
to do is I want to be able to make an

804
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:48,970
interaction that will set you know what

805
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:51,430
frame you're talking about and so in

806
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:55,709
order to do that what I'm gonna do here

807
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:57,819
is say well where's my interaction code

808
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:00,159
there it is

809
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:11,820
there's gonna be a thing that's like a

810
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:15,399
debug interaction set view frame ordinal

811
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,430
something like that I let's just say

812
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:24,090
it's that and so then I'm gonna make one

813
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:24,089
of these here where I can say like okay

814
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:31,929
debunk interaction and get rid of all

815
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:33,819
this stuff and we'll say the net hot

816
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:38,199
next hot in direction in this case is

817
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:42,760
this one and it is set view frame

818
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:44,619
ordinal and the you know whatever it is

819
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,540
the index and we should have one of

820
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:50,619
these we don't the moment include two

821
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:53,320
you know given 32 or something we want

822
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:56,219
to set our U and 32 to be equal to the

823
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:02,170
frame index that we currently have and

824
00:39:56,219 --> 00:40:05,949
that's just all fine and stuff so that

825
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:08,289
is what that will do we don't have a

826
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:10,899
graph ID do we or we do

827
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:14,019
it should just be called debug ID or or

828
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:16,030
slider ID I guess so we'll set the

829
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:19,030
slider idea we don't actually need that

830
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,760
no one's going to use that at all

831
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,890
but we'll just set it anyway and that

832
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:29,200
can be our interaction we could also if

833
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:34,299
we wanted to make this happen and by

834
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:37,179
this I mean I don't really know what we

835
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:41,200
were using that for exactly but I just

836
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:44,559
mean hey let's print out whatever the

837
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:48,129
frame index is so that you can see which

838
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:52,750
ordinal it is in case anyone cares at

839
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:54,490
all which they probably don't and really

840
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,320
all I'm all I was saying with that was

841
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:58,809
you know like hey you could see which

842
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,850
ordinal it was probably what I'd want to

843
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:05,679
do instead is print out how many frames

844
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:11,710
back we were which maybe I'll do if I'm

845
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:15,059
in the mood for love you know just in

846
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:18,849
that mood but is just a feel up shoe is

847
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:21,429
sensual so I'm gonna go ahead and search

848
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,869
for that interaction code because

849
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:28,149
frankly I don't remember anything about

850
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:31,679
that at all so let's go ahead and go

851
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,760
down there to where we actually do that

852
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,500
and here is basically all of our

853
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,040
interaction code that we've written so

854
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:40,840
far so here's an interaction it doesn't

855
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:45,730
really do anything interesting at all

856
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:47,470
other than just set what was it called

857
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:50,500
we had a name for it

858
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:52,779
viewing frame ordinal so it sets the

859
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:59,099
viewing frame ordinal equal to whatever

860
00:41:52,780 --> 00:42:04,080
this whatever this guy says it should be

861
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:07,869
and that's all it does that's all it do

862
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:12,329
yeah and so if I come in here and I drag

863
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:12,329
select on this that's not good

864
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:22,199
someone want to tell me what that's it

865
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:26,009
Oh what

866
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:32,139
who wrote this ridiculous code that's

867
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:36,700
garbage this is just plain ridiculous

868
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:39,609
I do not know who thought this was even

869
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:41,789
remotely going to work because surprise

870
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:43,599
it's totally not

871
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:47,219
that's probably wasn't actually a

872
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,219
surprise to anyone

873
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,800
yeah I don't even know why that would be

874
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,799
a surprise

875
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,669
OOP

876
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:05,710
whoops what did I don't don't know what

877
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:08,559
F key I hit there don't even know so

878
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:13,179
that allows us to kind of do some stuff

879
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:15,880
but it's not good it's not really slider

880
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:17,019
II so I probably need to make that

881
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,559
interaction a little bit better well

882
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:22,869
we'll we'll just we'll leave it like

883
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:27,039
that for now just for the second just

884
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:30,549
for the split estelle splits seconds or

885
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:33,250
splits as they're called in when you're

886
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:35,289
really super advanced programming you

887
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,699
use the term seconds for split second so

888
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,449
I don't know if you knew that it's a

889
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:42,909
computer science term so what I want to

890
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:45,730
do is I want to start taking the place

891
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:49,929
all the places right now where people

892
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:51,699
were using the ordinal most recent and

893
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:53,980
then want to basically make them all use

894
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:56,949
the other one so I want to say that I'm

895
00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:03,929
gonna replace like the most recent frame

896
00:43:56,949 --> 00:44:07,000
ordinal yeah with viewing frame ordinal

897
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:11,619
and I can't see because it's behind my

898
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,389
head I think so that's unfortunate

899
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:14,980
you know what oh I know what I can do I

900
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:18,539
can switch over into this thing because

901
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:25,550
my head's not on the side BAM

902
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:30,750
yep so now now now we can do most recent

903
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:35,490
frame ordinal and viewing frame ordinal

904
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:42,500
and I can say what I want so draw a

905
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:42,500
profile yes please draw frame slider no

906
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:50,840
stored event thread interval graph yes

907
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:53,929
yes

908
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:19,679
yo that's a tough one yeah yeah yep

909
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:19,680
debug begin interact oh man no I guess

910
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:28,919
I'm gonna say no no no

911
00:45:33,298 --> 00:46:00,788
no no no no and then I'm gonna say last

912
00:45:50,199 --> 00:46:04,269
frame time yeah yeah so this is now

913
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:11,459
gonna be awesome is what this is going

914
00:46:04,268 --> 00:46:17,468
to be it's gonna be super awesome

915
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:19,899
maybe possibly or approaching the

916
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:21,909
awesomeness so now we can just kind of

917
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:24,670
go through here and we can pick any

918
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:27,788
frame that we wanted to view right and

919
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,289
we can view that frame so we can see

920
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:31,170
like oh how many milliseconds was each

921
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:33,759
of these frames you know what was the

922
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:36,479
information available at that time what

923
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:40,150
did the profile look like on that frame

924
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:43,118
and similarly all this stuff would also

925
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:47,259
be correct so for example like in here

926
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:50,858
if we were doing some stuff I feel like

927
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:52,539
I feel like it's still I guess one

928
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:55,058
problem is its what it's doing the

929
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:58,059
viewing its viewing the state of the

930
00:46:55,059 --> 00:47:02,519
events at that time so I guess one of s

931
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:07,150
when we actually draw I'm gonna have to

932
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:14,438
not do that right cuz it's actually

933
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:18,729
taking that was a flaw on the plan I

934
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:22,318
admit that I admit that up front

935
00:47:18,728 --> 00:47:22,318
let's go address that

936
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:32,900
yeah that's pretty plain okay so in

937
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:37,130
terms of how the debug views go that's

938
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:39,500
looking up into like whether something

939
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:43,460
is standard or not I don't feel like

940
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,599
that actually should I don't feel like

941
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,119
that actually should have caused a

942
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:49,250
problem hold on one second let's let's

943
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:57,858
let's just figure out exactly why that

944
00:47:49,250 --> 00:48:01,088
was happening where's the view hash get

945
00:47:57,858 --> 00:48:08,960
debug view oops

946
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:11,058
get or create debug view for so we do a

947
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,500
hash here and with the requisite comment

948
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:24,859
remember you always have to put that

949
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:29,239
comment in so what are we having we are

950
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:31,778
hashing the two you 32s for the debug ID

951
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:37,179
for that thing whatever that thing is

952
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:42,409
right and so when we call get or create

953
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:47,960
give a view for what are we actually

954
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:49,879
passing for those debug IDs now in this

955
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,659
this one we don't this is not an expand

956
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,710
or collapse kind of scenario right so

957
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,848
that's not the one we actually care

958
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,940
about the one that we actually care

959
00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:02,630
about is for example one of these and so

960
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:05,059
to get that that one where we call that

961
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,890
where we get that view we use an ID

962
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:14,240
that's generated from the tree and the

963
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:17,929
link and the link is actually the in the

964
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,348
the tree itself right so I'm going to

965
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:20,348
take a look

966
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:37,590
that's in the iterator for this which is

967
00:49:34,469 --> 00:49:49,980
the debug variable iterator so where is

968
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:52,100
the debug variable iterator I don't know

969
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,969
why we do that in order by the way I

970
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:56,759
think that was cuz we were trying to

971
00:49:53,969 --> 00:50:00,259
show how to do it but it's kind of dumb

972
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:03,480
anyway debug variable links are stable

973
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:11,790
so I don't really understand why that

974
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:17,329
would have been the case that's a little

975
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:17,329
bit puzzling so let me see

976
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:33,750
I wish to understand more I wish to know

977
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:34,860
more expanded well actually I guess I

978
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:38,159
really just want to look at toggle

979
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:50,519
expansion toggle expansion expansion

980
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:55,529
toggles toggle expansion so this is

981
00:50:50,519 --> 00:51:03,210
toggle expansion and get or create debug

982
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:09,080
view for he's just looking at whatever

983
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:09,079
the ID was for this interaction so

984
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:23,099
so I don't see why that would that does

985
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:33,680
not make a lot of sense to me I don't

986
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:33,679
see why that would be sort of variant

987
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:51,269
for toggle value yeah I'm not sure what

988
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,038
we want to do for event editing like

989
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:56,699
it's a theoretical that you'd want to

990
00:51:53,039 --> 00:52:00,059
allow editing of the events back in the

991
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:01,739
past but really what we want to do is

992
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,619
just not allow you to edit things in the

993
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:07,949
past because they won't take effect you

994
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:11,730
know what I mean so it doesn't really

995
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:13,848
make a whole lot of sense either way so

996
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:22,230
this I don't know this may have to wait

997
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:28,220
for for to debug like that's super weird

998
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:28,219
I do not understand

999
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:36,200
because there still should be I guess

1000
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,710
it's because the stuff isn't in there

1001
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:43,849
yet

1002
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:46,159
oh yeah I guess that is the case so it's

1003
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:50,269
looking for those things there's nothing

1004
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:52,250
actually in that slot yet okay yeah no

1005
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:54,650
that's now that I think about it that's

1006
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,030
actually correct so it's going to try to

1007
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,889
display stuff but there's nothing in

1008
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:00,260
there on that frame because it hasn't

1009
00:52:57,889 --> 00:53:04,159
been written yet so I guess that is

1010
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:05,600
actually fine I guess that's okay all

1011
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:06,799
right so let me just finish up in the

1012
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,299
last five minutes what I was going do

1013
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,470
and we'll see if that continues to be

1014
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,700
true but I guess that's actually correct

1015
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:11,409
cuz it just won't draw anything if

1016
00:53:10,699 --> 00:53:14,179
there's nothing there

1017
00:53:11,409 --> 00:53:16,429
so it's not that it hasn't it's not that

1018
00:53:14,179 --> 00:53:17,119
it isn't collapsed or expanded it's that

1019
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:18,829
there's nothing there

1020
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,750
when we jump into the game since we set

1021
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:23,179
the debug size down and we leave a big

1022
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,679
gap there whenever the gap of debug data

1023
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:28,429
would come across it wouldn't happen yet

1024
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:31,599
okay it all makes for any sense now all

1025
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:34,909
makes perfect sense now both programming

1026
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,079
so anyway all that really means is I

1027
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:38,779
just have to finish up and then we'll be

1028
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,460
fine so when we actually do debug start

1029
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:45,250
what we want to do is we want to see

1030
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:45,250
whether or not we are paused right and

1031
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:49,460
you know we'll want to do and if paused

1032
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:51,920
here basically but right now we don't

1033
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:55,340
have that quite yet or we don't actually

1034
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,740
use it right but if we are not paused

1035
00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:04,100
and we want like the most recent frame

1036
00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:07,279
ordinal to overwrite viewing frame

1037
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:09,409
ordinal so normally like you know this

1038
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,720
is we're running the same way we were

1039
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:13,549
before and so when you look at something

1040
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:15,889
you're looking at the current frame and

1041
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:18,380
it's telling you that and it's all fine

1042
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:20,750
right but then we need a way to

1043
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:22,849
basically pause and make it so that

1044
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:26,989
we're not gonna continue anymore by the

1045
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:30,079
way like let's talk about this like

1046
00:54:26,989 --> 00:54:31,549
that's pretty baller right there you can

1047
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,799
just tear that off if you want to

1048
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:37,870
because we're awesome it's like I just

1049
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:42,950
want to like move my UI around anyway so

1050
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:45,079
if I want to write I can what I want to

1051
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:48,439
be able do now is pause this

1052
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:50,599
so that I can then I can then go in and

1053
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,289
like click right now I can't click on it

1054
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:56,089
anymore

1055
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:58,420
because if I were to click on it it'll

1056
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:00,440
just immediately get overwritten right

1057
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:02,659
so another thing I could do is I could

1058
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,429
make it so that if any if I click on the

1059
00:55:02,659 --> 00:55:05,690
debug if I click on one of these it'll

1060
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:08,809
just automatically stop that's another

1061
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:10,400
thing I could do but either way the

1062
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:14,210
primary point here is we have to

1063
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:17,119
implement some way of pausing so I think

1064
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:21,559
we had a variable for pause like I think

1065
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:25,029
we had a pause right but I don't think

1066
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:27,139
it does anything anymore so so you know

1067
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,600
it's nice to have a variable called

1068
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:31,129
paused but if you never reference that

1069
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,259
variable anywhere other than to set it

1070
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:35,480
to false not gonna do a lot for you

1071
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,640
right that's another pro tip right there

1072
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,380
that you can use to become a better

1073
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:41,299
programmer is if you don't use a

1074
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:44,539
variable it won't have an effect very

1075
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,580
important so what we want to do here is

1076
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:50,150
say if we're not paused then we are

1077
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:51,619
going to overwrite that now what we need

1078
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,510
to implement now is just some way of

1079
00:55:51,619 --> 00:56:00,589
saying when we are paused don't

1080
00:55:53,510 --> 00:56:06,770
overwrite stuff anymore right so you

1081
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:09,970
know like here so this sort of situation

1082
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:16,579
oops when we come through and we call

1083
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:18,500
collate debug event records so in here

1084
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:19,940
when we see a frame marker and we do the

1085
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,460
collation frame you can kind of see here

1086
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:25,940
we come through and we increment the

1087
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:29,269
frame ordinal you know this sort of

1088
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:36,070
thing I think all we have to do is just

1089
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:39,199
not do that if that makes sense so

1090
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:44,690
basically we would just freed that frame

1091
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:47,259
immediately and then just keep going so

1092
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,260
we would do

1093
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:57,559
if debug state well I guess we actually

1094
00:56:55,309 --> 00:57:00,460
want to do it yeah absolutely around if

1095
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:03,739
we're paused then we just do free frame

1096
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:09,110
debug states diverse state collation

1097
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:09,439
frame ordinal goodbye been nice knowing

1098
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:16,910
you

1099
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:19,909
off it goes and otherwise we advance so

1100
00:57:16,909 --> 00:57:22,969
then what I'll say is well you know when

1101
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:27,049
we set this thing probably we wanted to

1102
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:31,639
pause and then we'll just have to make a

1103
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:32,539
way to non pause right but there's our

1104
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:34,730
profile

1105
00:57:32,539 --> 00:57:36,409
there's our frame slider ething and so

1106
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:37,760
if i click there and now we are paused

1107
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:50,029
and here we go

1108
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:52,040
right which is pretty great awesome very

1109
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:54,350
happy about that

1110
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:55,849
yeah so we're getting there man this is

1111
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:58,719
starting to be some pretty this is

1112
00:57:55,849 --> 00:58:01,519
turning me some pretty sweet action now

1113
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,199
we need an unpause obviously we'll do

1114
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:04,340
that next week and we need those buttons

1115
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,589
I was talking about we also need to go

1116
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:11,240
finally fix the OpenGL multi-threading

1117
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:13,340
thing Oh OpenGL so we don't have to

1118
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:16,759
worry about texture downloads still

1119
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:19,450
being wrong so much for reading white

1120
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:23,930
papers about how to download textures

1121
00:58:19,449 --> 00:58:26,779
anyway so what we want to do here right

1122
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:28,909
is I just wanted to demonstrate too that

1123
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:31,519
we track all the debug data now so for

1124
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:34,699
example this dude right if we open up

1125
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,559
now that we have selected him if we open

1126
00:58:34,699 --> 00:58:38,689
up the simulation and look at the entity

1127
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,360
data we don't actually need this profile

1128
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:44,000
dating here you know it goes all around

1129
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:46,640
and we track that data right and now if

1130
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,920
we want to we can also you know just say

1131
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:52,609
like oh okay let's let's go ahead and

1132
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:55,269
and zoom back through there so not only

1133
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:58,430
like will our profile be you know

1134
00:58:55,269 --> 00:59:00,409
accurate back then but so will all of

1135
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:02,210
the data we captured like all of its

1136
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:04,789
still good so we can look

1137
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:06,380
at our data and our profile together and

1138
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:07,730
do all the operations we would normally

1139
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,500
be able to do like if we want to zoom in

1140
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:11,510
on one of these things we can we can

1141
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,519
look at every last little thing and not

1142
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,140
only can we look at it but once we look

1143
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,750
at it we can actually see how it varies

1144
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:21,980
over time to write by looking at was

1145
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:25,849
there any differences between these yeah

1146
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:28,309
this profiler is baller I think by the

1147
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:32,180
end of next week I'm basically just

1148
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:33,679
gonna like have to like call the

1149
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:36,440
Smithsonian and be like do you want to

1150
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,598
put this profiler in there because it's

1151
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:46,700
pretty much the best profiler that like

1152
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:49,070
America has ever made okay put it next

1153
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:50,779
to john f kennedy's brain or whatever it

1154
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,190
is you're keeping in there that no one

1155
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,070
cares about because this profiler is

1156
00:59:52,190 --> 01:00:00,230
going to be cooler than that by a

1157
00:59:54,070 --> 01:00:01,760
substantial substantial margin all right

1158
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:04,510
I'll take literally five minutes of Q&amp;A

1159
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,510
but then I gotta go

1160
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:36,329
fwe for how much would it cost to save

1161
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:38,699
draw buffer snapshots so when you pause

1162
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:41,639
you can show the visual state it was in

1163
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:47,639
or maybe save enough data to resented

1164
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:53,639
the frame um so honestly most of that's

1165
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:55,139
just OpenGL busy work right so if we if

1166
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:56,639
we only cared about working with our

1167
01:00:55,139 --> 01:00:59,129
software renderer the answer is this

1168
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,989
trivial you just allocate 256 back

1169
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:04,110
buffers and you point to a different one

1170
01:01:00,989 --> 01:01:06,569
each time free so it's literally free

1171
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:08,039
like there's a little more cash maybe if

1172
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:10,980
that ever stayed hot but it probably

1173
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:13,429
doesn't through the cycle so it's just

1174
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:16,679
free so software render it's really

1175
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:19,019
Hardware renderer it probably takes a

1176
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:21,089
little more doing but basically the same

1177
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:25,199
technique would probably work so what we

1178
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:27,539
would do is we just allocate 286 back

1179
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:28,710
buffers on the card and just be like hey

1180
01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:30,690
you better have a car with a lot of

1181
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:32,519
memory bro

1182
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,769
and then each time we would render to

1183
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:39,780
one of those first then flip that one

1184
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:40,949
flip that one to the screen and then we

1185
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:44,730
could just go back to the other back

1186
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:47,129
buffer I would be willing to do that

1187
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:50,219
sometime I that's probably not too hard

1188
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:52,170
I mean it's definitely not too hard I

1189
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:54,799
just I worry about the amount of stream

1190
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:57,869
stream time spent on doing OpenGL things

1191
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:01,410
because they're super not relevant

1192
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:03,150
like GPU programming will be total like

1193
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:05,069
building this profiler every last thing

1194
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:07,349
I did in here is relevant to programming

1195
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:08,670
in my mind like you should know every

1196
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:11,009
last thing that I did in here and

1197
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:12,659
understand why like how it was doing

1198
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:14,580
what it was doing and how I went from

1199
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:15,869
one state to the other and decided to

1200
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:17,610
move things around like all that stuff

1201
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:20,519
is classic programming that I think will

1202
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:23,940
never not be relevant to training your

1203
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:25,050
brain how to use OpenGL literally no one

1204
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,119
will care about in ten years

1205
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,980
like the way we program GPUs today will

1206
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,960
be completely irrelevant you will never

1207
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:34,170
need to know a single thing about how to

1208
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,639
call OpenGL or Vulcan or D 3d or metal

1209
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:38,400
or any of this other garbage that'll

1210
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:40,019
just be gone right and we replaced with

1211
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,280
hopefully something good but probably

1212
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:42,840
just another crappy thing with a

1213
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,000
different name that's somebody else

1214
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:47,579
screwed up so

1215
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,119
you know I worry about spending too much

1216
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:54,049
time on you know GPU stuff because it's

1217
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:57,299
just not educational it's really just

1218
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:58,740
completely transient and doesn't really

1219
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,160
benefit you much to know except in the

1220
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:01,159
instant

1221
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,679
mongolians is it is it impossible to

1222
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:15,210
keep the entire code base in mind when

1223
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,529
developing a larger project how does

1224
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,970
this impact code design decisions in

1225
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:21,119
handmade hero what about other larger

1226
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:24,239
projects eg a triple-a titles the answer

1227
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,730
is no or I should say I guess you said

1228
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:29,159
is it impossible yes it is impossible to

1229
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:30,840
keep the entire code base in mind when

1230
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:32,940
developing a larger project that is true

1231
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,380
and I don't think there's ever been a

1232
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:38,250
programmer who could do that for a

1233
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:40,530
triple-a title but when you are

1234
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:42,510
developing large projects you can still

1235
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:44,280
work around this limitation and the way

1236
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:48,630
to work around that limitation is by

1237
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:52,800
reducing systems to understandable sort

1238
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:55,200
of repeatable pieces before moving on so

1239
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,869
that you can clearly understand how they

1240
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,750
would work when you come back to them

1241
01:03:56,869 --> 01:04:03,690
and so like for example the debug system

1242
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:05,550
in handmade hero here is crazy right

1243
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:08,340
like the stuff we've been doing is super

1244
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:10,230
weird and so if we were planning on

1245
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:13,170
handmade hero being like a very large

1246
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:15,809
project and lots of people having to

1247
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:19,380
come back to this debug code and do it

1248
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:21,989
if this were not on stream what we would

1249
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:22,470
then probably do is we'd spend a week or

1250
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:25,679
two

1251
01:04:22,469 --> 01:04:27,569
like solidifying everything making it as

1252
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,819
clear as possible breaking some things

1253
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:31,650
out you know just like putting it into a

1254
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:33,750
state where it'd be very easy to

1255
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:35,280
understand how each piece worked because

1256
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:38,400
right now it's very like tightly

1257
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,800
integrated and it's largely about how we

1258
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,349
got there when we were doing car sort of

1259
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,609
explorations and so you have to keep

1260
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:47,640
that in mind as you scale up to larger

1261
01:04:44,608 --> 01:04:49,380
projects that often times before moving

1262
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:51,719
out of a section for a while

1263
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:54,750
you need to spend some time basically

1264
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,639
bolting it up into a place where when

1265
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,809
you come back to it it's more obvious

1266
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:59,809
how it's supposed to work

1267
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:07,579
is the engine portion expected to be the

1268
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:11,289
largest chunk of the handmade hair

1269
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:11,289
project yes definitely

1270
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:17,419
so look I would say that it after the

1271
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,750
dista bug code is done I think we will

1272
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:22,760
mostly probably be working on game Cody

1273
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:25,460
stuff but a lot of that will still be

1274
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,079
enginee like we'll be making a sort of

1275
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:29,088
the final collision detector as we go

1276
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:31,160
and we'll be making like a nice amenity

1277
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:33,889
system stuff that's you know not

1278
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:36,049
necessarily hard welded to the game and

1279
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:38,059
other things like that but definitely

1280
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:39,769
like the point of this is engine

1281
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:41,719
programming I'm not a game designer I

1282
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:46,940
have nothing to say about game code at

1283
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:50,118
all literally and and I have nothing to

1284
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:52,369
say about game design so hand made here

1285
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:54,380
is strictly an engine project but in

1286
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:55,789
order to build an engine of any value

1287
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,019
you have to have a game to go with it or

1288
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:59,269
at least understand how a game would

1289
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:01,820
work with it and so I felt like it was

1290
01:05:59,269 --> 01:06:02,989
very important to make a game not just

1291
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,730
an engine because otherwise you don't

1292
01:06:02,989 --> 01:06:06,319
know if you really made an engine that

1293
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:08,449
can do anything right unless you

1294
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:10,160
actually prove here's a game it's

1295
01:06:08,449 --> 01:06:12,078
interesting you know the game looks

1296
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:13,818
looks like it should and feels like it

1297
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,470
should ok then we know this engine can

1298
01:06:13,818 --> 01:06:17,059
at least make a game that's very

1299
01:06:15,469 --> 01:06:18,828
important I think I don't think you can

1300
01:06:17,059 --> 01:06:24,230
really make an engine in the back vacuum

1301
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:26,869
and have it be very good and so so yeah

1302
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:30,230
so mostly everything we do I ballpark

1303
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:31,789
like 600 episodes at a minimum mostly

1304
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:34,159
everything we do in those 600 episodes

1305
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:35,568
will be engine code it just some of it

1306
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:36,679
will be more game related than others

1307
01:06:35,568 --> 01:06:38,239
like some of it will be okay we're

1308
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:41,179
making an animation loop for a guy

1309
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:42,739
that's kind of game code II but it'll

1310
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:45,259
still be mostly about how do we make

1311
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:47,719
animation loops not about how do we

1312
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:50,089
program it this particular person's

1313
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:52,689
animation loop because that's not super

1314
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:52,690
interesting to me

1315
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,019
Culver fly can you please expend again

1316
01:06:57,789 --> 01:07:01,029
the problem with texture loading why

1317
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:03,940
does it not work occasionally well so

1318
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:05,620
the answer axes we don't know we tried

1319
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:07,360
doing what Nvidia had suggest in their

1320
01:07:05,619 --> 01:07:11,109
white paper to get more to get texture

1321
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:12,400
overlaps on the GPU side it turns out

1322
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,440
they don't actually implement that in

1323
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,570
their consumer level cards a and AMD

1324
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:19,389
seems to have a problem with it as well

1325
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:21,400
so as far as I can tell it's just a bad

1326
01:07:19,389 --> 01:07:23,409
idea and who knows why it's not working

1327
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,940
could be any number of reasons so we

1328
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:26,799
will probably replace that with one that

1329
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:32,679
does not actually try to overlap it with

1330
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:34,690
two contexts so all right but we'll get

1331
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:39,069
to that later like just stay tuned we'll

1332
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:40,720
fix that at some point but again since

1333
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:42,760
we don't have source coded drivers we'll

1334
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:44,649
never really know what the bug is unless

1335
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:46,630
someone an Nvidia debugs it and I'm

1336
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:55,329
sorry this is a named Akari if someone

1337
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:56,980
at AMD debugs it and tells us right all

1338
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:58,179
right thank you everyone for joining me

1339
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,349
for another episode of handmade hero

1340
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:01,089
it's been a pleasure coding with you as

1341
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:03,190
always if you want to follow along the

1342
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:04,510
series source code at home you can

1343
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:06,220
always pure to the game on handmade hero

1344
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,990
or it comes with a source code so you

1345
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:09,039
can follow along and do experiments and

1346
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:10,569
learn from it in all the other good

1347
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,769
stuff we also have forums that you can

1348
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:13,180
go to if you want to ask questions you

1349
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:15,070
have a patreon page you can use if you

1350
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:16,269
want support the video series and we

1351
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,710
have a tweet pops tweet schedule which

1352
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:20,730
will tell you the schedule for next week

1353
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:24,960
if you would like to come back next week

1354
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:30,099
and see our profiler get up - previously

1355
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:32,649
unknown heights of baller ism that's it

1356
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:36,130
for today hope see you back here next

1357
01:08:32,649 --> 01:08:37,149
week until then have fun programming and

1358
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:39,840
I'll see you guys on the Internet

1359
01:08:37,149 --> 01:08:39,839
techies everyone
