00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,278
according start cording okay hello

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,679
everyone and welcome to handmade Hero

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,960
the show recode a complete game live on

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,739
Twitch no engines no libraries here it's

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,080
only just us and we go through every

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,839
last bit of technology that's required

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:24,899
to make a game possible now at the

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:29,550
moment we're sort of at a decision point

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:31,678
and I kind of decided I think which way

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,570
I want to go we talked at the end of

11
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,369
yesterday's dream about whether or not

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,100
we would go finish the asset loader or

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,808
do an audio mixer first and I kind of

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,489
decided that I that what I want to do is

15
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:43,199
do an audio mixer first and the reason

16
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:47,578
that I'd like to do an audio mixer first

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,449
is because I don't actually know whether

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:55,079
we're going to want to do multi-part

19
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:58,159
loading of wav files and so I'd like to

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,628
see how the audio code shakes out first

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,698
to see whether we'll ever really care

22
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:04,469
about that so that I know whether or not

23
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,640
I want to put that in the asset system

24
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,840
and if so how and what I mean by that is

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,819
normally for sound effects obviously I

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,030
don't think we would need to do anything

27
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:17,789
fancy there because they are small sound

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,400
effects that we would load in one go and

29
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,799
play back but if you imagine something

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,228
like a three or four-minute piece of

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,000
music well that's something that maybe

32
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:30,209
you don't want to keep the entire thing

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,969
in memory at once let's say and so you

34
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:35,578
maybe are pulling in chunks of it at a

35
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,950
time so that you only have to load a

36
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,868
certain amount of it and you know maybe

37
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,609
you only load say ten seconds of that

38
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,009
and then when that 10 seconds are

39
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:47,129
consumed you know you bring in the next

40
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,560
ten seconds and so on so I don't know I

41
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,438
feel like these days there probably is

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,500
really no reason to bother with asset

43
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:57,688
streaming of that form because you know

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,209
if if I take a look if you just do sort

45
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:02,938
of the back of the envelope calculation

46
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:06,179
on it and you figure if you have

47
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:08,429
something that's going at 48,000 samples

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,099
per second and you're talking about a

49
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,360
stereo piece of music that's 16-bit so

50
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,619
you're talking about four bytes per

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,080
sample right

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,739
then that 192 kilobytes is basically

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,150
going to be how much a second of music

54
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,789
is worth right and so if I go ahead and

55
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,090
say I want to have say pieces of music

56
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:36,179
that are you know something like three

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,539
minutes in duration and I multiply that

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,060
out if I go ahead and do my megabyte

59
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,298
calculation that's 32 megabytes of

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,609
memory right and so when we take a look

61
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,859
at how much memory is likely to be in a

62
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:52,170
machine and we ask ourselves you know

63
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:55,560
can we spare say 64 megabytes of memory

64
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:58,919
as a music streaming buffer the answer

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,598
is probably yes and so I don't know if

66
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:06,089
it makes any sense to really think about

67
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:09,719
this problem very deeply at the same

68
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,039
time you know is it something we're

69
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,109
showing on stream is it worth doing for

70
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,929
educational purposes potentially I don't

71
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,939
know maybe it is so I just want to leave

72
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,329
that door open even though we may really

73
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:23,669
not need to go through it I feel like

74
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,219
maybe what we should do is go ahead and

75
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,400
do the music stuff first or I should say

76
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:31,500
the sound system first then come back

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,329
wind up the asset loader then come back

78
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,829
wind up the render like kind of a

79
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,819
Russian nesting doll thing and then we

80
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:40,169
would pretty much be on to our main

81
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,208
engine stuff but we want to do a little

82
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,439
bit of debug display stuff if I remember

83
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,900
correctly from the to-do list but other

84
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,449
than that we would have wound things up

85
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,980
pretty nicely at that point so yeah so

86
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:52,190
I'm gonna go over to the blackboard and

87
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,988
we're gonna talk a little bit about

88
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:56,729
sound since a lot of people out there

89
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,128
who are maybe seeing this stuff for the

90
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,388
first time have not really had much of

91
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:02,370
an introduction to sound and maybe

92
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,739
aren't thinking about sound in any way

93
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,329
other than I know that you know like you

94
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,650
know in unity I can call some function

95
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,120
to play a sound or something right but

96
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,430
they maybe haven't had much experience

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,689
with sound at a low level knowing what

98
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,319
it is how it works and those sorts of

99
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:20,910
things so let's talk a little bit about

100
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:23,728
that so here we are on day 139 and we'll

101
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,640
talk about sound and I can put also and

102
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:27,689
music in here because music nowadays

103
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,139
most of the time

104
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:34,110
is just a very long sound because hey

105
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,300
we've got so much technology now for and

106
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,699
and so much horsepower you don't have to

107
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,230
do things like meeting music anymore we

108
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,519
can actually just have full recordings

109
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,629
of whatever we want and play them back

110
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:49,169
in games which is kind of cool so let's

111
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,639
talk about sound what basically are we

112
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,780
even talking about when we talk about

113
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,209
sound okay so what happens is in the

114
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,869
real world the whole way that you can

115
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:03,719
hear sound in the first place right is

116
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,340
the world is filled with molecules right

117
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,050
the world is filled with all these

118
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,639
little molecules and they're kind of in

119
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,350
the air like you know here's the air or

120
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,990
whatever and then there's like some

121
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,000
dense molecules over here that make up

122
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,850
like you know a wall or something and

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,519
whatever right and what sound is is

124
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,990
these molecules are naturally moving

125
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:27,419
around and when there is some kind of

126
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,920
force exerted on them that's coherent

127
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,660
like you know we push them in this

128
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,240
direction like you could think of wind

129
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,550
or something like this you know just

130
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,860
like just pushing on these these things

131
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,840
in the air or whatever they start to

132
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,930
move coherently and what you get is you

133
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,519
get an oscillation as they move and then

134
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,230
return to where they were they like

135
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,060
oscillate back and forth with this force

136
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,620
that's applied they kind of move a

137
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,680
little and then they they come back to a

138
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,199
steady state and that vibration as these

139
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,579
molecules hit each other and so on gets

140
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,409
passed throughout the world right and so

141
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:04,050
you know one way to think of it might be

142
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,240
if you imagine that the sort of scene

143
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,189
where you have a ripple in a pond right

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,439
and the ripple kind of comes outwards

145
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:12,329
right from where you go you see those

146
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,009
little waves the water eventually

147
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,810
returns to normal but there's these

148
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:19,199
ripples that sent that send through it

149
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:22,160
right and if there were things you know

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,599
obstacles in the path those those those

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,460
ripples would hit the obstacle and they

152
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,050
would bounce off creating new ripples

153
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:29,759
and those ripples would actually

154
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,240
potentially interfere with each other to

155
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,099
create new patterns right that is very

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,410
much the model that you have to think

157
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,710
about when you think about sound it is

158
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,439
not really like light the way light

159
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,089
works of course

160
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,339
we know is light travels in a straight

161
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:48,669
line it carries information almost

162
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:51,099
perfectly it bounces off of things in a

163
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:53,980
very specific way and then travels in

164
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,010
another straight line right that is not

165
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,050
sound sound does not work that way

166
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,939
basically sound is carried by all of the

167
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,189
molecules in the world if you think

168
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:06,120
about that way and the vibration that is

169
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:08,500
created by any given motion like that is

170
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,300
propagated in fully fully in three

171
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,649
dimensions so you don't really want to

172
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,090
think about sound if you really want to

173
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:14,699
conceptualize it properly you don't

174
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:17,289
really want to think about sound as

175
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,680
traveling from a point to another point

176
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:23,890
like we think of light doing you want to

177
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,949
think about sound as being a volume a

178
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,629
volumetric thing where you know it can

179
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,240
come around corners and stuff like this

180
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:33,129
right like you know if I have a doorway

181
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,920
from let's say I'm looking from the top

182
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:37,420
down right and here's my little doorway

183
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,810
right so I don't know maybe the door is

184
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:44,350
open that's the door this is a room and

185
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:47,350
here's here's my sound so I emit some

186
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,960
sound here right well the sound that's

187
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,700
coming through here you know maybe it

188
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:53,229
bounces off the door and comes in and

189
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,168
you can hear it and so on right and that

190
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,939
part feels a little bit like light does

191
00:07:56,168 --> 00:08:00,549
right where it bounces off surfaces

192
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:03,339
because if surfaces are hard they're

193
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,470
going to reflect that vibration much

194
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,149
more stiffly than something that's soft

195
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,760
and has more give and will absorb more

196
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,979
of it right so that is true but even if

197
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,250
this door wasn't there as these ripples

198
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,500
happen there they're constantly rippling

199
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,879
you know sort of outward they're you

200
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,310
know they're they're creating these

201
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,959
outward forces and so even if that door

202
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,000
wasn't there the ripples would still

203
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,529
kind of make it through and they would

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,629
be able to turn corners and stuff like

205
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:30,279
this because all of the molecules are

206
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:34,240
kind of getting dispersed in this sort

207
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:36,788
of very this the sort of very diffuse

208
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
way if that makes sense now these are

209
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,179
not things if you have to really

210
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,379
understand too much and of course I

211
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,899
don't understand them that much either

212
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:45,879
right like much like I said with light I

213
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,860
understand it only in a very basic way

214
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,629
because I do rendering work and I have

215
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,519
to know a certain amount about it sound

216
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,909
is the same way I don't know anything

217
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,069
about sound you know I know

218
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,779
only the very basic parts about Samuel

219
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,120
variations I don't know anything that a

220
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,529
scientist who studies things like Sam

221
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
transmission or sonar would know about

222
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:12,189
sound there's I'm sure a lot more to

223
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:14,800
know but for our purposes what we need

224
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,530
to know is that we would like to

225
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,719
reproduce this phenomenon of vibrations

226
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,089
being created in the world traveling

227
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,340
through some set of molecules like the

228
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,580
air or anything else and then hitting

229
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,940
your ear and inside your ear there are

230
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,900
these little hairs right so this is

231
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,780
inside your ear

232
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:37,389
here's your ear that's a weird looking

233
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,970
here inside your ear there are these

234
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:42,549
little hairs and what happens is these

235
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,220
hairs when the vibration four things in

236
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:46,659
the world enter your ear it goes through

237
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,370
a bunch of random stuff like you know

238
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,899
your eardrum and so on to try and like

239
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,519
do filtering on stuff like this but then

240
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:57,129
what happens is these these these hairs

241
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,779
they move with the vibrations that are

242
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:02,500
incoming right they vibrate and are

243
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:05,110
pushed by the sound which is the

244
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,590
vibration that hits like the eardrum of

245
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,779
your ear and and creates like you know

246
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:13,060
for lack of better term a secondary sort

247
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,669
of vibration a filtered vibration that

248
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:22,209
travels into that inner ear area right

249
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:23,979
and based on how these these sort of

250
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,470
hairs in your in your ear vibrate back

251
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,769
and forth they generate signals to your

252
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:34,810
brain which tell you what frequency of

253
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:36,399
vibration is happening right and so much

254
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:38,259
like sort of the rods and cones and your

255
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,929
eye are trying to tell you if photons

256
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:43,960
are hitting them these sort of hairs are

257
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:47,969
trying to tell you something about how

258
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,530
fast and how much both both speed and

259
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:54,279
sort of how much how forceful the

260
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:55,659
vibration was right and so because

261
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,279
that's the way you perceive it right

262
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:59,409
because these what these things

263
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,860
basically convey to your brain is how

264
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:05,649
fast the vibration was oscillating and

265
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,810
how hard like how much amplitude how

266
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,750
much force it had

267
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:13,599
that tends to end up being the way that

268
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,460
we need to reproduce sound right we need

269
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,850
to think of sound in terms of

270
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:22,320
frequencies which is basically again

271
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,300
that sort of that that that sort of

272
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,920
speed of the vibration it to go back to

273
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:28,838
the analogy of the of the puddle in the

274
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,419
water right if you imagine this water

275
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,750
from the side on view when you drop that

276
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,729
stone in the water right what happens is

277
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,129
you're going to get something like this

278
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:41,680
pattern coming out right it's going to

279
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:43,809
be this ripple and when we say frequency

280
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:48,399
what we mean is you can sort of look at

281
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:52,088
these troughs and these Peaks right like

282
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:55,299
so and we can talk about measuring right

283
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,529
like the wavelength of them right we can

284
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,299
talk about measuring that and saying

285
00:11:56,528 --> 00:12:01,539
that that's the frequency right that's

286
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:03,219
how fast this vibration is happening

287
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:06,039
because any given point here right is

288
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,170
going up and down in these peaks and

289
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,049
troughs as the ripple travels through it

290
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:13,779
and that speed again is the frequency of

291
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:15,669
of that that vibration that sound that

292
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,809
we're talking about right so we're

293
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:19,179
talking about your your brain

294
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,349
understanding the frequencies and the

295
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:22,809
way that your brain understands

296
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,450
frequencies is the faster the vibration

297
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:27,069
the higher the pitch of the sound is so

298
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:31,600
something that is vibrating very slowly

299
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:33,879
right will be sort of a low a very low

300
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,360
deep sound and something that's

301
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:39,789
vibrating very quickly will have sort of

302
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,610
a high-pitched a very like shrill

303
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:45,029
high-pitched sound right and then

304
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,100
everywhere in between produces the other

305
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:50,980
the other sort of the range of your

306
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,350
hearing now obviously you know your ear

307
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,509
can only hear certain frequencies so at

308
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,870
some point some some vibration gets low

309
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:02,799
enough that no matter how loud it is you

310
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:04,629
will no longer hear it and in fact you

311
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,969
can still perceive that sound to some

312
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:08,679
degree because you will feel it you will

313
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,959
start to actually feel your body

314
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,819
vibrating that's when you have those

315
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,409
really like ultra bass woofer things

316
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,050
that are trying to like vibrate you

317
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:18,669
right so your body can still perceive

318
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:21,879
those low frequencies it just maybe

319
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:24,219
can't really hear some of them so

320
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,470
and so there's sort of like a low rain

321
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,050
just like infrared was below the

322
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,600
frequency of light you could you could

323
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:34,740
perceive there is the concept of falling

324
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:40,440
out there and similarly somewhere around

325
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:43,210
222 thousand Hertz 22 kilohertz

326
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,580
somewhere around there your ear stops

327
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,170
being able to hear high frequencies

328
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,379
they'll go from being like a very like

329
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:52,409
hard to hear like you know hot super

330
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,820
high-pitched sound to being just nothing

331
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:58,929
and there's your body as far as I know

332
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,379
can't really perceive those much you you

333
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:01,149
can't

334
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,580
super tell that those are happening but

335
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:05,769
your dog can because your dog has much

336
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,870
better hearing than you do and they

337
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:13,360
that's why they hate things like a dog

338
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:16,539
whistle that you can't hear so yeah so

339
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,180
again that frequency is is is about the

340
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:21,099
pitch so frequency tells you what the

341
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,259
pitch of a sound is basically that's how

342
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,519
your brain perceives it and again that

343
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:29,139
goes up to something like 22 kilohertz

344
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,730
or roughly there abouts I don't really

345
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,750
remember exactly where it where it is it

346
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,639
and it's different for everybody

347
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,009
different people have you know hearing

348
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,809
that goes up to different levels but

349
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:40,509
again if you're not familiar with with

350
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:43,059
hurts or kilohertz right those are just

351
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:45,970
Hertz is we've used it before it's just

352
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:50,079
basically like something per second

353
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:52,090
right so if you say something is 22

354
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,830
kilohertz what you're saying is again

355
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,540
Killough is a thousand you're saying

356
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,790
that there's 22,000 of them happening

357
00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:00,809
every second right and so a sound that a

358
00:14:57,789 --> 00:15:03,219
frequent that had a frequency of 22,000

359
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,679
Hertz would be something that's going

360
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,259
you know it's oscillating 22,000 times

361
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,088
per second so again that's also why you

362
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,250
see these sampling rates being so high

363
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,170
you know if you think about the rate at

364
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,929
which we output things we output one

365
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:19,179
frame of video right let's take

366
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:21,279
something like valves advanced VR stuff

367
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,599
right which is designed to completely

368
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,159
fool you into thinking you're in a

369
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,100
virtual space so you can't tell it all

370
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,259
right that's happening at 90 Hertz they

371
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,759
refresh the most of the time right at

372
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:32,319
least if I I think that's right sorry

373
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,809
valve guys if I'm getting that wrong but

374
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,690
I believe 90 Hertz

375
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:39,589
is is what they target right that's 90

376
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:43,950
times a second okay

377
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:48,350
the most basic of modern audio output

378
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:50,820
these days happens at 48,000 Hertz right

379
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,600
sometimes 40 for one because that was an

380
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,028
old CD specification so we're talking

381
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,670
about a frequency difference for your

382
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:03,330
visual system it's perception versus

383
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:06,778
your or your auditory systems perception

384
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,160
is just they're nowhere close the speed

385
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:10,769
with which you can integrate visual

386
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:14,519
information is drastically drastically

387
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:17,730
slower than than the speed at which you

388
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,009
integrate audio information and it makes

389
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,509
some sense because audio you know if you

390
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:24,838
think about humans and how they perceive

391
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:26,759
audio it's a very weak perception we

392
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,670
have very limited information that we

393
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:32,009
gain about audio we don't have a huge

394
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:34,559
range compared to other animals we

395
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:36,720
aren't able to really make a lot of

396
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,709
sense of things that we hear right a lot

397
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,389
of times it's just kind of you know

398
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:45,720
nonspecific what we're hearing it's not

399
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:48,509
pinpoint we can't say oh that specific

400
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,500
sound I heard if you blindfolded me I

401
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,419
could go

402
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,399
you know pinpoint just play one sound

403
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:54,509
once I could go walk over to exactly

404
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,220
where it was and tell you where it is

405
00:16:54,509 --> 00:17:00,689
it's like that's not you know happening

406
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:03,089
and so on right so in general you know

407
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,160
you're talking about something that the

408
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,130
human brain doesn't really process all

409
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,860
that all that hard it's a very weak

410
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,020
process compared to this and so I guess

411
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,338
you know and I shouldn't even say this

412
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,869
cuz I don't know right I don't know

413
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:17,938
brain science maybe this has nothing to

414
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,039
do with it I'm just saying in my mind I

415
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,839
can rationalize it by saying you're

416
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,740
doing a ton of work here right and it's

417
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:27,419
two-dimensional - right our input for

418
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,920
video there is two-dimensional so we're

419
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,110
processing a huge array of things

420
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,610
whereas with sound it's just processing

421
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:34,619
one dimensionally right we don't again

422
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:36,419
know that directionality we don't know

423
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:38,369
any of that stuff and your brain

424
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,140
basically back figures out any of that

425
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:41,428
that you think you know right like so in

426
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,500
terms of figure out where something is

427
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:45,030
we're not like a bat where we have sonar

428
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,769
and can you know do this really great

429
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:49,079
reception of things we don't have that

430
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:50,819
right so I think that makes some sense

431
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,710
but either way you can ignore that part

432
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:56,009
that's just me being random and spouting

433
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,179
the point is simply that the frequencies

434
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,470
that we're talking about here it's

435
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,840
important to understand they're much

436
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,420
much higher and that's why when we talk

437
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,699
about how many things were going to

438
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,610
output a second for sound we often talk

439
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,700
about outputting 800 samples of sound

440
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:13,469
for every one sample of video right I

441
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,110
think that's what we're doing right now

442
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,670
and so at 30 Hertz which was our target

443
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:20,579
frame rate right we were doing something

444
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,529
like 800 samples for only one sample of

445
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:25,349
video and so we're just talking 800

446
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:27,899
times as many discrete things per second

447
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:30,449
that we're talking about right one thing

448
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,120
you could say is thank God

449
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,650
humans aren't like bats and we don't

450
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,609
have to output that because if we had

451
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,929
output a video like the amount of data

452
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:43,229
we have to process our video if we had

453
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,940
to do that 48 thousand Hertz oh man

454
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,558
that would be a lot of computing power

455
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,179
and I don't think we would be able to do

456
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,339
it I mean we've never had anything like

457
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:53,940
a GPU that can render basically anything

458
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:55,649
at 48 thousand frames a second right

459
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,370
like that's just not even in the realm

460
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,370
of possibility

461
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:05,669
so okay so we have frequency and that's

462
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:09,960
pitch and then we also have what's

463
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:12,390
called amplitude and that is where we

464
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,558
perceive volume so amplitude if we go

465
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,020
back down here where we have the

466
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,349
wavelength right the amplitude of

467
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:21,480
something is how high these peaks and

468
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:23,699
troughs or how high the Pink's get and

469
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,069
how low the troughs get right so if you

470
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,350
imagine dropping a really big rock in

471
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:31,139
this lake and generating a much bigger

472
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:33,089
ripple through it right now that was

473
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,780
really bad let's try to draw that a

474
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,129
little bit better not that much better

475
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:40,019
we would say that this has more

476
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:44,300
amplitude than this right it is a more

477
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:47,329
powerful ripple okay and so amplitude is

478
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:49,349
where we get our volume from so

479
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:51,689
frequency gives us the pitch of the

480
00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:53,609
sound amplitude of the vibration gives

481
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,910
us the volume of the sound and together

482
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,709
that pretty much gives us the entire

483
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,940
characteristics of the sounds that we

484
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,500
hear now I know that sounds

485
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,480
a little bit odd because you can hear so

486
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,429
many different sounds but it is actually

487
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:12,750
true and we'll go over a little bit how

488
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:14,730
that works right now so these are the

489
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,730
things that we want to reproduce in the

490
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:22,519
world how do we do that well what we do

491
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:24,960
right is we have a little speaker okay

492
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,940
and what this speaker is designed to do

493
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,579
is just to reproduce those vibrations

494
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,798
right so we send a little electrical

495
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:34,319
signal to their speaker and the cone

496
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,480
inside the speaker vibrates back and

497
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,119
forth and it vibrates back and forth

498
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,000
based on the signal that we send it it

499
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,250
vibrates further back and forth if we

500
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,159
send it a greater amplitude signal and

501
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:51,450
it vibrates faster back and forth if we

502
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:54,990
send it a higher frequency signal and if

503
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,399
we continuously vary the frequency and

504
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,409
amplitude that we're sending it over

505
00:20:56,398 --> 00:21:00,808
time we can reproduce basically any

506
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:03,899
vibration that could be captured at a

507
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:07,038
point right and so we're just

508
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:10,768
reproducing a point of

509
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:13,378
sound there now that is why you'll often

510
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:16,230
get multi speaker systems because the

511
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:18,439
human ear we do have two of them and by

512
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,788
using those two inputs and some

513
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,889
assumptions about how sound travels

514
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:26,250
through your skull and all these other

515
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:28,048
sorts of things and a bunch of different

516
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,048
fuzzy heuristics that your brain does

517
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:33,388
your brain can roughly determine sort of

518
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:35,158
where a sound is coming from in a gross

519
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:37,439
sense right we all know that if

520
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,299
something happens on the left side of

521
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,528
our head we kind of can tell the

522
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,788
difference between that then something

523
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:43,558
happens on the right side of our head

524
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:45,628
right and the way that that sounds

525
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,428
because the two ears are picking up the

526
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:49,230
signal differently and our brain is

527
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,129
reconciling those two going oh it must

528
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,990
have been something that was a little

529
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:54,119
more over here now when it's a question

530
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,980
of being in front of or behind us it's

531
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,298
really difficult for us to tell and we

532
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,159
have to rely on things like the

533
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,109
characteristic of the sound do we feel

534
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,278
like it's more muffled or louder because

535
00:22:01,109 --> 00:22:04,378
our ears are shaped a little differently

536
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:05,460
right so there's all this fuzzy matches

537
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:08,519
going on there again because we don't

538
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,110
have the kind of input that we do for

539
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:11,910
our visual system right we have a much

540
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:13,558
more simpler system

541
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,720
for for caption and sound just much less

542
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,918
data for the brain to go on so even

543
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,150
though it's doing a reasonable job

544
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,580
there's just not that much information

545
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,929
so that's why you summons that multiple

546
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:24,359
speaker system so sometimes we have

547
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:26,340
additional ones here and we think about

548
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,379
the location of where they are and how

549
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,720
we want to perhaps reproduce those

550
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,179
vibrations so that the the human brain

551
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,829
will perceive the sound to be coming

552
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,360
from different places right and so one

553
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:38,548
thing we might typically do is say well

554
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:40,139
if I wanted you know if I have two

555
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:42,119
speakers and we were looking at them

556
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,070
dead-on and I wanted to position the

557
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:47,609
sound here then maybe what I'm going to

558
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:49,168
do is play like 70 percent volume of the

559
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:50,428
sound of this speaker you know and

560
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,650
thirty percent of the sound and this

561
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:53,940
speaker so it sort of sounds like maybe

562
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,159
it was coming roughly from over here

563
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,419
it's not perfect right it doesn't really

564
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,110
sound like it's coming from here but

565
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:03,210
it's an approximation okay and then what

566
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:04,949
some sound systems try to do and this is

567
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,110
especially true if you go ahead and and

568
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,120
you have earphones on so that you know

569
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:10,319
that there's no interference in that in

570
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,579
the way right because as soon as you

571
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,519
introduce these speakers right like I

572
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:16,649
said it's a volumetric thing so now

573
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,480
you're not just reproducing sound at a

574
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,890
point and having it travel directly to

575
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,880
the ear and working that sound you're

576
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:25,049
reducing at a point there right is now

577
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,820
going to like vibrate through the whole

578
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:28,558
space and off the monitor and through

579
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:29,759
the air and curving and all these other

580
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:31,408
sorts of things that's doing it's just

581
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,450
creating all of these residual

582
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,919
vibrations so it's not pure if you put

583
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,960
headphones in like the kind that I'm

584
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,830
wearing right now that's a much more

585
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,569
pure transmission into your ear and so

586
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:44,720
when you do it like that you have a lot

587
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:46,859
more flexibility to try and recreate

588
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,970
sounds that try to fool your brain into

589
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:51,298
thinking it's coming from a particular

590
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:53,700
place right and so what they will do in

591
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:55,859
systems where you hear like 3d audio or

592
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,600
things like this to varying levels of

593
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:02,369
success depending on the circumstances

594
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:04,798
what they will try to do is something

595
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:08,158
like this here is you know your your

596
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,808
skull right and you know your ears are

597
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,780
here and you know the sound is coming in

598
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:16,168
here right well what they will try to do

599
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:20,308
is say okay let's measure for a typical

600
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:22,650
human head let's measure what the actual

601
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:26,099
vibration is that's produced inside the

602
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,970
eardrum right what would that be

603
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:32,159
for reference signals produced at

604
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:34,250
various places around the head in three

605
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,860
dimensions in the full sphere right

606
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:40,049
because as those you know sounds hit

607
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,689
your head and vibrate parts of your head

608
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:45,299
hit your ear bounce around inside the

609
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,680
ear canal there is obviously all kinds

610
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,419
of effects that are happening to them

611
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,820
that make them more muffled more shrill

612
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,009
more this more that right there changing

613
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:55,019
the nature of the sound and your brain

614
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:57,900
from birth has been trained to recognize

615
00:24:55,019 --> 00:25:00,809
these changes to help try to approximate

616
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,310
the location of sound specifically

617
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:03,869
because of the shortcomings that I

618
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:05,849
discussed before where we just we just

619
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,169
don't have that good of an audio system

620
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:08,909
right that just wasn't what we're set up

621
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,830
to do but your brain is trying to

622
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,140
compensate for that so it tries to make

623
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:15,299
a guess about where a sound is coming

624
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,220
from based on these other cues now when

625
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,289
we reproduced as a computer if we don't

626
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,900
reproduce those cues your brain will not

627
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:23,879
be able to guess and it will not really

628
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,240
sound like the sound is traveling around

629
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,500
you or behind you or whatever right and

630
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,170
so what they do is they take all these

631
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,579
references they record the results and

632
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:36,630
then they try to come up with basically

633
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:40,349
mathematical transforms for input sounds

634
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:43,890
that will apply the same basic changes

635
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:45,539
to the sound wave for new sounds so that

636
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,340
when you play back a sound you can say I

637
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:50,490
want it to sound as if it's coming from

638
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:51,959
this angle to the head and the system

639
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,630
will go okay that means you need to

640
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,569
process the sound in this way right and

641
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,430
so again not a particularly important

642
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:02,009
thing a lot of people can't really

643
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,570
perceive this that well but when you

644
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,519
start to talk about things like VR

645
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:07,409
experiences where you're starting to put

646
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,509
the player in a real space where all of

647
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,980
their senses can work together these

648
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,019
sorts of those sorts of things can start

649
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,849
to become more important because now if

650
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:18,150
you if you get the sound right that's

651
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:19,829
yet another barrier that goes away to

652
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,450
your brain believing that you're in a

653
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:23,699
real space when it can actually hear a

654
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,069
sound and hear it change in the way it's

655
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,870
expecting it to change based on its

656
00:26:26,069 --> 00:26:30,599
experiences in the real world that's

657
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:31,619
very important again to removing some of

658
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:32,669
those barriers but when you're just

659
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,129
talking about playing a game on a

660
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,779
monitor a 2-d game on a monitor this

661
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,340
stuff is not at all necessary because

662
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:39,629
you're not trying to fool the

663
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,819
brain into thinking anything in

664
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,500
particular your brain is just trying to

665
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:45,389
have an entertaining experience with

666
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,278
some stuff that's being presented and so

667
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,890
the important stuff for like a game like

668
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,269
ours on handmade hero is really just

669
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,940
making sure that the sound sounds good

670
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:55,980
and pleasing and it does pleasing things

671
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,330
with respect to what's happening on the

672
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,640
screen so this is not really that

673
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:01,019
necessary in a game like ours but again

674
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,028
different circumstances different

675
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,798
techniques if you were making a VR game

676
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:07,409
this might be somewhere that you really

677
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:10,710
want to spend some serious time because

678
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:11,850
it can have a potentially big payoffs if

679
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,470
it's done correctly and I don't think

680
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:15,449
we've necessarily even seen some of the

681
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,798
high points of that I think once maybe

682
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,419
the valve stuff is out and people are

683
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,278
playing with it more I think you'll see

684
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:22,860
people start to spend a lot more time on

685
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,659
audio and at that point you'll probably

686
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:27,359
see them make some really interesting

687
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:30,528
pushes there that go beyond what we're

688
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,528
traditionally used to seeing in games

689
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,778
okay

690
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,869
so we got about 20 minutes left let's

691
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:42,690
talk now now that we kind of understand

692
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:45,750
sound from first principles here if the

693
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,220
basics of sounds let's talk about how we

694
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,429
actually do this process from the

695
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,319
software side so we have these speakers

696
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:54,509
maybe we have two sets of headphones out

697
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,700
speakers little baby speakers or maybe

698
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:58,890
we have like a 5.1 surround system so we

699
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,600
have five speaker output channels and

700
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,759
also a base vibration channel or

701
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,189
something to play with but point being

702
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:08,579
it all comes down to the concept that we

703
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,100
have a number of channels right we need

704
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:14,009
to output a number of channels and those

705
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,949
channels are ways of us telling the

706
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:20,720
speaker's what vibrations to reproduce

707
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:23,278
and how do we tell them what kind of

708
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,750
vibrations to reproduce the way that we

709
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,169
tell them what kind of vibrations to

710
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,750
reproduce is by encoding a waveform we

711
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,610
basically take whatever that sample rate

712
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,308
is that samples per second that we want

713
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:37,199
right the 48 thousand Hertz for example

714
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:38,460
in my previous statement which I believe

715
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,210
is what our game is running at right now

716
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,620
in terms of sound and we basically take

717
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,829
snapshots if you will if you can imagine

718
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:51,029
taking snapshots 48,000 of them every

719
00:28:46,829 --> 00:28:52,379
second of where our what of if you

720
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,809
imagine that speed

721
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,880
how we want the speaker cone to be

722
00:28:54,809 --> 00:29:00,569
vibrating right so if you imagine the

723
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,540
speaker news neutral position right and

724
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:06,539
you imagine like how we want it to

725
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:08,460
vibrate right what you would want to do

726
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,099
is you'd want to take at each position

727
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,710
you'd want to take where it crosses at

728
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:16,859
that at that instant in time where we

729
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:19,680
would want the vibration to be right and

730
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:21,179
then that becomes the individual numbers

731
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,070
right we're going to encode these we're

732
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,900
cutting them a 16-bit signed so it's

733
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:30,389
gonna be some number between like you

734
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:33,259
know plus 32 K and minus 32 K right you

735
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:39,800
know what I'm saying that makes sense a

736
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:42,900
16-bit number then encodes this site

737
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:44,399
that is what we were trying to output to

738
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,900
the speaker and we want to do that once

739
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,700
for every channel in our game right now

740
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,160
is stereo so we're assuming that we have

741
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,440
two speakers to play with and so we

742
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,150
would produce two separate waveforms one

743
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,320
for each speaker and we would play that

744
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,810
out through the speaker and that would

745
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,549
reproduce our soundscape now what's

746
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:00,899
interesting about this right and what's

747
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,180
very important to understand in fact

748
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,700
this was something that someone found

749
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,019
very surprising to them because I guess

750
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,400
they'd never worked on sound or anything

751
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:09,420
like that so this was totally new to

752
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,940
them

753
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,620
way back when someone would when I said

754
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,140
it's really easy for us to do a mixer

755
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:17,819
and I think I was on the chat just some

756
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,440
after the episode was over I said oh

757
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:22,259
it's trivial you just add the sounds

758
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,759
together this was these things were

759
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:25,170
totally news to them so I'm gonna go

760
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,700
through it kind of slowly just so every

761
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,870
so I know a lot of people probably

762
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,920
already know this stuff but just to make

763
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,869
sure that everyone I mean this is

764
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,220
educational stream just make sure that

765
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:34,769
everyone understand what's going on I'm

766
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,720
just gonna unpack this a little bit so

767
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:39,359
if you think about what that means it

768
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,380
means that if the entirety of how we

769
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:46,139
output sound boils down to one stream of

770
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:50,040
numbers per speaker and that stream of

771
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,170
numbers is just 48,000 per second things

772
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,889
that tell it how to vibrate right just

773
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:57,960
where it should be in its motion and to

774
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,100
be clear like you know speakers do the

775
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,019
sound output system does a lot of stuff

776
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,459
so this is a simplified explanation I

777
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:05,379
don't pretend to be a hardware engineer

778
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,788
so it's not it's not like we're really

779
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,350
telling the speaker be exactly this

780
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:10,089
position I don't like that it's that's

781
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:11,859
not quite it but we're we're basically

782
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:13,928
encoding the vibration that we want it

783
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:15,519
to do and it's in charge of figuring out

784
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,288
the right way to make that actually

785
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,429
happen well in practice right so there's

786
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:20,919
a whole bunch other stuff there but

787
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:22,690
ignoring that section what we're trying

788
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,490
to do is we're trying to tell it what

789
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,169
that vibration should look like but

790
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,538
since there's only one vibration going

791
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:31,480
out to each speaker what that means is

792
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:34,179
no matter how many sounds we are playing

793
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,038
right we could be playing a thousand

794
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:37,840
sounds around in our world that are

795
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:40,150
happening just everything you know

796
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,908
lightning crashing in the wind blowing

797
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,190
and you frogs chirping and the angels

798
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:48,460
singing and machine guns firing and God

799
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,570
knows what's happening in this game all

800
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,640
of those things much like all of the

801
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:57,939
visual things baked down into a single

802
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,049
plate of red green and blue colors all

803
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:05,769
of the sounds boil down into one simple

804
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:10,179
set of vibration encodings per speaker

805
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:18,308
right so how does that work right how do

806
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:21,788
we how do we make that work well if you

807
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:24,668
think about what happens if I was at a

808
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:27,669
location a single point in space right

809
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:30,850
and what I wanted to do at that single

810
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:33,220
point in space is produce a given sound

811
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:37,000
right whatever it is and I start

812
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,079
vibrating back and forth right doing you

813
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,190
know just going back and forth back and

814
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,798
forth back and forth back and forth

815
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,240
right and that back and forth motion of

816
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:46,119
that vibration is starting to create

817
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:51,099
those ripples that go out right if I

818
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:55,119
were to want to produce a second sound

819
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:59,619
from that same location there's no way

820
00:32:55,119 --> 00:33:01,719
if you think about it to carry more in

821
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:03,788
you can't carry twice the amount of

822
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,009
vibration information right we have

823
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:07,538
molecules and these molecules are going

824
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:09,429
to hit each other and they're going to

825
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:12,940
vibrate back and forth right that's

826
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:14,350
what's going to happen they're going to

827
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,090
vibrate back and forth at a particular

828
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:17,230
frequency they're going to vibrate back

829
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:19,289
and forth with a certain amount of force

830
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:24,130
right continually varying over

831
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:27,369
we can't send two separate distinct

832
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,740
ripples from one point there's only

833
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:31,329
going to be one set of characteristic

834
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,900
ripples going out so when I look at this

835
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:37,779
from the side right here's my point

836
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:40,390
right if I'm sending this out right and

837
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:45,549
then I also want to send this out

838
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:49,090
there's no way to send them both so what

839
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:51,789
actually happens is if I want to do them

840
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:54,009
if I want to play both of those sounds

841
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:57,308
in the same location is I have to have a

842
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:59,740
ripple that combines the two right it we

843
00:33:57,308 --> 00:34:02,529
have to take this ripple and on top of

844
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:06,789
wherever that ripple is vibrate the

845
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:09,250
other vibration onto it right so this

846
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,809
point as it moves back and forth to

847
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,429
create that vibration you know the

848
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:15,009
speaker is kind of coming back and forth

849
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:17,440
as we move it out we actually do like

850
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:21,610
micro wobbles to get that second sound

851
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,710
in there right so all we have to do when

852
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:26,019
we want to combine sounds to output them

853
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,389
to our speaker is we just have to add

854
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:30,250
the vibrations together if I know I want

855
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:33,519
this vibration in this vibration I just

856
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,500
add them sample by sample to produce the

857
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,360
to vibrations happening together and

858
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,969
that produces a sound that your brain

859
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,860
will then proceed as though to those two

860
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:45,519
vibrations having happened at the same

861
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:47,440
time together which sometimes will sound

862
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,909
like two separate sounds if it's the

863
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,510
kind of thing that your brain can parse

864
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,730
out cleanly

865
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,129
and sometimes it will sound like some

866
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,750
kind of weird combination distortion of

867
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:57,400
the two sounds but that's what will also

868
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,530
actually happen in the real world if

869
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,750
somehow those sounds were being produced

870
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,480
extremely close together like that right

871
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:07,179
real sounds in the real world produced

872
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,280
very close together actually do have all

873
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:12,099
kinds of construction constructive and

874
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,650
destructive interference in fact this is

875
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,809
how noise cancellation works it tries to

876
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:20,470
create sound waves near other sound

877
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:24,219
waves that will cancel them out right so

878
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:26,500
that leads us to a very simple situation

879
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:30,129
when we talk about creating an audio

880
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,170
mixer if we imagine creating a bunch of

881
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,829
sounds like we have done and like we

882
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,749
will do what

883
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:37,180
we get real sound design for this game

884
00:35:34,748 --> 00:35:38,828
if we have a bunch of sounds that are

885
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:40,690
encoded as vibrational patterns

886
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:42,249
presumably that we're like started from

887
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,380
a microphone that was actually measuring

888
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:45,939
vibrations right so we saw what the

889
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,410
vibrations were for real sound and then

890
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,298
maybe a sound designer tweaked it a

891
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:50,139
little edited it whatever cleaned it up

892
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:53,708
right

893
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:56,199
that's our sound if we have that set of

894
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:57,669
vibrations and we now know we can just

895
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,018
play that out the speaker right we've

896
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,298
even done this on handmade here at a

897
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:04,208
hero already we've played sound out the

898
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:06,190
speaker's right if we want to create a

899
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:09,098
mix or something that allows us to play

900
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:12,099
an arbitrary number of sounds out of the

901
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:16,450
same speaker all we need to do is

902
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:19,209
instead of copying sound into the sound

903
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:24,879
output buffer all we have to do is add

904
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:28,929
it that's it so a mixer is really just

905
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,509
an adder that's all it is if I have n

906
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:34,239
sounds right if I have here's one sound

907
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:37,690
you know here's another sound whatever

908
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:40,749
here's a third sound the only thing I

909
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:43,358
need to do to produce the final mix for

910
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:46,118
my game is I just need to add them

911
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,949
together and if I add sample by sample

912
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,349
each sound together I will get a

913
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:52,479
resulting sound sample that sounds like

914
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:54,719
all of the sounds were combined that's

915
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:54,718
all

916
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:03,670
make sense

917
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:06,099
hopefully that makes some sense so that

918
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,659
is what we need to write and hopefully

919
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,880
if you followed hand-made here from the

920
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,440
beginning by this point that is not

921
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,959
something that just scare you at all

922
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,929
that is much simpler that our renderer

923
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:19,328
was to do right there's a lot less

924
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:20,858
moving pieces to it probably and so I

925
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:22,119
feel like most people who've watched am

926
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:23,940
a hero should probably be able to figure

927
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,630
out how to do that almost on their own

928
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:31,599
if you've been following so far but

929
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:34,108
there are caveats there are a few things

930
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,729
that do increase the complexity and

931
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:38,558
let's briefly talk about what those are

932
00:37:36,728 --> 00:37:41,409
now when I say they increase the

933
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:44,829
complexity I mean what I should probably

934
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:45,998
say is they optionally increase the

935
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,390
complexity because as you'll see it's

936
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:48,969
like a

937
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:50,618
for them you could choose just not to

938
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:53,500
deal with them and you're actually still

939
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:56,410
probably going to be okay so let's talk

940
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,429
about them in order let's talk about

941
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:06,088
clipping and let's talk about

942
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:08,528
interpolation so that we can kind of

943
00:38:06,088 --> 00:38:12,038
kind of have our bases covered if you

944
00:38:08,528 --> 00:38:13,539
will so what happens when we talk about

945
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,869
these sounds and adding these sounds

946
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:20,500
together right well I said that we have

947
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:22,240
a 16-bit sound sample right and I said

948
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,039
it went from like negative 32 K to

949
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,048
positive 3 to K or whatever right I was

950
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:29,559
like you know we've got a range of sound

951
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:31,750
right and so when we're encoding those

952
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,298
samples what that means is that the

953
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:36,400
loudest sound would be something that

954
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:38,318
was like an oscillation right so you

955
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,710
know whatever the pitch is I don't care

956
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:43,869
what the pitch is the pitch is something

957
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:46,088
the loudest sounds are one that go all

958
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:47,528
the way up to the plus 32 K line and

959
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:49,838
then all the way down to the negative 3

960
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:51,099
to K line right so the oscillation

961
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,920
whatever the oscillation is is that

962
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:56,980
pitch right but how far up and down they

963
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,250
go that is what determines the the

964
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:02,679
volume right so the loudest sounds would

965
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,150
be going you know plus Sturridge K my

966
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:08,048
history to K and oscillating between

967
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,910
that but what does that mean right what

968
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:11,710
does that mean in the real world it

969
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:12,308
doesn't mean anything right it means

970
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,730
nothing

971
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:18,069
it means whatever the loudest sound your

972
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,949
speaker can produce at the volume knob

973
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:23,108
setting you turned it to right it has no

974
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:26,259
meaning whatsoever the game doesn't even

975
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:28,598
know right it's not like we have some

976
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:30,789
kind of understanding of a calibrated

977
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,640
sound level so we don't know what that

978
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:35,319
means we just know it's the loudest we

979
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:39,058
know we can't produce a sound that's any

980
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:45,099
louder than that sound right

981
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:48,009
using this encoding but what that means

982
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:49,900
is if the way that we add sounds

983
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:53,079
together or rather mixes together is by

984
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:56,048
adding them even if all of our sounds

985
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,250
fell within this encoding range because

986
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:59,159
again we don't even know what it means

987
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,139
so we're just gonna probably encode

988
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:02,549
to keep maximum precision we're probably

989
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:04,289
just going to code all of our sounds so

990
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:07,350
that their highest peaks are at plus 32

991
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:08,849
K minus 32 K right we're just gonna

992
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:10,860
encode them that way because we want to

993
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:12,599
use all 16 bits for the sound and then

994
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,130
we'll just you know if we want them to

995
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,480
be softer when you played them we could

996
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,300
just attenuate that and we'll talk about

997
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,190
that in a couple seconds here right but

998
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,930
if we then take a bunch of those things

999
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,300
and add them together well what happens

1000
00:40:21,929 --> 00:40:26,069
if one of the peaks of one sound

1001
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,140
coincides with the peak of another sound

1002
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,380
like what if this and this coincide

1003
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:33,379
right it would produce a resulting peak

1004
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,579
that goes straight off of the top and

1005
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,900
cannot actually be produced by the

1006
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:41,670
speaker that is what is called clipping

1007
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,039
right and you can hear it it kind of

1008
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:46,050
like makes that kind of thing where you

1009
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:48,659
get like a your sound card starts to

1010
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,130
distort right and anyone who's ever

1011
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:52,079
played with an amplifier knows what

1012
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,610
clipping and amp sounds like anyone

1013
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,989
who's plays guitar or something

1014
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:57,900
sometimes you even want it to do this

1015
00:40:54,989 --> 00:41:00,149
right sometimes that's the sound you're

1016
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,099
going for is clipping right but that's

1017
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,510
what's happening is when you kind of get

1018
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,400
to this thing where the waveform just

1019
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,380
hits the top of the encoding range and

1020
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,240
then comes back down a little later you

1021
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:15,599
get these kind of these kind of patterns

1022
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:18,809
that produce distortion of the sound so

1023
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,380
clipping is something you can choose to

1024
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:24,900
address or not oftentimes you just don't

1025
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,070
have to you'd be very surprised but it

1026
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,139
turns out that adding is a bunch of

1027
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,269
sounds together tends to often not

1028
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,039
produce any objectionable clipping

1029
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:34,889
whatsoever I know it sounds strange

1030
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,630
you'll just have to believe me and in

1031
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:38,099
fact we maybe just won't do anything

1032
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,550
about it I am a hero and you'll see what

1033
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:41,190
I mean

1034
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:42,840
it's kind of surprising just how little

1035
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,840
clipping actually becomes a problem in

1036
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:49,320
practice for most situations but if you

1037
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,030
really want it you can do some things

1038
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,809
they're called

1039
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:56,640
compressors you can do some things to

1040
00:41:54,809 --> 00:42:01,579
your sound signals they're typically

1041
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:06,809
classified as soft knee or hard knee

1042
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:10,289
compressors and what those are is they

1043
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:12,809
are ways of mapping your sound range so

1044
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:17,150
that you never can actually

1045
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:19,440
get all the way into no-man's land right

1046
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,599
basically what you can do is you can say

1047
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,750
all right I'll first compute what the

1048
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,360
peaks would actually be and then I'll do

1049
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:29,280
some kind of a mapping probably one that

1050
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,750
looks like this right

1051
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:36,360
if you imagine here's my input and

1052
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:39,119
here's my output so that no matter what

1053
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:42,750
the sound is I'll never go above plus

1054
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,449
32k but no matter how you like no matter

1055
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,340
how loud I'm supposed to be I'll always

1056
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:49,799
level out at that 32k like some kind of

1057
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,320
logarithmic curve right so when I'm down

1058
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,240
in the reasonable range I'll still get

1059
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,590
you know pretty reasonable output but

1060
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:59,069
when I get up to the top I won't be

1061
00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:01,260
right so that's something you can do I'm

1062
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,340
not really an audio guy I don't do a lot

1063
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,650
of audio programming

1064
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,630
I don't feel super qualified to

1065
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:08,579
implement one of these someday I

1066
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,320
probably should just add OOP as a

1067
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,789
learning experience go study it see what

1068
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,900
the consequences are so we probably

1069
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,980
won't be doing one of these on the

1070
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,190
stream just because it's not my

1071
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,990
specialty but if this is the kind of

1072
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:21,750
thing that you really care about go read

1073
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:24,059
about compressors go read about dynamic

1074
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:25,889
gain which is kind of trying to look at

1075
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:28,049
the audio form over time and adjust an

1076
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:30,119
overall sort of level for your sound to

1077
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,410
make sure that you don't clip you can go

1078
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,389
read about those things and they may

1079
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:36,659
interest you they're not typically I

1080
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:38,250
think very hard to implement but you

1081
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:39,960
know again not my specialty so I don't

1082
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,610
really feel qualified saying do this

1083
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,840
don't do that or anything like this

1084
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:49,620
right so that's flipping we then have

1085
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:52,559
interpolation and interpolation I guess

1086
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,750
I should also say you know modulation

1087
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,809
and interpolation will talk about these

1088
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,340
together but basically what this is you

1089
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:00,779
know a straight ahead adder a

1090
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,960
straight-ahead mixer that just makes

1091
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:06,510
this sounds together is dumb simple

1092
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,920
right it's stupid simple just like you

1093
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,260
would expect you're literally just

1094
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,090
taking two buffers and you're adding

1095
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,190
their contents together and writing the

1096
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:15,809
result right that's it there's there's

1097
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,429
nothing else to it

1098
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:20,460
and so especially if you don't implement

1099
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:21,989
any fancy handling of that final output

1100
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,820
buffer to avoid the clipping or whatever

1101
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:25,319
you're talking about a routine that's as

1102
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,050
simple as it can be it's like one of

1103
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,420
those mmm

1104
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,890
ab PS functions like you know that does

1105
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,360
a for white ad we're just gonna be like

1106
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:41,019
spamming that outright that'd be all it

1107
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:43,210
would be right so that in and of itself

1108
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:45,009
would be a reasonable mixture but it

1109
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:47,110
would be fun somewhat limited because

1110
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:50,320
there's things we might want to do with

1111
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:52,630
our sounds in the game that even if

1112
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,789
we're not audiophile fancy audio guys

1113
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,380
who want to do a weird filtering and the

1114
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:58,779
sort of stuff right if we just want

1115
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,610
basic game designer control over the

1116
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:04,690
sound there are some things we probably

1117
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:06,370
want to do right first off we would

1118
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,530
probably want to adjust the volume of

1119
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:11,109
sound right we probably want to adjust

1120
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:14,260
the pan of the sound right like left and

1121
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:16,720
right channel right those are things

1122
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,060
that would be pretty pretty basic we

1123
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:22,949
might even want to vary the pitch of the

1124
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:25,150
sound right this one's a little bit more

1125
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:27,099
involved but let's talk about these two

1126
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,160
first and we can talk about modulation

1127
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:32,589
interpolation why put that there right

1128
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:35,519
so volume and pan these basically boiled

1129
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:38,920
down to the same thing essentially right

1130
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:41,590
because if I like I was saying up here

1131
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,289
before where was my little diagram here

1132
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:45,670
it is like I was saying before if I have

1133
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:47,170
two speakers and I want to output

1134
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,090
something that sounds like it's coming

1135
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,010
more from one than the other then I'm

1136
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,200
gonna sort of like play it louder and

1137
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,030
one speaker than the other so panning

1138
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,689
moving something back and forth between

1139
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:00,310
the speakers is actually just a volume

1140
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,400
modification to the sound when it is

1141
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:04,570
being mixed into into this channel the

1142
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,970
channel for outputting this speaker

1143
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,740
mixing it at a different volume than if

1144
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:11,589
like we're going to this speaker right

1145
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:13,149
so panning is just a volume change both

1146
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:15,760
panning and volume are the same thing

1147
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:17,680
right so let's talk about what is volume

1148
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,090
right well volume is actually just

1149
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:23,710
modulation volume is taking like

1150
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:26,110
remember I already said it's how high

1151
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:28,240
these Peaks are and the troughs right

1152
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:30,610
that's what determines how the sound is

1153
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:33,309
so all I need to do if I want to make a

1154
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:35,140
sound sound quieter I just have to

1155
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:37,449
multiply it right I just have to

1156
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:39,829
multiply it by some value between zero

1157
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:41,509
and one I came at it multiplied

1158
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:43,489
by more than one if I wanted to get

1159
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,260
louder than it started but if I want to

1160
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:47,119
take a sound in control its volume zero

1161
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,370
would be the quietest that sound could

1162
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,400
possibly be and one would be the sound

1163
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:54,859
as it was encoded and then anywhere in

1164
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,960
between would just create softer

1165
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:58,760
versions of these ripples right it's

1166
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,369
just softer version so we're just taking

1167
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:08,810
it again and like kind of scaling it

1168
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:10,969
down right like so okay and so that to

1169
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:13,759
control the volume all we have to do is

1170
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:15,619
multiply still stupid simple right we're

1171
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,930
talking about the mixing equation is

1172
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:21,440
like you know still so basic it's like

1173
00:47:17,929 --> 00:47:25,399
you know the output right equals you

1174
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:28,130
know the sum if you will over all of the

1175
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:32,780
inputs we're talking about just like the

1176
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:34,880
volume of the if' input times you know

1177
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,380
whatever the the eyuth input the sample

1178
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,550
value is at the I input right we're

1179
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,410
talking about literally something like

1180
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:42,920
this so you're talking about like a four

1181
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:45,139
I loop equals zero two samples right and

1182
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,760
inside the for loop you know you start

1183
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:48,619
out with you're out you know you're out

1184
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:50,540
is initialized to zero or something and

1185
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:53,299
then inside the for loop all you're

1186
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:56,869
doing is you're taking that out and

1187
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:59,600
you're adding to it the volume of the I

1188
00:47:56,869 --> 00:48:03,109
a sample times whatever the aya sample

1189
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:05,089
actually is for that thing right this is

1190
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:06,800
all we're doing and we're doing it for

1191
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:09,050
each sound so really there's another you

1192
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,240
could think of as another for each sound

1193
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:12,740
here right so for each sound we go

1194
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:14,479
through all the samples we add them

1195
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:15,709
together right alternately you could

1196
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,210
think of it the other way round you can

1197
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:20,210
think of putting the four sound and here

1198
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,460
either way doesn't matter right so

1199
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:24,320
that's all we're talking about still to

1200
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:28,099
get volume control in there and panning

1201
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:31,010
is just adding a multiplier that's it so

1202
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:32,869
that's very very simple stuff so why

1203
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,010
does this get complicated why did I list

1204
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:35,569
it as something that would be

1205
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:39,470
complicated when that's all that would

1206
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:42,559
take the reason is because you cannot

1207
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:46,449
change these parameters discontinuously

1208
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,449
that's the reason so

1209
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:53,250
if all I wanted to do was put a sound at

1210
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,670
a particular volume and pin and leave it

1211
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:57,329
there

1212
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:59,190
problem solved it's just this but I may

1213
00:48:57,329 --> 00:49:00,960
not want to do that what I may want to

1214
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,400
do is let's say I want to fade in a

1215
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,240
sound like maybe I have a music track

1216
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,039
right and the music track is playing but

1217
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,199
what I want to do is I want to fade it

1218
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:12,329
in so what I want to do is to have it

1219
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:15,839
start so that it starts kind of quiet

1220
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:19,230
right and then it sort of gets louder as

1221
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,579
it goes until it actually then reaches

1222
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,219
the actual sound right

1223
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:26,069
so that volume you know that volume is

1224
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:28,199
going to be at time equals zero or

1225
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:29,940
something right at T equals zero that

1226
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,809
volumes going to be zero but by the time

1227
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,780
it gets up to here

1228
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:36,380
I want that volume to be 1 right T

1229
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:40,620
equals something else I don't know what

1230
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:43,079
right so over time I want it to to

1231
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:46,230
change now if I'm going to do that what

1232
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:49,170
that means is that this value now has to

1233
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,969
be smoothly incremented over that time

1234
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,800
period right and that makes things a

1235
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:54,989
little harder again because if we are

1236
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,060
imagining processing these things wide

1237
00:49:54,989 --> 00:49:58,799
like four samples at this time we've got

1238
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:01,139
a little bit more thinking to do about

1239
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,269
exactly how all of this should play out

1240
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:04,739
right so we've got some more work to do

1241
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:07,679
if we want to do that smooth line and

1242
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:10,109
again smooth volume change smooth pan is

1243
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,389
also a smooth volume change right it's

1244
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,460
it's controlling the volume in one

1245
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:15,599
speaker or the other okay so there's a

1246
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,059
little more work to do there at start

1247
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,269
scalebar complicated pitch more

1248
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:23,639
complicated even still so there's two

1249
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:31,849
ways you can think about pitch changes

1250
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:31,849
right there's a length preserving

1251
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:41,550
and not not like the preserving right

1252
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:43,800
and so what you can think about these

1253
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:46,350
ARS let's say I have a sound right and

1254
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,570
you know the sound is is me saying like

1255
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:52,589
hello right so this is me saying hello

1256
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:55,470
okay as you know like I said the

1257
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:56,970
amplitude right this part that says how

1258
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,919
high up and down each of these Peaks are

1259
00:50:56,969 --> 00:51:02,699
right the vertical axis this is

1260
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,889
amplitude right this is time the

1261
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:07,710
frequency which is how fast we oscillate

1262
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:09,449
along the time axis that determines the

1263
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,690
pitch so if I want to make myself go

1264
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:14,909
like hello up really high one way I can

1265
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:18,269
do that is by just playing the sound

1266
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:20,219
faster right if this was going at 48,000

1267
00:51:18,269 --> 00:51:22,259
Hertz when it was sampled right what I

1268
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:26,189
could do is just play it back at like

1269
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:29,670
two times 48,000 and that will be a much

1270
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:32,909
higher pitch sound right the problem is

1271
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,590
it will also speed the sound up because

1272
00:51:32,909 --> 00:51:39,839
if I play it twice as fast it will

1273
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:43,410
laughs half as long so the cheap way to

1274
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:45,620
do that right is is to just speed it up

1275
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:47,909
or slow it down if you just want small

1276
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:50,250
variances in your sound pitches like

1277
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:53,009
just up you know like a half step on a

1278
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:55,650
piano keyboard for example this will

1279
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:58,020
totally be fine no problem no one would

1280
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:59,820
ever know the difference but if you want

1281
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:01,920
to do something crazy like take

1282
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,930
something that goes like hello and then

1283
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,309
something goes oh and make them both

1284
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:07,529
last the same amount of time but come

1285
00:52:05,309 --> 00:52:09,269
from the same source sample then you're

1286
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:11,550
looking at a length preserving pitch

1287
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:15,119
change length preserving pitch changes

1288
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:17,490
are very complicated so complicated in

1289
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,219
fact that up until recently nobody

1290
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:21,659
really even knew how to do them properly

1291
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:25,139
that I'd ever seen

1292
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:27,210
but in the last 10 years or so people

1293
00:52:25,139 --> 00:52:30,089
have finally shipped stuff where they

1294
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:32,909
really do totally nail it and you can do

1295
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:36,320
very large pitch changes that sound

1296
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:36,319
actually really quite good

1297
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:43,259
but for a long time basically anything

1298
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,969
that you bought that tried to do

1299
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,990
commercial software offline like we're

1300
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:48,118
not even talking about real time just

1301
00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:50,308
offline pitch changing sounded awful

1302
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,990
you got you had stuff like auto-tune

1303
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:55,980
sounding stuff I mean it wasn't that bad

1304
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:58,189
but it was pretty bad and so only

1305
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,000
recently have they really gotten down to

1306
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,599
to be able to do length preserving

1307
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,858
resize better so length preserving

1308
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:08,789
typically you would never see that in a

1309
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:11,159
game because the again cost benefit

1310
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:14,548
there it's just not there the chance is

1311
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:17,969
that a game needs to do that much pitch

1312
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:20,039
bending of something is extremely low

1313
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:21,989
and so typically when you're talking

1314
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,298
about that kind of thing it would

1315
00:53:21,989 --> 00:53:26,219
probably have to be in the context of a

1316
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:31,739
game that was doing something specific

1317
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:32,939
with audio that you know you wouldn't be

1318
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:34,229
talking about doing that in like a

1319
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,700
first-person shooter there'd be no

1320
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,469
reason you just record all the sounds

1321
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:40,798
that you need you don't pitch bend them

1322
00:53:37,469 --> 00:53:42,328
much at all you pitch shift them only

1323
00:53:40,798 --> 00:53:44,460
little bits to give your sound some

1324
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:47,160
variety but those are all ones that can

1325
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:52,798
happen with non length preserving pitch

1326
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:55,588
shifting right so so this if we want to

1327
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:58,019
do the simple kind right the non length

1328
00:53:55,588 --> 00:54:00,449
preserving kind it doesn't reduce yet

1329
00:53:58,019 --> 00:54:03,030
one more interesting aspect which is

1330
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:04,649
that if we want to shift it by an on

1331
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:05,640
multiple of two which we almost

1332
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:08,400
certainly do

1333
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:12,598
because remember pitch is like you'd

1334
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:15,900
imagine the difference say between a 400

1335
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:18,119
Hertz tone in a you know a 600 Hertz or

1336
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,980
an 800 Hertz tone let's say right I

1337
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:24,710
don't know can we get something that

1338
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,710
would make that can we do 800 Hertz tone

1339
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:33,480
so there's 800 Hertz if that's to be

1340
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:37,349
believed here's 400 Hertz do you hear

1341
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:39,780
how different those are right so chances

1342
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:42,000
are we don't want to shift things by 2x

1343
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,339
because that's gonna be a huge

1344
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,190
difference in pitch so chances are we're

1345
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:48,440
talking about things like 1.0 to right

1346
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:51,019
or 1.1

1347
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:53,659
at you know at an upper level let's say

1348
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:55,969
right tiny little variations in pitch to

1349
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:58,489
give sound some characteristic changes

1350
00:54:55,969 --> 00:55:00,589
in in pitch for example just to give it

1351
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:02,179
color to give it some variety when we're

1352
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:04,820
talking about that what that means is we

1353
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:05,949
can't just play like every other sample

1354
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,059
or something and expect that to work

1355
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:10,519
instead we're talking about something

1356
00:55:08,059 --> 00:55:14,259
now where if we look at the samples that

1357
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:19,250
we have of this of this wave you know

1358
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:21,470
like so on there we go if these are the

1359
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,150
samples we have now we're talking about

1360
00:55:21,469 --> 00:55:27,529
something where we want to sample it

1361
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:30,470
like here and here and here and here but

1362
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:33,920
we don't have those sample points right

1363
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:35,419
so what we can do again is go back to

1364
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,490
the same stuff we were doing before our

1365
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:39,170
linear interpolation where we go oh

1366
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:41,719
let's pretend there was a line between

1367
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,550
those and just pick where we think it

1368
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:45,469
would be approximation wise right and

1369
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,910
that will get us some pics if tting

1370
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:51,079
relatively for free cuz that's a very

1371
00:55:46,909 --> 00:55:53,569
low-cost thing to do there are again if

1372
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:55,099
you want to do pitch shifting that's

1373
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:56,570
more powerful than that that can do

1374
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:57,589
bigger pitch shifts that can do length

1375
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,840
preserving all those sorts of things

1376
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:01,940
there's a lot more signal processing and

1377
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,890
audio stuff that you would do if you

1378
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,809
were trying to really do that we don't

1379
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:07,369
care about that we only care about small

1380
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:10,309
pitch changes and linear interpolation

1381
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:12,769
actually surprisingly enough actually

1382
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:14,900
works totally fine for it you don't

1383
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,070
really perceive any your ear doesn't

1384
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:20,539
perceive any problem with it really at

1385
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:22,010
all so yeah so that's really all we're

1386
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:23,779
kind of getting into the episode here we

1387
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:26,390
got maybe a minute or two left I think I

1388
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:28,070
started about 10 minutes late so that's

1389
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:29,929
really everything to do with sound that

1390
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:32,030
we care about so what we're gonna want

1391
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:33,949
to do tomorrow to write a mixer right is

1392
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:37,220
we're going to want something that does

1393
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:42,649
you know that take sounds takes input

1394
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:47,929
sounds right knows where they are like

1395
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:52,039
knows how I should say knows knows what

1396
00:56:47,929 --> 00:56:53,480
time they're at right because remember

1397
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:55,250
we're playing these things over time so

1398
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,500
if we have a sound that lasts for

1399
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,969
several frames we got to know where we

1400
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,530
are in that sound so we're playing the

1401
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:01,879
right part of it the knows where they're

1402
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:09,850
at can

1403
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:14,619
add the sound in multiplied by volume

1404
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:19,279
right we want to be able to continuously

1405
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:24,319
change the volume and we want to be able

1406
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:26,120
to vary the pitch right and I don't

1407
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,130
think we'll need continuously varying

1408
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:29,599
pitch sometimes you do want continuously

1409
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:31,190
bring pitch if you want like an engine

1410
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,139
like if you're a car or racing game or

1411
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:35,720
something but if you're doing a

1412
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:38,089
situation like that oftentimes you want

1413
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:39,919
to be able to make that sound a little

1414
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:42,050
more procedural anyway so that you get a

1415
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,789
really high quality version of it so you

1416
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:46,460
know there's that as well so I don't

1417
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:48,500
think we'll vary the pitch you know per

1418
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,880
sound I'm sorry I don't think will vary

1419
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,250
the pitch per sample just per sound

1420
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,710
right so this is really what we want to

1421
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:57,260
do and so that's what we will probably

1422
00:57:54,710 --> 00:58:00,380
start on doing tomorrow I think that's

1423
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,940
basically it so I will go ahead and go

1424
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:04,550
to the Q&amp;A and see if anyone has any

1425
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:07,579
sound questions so that we will be all

1426
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:11,690
good to go tomorrow and everyone will be

1427
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:15,789
on the same sound pace on the same

1428
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:15,789
wavelength if you will

1429
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:29,529
okay insofar as asks you said panning is

1430
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,720
just a function of volume but could it

1431
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:34,920
also mix a portion of one source channel

1432
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:39,069
into the other output channel for stereo

1433
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:41,559
so if you have a stereo sound again you

1434
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:46,120
don't really have to think about this

1435
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:50,019
too much it still ends up just being a

1436
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:52,239
series you can may put it this way you

1437
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:56,380
can pretty much always think of sounds

1438
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:58,629
as being mono sounds that get mixed with

1439
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,599
a volume multiplier into speaker

1440
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:04,869
channels right so let me just work out

1441
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:07,659
both of them for you so you can think

1442
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:12,279
about it in your head and see what you

1443
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:15,250
think right so let's take the mono case

1444
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,350
first so we have mono sound what is our

1445
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:19,719
mono sound representing well the mono

1446
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:22,750
sound is representing the vibrations

1447
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:25,239
that were hitting a particular point the

1448
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:27,760
microphone right and so what we're

1449
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:30,369
trying to do is pretend that we are now

1450
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,830
going to turn around and make those same

1451
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:35,049
sounds out from that point to reproduce

1452
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:37,449
what would happen if you were sort of

1453
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:41,440
you know sitting there listening to it

1454
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:44,259
right that makes sense so if you think

1455
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,119
about what this will do when we want to

1456
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:48,490
produce this and we want to control

1457
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:50,859
where we're going to hear it right if we

1458
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:53,019
have two speakers and these things are

1459
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,890
producing our sound what we want to do

1460
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:56,170
is say okay

1461
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:57,730
wherever that thing is if it wants to be

1462
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:59,079
closer to this speaker we're gonna play

1463
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:00,099
more of it in this speaker if it wants

1464
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:01,299
to be closer to this think we're gonna

1465
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:03,309
play more of in this speaker right so

1466
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:05,500
we're gonna pan it between these two and

1467
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:07,840
that's just a volume change it just

1468
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,690
means that when we take this sound we'll

1469
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,890
call this sound s and we'll call this in

1470
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:14,019
fact I guess we'll do it we'll call this

1471
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:16,269
s zero we'll call this channel zero will

1472
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:17,530
call this channel one right all we're

1473
01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:20,559
doing is saying that there is a

1474
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:23,860
particular volume that's going to be for

1475
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:26,529
s zero on C zero and there's going to be

1476
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:28,660
a particular volume for s zero on C one

1477
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:30,430
right so we're taking the same sound and

1478
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,500
playing it at two different volumes on

1479
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:33,779
the

1480
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,329
different channels to produce a combined

1481
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:39,930
effect of each speaker reproducing a

1482
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:40,769
certain volume of that sound right so

1483
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:42,779
hopefully everyone's clear on that

1484
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:44,190
that's what I talked about before but if

1485
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,980
we didn't go actually let me go over

1486
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:49,320
here and do it so if we then do the

1487
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:52,260
stereo case well what's the stereo case

1488
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:54,210
the stereo case was just somebody who

1489
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,530
said all right when I mic this thing and

1490
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:57,869
who knows how they decided to mic it

1491
01:00:55,530 --> 01:01:00,540
right when I make this thing I took two

1492
01:00:57,869 --> 01:01:02,940
microphones right and so when the sound

1493
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:04,559
came in right it was caught by two

1494
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:06,269
different microphones which maybe got

1495
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,949
different sorts of stuff happening right

1496
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:10,409
and maybe they even put like a little

1497
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:12,149
blocker in here so that things that kind

1498
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:13,710
of echoed off of this wall and came in

1499
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:15,450
this way or things that came in this way

1500
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:18,059
would happen more in this one than in

1501
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:20,939
another one right so the first thing

1502
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:23,039
that you have to decide is how you want

1503
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,349
to think about where those sounds are

1504
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:27,239
actually coming from because you don't

1505
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:29,099
really know right you have to have an

1506
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:30,179
idea of what what happened there before

1507
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:33,059
you can determine what you want to do

1508
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:36,210
but either/or you're still going to bake

1509
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:38,309
it down into thinking about this being

1510
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:40,470
sound zero and this thing sound one it's

1511
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:42,119
as if you had two mono sounds that were

1512
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:44,099
recorded in different locations right

1513
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:45,779
and then you're going to talk about

1514
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:48,599
doing a source zero

1515
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:51,390
a sound zero on channel zero plus a

1516
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,699
sound one on channel zero right so two

1517
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:57,569
volumes right volume zero zero and

1518
01:01:53,699 --> 01:01:58,949
volume one zero and then you're going to

1519
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:00,600
take and I shouldn't draw these I was

1520
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:03,779
trying to make like a little operator

1521
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:05,130
sign here no something like that and

1522
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,420
then you're going to do the exact same

1523
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,130
thing on the other side you're going to

1524
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:11,760
have sound zero this time played in

1525
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:13,740
channel one plus sound one this time

1526
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,940
played in channel one right and that's

1527
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:17,519
going to be another set of volumes gonna

1528
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:20,610
be volume zero one and volume one one so

1529
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:22,800
a stereo sound doesn't actually like

1530
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,720
stereo sound is almost meaningless that

1531
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,850
was just a concept that was introduced

1532
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:29,509
for the audio industry because they

1533
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:31,589
wanted to start miking you know

1534
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:33,660
performances of live music with two

1535
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:36,300
microphones instead of one right but in

1536
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:38,519
the game world we only really have mono

1537
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,789
sounds when you have a stereo sound a

1538
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:43,679
stereo sound is just two mono samples of

1539
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:46,079
the same sound at the

1540
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,879
time taken from different locations so

1541
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,949
when we played them back we just have to

1542
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,470
have an opinion about where we want

1543
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:54,059
those two sample sets which are

1544
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:56,519
completely different from our

1545
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:58,349
perspective right where we want those

1546
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:09,119
two to be positioned virtually to

1547
01:02:58,349 --> 01:03:10,619
produce the effect that we want early in

1548
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,969
the stream you were describing audio

1549
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:14,130
relation to light and you mentioned how

1550
01:03:11,969 --> 01:03:20,329
sound is volumetric but isn't light also

1551
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:27,660
volumetric no light is is like linear

1552
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:34,829
light travels in a line and so let me

1553
01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:37,139
let me try to explain it this way first

1554
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:39,659
I'll give what I would consider to be

1555
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:41,819
probably a poor explanation because I

1556
01:03:39,659 --> 01:03:43,079
feel like a scientist who studies these

1557
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,570
matters could give a better explanation

1558
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:51,409
that was more accurate but for to a

1559
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:57,380
first approximation light is a thing

1560
01:03:51,409 --> 01:04:04,619
sound is not right

1561
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:09,809
light is a thing that moves sound is the

1562
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:12,179
movement of things might be one way to

1563
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:14,670
say it right light is the thing that

1564
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:17,759
moves sound is the movement of things so

1565
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,630
light the way we perceive it is a photon

1566
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,970
right

1567
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:24,000
it is a photon because mister photon and

1568
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:26,009
mister photon travels it derp straight

1569
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,110
he just goes straight though mister

1570
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,970
photon go straight now he's wiggling he

1571
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:31,920
has a wavelength too that you perceive

1572
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:33,959
as color right so he Wiggles he

1573
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,289
oscillates but he just goes straight and

1574
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:40,110
the only time he stops going straight is

1575
01:04:37,289 --> 01:04:42,389
well and straight it's it's relativity

1576
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:43,559
right so he goes straight for some

1577
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:45,659
coordinate system

1578
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:47,130
he really bends through space-time and

1579
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:49,949
whatever right just like everybody else

1580
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:52,559
but as far as relativistic things aside

1581
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:54,149
he's going straight right and the only

1582
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,960
time he stops going straight is when

1583
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:58,940
there's a molecule here that he pits

1584
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,579
bounces off right so there's some big

1585
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:04,460
old fatty it's sitting here right it's

1586
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:06,799
it's you know it's some big proton or

1587
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,210
something and you know it's gonna it's

1588
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:10,160
going to cause this photon to be

1589
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:13,250
repelled right and go in a different

1590
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:15,139
direction so light is all about going in

1591
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,608
a straight line bouncing off of

1592
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:20,389
something and going in a new straight

1593
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:24,549
line right sound there is no thing

1594
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:28,190
there is no particle that carries sound

1595
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:30,500
sound is just the movement of existing

1596
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:33,619
particles so whereas this is how a

1597
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:35,420
photon moved sound is actually all of

1598
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:38,838
these these guys who were actually

1599
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:40,639
disrupting the photon right sound is all

1600
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:43,159
of these guys getting pushed and

1601
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:45,920
returning like oscillating being moved

1602
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:49,639
bouncing off each other and propagating

1603
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:53,300
a force as it happens right so the thing

1604
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:56,358
the actual sound is ethereal it doesn't

1605
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,500
exist the sound is the motion of these

1606
01:05:56,358 --> 01:06:02,179
things that were sitting there

1607
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:05,000
beforehand right so sound is truly

1608
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:08,029
volumetric it really is a volume of

1609
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,088
things vibrating together it doesn't

1610
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:12,650
know a direction it has no direction you

1611
01:06:11,088 --> 01:06:15,710
could say that the waves that are

1612
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:18,320
propagating are stronger the degree to

1613
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:21,230
which those collisions happen in a

1614
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:22,550
particular direction is perhaps stronger

1615
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:24,650
in that direction than another direction

1616
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:26,869
so you could talk about that but it is

1617
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:30,349
truly a volumetric phenomenon that does

1618
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:32,030
not need specific colliders to change

1619
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:35,630
the motion of something because all of

1620
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:37,339
the molecules that are happening that

1621
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:40,820
are carrying that sound have it happen

1622
01:06:37,338 --> 01:06:42,920
right you can see this in space light

1623
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:45,260
travels through space sound doesn't why

1624
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,539
because there's nothing in space to

1625
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:50,960
carry the sound it's not a thing that

1626
01:06:47,539 --> 01:06:53,150
exists so it can only exist somewhere in

1627
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,880
you know you can only come into being if

1628
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:57,349
there are things there to vibrate if you

1629
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,260
take away the things that can vibrate it

1630
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:02,000
cannot exist not so with light light is

1631
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,770
an actual thing it can travel through

1632
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,989
space just fine in fact it really likes

1633
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:09,019
it because there's nothing there to get

1634
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:10,788
in its way now you may think that's a

1635
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:12,288
little bit odd because people

1636
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:19,579
and talk about something called

1637
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:24,069
volumetric lighting that is just a that

1638
01:07:19,579 --> 01:07:26,630
term arises when talking about a certain

1639
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:29,568
conceptual way of modeling the lighting

1640
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:31,009
and not about how light actually works

1641
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:32,478
we talked about this a little on the

1642
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:34,458
screen but I'll go over it briefly just

1643
01:07:32,478 --> 01:07:35,659
one more time to make sure that

1644
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:38,028
everyone's on the same page

1645
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:41,538
what is volumetric lighting volumetric

1646
01:07:38,028 --> 01:07:44,719
lighting is when you have a volume such

1647
01:07:41,539 --> 01:07:49,249
as a room filled with participating

1648
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:51,259
media right that's what it's called

1649
01:07:49,248 --> 01:07:55,149
participating media in the lighting

1650
01:07:51,259 --> 01:07:59,778
terminology which is like dust mist

1651
01:07:55,150 --> 01:08:01,548
right stuff in the air aerosols right

1652
01:07:59,778 --> 01:08:04,789
there's particles floating in the air

1653
01:08:01,548 --> 01:08:08,778
and what do those particles do they take

1654
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:13,009
the light and they make it bounce in the

1655
01:08:08,778 --> 01:08:16,130
middle of the air right so it's as if

1656
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:19,009
light is somehow a volumetric phenomena

1657
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:22,219
because we cannot see the things that it

1658
01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:24,710
is bouncing off but the only reason it

1659
01:08:22,219 --> 01:08:26,658
is bouncing off is because of those

1660
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:30,828
things the only reason that's happening

1661
01:08:26,658 --> 01:08:32,960
right so when you see God rays the you

1662
01:08:30,828 --> 01:08:34,460
know you're in the church and there's

1663
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,599
about to be the demon summoned if the

1664
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,389
hell gate and all the other things that

1665
01:08:35,599 --> 01:08:41,509
happen in volumetric lighting games and

1666
01:08:37,389 --> 01:08:44,118
you see those those shafts of light that

1667
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:46,698
is not light behaving in a volumetric

1668
01:08:44,118 --> 01:08:48,769
way because light cannot do that what

1669
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:50,598
that actually is is the illusion of

1670
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:52,639
volumetric light created by the fact

1671
01:08:50,599 --> 01:08:54,828
that there are particles of dust in the

1672
01:08:52,639 --> 01:08:56,838
air that are causing light which is

1673
01:08:54,828 --> 01:08:59,448
trying to travel in a straight line to

1674
01:08:56,838 --> 01:09:03,099
hit one of the particles and bounce off

1675
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:07,969
towards your eye if we were in the void

1676
01:09:03,099 --> 01:09:09,770
right we would have no sound but we

1677
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:11,509
would have completely linear light so

1678
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,849
when you look out in space you don't get

1679
01:09:11,509 --> 01:09:15,920
any of that right when you look out of

1680
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:18,440
the space you see crystal clear pinpoint

1681
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,059
stars and the only time that you see

1682
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:22,638
other things is when you have

1683
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:23,539
participating media like gases or

1684
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:28,850
something like this

1685
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:32,119
right so what it ends up being is you

1686
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:33,770
know at the end of the day we're

1687
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:35,568
actually very lucky because it means a

1688
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:38,240
lot of the rendering work that we do for

1689
01:09:35,569 --> 01:09:39,740
lighting which again is very expensive

1690
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:40,760
because you have to produce 2d outputs

1691
01:09:39,739 --> 01:09:44,389
for it right it's much more expensive

1692
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:46,069
than sound which is a 1d output we're

1693
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:49,190
very lucky because most things that

1694
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:52,430
light duck does are still linear even in

1695
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:54,469
our own space because the air is mostly

1696
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:56,000
free of particles there's not that much

1697
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:58,100
stuff in the air it's typically not very

1698
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,539
dense and so for a lot of the stuff that

1699
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,460
we render we don't even have to care

1700
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:02,720
about the fact that light occasionally

1701
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,109
hits one of those particles and bounces

1702
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:09,079
off it right so that's that's how that

1703
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:11,089
works right so that's why I say light is

1704
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:13,220
not a volumetric phenomena and sound is

1705
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,869
it's because light always travels in

1706
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,190
straight lines it can always be thought

1707
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:18,619
of as saying traveling a straight line

1708
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:21,319
bouncing and spinning even in the cases

1709
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:22,880
where we talk about it in terms of

1710
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:24,829
volumetric effects in terms of things

1711
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:29,300
that we perceive to be volumetric it is

1712
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:31,189
still completely model able by something

1713
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:33,380
traveling a straight line bouncing and

1714
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:35,239
coming back right you can still

1715
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:38,840
conceptualize the entire thing that way

1716
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:40,250
sound is never that way the only time we

1717
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,110
can think about sound traveling in

1718
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:44,329
straight lines is when we we are

1719
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:45,859
choosing to approximate it and not

1720
01:10:44,329 --> 01:10:47,989
actually simulate it properly which by

1721
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:50,929
the way we do all the timing games right

1722
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:53,510
because again human auditory system not

1723
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:55,340
that good the level of fidelity at which

1724
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:57,159
we have to reproduce sound to get you to

1725
01:10:55,340 --> 01:11:00,949
think it sounds good is very low so

1726
01:10:57,159 --> 01:11:03,079
that's good but it's worth understanding

1727
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:05,929
that when we simulate some of these

1728
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:07,550
lighting things and we're talking about

1729
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,630
the light moving in a straight line and

1730
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:10,760
we're talking about that way in there

1731
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:12,470
something that's actually true that is

1732
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,539
actually what the light is really doing

1733
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:16,699
when we talk about sound moving in a

1734
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:19,550
straight line that is never true that is

1735
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:21,710
not conceptually correct that is just an

1736
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:24,380
approximation to how it worked

1737
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:27,130
sound is always volumetric light is

1738
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:30,739
never volumetric and when we talk about

1739
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:32,779
simulating these sound or light in ways

1740
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:34,760
that are opposite that it is because of

1741
01:11:32,779 --> 01:11:36,319
some approximation that we want to do or

1742
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,100
some phenomenon that's just easier to

1743
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:38,750
capture

1744
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:40,699
than doing the real thing right like you

1745
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:42,800
could simulate light if you knew all of

1746
01:11:40,698 --> 01:11:44,329
the molecules in the room and you had

1747
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,820
enough processing power to capture that

1748
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:48,198
and treat every photon individually you

1749
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:49,819
would never have to care about sound

1750
01:11:48,198 --> 01:11:51,559
volumetric light I mean light volume it

1751
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:52,939
really at all right you could just

1752
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,020
simulate each individual photon bouncing

1753
01:11:52,939 --> 01:12:10,309
up and you'd get exactly the right

1754
01:11:54,020 --> 01:12:12,560
answer no problem soy sauce the kid no

1755
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:17,920
special sound effects such as reverb I

1756
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:20,929
don't know probably not but we'll see

1757
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,550
because we may just process our sounds

1758
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:26,179
to have different things like that in

1759
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:27,469
there but if we have at some point we

1760
01:12:26,179 --> 01:12:29,840
may decide we want some of that and add

1761
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:31,448
it in there but probably not I think

1762
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,560
we'll probably stay away from that stuff

1763
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:37,329
you can go down a pretty large rathole

1764
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,330
of sound effects sexy stuff

1765
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:48,229
are you going to do any work with sound

1766
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:51,980
analysis or visualization using FFTs no

1767
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:54,789
why would we did you have something in

1768
01:12:51,979 --> 01:12:56,779
mind you wanted to do with that

1769
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:58,130
visualizing the frequency of sound is

1770
01:12:56,779 --> 01:13:00,500
usually something you're doing more for

1771
01:12:58,130 --> 01:13:02,449
editing but you don't really need to

1772
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,699
know the frequencies of sounds in a game

1773
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:09,229
typically do you have any experience

1774
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:11,389
with that stuff with an FFT not much I

1775
01:13:09,229 --> 01:13:14,389
mean I've used them before but not

1776
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:15,860
really I as far as the Fourier transform

1777
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:22,810
is concerned or why it works

1778
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:22,809
I do understand that if that makes sense

1779
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:27,560
is there any need for an equaliser for

1780
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:30,859
the games engine I assume it would be

1781
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:34,700
trivial to implement no actually there

1782
01:13:30,859 --> 01:13:36,739
typically isn't a need for that but no

1783
01:13:34,699 --> 01:13:37,970
it's not trivial to implement and the

1784
01:13:36,739 --> 01:13:40,039
reason it's not true they implement is

1785
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:43,220
because a equalizer works in frequency

1786
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:44,449
space and in order to implement

1787
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,770
something in frequency space you

1788
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:47,720
typically do have to do a fast Fourier

1789
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:49,280
transform in order to do a fast Fourier

1790
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:52,340
transform you're talking about a bunch

1791
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:53,899
of additional code there and you run

1792
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:55,159
into sort of stuff like windows and

1793
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:57,079
blending and all this other sorts of

1794
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:58,970
stuff so because because

1795
01:13:57,079 --> 01:14:00,739
Fourier transforms are actually really

1796
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:02,360
lousy for sound people think they're

1797
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:05,239
great but I totally disagree because

1798
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:09,199
they are fundamentally not a time-based

1799
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:13,000
thing Fourier transforms are static in

1800
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:15,859
time and this causes a lot of problems

1801
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,319
that you then solve in these kind of

1802
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:19,670
annoying hacky ways so I don't I don't

1803
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:24,399
care much for that sort of stuff but

1804
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:26,539
either way point being the the

1805
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:29,059
implementing and equalizer actually is a

1806
01:14:26,539 --> 01:14:31,729
fair bit of work you have to implement a

1807
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:32,690
fast Fourier transform or I guess you

1808
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:34,759
could implement a regular Fourier

1809
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:36,049
transform but it'd be quite slow

1810
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,270
you have to implant a fast Fourier

1811
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:41,110
transform and then you have to actually

1812
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:43,310
go ahead and do the Fourier transform in

1813
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:45,229
modulate the frequencies that you're

1814
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,820
trying to modulate for do equalizing and

1815
01:14:45,229 --> 01:14:48,889
then you have to transfer them back to

1816
01:14:46,819 --> 01:14:53,170
do the inverse Fourier transform to put

1817
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:53,170
it back into sound you can play

1818
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:59,229
what we also want at least a low-pass

1819
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:01,779
filter for audio coming from for example

1820
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:03,279
the other side of a wall maybe like I

1821
01:15:01,779 --> 01:15:05,710
said you know these things largely

1822
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:07,599
aren't super important most of the time

1823
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,069
if you really want to go the extra mile

1824
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,320
with your sound yes you should do them

1825
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:13,179
whether we'll actually get to these in

1826
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:14,859
ham here I don't know they're not very

1827
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:18,039
high bang for the buck

1828
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:19,389
so maybe maybe not obviously low-pass

1829
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:21,670
filters and stuff are pretty easy to

1830
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:23,140
implement so maybe way towards the end

1831
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:25,329
we could throw that in or maybe we'll

1832
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:26,770
after we're done with the game go back

1833
01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:28,750
and add sound effects if we want to or

1834
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,920
whatever it's you know sort of more

1835
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:31,119
expensive sound engine but it's not

1836
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,659
something I really want to spend a whole

1837
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:36,789
lot of time on just because you can get

1838
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:39,220
away without most of it and so I'd

1839
01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:41,079
rather focus on probably on other stuff

1840
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,820
and say you know if you're someone who

1841
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:46,210
really wants to do sound stuff you know

1842
01:15:42,819 --> 01:15:52,750
you can go down that rat hole separately

1843
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:55,869
certainly some older sound cards could

1844
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:58,899
do crosstalk cancellation to try to do

1845
01:15:55,869 --> 01:16:00,099
3d sound with 2 or 4 speakers instead of

1846
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:02,469
with headphones do you have any

1847
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:05,850
experience with this no I don't think

1848
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:05,850
I've ever played with anything like that

1849
01:16:07,289 --> 01:16:11,800
what is a good way to get sound to

1850
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:15,220
bounce off objects more realistically

1851
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:18,159
like walls cars etc to be honest I have

1852
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:20,740
no idea I would assume that what you

1853
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:22,569
would want to do is try to find someone

1854
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:25,420
who had sampled the reflectivity of

1855
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:28,239
sound off of some substances like metals

1856
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:30,159
and drywall and whatever and then you

1857
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:33,279
would want to maybe shoot a bunch of

1858
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:34,779
test rays from the sound emitter see

1859
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:37,569
what sorts of stuff it was hitting and

1860
01:16:34,779 --> 01:16:40,659
maybe put some new emitters in those

1861
01:16:37,569 --> 01:16:41,949
places to admit quieter versions of the

1862
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:43,720
sounds that have been processed with

1863
01:16:41,949 --> 01:16:44,979
that or something like this but that's

1864
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,350
not something that I specialize in like

1865
01:16:44,979 --> 01:16:49,899
I said I'm not an audio guy so I don't

1866
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:51,070
know I don't know what the state of the

1867
01:16:49,899 --> 01:16:52,599
art is so like that I don't know how

1868
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:56,649
much of that is happening in games these

1869
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,180
days if at all I know that games like

1870
01:16:56,649 --> 01:17:00,399
theif the dark project did some work

1871
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:02,350
with sound specifically to try and make

1872
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:03,909
stuff work like that so you could hear

1873
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,560
guards like where were they in those

1874
01:17:03,909 --> 01:17:06,210
sorts of

1875
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,119
so I know there are games that have

1876
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:11,939
tried to sort of push a little bit more

1877
01:17:09,118 --> 01:17:13,529
realistic sound propagation model into

1878
01:17:11,939 --> 01:17:16,919
things but I don't know where that's at

1879
01:17:13,529 --> 01:17:19,229
these days I don't know I don't know to

1880
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:22,399
what degree people have continued to

1881
01:17:19,229 --> 01:17:25,709
pursue that and where they've gotten

1882
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:27,328
alright we're just about out of time and

1883
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:29,908
that's good because there's no other

1884
01:17:27,328 --> 01:17:33,929
questions so we can everything wraps up

1885
01:17:29,908 --> 01:17:37,109
everything wraps up together all right

1886
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:39,090
so let's let's call it a day I think

1887
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:40,618
we've we had a long blackboard session

1888
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:41,969
so I think we're hopefully everyone's

1889
01:17:40,618 --> 01:17:43,979
all on the same page and we're ready to

1890
01:17:41,969 --> 01:17:46,380
do some coding some mixture coding

1891
01:17:43,979 --> 01:17:47,729
tomorrow so thank you everyone for

1892
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,989
joining me for another episode of hand

1893
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:51,868
made here oh it's been a pleasure coding

1894
01:17:48,988 --> 01:17:53,789
with you as always if you would like to

1895
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:56,059
follow along at home you can always

1896
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:58,078
pre-order the game on handmade hero org

1897
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:59,250
you can pre-order it comes to the source

1898
01:17:58,078 --> 01:18:01,889
code you can play around with it do

1899
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:04,408
whatever you would like to experiment

1900
01:18:01,889 --> 01:18:06,060
and learn from it and all those sorts of

1901
01:18:04,408 --> 01:18:07,799
other good things and when you're doing

1902
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,090
that if you then have questions don't

1903
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,980
forget we have a forum site you can ask

1904
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:12,000
questions on there's cool people on

1905
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:14,549
there who answer them

1906
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,539
there's also community ports too Mac and

1907
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:16,889
Linux you can check out if you're trying

1908
01:18:15,539 --> 01:18:19,618
to follow along in a platform that isn't

1909
01:18:16,889 --> 01:18:20,400
Windows we also have an Tate episode

1910
01:18:19,618 --> 01:18:22,198
guide that people in the community

1911
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:23,819
contribute to so there's that but if you

1912
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:25,859
try kept up with past episodes it's kind

1913
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:27,118
of Handy to do it that way we also have

1914
01:18:25,859 --> 01:18:29,339
a patreon you can subscribe to if you

1915
01:18:27,118 --> 01:18:30,779
want to support the video series and we

1916
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,010
also have a tweet bot that you can

1917
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:33,210
subscribe to if you want to know when

1918
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:35,099
this when the video is going to be live

1919
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:36,980
so if you want to come and catch it live

1920
01:18:35,099 --> 01:18:39,239
and ask questions and all that stuff

1921
01:18:36,979 --> 01:18:41,848
subscribe the tweet bot it'll tell you

1922
01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:43,229
when to do it so that's just about it I

1923
01:18:41,849 --> 01:18:44,279
hope see you back here tomorrow when

1924
01:18:43,229 --> 01:18:47,218
we'll do some mixer coding

1925
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:48,090
until then have fun coding and I'll see

1926
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:50,779
you guys on the Internet

1927
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,779
take me as everyone
