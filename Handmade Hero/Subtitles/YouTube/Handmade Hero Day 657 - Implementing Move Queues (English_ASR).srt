1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,679
all right everybody uh let's take a look

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,719
today

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,000
um

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,599
at

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,960
moving the glove around so we kind of

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,000
decided last

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,839
week

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,960
that we were going to try to

9
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,079
uh just store movements in entities

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
we're going to say like look there's

11
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,959
going to be a certain

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,160
series of movements that you can

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,400
queue up so you know you get something

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
and i believe it's in

15
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,839
here

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,520
where we have

17
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,079
um

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,600
this so what we decided to do was say

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,960
all right there's gonna be this move

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
pattern

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
and the move patterns are things that we

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,719
can define that are just gonna be like

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,879
game designy

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,520
so move patterns are things like how

25
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,119
enemies attack or how a glove works or

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,280
even potentially how enemies move

27
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,198
sometimes so i don't know what we'll use

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
it for but this is our experiment it's

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:57,920
just what we decided to implement we

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,279
need to pick something implement first

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,239
just so we can get started and see how

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
it goes

33
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,479
right

34
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,079
um

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
so uh

36
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,519
what we expect to have happen is we

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
define some of these move patterns such

38
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,879
as a glove punch pattern

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,879
the patterns are direction agnostic so

40
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,640
basically they don't care whether you're

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,959
facing like

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
left up right or down

43
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,559
they are

44
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,639
written always to point to the right and

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,359
then we assume that when you trigger one

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,359
of these it will be rotated into the

47
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,840
correct direction

48
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,159
so uh we define a move pattern and the

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
move pattern is some number of moves we

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
don't know how long this should be here

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,759
but whatever it is it's going to be you

52
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,519
know there's going to be some

53
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
max number that's however money we think

54
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,519
we'll ever need and then we set the move

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
count how many of those we actually use

56
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,519
because probably most moves are going to

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
be like a lot less than eight eight is

58
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,879
really kind of tediously long so like if

59
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,158
you're gonna do a glove punch you

60
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,519
probably don't want it to go to eight

61
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
squares right

62
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,959
um but in general you know two three

63
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,959
four something like that

64
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,359
uh when you then trigger one of these

65
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,478
the move pattern gets copied into a move

66
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,800
queue and the move queue is per entity

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
it consists of these entries and they

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,959
are basically like a finalization of it

69
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,120
it's like here is the delta which

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,759
direction i'm going to move from my last

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,239
position plus you know any flags like is

72
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,079
it interrupt or interruptible am i you

73
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,080
know able to collide during it you know

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
who knows what

75
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,000
and i

76
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,400
again we we also kind of decided well

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,239
we're gonna need some way of saying how

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,599
stats affect what you do when you move

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
like whether you do damage

80
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,000
uh whether you you know how much you do

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
how fast you move

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,759
and so we decided as well we're going to

83
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,199
probably have some move square types and

84
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,878
we haven't really decided what they are

85
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,958
right now we just call them a b and c

86
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,560
but you know eventually we'll have

87
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,360
some idea of what those are and the

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,840
stats for things will just be based on

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
that so

90
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,479
basically a move pattern will be

91
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,319
something like you know move move strike

92
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,919
and so we'd have maybe move is one of

93
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,679
these and strike is one of these and

94
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,598
maybe big strike is one of these or

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
small strike you know what i'm saying

96
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,518
so we have some move square types and

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,039
those move square types are all designed

98
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,759
to be uh

99
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,439
like things we will tune for game design

100
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,560
and then the

101
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,439
actual stats are never

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,360
uh

103
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,680
are never just vague like they're never

104
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,400
like oh here are some stats the stats

105
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,159
are always tied to a type so for example

106
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,158
if a particular glove

107
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,719
has a particular damage stat

108
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,120
it's never just here's the abstract

109
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,039
amount of damage this glove does instead

110
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
it is here's how much damage this glove

111
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,519
does on a move movement here's how much

112
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,080
it does on strike here's what she does

113
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,239
on big strike right

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,040
so you could have gloves that don't do

115
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,519
any damage on movement and only do

116
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,438
damage on striking you could have drugs

117
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,400
drugs that's good gloves or you could

118
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,919
have drugs i mean maybe there's

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
you know prescription illicit i'm not

120
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,438
sure over the counter even

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,039
um

122
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,759
you can have gloves that do the opposite

123
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,759
right gloves that that do attack on move

124
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,839
and don't attack on strike or attack on

125
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
both and all that and so the idea there

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,439
is just to give us room to start working

127
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
on the game design

128
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,560
um

129
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
so that there's enough because you know

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,079
i mean this is a supposed to be a

131
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
roguelike kind of feel so we we need

132
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,120
enough room for the design to have a lot

133
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,638
of variability uh a rogue alike that's

134
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,478
the same every time is not gonna be very

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,280
interesting so you have to have

136
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,279
i think some variety in how the attacks

137
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,000
feel there has to be like oh in this

138
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,758
build it was all about doing a small

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
amount of damage to a lot of things at

140
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,919
once and in this other build it was all

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,079
about doing a lot of damage to just one

142
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,000
thing at a time right

143
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,680
and so you kind of need there to be a

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
room for that and so that's that's the

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
design that we basically just kind of

146
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,439
like quickly sketched out

147
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,400
um again it's just a guess we have no

148
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:09,519
idea but we need something to type in

149
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,359
first so that we can start playing

150
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,879
uh that's and that's all this is just

151
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,720
something to type in first i have no

152
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,279
idea if it's any good

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,440
um and i'm not a game designer so i'm

154
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,758
not supposed to know right uh that's

155
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,279
that's something someone else you know

156
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,319
would would be uh in charge of normally

157
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,319
uh and so in the brain code when you do

158
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,759
something like trigger and attack we

159
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,719
started sketching out like how this

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,720
would actually work using that system

161
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
um you would get something like this and

162
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,759
this is probably going to be reusable

163
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,918
code eventually

164
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,600
because we probably want you know in

165
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,120
general the ability to cue a pattern up

166
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
like this so this is just we put it in

167
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,240
here because this is where we have to be

168
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,199
developing it but you can kind of see

169
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,918
there's nothing specific to the glove

170
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,759
about this actual piece of code it just

171
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,038
does a cue right it

172
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,800
looks to make sure there's room in the

173
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,560
queue for the movement so that it won't

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,639
start adding things to a movement that

175
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,800
it can't finish

176
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
and we made that be an assertion because

177
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
i think that's just a bug we should

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,400
always make the game design so that you

179
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,918
know it's free for us to set these

180
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,279
numbers to the maximums we're going to

181
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,519
use in the game design so it shouldn't

182
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:18,318
be an issue right

183
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:21,038
um and then we just go through and we go

184
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,120
through the moves and we add them in

185
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,318
rotated to fit the current facing

186
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,519
direction

187
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,639
you know

188
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,758
um

189
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,160
and that's it

190
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,560
right it's very simple uh so that's how

191
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,639
we would cue up movements i think that

192
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,839
probably just works uh i mean there

193
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
might be some bugs and i haven't looked

194
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,279
at it closely but

195
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,038
i think that's it right

196
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,638
so you can see this will be pretty easy

197
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,879
we'll just have a cue we'll we'll pull

198
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
this out into like a queue if this turns

199
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,560
out to be okay

200
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,199
that's what you end up with

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120
and so really i think all we're

202
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,759
really in need of now

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
is just for the entity code to be

204
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,319
pulling things off of this movement

205
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,598
queue

206
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,800
and executing them you know what i mean

207
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:06,399
uh so we kind of need a way to

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,439
to we kind of need to start working on

209
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,439
that aspect of things

210
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,800
um

211
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,560
so

212
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,199
there's a couple things that are weird

213
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,639
about this and again like i think we're

214
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,319
just gonna have to feel our way through

215
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,240
it

216
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,960
if you look at how

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,598
uh movement is working currently

218
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,399
effectively what's going on is the brain

219
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,639
code is synchronizing the movement of

220
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,239
things across the frame so like for

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,240
example well you can see it

222
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,519
uh happening right here actually um

223
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,799
right you can kind of see this dude

224
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,680
hopping around

225
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,520
right

226
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,199
um we're outside the lighting region now

227
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,959
so everyone is going to get lit by the

228
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,360
same light uh when you're out you're not

229
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,598
really supposed to be looking beyond the

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,120
blue boundary but for now just ignore

231
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,800
the lighting um

232
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,439
the uh

233
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,360
this dude who's hopping around

234
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,319
the way that that works is that the

235
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
brain

236
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,360
does those movement requests so they all

237
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,439
kind of

238
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,280
happen at the same time that's why that

239
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,959
works right because the transactional

240
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,559
movement system would otherwise it would

241
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,240
create a problem

242
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,879
and the problem that it would create is

243
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,959
if these guys moved in a different order

244
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,879
then like the person here wouldn't be

245
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,639
able to move until this guy moved so

246
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,320
they wouldn't move in sync like they'd

247
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,278
move like one frame lagged from each

248
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,200
other because

249
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,958
like the first person would have to have

250
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,560
already started to move out of the

251
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,239
square that they're in before the person

252
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,838
behind that person could have started to

253
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,839
move into it right

254
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,360
um

255
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,319
so that's kind of an issue

256
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,440
and i'm not 100 certain what we're going

257
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,720
to do

258
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,480
long term we can keep doing it that way

259
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
um but you could imagine a world where

260
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,839
we wanted everything to go through the

261
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,919
movement cue system and really what the

262
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,440
brains did was just they they queued up

263
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,000
emotion here

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,399
and those cued up motions have to be

265
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,679
retired by somebody right

266
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,440
and when they are they might fail right

267
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,879
like and so you get into that situation

268
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,240
i was just saying where you have this

269
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,039
sort of

270
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
uh

271
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,480
off by one kind of a thing where oh this

272
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,000
guy

273
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
in the entity list happens to come

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
before this guy

275
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
and so what do we do

276
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,599
um and so we kind of have to think about

277
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,519
that and the answer might be that since

278
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,200
we're now going to be more or less doing

279
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,440
everything on the grid anyway uh as we

280
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,040
move towards

281
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,360
you know simplifying the code down and

282
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,360
just doing something more grid based

283
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,839
always

284
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,079
it may be that we just want

285
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,079
to uh

286
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,839
it may be that we want to switch to a

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,159
multi-pass approach there

288
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
and and i don't know

289
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,480
like

290
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,278
but

291
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,560
you know what we could do for example

292
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,000
is

293
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,799
the move cues get retired

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,120
you know um

295
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,919
we go through the move cues and they get

296
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,120
processed as requests to move somewhere

297
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:39,278
and then we resolve those in a second

298
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,759
pass so that if if it just so happens

299
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,159
that one person requests a move into a

300
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:48,879
square that another person requested to

301
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:51,360
move out of those get resolved properly

302
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,559
you have to be careful like because if

303
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
you start getting into stuff like that

304
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,359
you end up with what basically amount to

305
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
physics dependency chains

306
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,720
you end up in a situation where like

307
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,519
with something like this

308
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
where

309
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,480
you know it's hard to know how many

310
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,159
passes or in what way you you

311
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,159
uh resolve them you know

312
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,000
and so it's not oh it's not clear to me

313
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,240
like right off the bat that that's a

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,278
smart thing right like i don't really

315
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,799
know

316
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,360
um

317
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,439
whether there's fruitful ground there i

318
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,560
i really just am not sure

319
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,279
so uh i'm gonna kind of ignore that part

320
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,359
of it for now and just focus on moving

321
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,519
things that don't have that constraint

322
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,639
and we'll start there and then we'll

323
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,959
kind of like

324
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:41,519
go further right as we go

325
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,518
and figure out more stuff

326
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,560
um so okay

327
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,000
so

328
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,000
let's start thinking about how this is

329
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,039
going to work if we push you know if you

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,159
imagine us doing um something like this

331
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,879
what do we want to have happen here um

332
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,399
oh that's a bit weird

333
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,439
did i set one of these wrong it looks

334
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,000
like i set one of these wrong when i

335
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,000
pushed up

336
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,919
it looks like it pointed in the wrong

337
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,920
direction

338
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,838
that looks correct though

339
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,838
doesn't it

340
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,600
action up

341
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,600
ended down

342
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
this so this must be

343
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,000
yeah this is a bit strange so so why is

344
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,000
this this way

345
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,559
the facing direction

346
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,919
is going to be the a tan of the x vector

347
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,599
right

348
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,199
and i mean i don't even know why we have

349
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,839
it that way we might as well just set it

350
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,920
up above so we don't do an a tan but

351
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,639
that's just wrong i'm not sure why it

352
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,639
was set like that

353
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,480
what am i missing there attack

354
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,639
is our how is our facing direction is

355
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,320
encoded as

356
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,320
i think as an angle

357
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,480
although i guess i'm not entirely sure

358
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,480
how we encoded that i don't remember but

359
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,079
that should be

360
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,159
correct for atan right

361
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,278
i mean i'm looking at it there's attack

362
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,919
x

363
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:42,799
and it sure seems like it right

364
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,000
i mean a tan of one zero

365
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,120
oh uh

366
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,480
duh

367
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,879
a tan is y over x sorry so it was okay

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,159
uh the y x part it was just the the

369
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,919
attack x instead of y a tan always

370
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,919
i've never really understood the the

371
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,198
order of parameters there we go

372
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,958
i was like i knew that was right like

373
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,399
what's going on so now it's correct when

374
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,518
i push of course you guys couldn't tell

375
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,600
it was wrong because you can't see which

376
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,198
keys i'm pushing but you know trust me

377
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
now it's correct

378
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,679
so what we want to do now is we have to

379
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,679
try and figure out how we want uh the

380
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,958
glove to move so the first thing that we

381
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,919
have to figure out is where does the

382
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,919
glove really sit and

383
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,078
i feel like you know it's just going to

384
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,919
be too difficult to figure out how this

385
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,359
game would work exactly

386
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,159
if the glove

387
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,000
uh occupied a square completely because

388
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,278
we kind of want the glove to be floating

389
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,440
in the same square as the hero right

390
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,519
um like we we want the

391
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
we want the glove and the hero to be in

392
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,879
the same square i think

393
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,838
um

394
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,559
and

395
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,040
so we don't really want to consider that

396
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,518
illegal if we said that the glove and

397
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,039
the hero both occupy a square

398
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,679
then

399
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,838
i mean you could make that game but then

400
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:59,278
it becomes a little bit more even more

401
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,920
tetris-like as a game right because now

402
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,679
you have to worry about like fitting

403
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,599
um

404
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,159
like you have to worry about whether you

405
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,639
can have room to turn

406
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,480
like if i turn this way then the glove

407
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,480
has to go into this square and if it

408
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,320
can't then i like can't turn that way or

409
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
i can turn that way but the glove stays

410
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,600
here right

411
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
um

412
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,839
i mean one of the things that sucks

413
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,679
about this sort of thing if you're not a

414
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,600
game designer is like as i'm saying that

415
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,599
i'm like i don't know that's like

416
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,880
kind of interesting

417
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,959
i i don't think it would make sense in a

418
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,919
game like this because this game is more

419
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,159
actiony if it was a puzzle game

420
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,439
that sounds

421
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,838
good right meaning a puzzle game

422
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,480
you know that's

423
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,120
very that seems very logical

424
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,278
for an action game

425
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,399
i'm just not sure why you would care

426
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,639
right like

427
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
like

428
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:13,838
i i can't think of hand of a reason why

429
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,839
that would be something we would need

430
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,079
like what are you going to be doing in

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,240
the game differently because that's true

432
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,239
you know

433
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,220
[Music]

434
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,759
um so i don't think it's really worth

435
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,758
trying that um

436
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,480
like i don't really think it's worth

437
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,919
trying that so i think i'm just going to

438
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
put it in

439
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,439
um

440
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,120
it it's it's you know it's it's in the

441
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,800
same square

442
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,198
uh and so

443
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,439
that part is kind of a little confusing

444
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,000
now because i have to think about how it

445
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,199
interacts with the move cube but i think

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,759
more or less uh what's happening is

447
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:57,758
if the

448
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,600
when we're looking at the glove

449
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,400
if we are in a situation

450
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,400
where there's nothing in the move queue

451
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,240
then i think that's like our return

452
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,880
pattern right

453
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,679
so uh

454
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,400
we want this code to be setting it to be

455
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,519
moving back to a location next to the

456
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,798
hero is what this code does

457
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,038
uh and we want this code to

458
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,480
uh

459
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,640
this code is just pushing the things on

460
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,558
to the move queue and the entity code

461
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,880
will presumably take care of moving that

462
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,440
stuff forward i assume

463
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,799
i don't know uh it's kind of hard to say

464
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,160
where that code should live maybe that

465
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,160
still lives in the brain code but

466
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,279
so this part here we should be able to

467
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,839
get working at the moment um and if we

468
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,000
go look at the animation floating code

469
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,359
uh like now we have to start actually

470
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,720
thinking about how this stuff's gonna

471
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,719
work right

472
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,279
uh so we've got this where we've got

473
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,558
hopping and we've got floating

474
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:06,399
and you can see us doing like a a lerp

475
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:08,720
here to move from one place to another

476
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,720
and

477
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,279
hmm

478
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,119
sorry i'm very allergy today for some

479
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,400
reason

480
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,439
i'm not sure why it's raining i feel

481
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
like my allergies should get better

482
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,679
they're not actually bad just a little

483
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,679
bit stuffy

484
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,599
um

485
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,599
so

486
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,558
the question is

487
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,960
how do we square the part about it

488
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,319
occupying or not occupying things you

489
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
can see here it's doing like an

490
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,240
occupying and it came from and it's like

491
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,279
lurping it's doing the lerp and that's

492
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,079
fine

493
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,240
but

494
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:57,038
we don't actually want it to occupy a

495
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,480
square

496
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,400
we just want it to float through the

497
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,679
square

498
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,120
you know

499
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,559
and so i guess

500
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,879
part of the problem

501
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,879
is that

502
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,400
we we need some way of of marking

503
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:18,879
[Music]

504
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,480
what the entity is right now

505
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,240
meaning like when it does

506
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,079
those occupying steps

507
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,480
we need a way of saying something came

508
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:34,399
from somewhere or is going to somewhere

509
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,038
without it actually taking up the square

510
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,798
because when something is going to be

511
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:39,839
ephemeral it's supposed to float through

512
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,038
things

513
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,359
right

514
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,359
um

515
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
so

516
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:01,440
in the transaction system

517
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,440
right when you move around

518
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,120
so

519
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,759
you can actually see

520
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,918
uh in here

521
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,038
transactional occupy

522
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,000
does the

523
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,000
occupying thing right

524
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,360
and so like i guess i'm just trying to

525
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,038
think about like how do we want to move

526
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,719
this forward because i think we kind of

527
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,960
want to just redo this stuff a little

528
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,960
bit

529
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,080
right

530
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,319
um like i feel like we kind of want to

531
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,319
just

532
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:54,359
move to a system whereby we

533
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,359
can just

534
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,798
i i guess the right way to say it would

535
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,120
would maybe be that i want to kind of

536
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,038
regularize this stuff more

537
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,439
like right now it's very ad hoc and

538
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,640
anyone can call transactional occupy and

539
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,600
of course transaction occupy is

540
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,038
reasonable so you know you know that

541
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,000
people are occupying a particular square

542
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,879
or not

543
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,679
but

544
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,679
i think

545
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,000
if you look at how occupying

546
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
itself

547
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,678
works

548
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,000
so in here you can see

549
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,000
um

550
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,400
when we do update and render entities we

551
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,519
go over the entities here

552
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,519
and you can see that it does a thing

553
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,759
where it like

554
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,759
um

555
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,079
not that one

556
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,080
it's actually the unpack

557
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,038
where is that

558
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,480
it might be that they're just stored

559
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,079
been a long time

560
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,599
so i guess it might be that they're just

561
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,839
stored

562
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,839
um

563
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,960
so maybe that's not true

564
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:38,960
i

565
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,678
you know previously

566
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,839
i was i was thinking that the occupy got

567
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,919
unpacked but it looks like they're just

568
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,519
stored along with the entity

569
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,440
i guess

570
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,038
um and again it's just like it feels

571
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,880
like this stuff wants to be simplified

572
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,558
down now like we should probably just

573
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,679
have the grid

574
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,480
um

575
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,600
and

576
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,519
the grid

577
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,079
is

578
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,440
doesn't require people to track occupant

579
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:09,279
occupancy because occupancy

580
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,960
you just unpack into the grid and you're

581
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,250
done right

582
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,519
um

583
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,000
[Music]

584
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,359
and so yeah i'm just the reason i'm kind

585
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,880
of a little hesitant is i just don't

586
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,399
know in which order i want to do these

587
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,240
things i want to clean up a bunch of

588
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,159
this stuff but i just don't know which

589
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,079
order i want to do it in

590
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,159
so i guess what i would say is since it

591
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,480
looks like there's no real harm at the

592
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,400
moment because the occupying is

593
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
completely up to you whether you call it

594
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,600
or not and it doesn't actually do an

595
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
unpack

596
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,038
um

597
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,039
because i like it does not look like

598
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,879
there's an unpack uh

599
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,879
for that right like i don't

600
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,640
how come i can't go to next error

601
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,319
well it doesn't matter

602
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,320
um

603
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,558
because there's it in there's nothing in

604
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,439
the unpack that actually sets this as

605
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,440
far as i can tell

606
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,639
uh then i guess we don't have to worry

607
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,400
about this right now but i would like to

608
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,278
do it at some point but since there

609
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,278
isn't

610
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,519
i guess that means that we can literally

611
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:18,480
set uh the entity to just come back

612
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:21,278
and at the moment it would do probably

613
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,679
too much of a lurp

614
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,159
uh way too fast of a lerp

615
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,159
normally

616
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,960
it probably should be set to do

617
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,200
something smoother but

618
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,200
at the moment i think we can just set

619
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,159
the occupying

620
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,200
to

621
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,720
uh to be where i set the um

622
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,240
the destination and the occupying

623
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,200
without actually doing a transactional

624
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,919
occupy just set them

625
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,038
and that will actually move it properly

626
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,400
so i guess we can do that i guess

627
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:54,319
right

628
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,200
so if we don't have any moves then i

629
00:24:54,319 --> 00:25:00,200
think all we really need to do is to set

630
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,200
um

631
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
yeah it looks like like it like i mean

632
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
it looks like we just

633
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
we can just literally cold set this

634
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,760
stuff

635
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,839
so we're gonna want to clean this up

636
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,919
this isn't good uh this this needs to

637
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,199
get regularized a lot there's way too

638
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,080
much code going on in here for this

639
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,159
stuff

640
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,720
so it's definitely on my radar of stuff

641
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,080
that needs to get fixed for sure

642
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,079
but

643
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,079
um

644
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,038
for the moment i think this will still

645
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,720
work so if the move q count is zero then

646
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,558
i think what we want to do

647
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,880
is uh is check to see whether or not the

648
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,720
glove occupying equals the body

649
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,919
occupying meaning are they in the same

650
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,400
square

651
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,600
um and if they're not then you know if

652
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,480
they are in the same square we don't

653
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,480
really have to do anything

654
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,159
but if they're not in the same square

655
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,080
then we need to set uh this stuff

656
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
right we need to set the the anim

657
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,599
floating

658
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,639
and we need to set these to be equal to

659
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,959
the right

660
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,480
uh stuff so we want to say that the

661
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,200
glove

662
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,278
occupying should be the body occupying

663
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,278
um and the glove came from

664
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,919
should equal the glove occupying so

665
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,559
it'll just return right it'll return to

666
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,200
where you know the body is

667
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,200
in that case

668
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,919
uh but like i said this is way too much

669
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,000
work uh this stuff we now want to kind

670
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,000
of collapse into something small and

671
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,919
reasonable because this is very simple

672
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,200
what we're doing here it's just over

673
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,200
complicated by the fact that it was

674
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,159
generic 3d before

675
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,919
um

676
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,520
so anyway so now we want to do is get

677
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,440
that working so that it will actually

678
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,918
lerp right um

679
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,919
and so

680
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,678
i guess i'm not sure about

681
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,519
well that should

682
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,960
so that should work so we should debug

683
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,798
this real quick and make sure we know

684
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,558
why like we should make sure that works

685
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:09,918
because i think as it is that should

686
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:11,599
probably work because it should hit this

687
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,990
case

688
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,108
um

689
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,108
[Music]

690
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:21,839
i guess i'm not sure where t movement

691
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,839
gets advanced

692
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,200
okay so t movement is always advanced uh

693
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,319
so that's fine

694
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,640
um

695
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,678
so that should work and so why this

696
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720
isn't

697
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,038
uh

698
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,759
doing alert on the ground p because i

699
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,200
think we should hit this case

700
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,879
i mean i don't know for sure but i think

701
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,038
we should get this case

702
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,039
uh i'd like to see why that's not

703
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,038
happening

704
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,840
so i guess one reason that might not be

705
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,879
happening though is also if i

706
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,480
accidentally hit a key

707
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,919
but i didn't there so the move queue is

708
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,599
still m is is empty so there's something

709
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,399
up with that so let's take a quick look

710
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,599
and see why that case doesn't hit

711
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,839
um

712
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,798
or if it does hit why it's like doesn't

713
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:25,199
actually result in anything

714
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,798
because i think that should already even

715
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,798
before we clean up the code it should

716
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,558
trigger the lerp case

717
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,519
and it's not triggering the lerp case so

718
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:36,480
that's a bit odd and

719
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,480
i want to know why

720
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:46,558
okay so in this code uh

721
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,240
we've have it all so we right here are

722
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,558
wondering do we ever come through this

723
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,558
code

724
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,599
uh another problem

725
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,158
well okay

726
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,599
so we do come through this code the

727
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,120
glove occupying the body occupying are

728
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,199
not the same

729
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,359
right

730
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,840
let's take a look at the glove data here

731
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,839
real quick

732
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,799
or the g love

733
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,150
so if we take a look at the occupying

734
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,199
um

735
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,199
[Music]

736
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,158
it looks like the glove is not occupying

737
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,159
anything

738
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,720
so that's kind of weird

739
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,919
i guess it must not have been set when

740
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,119
it starts

741
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,640
but it's definitely targeting something

742
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,439
right

743
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,880
um

744
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
so

745
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,919
i'm not

746
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,520
quite sure

747
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,840
why that would not therefore animate

748
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:57,599
right

749
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:57,599
um that's a bit peculiar

750
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,558
but

751
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,839
we can take a look at update animation

752
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,839
and see what's going on there

753
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,720
now unfortunately we don't really have

754
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,720
any way excuse me

755
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:23,839
um

756
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,839
we don't really have any way of

757
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,599
checking which one is the glove which is

758
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,200
a little annoying

759
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,678
uh because we'd like to just take a look

760
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,679
at just the glove itself

761
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,798
so we probably need some way of of

762
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,600
getting that

763
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,759
narrowed down but

764
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,639
um

765
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,759
seeing

766
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,759
what's going on here

767
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,558
like everyone is at t equals one

768
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,038
like everybody

769
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,879
so why you wouldn't have movement from

770
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,679
in movement two it should just be equal

771
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,679
to movement two

772
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,720
right i mean

773
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,720
so that's just really kind of strange um

774
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:40,159
like that really does seem kind of

775
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,159
strange i don't know why we would

776
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,398
i can't say i understand that because if

777
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,720
the t value is always set to one and

778
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,959
movement two is going to be the

779
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,240
destination of the thing

780
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,679
um

781
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,278
which we set to the same one as the body

782
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,720
then it doesn't make a lot of sense to

783
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,960
me why it wouldn't be following around

784
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,960
right

785
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:11,199
i mean there's there's bad like this

786
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,399
code is not good because there's i could

787
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,278
list off a number of things that are

788
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,199
wrong with it right um

789
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,240
but like

790
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,798
it should be moving

791
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,558
at least slightly

792
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,319
it's we should see it kind of jerkily

793
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,079
move to where it should go and the fact

794
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,079
that we don't see it move at all is

795
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,079
weird

796
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:53,558
hmm

797
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,480
what am i missing

798
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,480
i'll take a look at that update

799
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,480
animation code

800
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
so

801
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,079
i mean

802
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,840
there's not a lot of code there

803
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,840
ah the ground p of the entity just kinda

804
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,040
yeah i'm not seeing it i'm not seeing

805
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,559
why that that seems like it should work

806
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:21,918
and it's especially weird that it

807
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,358
doesn't

808
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,799
um

809
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,799
the glove stuff doesn't really get

810
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,720
overwritten anywhere as far as i can

811
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,720
tell i guess i'll double check maybe it

812
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,719
does

813
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,838
i mean that's the only place we set the

814
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,838
animation type

815
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,720
so that's really strange it seems like

816
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,280
that should be set we should be hitting

817
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,878
the floating case and worst case it

818
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,240
should just be kind of jumping to

819
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:00,159
movement 2

820
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,118
where it says get some space traversible

821
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:07,199
of whatever the entity is occupying

822
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,440
that seems like what i would expect

823
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,439
right

824
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,119
now i suppose

825
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,279
since we don't know which one is the

826
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,440
glove i suppose

827
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,040
one nice thing to do would be to like

828
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,280
you know

829
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:26,000
be able to mark this clearly so we can

830
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,280
tell that it is or isn't the glove

831
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,838
right

832
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,839
so when we do this entity id here

833
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,440
we could also assign like a debug

834
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,879
name to it

835
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,280
you know what i mean

836
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,320
uh and that would be a way for us to

837
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,400
sort of quickly know who we were dealing

838
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,400
with um

839
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:50,480
i can also sort of save when the glove

840
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,960
gets created

841
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,719
and look at what the glove

842
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,079
id is there

843
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,399
and maybe that's easier because then i

844
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,320
can actually even just set a breakpoint

845
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,880
for that

846
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,960
so in here right you can see where we do

847
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,960
the glove and the glove

848
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,800
creates the

849
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:15,280
you know the entities for it

850
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,039
again nothing really weird happening it

851
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,519
it's it's literally just

852
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,639
you know add entity it sets it to

853
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,639
floating here

854
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,960
collision volumes we don't know that

855
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,719
we're really going to use

856
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,720
all that much

857
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,719
um

858
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,039
so i guess what i'd say is

859
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,960
maybe we'll just set a breakpoint here

860
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,800
at add player

861
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,800
uh and i'll just look at what the glove

862
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,359
entity id actually is

863
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,760
and then we can look and

864
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,039
see if you know just somehow the glove

865
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,599
not get

866
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:07,920
updated i mean it doesn't make sense but

867
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,720
you know we'll just see

868
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,599
so here's add player

869
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,598
here's the glove

870
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,279
and you can see the id

871
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,599
right there

872
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,839
so we're looking at 10 845

873
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,838
right

874
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,199
so now if i just go into well i suppose

875
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,799
i can leave a break point on this

876
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,118
there's not

877
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,320
really a reason not to because the next

878
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,559
time we run we'll want to look at the

879
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,760
end of the idea again uh it probably

880
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,559
would be the same

881
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,480
but

882
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,239
just in case it isn't so that we can

883
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,119
make sure

884
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,000
um

885
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,119
so now if we go to that entity code we

886
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,280
could just see like all right

887
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,200
what happens does that particular

888
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,680
entity

889
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,679
come through

890
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:07,358
so like there's our answer i guess

891
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,960
is that entity didn't come through

892
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,679
uh at all

893
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,159
so let's make sure it's still there

894
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,159
yeah so it's still 10 8 4 5

895
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,960
here when it's getting set

896
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,000
to

897
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,880
floating um so maybe it hadn't been set

898
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,239
to float yet although it seemed like it

899
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,039
was set to flowing when it was created

900
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,679
so

901
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,679
should it come through

902
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,560
there it is so i guess

903
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,119
it has to hit the first time

904
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,358
so if we look uh

905
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,119
at what the t value is the t value is

906
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:39,119
zero which means it won't move from

907
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,599
where it started so we wouldn't expect

908
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,200
to see it move here at all i guess

909
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,200
right

910
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,838
um

911
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:51,199
so this first time through that's fine

912
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,199
let's see the second time through

913
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,480
so now it should move like it should

914
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:00,319
place itself

915
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,000
halfway in between these two locations

916
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,240
right

917
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,239
um

918
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,240
i mean that's what should happen

919
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,800
unless i'm totally wrong

920
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,519
so

921
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,839
we have a ground p we have a from a two

922
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:24,159
i don't honestly have no idea how this

923
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,440
could be the value of ground p at the

924
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,598
moment

925
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,039
so so maybe that's part of the clue as

926
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,960
to what

927
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,239
is wrong here because you can see we

928
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,240
have oh can i do

929
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,000
is there a way to

930
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,920
can you do

931
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:57,719
um

932
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,280
i guess not

933
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,960
is there no way to specify this as a

934
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,400
vector3 basically like

935
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,400
there's the matrix mode

936
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,960
what am i what am i typing in wrong is

937
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,960
it m

938
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,639
i thought there was a thing for this but

939
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,639
i forget

940
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,519
it's mtx okay okay okay

941
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,519
gotta learn my remedies

942
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,159
or not

943
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:04,719
address expression which this is right

944
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,639
because it's e

945
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,480
although i guess it's an array

946
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,039
so maybe i'm wrong about that do i need

947
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,039
to do this

948
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,199
like why does this say identify or not

949
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,079
found

950
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,078
this isn't that kind of weird

951
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,280
george help us george i don't know

952
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,039
what's wrong here i kind of wanted to do

953
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,519
this but it doesn't look like it works

954
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,519
for some reason

955
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:44,318
although maybe like you can only do

956
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,839
so is it that you can't put a different

957
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:49,519
thing in here like you can put

958
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:51,519
okay it would be cool if you could just

959
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:52,559
put whatever you wanted

960
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,000
you know

961
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:59,119
like it would be cool if you could just

962
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,119
say mtx n by n and then it just did that

963
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:04,559
that would be cool so i guess we can't

964
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,920
do what i wanted to do so never mind

965
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,719
but point being

966
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,720
back to our story

967
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,599
um if we look at these vectors

968
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,599
we

969
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,599
we don't have a story for how the heck

970
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,599
how is this set to one

971
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,000
like how is that possible

972
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,679
because that it's always going to be

973
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,760
zero if it's lurping between these two

974
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,879
things

975
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,880
so how the heck was

976
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,480
like like it must be getting set

977
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,559
somewhere else

978
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,559
right um

979
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,599
i also don't know what the difference is

980
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,358
between p and ground p at this point

981
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,440
so there's a lot of stuff like cleaning

982
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:56,960
up this code is going to be nice because

983
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,960
there's just a ton of stuff that's left

984
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,599
over that none of it's necessary and

985
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,599
just gets in the way

986
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,839
i'm just trying to look and see if

987
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,838
ground p gets mucked with here

988
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,640
i don't see that happening though

989
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,640
by the time i exit this routine

990
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,159
does it change

991
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,159
oh i should have pinned that

992
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,480
like what

993
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:47,519
how did that suddenly happen without us

994
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,519
seeing it happen

995
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,639
right like

996
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,719
that ground p thing is nuts i don't

997
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,838
understand what i'm looking at here

998
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,358
um

999
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,400
oh wait no we're not in the same guy so

1000
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:03,838
that's fine sorry no no here we go

1001
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,358
same thing though

1002
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:08,799
like i do not understand how that got

1003
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:11,598
set to one who set it to one

1004
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,400
we clearly should just set like a

1005
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,480
break point on

1006
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,480
this um

1007
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,280
and see who is actually changing that in

1008
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,240
fact i guess i could even just search

1009
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,240
and see where that's happening

1010
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,280
so this is the problem

1011
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:58,078
this entity p entity this right here

1012
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,079
actually that's what it is

1013
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,318
all right

1014
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,318
so

1015
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,838
so this is just

1016
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,200
total holdover

1017
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,759
right

1018
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:14,759
this is total holdover

1019
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,760
um

1020
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,280
there shouldn't be two of these anymore

1021
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,639
there's no need for it right

1022
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,280
um

1023
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,279
it's totally unnecessary

1024
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,119
i don't even really know what i can't

1025
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,800
remember why we had to have both of

1026
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,800
those things

1027
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,000
previously

1028
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,000
um anyway

1029
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,839
but since this is grid based

1030
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:53,119
we do want to have a ground p

1031
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,838
in a sense we want to have the v2

1032
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,720
like

1033
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,880
this is

1034
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,279
we want the notion that like here's

1035
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,200
where you are in space

1036
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,359
in the plane and then you're floating

1037
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:04,639
this high off of it we do want those

1038
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,318
things to sort of be dealt with

1039
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,838
separately in a sense

1040
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,440
but

1041
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,480
i don't know why we would need to store

1042
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,480
the ground piece separately

1043
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,480
um

1044
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,079
so

1045
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,000
yeah i don't think we even need this

1046
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,000
stuff anymore

1047
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:23,358
i think all this is just to solve

1048
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,358
problems that we just don't have anymore

1049
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,159
so i'm going to go ahead and say i think

1050
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,000
we can just kill this

1051
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,838
i think i think we basically just this

1052
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,079
is just to hold over this so this is

1053
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:37,078
step one is we just get rid of ground p

1054
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,079
entirely

1055
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,358
i just don't think it's necessary

1056
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,318
um

1057
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,078
so

1058
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,079
like you know

1059
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,079
the

1060
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,558
i'm gonna comment this out for now

1061
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,519
yeah so so basically like you can see

1062
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,358
too here like

1063
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,838
one of the reasons that

1064
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,838
okay i kind of get it too

1065
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:39,759
because the thing was hopping we

1066
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,679
probably want didn't know that we could

1067
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,280
just zero what we really need is just a

1068
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,838
way to get

1069
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,760
the ground plane there so we don't

1070
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,679
really care right so

1071
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,920
if you think about how this stuff works

1072
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,799
we can just say look the debug light p

1073
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,800
is this and the z of it is this we don't

1074
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,079
have to actually

1075
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,680
um

1076
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,839
worry anymore

1077
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,558
about that because we know that zero is

1078
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,078
the plane where the people are so i can

1079
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,079
see sort of why we had that because

1080
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,920
otherwise as you hopped around you would

1081
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,480
have been bobbing up and down so we were

1082
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,599
kind of trying to i think keep there you

1083
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,679
know make there be some

1084
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,280
um

1085
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:23,440
we were trying to have there be some

1086
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,880
idea of like a smooth value you followed

1087
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,240
but we really don't care about that

1088
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,440
anymore because we're always in the

1089
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,719
plane now

1090
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,400
right

1091
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,519
so um

1092
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,200
yeah

1093
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,159
so i think we're good

1094
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,598
um of course yeah that

1095
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,279
that's a little bit less good but we'll

1096
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,160
deal with that in a second

1097
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,240
um

1098
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:44,558
so okay so i think we just have to push

1099
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,838
forward on that stuff first because yeah

1100
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,200
that has to get cleaned up because

1101
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,960
that's just going to be a complete

1102
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,118
disaster

1103
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,159
um

1104
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,160
separate from anything else

1105
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,200
um all right so now we're back in

1106
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,558
business and you can see the glove doing

1107
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,439
the thing that the glove is supposed to

1108
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,240
do

1109
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,240
um

1110
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:07,039
exactly as we would expect

1111
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:09,279
uh like i said we have this problem of

1112
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,719
we're going to have to set the

1113
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,680
um

1114
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,039
we're going gonna have to do the

1115
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,399
interpolation slightly differently you

1116
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,558
can see how that like i said the glove

1117
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,318
kind of jumps right

1118
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,800
um and we're gonna have this problem

1119
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:23,039
where uh we need to look at where the

1120
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,880
glove currently is

1121
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,480
and do the interpolation and it's

1122
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,119
probably a slightly different way but i

1123
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,280
think we're okay otherwise i don't it

1124
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,880
should be doing more of an interpolation

1125
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,640
than it is right now that's more jumping

1126
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,318
than i would expect so i think there is

1127
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,799
still something a little bit off about

1128
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,358
that let me just make sure i'm right

1129
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,920
about how that's jumping

1130
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,679
yeah so it should do more interpolation

1131
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,318
than that it's still way too

1132
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,799
fast so i'm not sure

1133
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,960
we have some slight error

1134
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,800
in thinking about how that's happening

1135
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,760
because no matter what i slow this down

1136
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,440
to

1137
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,800
you can see the glove goes there

1138
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,800
immediately right

1139
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,079
so that's a bit strange

1140
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,079
um

1141
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,920
i'm not sure why that it that's not what

1142
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,920
i would have expected

1143
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,760
you like i don't quite see why that lerp

1144
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,599
i mean there's the lerp and we do know

1145
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,559
the t value

1146
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,559
actually

1147
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,480
you know it's got to be animating

1148
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,599
reasonably right

1149
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:55,440
so i'm not sure why we would be we

1150
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,200
wouldn't be seeing some amount of lerp

1151
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,599
there

1152
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:04,759
between the from and the two

1153
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,760
unless the came from is getting set

1154
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:09,039
you know overwritten

1155
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:22,800
and and i don't know

1156
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,800
that one's a bit of a mystery to me

1157
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,640
like i could see that happening if came

1158
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,400
from was getting overwritten with

1159
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,159
occupying again like when we came

1160
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,318
through here but

1161
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,078
it doesn't

1162
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:41,079
make a lot of sense to me why that would

1163
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,079
happen

1164
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:54,959
like

1165
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:03,519
oh some reason we

1166
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,440
forgot to set that to glove so we were

1167
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:06,639
still setting bodies t movement

1168
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,920
separately i was thinking this is

1169
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:10,000
probably something we want so that it

1170
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,800
only can do one move at a time but

1171
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,838
that's sort of a hack we will want to do

1172
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,839
something more than that anyway

1173
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,760
all right that's more what we were

1174
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,838
expecting

1175
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,480
yes

1176
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,440
so now we do have

1177
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,280
that

1178
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,280
that is working correctly

1179
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,280
we now want to do like a bit of an

1180
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,280
offset or something like the problem

1181
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,839
that we have now is that it's right on

1182
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,440
top of the hero exactly

1183
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,119
which is what we want

1184
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,760
um it means the code's working properly

1185
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:47,440
now but we want the glove to float sort

1186
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,640
of to the side of the hero

1187
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,880
and

1188
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,239
so we need this like a notion sort of of

1189
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,079
an offset

1190
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:59,039
right um

1191
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,599
that rotates around

1192
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:05,519
when the hero rotates around

1193
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:08,480
right the glove has to have an offset

1194
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:11,838
relative to the thing that it's going to

1195
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,838
um and that

1196
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,558
like in other words in here where we're

1197
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,480
figuring out where the thing should be

1198
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,480
presumably you want to have

1199
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,480
you want to have something that's like

1200
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,559
plus offset right

1201
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,800
um

1202
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,800
and

1203
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:40,000
[Music]

1204
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:40,000
there's two ways to do that um

1205
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,920
you know one way

1206
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,480
so if you went into

1207
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,280
uh ad player

1208
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,599
and

1209
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,760
you looked at

1210
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,119
this part where the glove gets created

1211
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,319
there's like this glove piece

1212
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,519
right

1213
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:59,440
um

1214
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,599
you could just make the glove piece be

1215
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,039
like offset

1216
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,960
and

1217
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:07,279
you know it's hard to say

1218
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,960
what we want to do there i i don't

1219
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,559
really know but like you know let me

1220
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,199
show you what i'm going to give you a

1221
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,200
for instance

1222
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,358
um

1223
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:19,199
so here's what happens if you give it a

1224
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,558
constant offset right

1225
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,960
so the glove

1226
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,200
is now properly offset from where the

1227
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,798
hero is which is you know what we sort

1228
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:27,598
of wanted

1229
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,318
um

1230
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,160
and we could also give it an up like

1231
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,400
probably wants to be up

1232
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:37,838
you know slightly

1233
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,639
probably not a huge amount but slightly

1234
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:41,119
um

1235
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,118
and ooh

1236
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,240
what the heck did i just do

1237
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,079
i don't know what i just accidentally

1238
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,720
did there so we're gonna undo that and

1239
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:56,400
redo that that way

1240
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:59,519
uh the point is we

1241
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,160
we can offset those and leave that as

1242
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:05,440
just a thing that's in the piece code

1243
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,318
like it's kind of like the peace corps

1244
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,079
right

1245
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,838
uh and we can we can position that

1246
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,880
however we want

1247
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,838
uh the problem with this approach is

1248
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,240
that it's unclear

1249
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:21,519
um what we then do for rotation because

1250
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:24,000
when the player rotates the

1251
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,759
the glove will not

1252
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,798
will not go like we would expect it to

1253
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,359
go to the other side of the body right

1254
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:34,079
so there's different ways we could do

1255
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:36,318
this and i don't know which one we would

1256
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,160
want to do one way

1257
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:40,000
would be to say that those offsets are

1258
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,519
going to be relative to the orientation

1259
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,599
of the person so

1260
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,759
when something changes its orientation

1261
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,798
its piece offsets rotate with it kind of

1262
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,359
like

1263
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,440
a parent-child relationship would be in

1264
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,719
a normal like 3d package

1265
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,159
right

1266
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:55,919
so that's one way

1267
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:57,679
to do it

1268
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,440
another way to do it is just to control

1269
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,679
that manually

1270
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,519
and say that when we push in a different

1271
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:04,960
direction we just set the offset to be a

1272
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,199
different thing

1273
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,199
um

1274
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:16,000
i don't know which of those makes more

1275
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,000
sense uh largely because

1276
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,079
i just don't know how much

1277
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,680
utility

1278
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:25,720
this

1279
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,719
has i assume

1280
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,639
i assume that

1281
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,760
my thinking is that in general we

1282
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,920
probably want to just keep a separate

1283
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,599
offset that's not the way the pieces

1284
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,519
work because the pieces are just ways of

1285
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,798
gluing things together

1286
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:54,880
and we may want that to rotate

1287
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:56,480
but

1288
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,440
we also

1289
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,159
want

1290
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,480
perhaps that to be

1291
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,798
we want things like the glove which

1292
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,358
we're moving around separately as as

1293
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,838
their own movable pieces

1294
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:12,239
we probably want those to also have this

1295
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,239
notion

1296
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:17,199
of where they are in the world

1297
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,200
that's not

1298
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,720
just about where the piece is but also

1299
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:25,039
where the entity is

1300
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:27,838
right because like what's happening now

1301
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:30,239
is the glove as an entity still has its

1302
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:32,078
location at the center of the square and

1303
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:35,279
it's just the piece itself the

1304
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:38,960
renderable piece that's doing the offset

1305
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:43,079
and so i just don't know

1306
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,079
um that's a tough one

1307
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,559
all right here's what i'm going to say

1308
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,519
about that

1309
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,960
that i'm going to push to later

1310
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:17,358
i'm just going to do the move cue stuff

1311
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,480
because that's what we were working on

1312
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:20,960
and

1313
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,400
let's just get the glove punching

1314
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,000
and then we'll address the offset stuff

1315
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,680
separately

1316
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
so it's just going to be kind of on the

1317
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,159
side like that we can see it just fine

1318
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,119
and we know we have to do one of the

1319
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,719
solutions to that problem but just

1320
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:40,640
i guess i just want to be slightly

1321
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:42,719
further down the road uh before i make

1322
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:45,118
that decision for now

1323
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,358
that's just i don't know

1324
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:51,160
that's my feeling on it

1325
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,159
i'm gonna let this guy in

1326
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:05,439
get out of my way

1327
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,280
um

1328
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,720
so i think yeah i think we're okay

1329
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,880
i think i'm just gonna get the glove

1330
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:14,558
punching for now and and i'll think

1331
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,400
about how i want to do that

1332
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,480
as a separate issue that you know we

1333
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,280
need to solve but we'll

1334
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,280
we'll figure it out

1335
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,558
sorry for some reason i decided i wanted

1336
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,559
to go through the dungeon

1337
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,839
i really love the lighting it took us a

1338
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,798
long time to figure out how to do it

1339
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:31,519
well

1340
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:33,119
but

1341
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,119
i gotta say the end result is pretty

1342
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,119
fabulous

1343
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,920
some weird bugs in there with some

1344
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,920
alternating lighting things

1345
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,679
all right

1346
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,558
yeah

1347
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:35,119
miles big c that that was sort of

1348
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,400
what i was worried about right

1349
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,760
like

1350
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,519
like there's nothing wrong with doing

1351
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,640
the fixed offset thing but it just it

1352
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,159
feels like for something with a glove

1353
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:43,358
that's like flying around as its own

1354
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,358
entity

1355
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:47,119
it feels like you need a more of a thing

1356
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:50,078
that's like

1357
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,240
it's just a there's an offset that says

1358
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,318
where this entity wants to be relative

1359
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:55,279
to the center of the square

1360
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:58,239
not

1361
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,000
this that the entity is quote unquote at

1362
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,919
the center of the square and just this

1363
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,880
renderable piece that is the whole

1364
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:07,760
entity right is offset it just feels

1365
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,358
like that'll get ugly as we go so it

1366
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,119
doesn't feel right

1367
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,199
um and that's why i didn't really just

1368
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,640
want to use that as an i didn't want to

1369
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,318
automatically say that was how we were

1370
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:19,598
going to do it because it doesn't

1371
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:21,440
i'm not thrilled about it right

1372
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,519
so that's you know that was just my

1373
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,760
thinking but anyway so assuming that we

1374
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,000
have the move q thing

1375
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,480
um i guess what i'd like to do is say

1376
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,400
okay if the entity t movement is greater

1377
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,199
than one that means you've like finished

1378
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:40,000
the movement that you were on

1379
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:40,000
um and if that's the case then i

1380
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,839
i want to like pop something off of the

1381
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,838
move cube right so if we've got a move

1382
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:49,279
queue

1383
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,119
i

1384
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,359
this code right

1385
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,160
i want to like

1386
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:59,480
like move through the move queue

1387
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,480
quote unquote

1388
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:08,639
um

1389
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,839
and i guess

1390
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,920
technically this is not gonna be like a

1391
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,920
fifo

1392
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,240
it's gonna be more just a stack that

1393
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,920
gets cleared entirely because you can

1394
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,078
queue up some moves but then you can't

1395
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,680
do anything until they complete

1396
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,640
if you do that

1397
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,558
um so really your only option is ever is

1398
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,400
cancel right

1399
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:48,319
um

1400
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:50,639
so i think we have a move q count and a

1401
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:53,519
move q index really

1402
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:58,519
and so the move q index like goes up to

1403
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:58,519
the move q count and then completes

1404
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:02,639
so i think what we would do here is say

1405
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:06,079
okay if

1406
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:09,038
if the entity t movement is one we pull

1407
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:11,039
something off right if entity t movement

1408
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,400
equals one

1409
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,440
um

1410
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,440
we could even do this

1411
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,480
um

1412
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:24,880
we would say okay

1413
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,719
if there's a move queue

1414
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,760
else right

1415
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:33,038
so if there's a move queue if the entity

1416
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,720
move q index is less than the entity

1417
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,880
move oops

1418
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,038
and the

1419
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,440
move q count

1420
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,920
um then that means we want to like

1421
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,480
process this move cue index and then

1422
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,280
increment it right so we would do

1423
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,280
something like this

1424
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:55,038
right

1425
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:59,480
and when we pull this entry off of the

1426
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,480
move queue whatever it is

1427
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,720
we grab this and we try to

1428
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,079
do it

1429
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:17,598
whatever it is

1430
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,359
that's on there

1431
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,720
right

1432
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:22,639
so

1433
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,159
we have one of these

1434
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:25,920
the delta is really the thing we're

1435
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,759
looking for

1436
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,760
so we would say

1437
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,220
on the delta

1438
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,300
um

1439
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:33,299
[Music]

1440
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:40,798
we would look to see whether we can get

1441
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:42,639
a traversible

1442
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:43,440
in that direction

1443
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:45,679
so

1444
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,000
in the same way that we've got and again

1445
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:48,838
all this code is terrible now and needs

1446
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,559
to be

1447
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:55,199
removed um because we don't you know

1448
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,280
since we settled on grid

1449
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,879
most of this code is just garbage with

1450
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,599
none of it's necessary you could just

1451
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,358
have an actual grid right

1452
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,599
um and it would simplify all of these

1453
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,798
calls and you wouldn't need to do nearly

1454
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,119
as much work

1455
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:10,159
so that's coming at some point

1456
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,680
but

1457
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,480
you know

1458
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:16,558
uh we have to do set aside a day to

1459
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,719
basically say like okay

1460
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,359
wipe all this clean and just do

1461
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:21,358
just a grid

1462
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:27,598
so uh what i was trying to say though is

1463
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:30,838
when we're doing the move cue stuff

1464
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,400
when we pull out the delta we would say

1465
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:34,639
okay

1466
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,440
this entity is at a particular location

1467
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:39,838
and it wants to move in a particular

1468
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,159
delta right

1469
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:42,159
and

1470
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,838
this is the delta it's going to use

1471
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,959
i think we have a function that works

1472
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:54,959
like this yeah

1473
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:03,679
basically no move in z just moving in

1474
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,200
x and y

1475
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,759
um and so then what we're going to do is

1476
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,118
we get the closest traversable to see

1477
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,240
uh

1478
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,240
where this target is

1479
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,400
um

1480
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:20,798
and assuming that we actually get it

1481
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,838
uh then we would

1482
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:25,119
we would move the person to that

1483
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:25,360
right

1484
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,798
i

1485
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,400
[Music]

1486
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:30,719
otherwise i don't know what we're gonna

1487
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,000
do so if there's nowhere to move i guess

1488
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,919
we just

1489
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,699
keep

1490
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,318
going

1491
01:07:34,699 --> 01:07:39,519
[Music]

1492
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:41,440
so we would probably let it wrap like

1493
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,199
we would

1494
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,119
we always do this

1495
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,439
right but if we don't find it reversible

1496
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,200
then we just skip to the next move

1497
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,838
probably

1498
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:53,439
so on the next frame we'll try again and

1499
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,679
move in a different i don't know oh

1500
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,000
that's going to be a gameplay decision

1501
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,759
that when we

1502
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,239
once we start thinking about that i will

1503
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,160
presumably have an opinion i have no

1504
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:07,279
opinion now

1505
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:09,038
so the traversable reference that we got

1506
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,280
back for this

1507
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,200
is going to be the so the entity is

1508
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,640
going to have it came from that equals

1509
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,639
it's it's occupying

1510
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,000
uh and it's going to have an occupying

1511
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,359
that is now

1512
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,359
whatever this traversal is

1513
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:35,600
um

1514
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:40,640
so now we have to figure out how to

1515
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,640
actually make this go uh for starters

1516
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:47,759
i guess

1517
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:49,600
maybe we should draw these so so i'm

1518
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,479
just thinking out loud here

1519
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,120
so let's suppose that somebody has a

1520
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:57,439
move q count

1521
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,960
we should draw that

1522
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:04,439
i think

1523
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:04,439
so like probably something like this

1524
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,119
where we say let's let's go through all

1525
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,199
of the things

1526
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:23,198
on here

1527
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,399
um

1528
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:28,318
and

1529
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:31,198
let's draw like boxes at the locations

1530
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,199
where they are

1531
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,600
um

1532
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,238
i guess

1533
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,238
not really sure

1534
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:47,238
um

1535
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,800
but like let's suppose we did something

1536
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,799
like this

1537
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:16,800
so we want to push a volume outline

1538
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:18,000
um i'm just going to make like a white

1539
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,440
uh

1540
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,520
cube

1541
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,678
that just goes

1542
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,920
wherever the thing said that the hop

1543
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,920
would be so basically this code

1544
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:34,800
right

1545
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:34,799
um so loop over all of these

1546
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,198
i don't know what radius it should be

1547
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:44,919
um

1548
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:44,919
probably pretty small

1549
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:57,600
so then i just so i can see like if any

1550
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,600
of this stuff gets pushed on like like

1551
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,239
i'm not seeing anything there so i don't

1552
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:04,159
actually know if this actually works

1553
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:05,279
so let me set some break points and see

1554
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:07,039
but you know it could be that the

1555
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:08,479
drawing code doesn't work either right

1556
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:10,960
we're throwing all this stuff in there

1557
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:13,039
who knows

1558
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,800
i also think probably we would need to

1559
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,519
push it upward slightly so it should

1560
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,039
probably be entity p plus that

1561
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,560
v3

1562
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:23,279
um

1563
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:24,480
this should probably be like half up as

1564
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,559
well

1565
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,479
just because otherwise we might not see

1566
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,239
it right

1567
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,319
might be embedded in the ground

1568
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:33,839
but uh so let's see if we can set a

1569
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:34,299
breakpoint now to see what happens in

1570
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,679
the brain

1571
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:38,840
[Music]

1572
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:42,560
like are we actually ever setting this

1573
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,560
so that would happen

1574
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:47,439
here

1575
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:56,639
so i don't know the glove stats probably

1576
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,480
prohibit this actually

1577
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,199
so we probably have to start actually

1578
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,198
doing quote-unquote game design

1579
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,039
in add player when we create this glove

1580
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:07,039
the glove is going to have to have stats

1581
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:08,960
for that right because if it doesn't

1582
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:11,119
then you can't move it at all

1583
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,679
so the glove stats have to have a max

1584
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:15,198
move group count

1585
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,440
of something

1586
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:19,839
right and we'll set that to one

1587
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:19,839
for now

1588
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:25,439
um furthermore when the glove gets reset

1589
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:27,039
and again all this code is probably

1590
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,119
going to come into reusable like

1591
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,519
functions like you know push move group

1592
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:34,519
reset move group that sort of thing

1593
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,520
um

1594
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,760
the move q index is also going to have

1595
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,480
to go back down to zero so so really

1596
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,400
this is wrong

1597
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:51,599
this stuff probably looks more

1598
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:53,198
uh like this

1599
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,440
this is wrong like we got to kind of

1600
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:57,599
reset how this stuff is working

1601
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:03,079
um so here it's going to be more like

1602
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:03,079
okay if the glove move uh

1603
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:10,319
q index

1604
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:10,319
is equal to the glove

1605
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,640
if the move q index is equal to the

1606
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,158
glove move group count meaning we've

1607
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,679
finished

1608
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:22,879
right

1609
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,679
then

1610
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,679
you can do this

1611
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,320
and reset

1612
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:31,399
otherwise

1613
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,359
i think actually when i said that code

1614
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,399
was wrong i don't think it is i think

1615
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,399
that code is still correct

1616
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,800
all

1617
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,920
right i'm not getting anything there so

1618
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,960
i still have set the breakpoint because

1619
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,960
it's not actually doing anything

1620
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,479
we do have this this will pass now

1621
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:59,960
that

1622
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,959
should be fine

1623
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:05,599
we have an attack pattern

1624
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,158
so that should be fine so i do want to

1625
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,960
set a breakdown because i don't see any

1626
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,079
glaring errors

1627
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,198
at the moment

1628
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,198
so let's set a breakpoint there

1629
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:37,079
and just walk through it once

1630
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:37,079
let's see what the heck it's doing

1631
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:49,519
okay

1632
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:50,960
so uh first things first what are the

1633
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,400
glove stats i assume we set them

1634
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,399
correctly

1635
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:55,399
what

1636
01:14:56,319 --> 01:14:59,519
did i not set that

1637
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,840
you guys realized did we do something

1638
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,840
dumb we did

1639
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,279
so

1640
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,359
yeah so uh this is we're now gonna have

1641
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,359
to start doing real game design um so we

1642
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:22,799
have the base stats

1643
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:24,799
those are the actual ones we set the

1644
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,560
stats and the static accumulation stuff

1645
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,000
that we're going to have to actually

1646
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,280
start dealing with now because we now

1647
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,560
have real stats and we have to start

1648
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:32,639
thinking about like how modifiers

1649
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,039
affects that's all that stuff

1650
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,840
we'll get there eventually

1651
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,840
let's try this one more time

1652
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,280
yeah so we're gonna have to go get that

1653
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,319
stuff working now

1654
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:57,279
all right so we have base stats

1655
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:57,279
and we have like

1656
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,319
uh we have now

1657
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,520
we're gonna have to do like actual

1658
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:10,519
unpacking

1659
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,520
right

1660
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,679
insobot is such a good

1661
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:25,679
bot

1662
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,800
everybody loves instabot

1663
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:38,640
it answers all the questions

1664
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:40,879
i feel like insofar as needs to like

1665
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,880
uh

1666
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,079
like

1667
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:49,840
like use like gpt3 now or something and

1668
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:51,760
have like insobot just do everything

1669
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,560
like insobot will just take take over a

1670
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,560
chat entirely

1671
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:59,920
it'll just do the stream by itself

1672
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,920
um

1673
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,920
so

1674
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,719
so we have this

1675
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,560
uh advanced entity stats thing

1676
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,520
and i think

1677
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,600
maybe the right thing to do here is that

1678
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,560
this was supposed to acquire the base

1679
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,480
stats when it starts

1680
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,039
i think

1681
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:26,559
um and we weren't doing that that might

1682
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,399
be the way that

1683
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,000
that works i don't know again this is

1684
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:31,359
now getting into game design territory

1685
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,359
so

1686
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:35,039
i don't know how we want to do that

1687
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,960
stuff exactly because i'm not sure like

1688
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:38,640
what we want to be able to do here but

1689
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,359
that was the problem is that the stats

1690
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,840
were never set right

1691
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:44,960
okay so

1692
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,000
uh now we

1693
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:50,880
okay so there are boxes now being drawn

1694
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,679
um they're not particularly good boxes

1695
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,079
uh

1696
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,480
so so maybe we need to like fix that a

1697
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:56,479
little bit

1698
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,840
um

1699
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,479
so i'm not sure exactly how we would

1700
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,600
draw these

1701
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:17,439
because

1702
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,560
they're relative to where you started

1703
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,000
and we don't really know where you

1704
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,000
started like that's not something that

1705
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
actually got saved

1706
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
um

1707
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:35,519
we could however do a traversable like

1708
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,520
we could get like traversable

1709
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,800
uh

1710
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,439
so what we could do here is do the same

1711
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,359
thing we do in animation

1712
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,639
right we could say like look just give

1713
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,559
us

1714
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,000
give us the base that you were moving

1715
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,000
from

1716
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,119
well or i guess moving two is now the

1717
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,479
correct one because we're showing the

1718
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:08,079
future things

1719
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:11,359
so we could do something where we say

1720
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:11,359
all right the target p

1721
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:18,639
um is actually at your occupying

1722
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,559
location then plus the delta

1723
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,840
that's probably a more stable way to

1724
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,840
draw it right

1725
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,760
might still be wrong but

1726
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,760
you know

1727
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:44,639
yeah so that worked pretty well actually

1728
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,439
um

1729
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,320
so

1730
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:48,319
uh

1731
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:51,279
we now need to get the reset part of

1732
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:53,439
things working so the reset part

1733
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:56,639
is a little

1734
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:59,639
harder so when this happens

1735
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,640
um

1736
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,960
i feel like this case should have

1737
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:08,959
occurred

1738
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:13,079
but it didn't

1739
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:33,839
so i'm not sure why we didn't

1740
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:33,839
return to where the

1741
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,319
body was

1742
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:50,760
that's a bit of a puzzler

1743
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:04,359
hmm

1744
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,480
yeah technic beam i want to know when in

1745
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:21,960
sabah will become sentient as well but i

1746
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,959
don't know when

1747
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,840
ah

1748
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,600
all right um

1749
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:50,718
so let's just take a look at why that's

1750
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,400
not returning because it looks like it's

1751
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,239
working properly also i assume it

1752
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:55,759
rotates properly

1753
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:57,119
yeah

1754
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,079
so really we just want to know why our

1755
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,760
glove didn't return and i have no idea

1756
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,840
um so that's

1757
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,679
one we got to take a look at so why

1758
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,520
wouldn't we hit that case we should have

1759
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:09,600
the nadt movement

1760
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,920
gets advanced every frame when it gets

1761
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,320
to one it will do this case until the

1762
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,279
moveq index equals the move count

1763
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:19,359
and then it won't it'll just clamp

1764
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:21,119
um so we should

1765
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:23,439
be able to hit here where we do move q

1766
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:26,319
index equals move group count

1767
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:26,319
oh no

1768
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,000
typo

1769
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,079
should probably make those more distinct

1770
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,079
looking

1771
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:37,920
so we're tracking two different

1772
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:37,920
quantities there

1773
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,279
good

1774
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:01,600
um so the other thing we can test too is

1775
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:05,880
if i change the stats of the glove to

1776
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,880
allow a second one

1777
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:16,559
i should now also be able to like chain

1778
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:20,280
these right so if i do like

1779
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,280
that and then that

1780
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,480
so that's a little odd

1781
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,039
so when i cue both of those up it

1782
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:36,158
doesn't

1783
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:40,158
hm

1784
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:42,879
it still used the old facing direction

1785
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:46,920
to cue them

1786
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,920
the secondary one

1787
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,600
why would that be

1788
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,400
can somebody please

1789
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,760
explain that behavior

1790
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:13,920
so this somehow is using the wrong

1791
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,360
attack pattern

1792
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,840
attack

1793
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:17,839
x and y

1794
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,800
unless i'm just misunderstanding what

1795
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,800
happened uh

1796
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,520
so that's peculiar

1797
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:06,879
what book are you guys talking about

1798
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,320
something written in 1977

1799
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:25,199
oh no okay

1800
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:27,840
i see what's happening

1801
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:27,839
so

1802
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:38,000
that's the problem is this attack

1803
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:39,198
it's we wanted a went down so it's it's

1804
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,158
queuing up

1805
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:42,158
i see okay

1806
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:48,439
can we do a went down on these or do we

1807
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,439
not have that

1808
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:21,439
the adolescence of p1 i've never heard

1809
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,199
of that book

1810
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:26,799
not surprising i don't read any science

1811
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,799
fiction so why would i have but

1812
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,079
so we don't have any kind of a went down

1813
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:39,279
kind of a call

1814
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:43,480
that's kind of weird because we have the

1815
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:43,479
like half transition count thing

1816
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:00,559
that just seems kind of weird

1817
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:03,519
doesn't it

1818
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:05,679
shouldn't we have a like

1819
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,880
like a thing to say that something

1820
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,679
went down

1821
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,679
as opposed to

1822
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:14,919
just being held down

1823
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,120
well anyway

1824
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,159
so we'll want to do something a little

1825
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:36,158
bit fancier here

1826
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,119
right

1827
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:46,879
because we probably want to

1828
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:49,679
do the half transition counts like

1829
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,920
if you tap multiple times on a single

1830
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,560
frame somehow like within a 60th of a

1831
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:58,239
second if that's even possible on usb

1832
01:27:54,560 --> 01:28:01,239
um you would still want to queue them up

1833
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,238
right

1834
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:15,840
so you can see now like we're able to

1835
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,840
cue movements up however we want

1836
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,639
game design wise we're going to have to

1837
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:27,359
make a bunch of decisions about like how

1838
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,520
fast this stuff should be

1839
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:31,839
how fast the return should be

1840
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,600
i'm guessing the punch should be

1841
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,360
considerably faster than that well

1842
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,199
although you know who the who the heck

1843
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:38,960
knows right it's probably going to be

1844
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:41,279
more like some gloves are really fast

1845
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,800
and some gloves are really slow

1846
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:45,439
and you have to deal with it right i

1847
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,679
mean that's probably the right thing

1848
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:47,678
um

1849
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:55,399
right

1850
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,399
so that's tough i don't know

1851
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:04,198
hmm

1852
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:18,319
yeah i don't know

1853
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:20,158
anyway um so i think that's

1854
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:21,920
basically what i wanted though that

1855
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:25,679
seems like that works now

1856
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:27,600
and that's roughly correct uh

1857
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,840
the question now is going to become like

1858
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,520
how do we want to do

1859
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,800
collision

1860
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,280
like what's the definition of a

1861
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,039
collision in our system

1862
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,719
and since it's grid based i think

1863
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,000
roughly the definition of collision is

1864
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,079
going to be like

1865
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,520
if you would be occupying the same

1866
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:47,519
square then you have collided and you

1867
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:49,199
take the action that you would take

1868
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,199
right

1869
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:52,198
um

1870
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:08,238
yeah i i mean

1871
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:15,359
i think at this point that is roughly

1872
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,359
what i want like like

1873
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,439
you know it would start out much simpler

1874
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:22,399
than this right so the initial way you

1875
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:26,079
would do the initial thing you would get

1876
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:26,079
for your for gloves

1877
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,960
that attack pattern

1878
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:33,678
would only just be like one thing right

1879
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,560
so the initial one would not look like

1880
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,760
this

1881
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,080
it would look

1882
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,079
you know

1883
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:42,678
like this

1884
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:59,599
right so the initial one would look like

1885
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:01,839
that

1886
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,719
so it's just you punch out right it's

1887
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:06,159
it's the simplest dumbest possible punch

1888
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:07,279
right

1889
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:09,198
um

1890
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:11,519
and we probably want the speed to be

1891
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:13,678
significantly higher so in there like

1892
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,120
the the t values

1893
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:18,639
need to be

1894
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:18,639
set to something sensible

1895
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:24,960
so like if you look at how the entities

1896
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:26,960
work currently the t values should be

1897
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,399
driven in here

1898
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,560
right like

1899
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,559
for each time you move you should be

1900
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,480
setting a t value

1901
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,800
for the move

1902
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:38,319
right now it's not that way and

1903
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,320
everything's in lockstep which is not

1904
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:42,880
really what you want it would make sense

1905
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:43,679
for an a strategy game but for an action

1906
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,319
game

1907
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:48,639
it doesn't make any sense

1908
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:51,840
um

1909
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,840
so i do think like

1910
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:58,238
you know probably

1911
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,920
what we want in here is when we set the

1912
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:01,359
movement

1913
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,399
stuff

1914
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:05,839
um

1915
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:05,839
like here you would do

1916
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,400
something like this

1917
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,359
you know

1918
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:15,359
um

1919
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,000
and probably like that animation setting

1920
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,440
thing would would be like we probably

1921
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,039
want that to be

1922
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:34,000
you know

1923
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:35,760
an actual function you call

1924
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
just to start making this a little bit

1925
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,000
more sane

1926
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:50,199
remember what this thing is called the

1927
01:32:45,279 --> 01:32:50,198
like it's an animation type or something

1928
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:05,920
so you know you would say like okay the

1929
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,600
dt for this entity

1930
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:12,399
gets set and the animation for this

1931
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,440
entity gets set at the same time

1932
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:16,079
so

1933
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:17,919
when you do animation equals you're also

1934
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:19,679
expected to basically be saying like

1935
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,000
what's the speed

1936
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:26,158
uh the t movement on that i guess we'll

1937
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,158
just say gets set automatically as well

1938
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,119
right

1939
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:38,158
something like

1940
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,159
that um

1941
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,079
and then from then on we just say like

1942
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,599
yeah you're always going to call this to

1943
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:48,600
set the animation and you're expected to

1944
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,600
provide

1945
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,039
like here

1946
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:07,920
that's now just like we're going to set

1947
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,158
the animation

1948
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,920
uh and again this is just me like slowly

1949
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:14,319
deciding like how this code should look

1950
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,960
and as we know more

1951
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:19,198
um about how we want the code to look we

1952
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,840
want to start cleaning it up right like

1953
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:23,678
because once we know what we're doing

1954
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,719
we want to make things a little bit more

1955
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:28,960
systemic so that we don't have errors

1956
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:31,359
we just want to make things where if you

1957
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,439
know you always do

1958
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:34,719
x and y at the same time then you want

1959
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:36,559
something that just like does that

1960
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:40,000
automatically so that everyone who's

1961
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:42,560
doing it can't accidentally forget right

1962
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
to do one or the other

1963
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,320
so that's really all i'm doing here is

1964
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,880
just starting to aggregate slowly like

1965
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:51,039
pull these things up together

1966
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:53,359
to put them into

1967
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:55,600
what i think is roughly how they should

1968
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:55,599
look

1969
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:00,679
that's all

1970
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:17,840
uh that is okay so

1971
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,400
so this i'm not gonna touch for now

1972
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:23,520
though um because the the floating head

1973
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:24,638
things are we we just haven't really

1974
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,840
implemented

1975
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:29,920
um

1976
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,679
so they're just gonna stay

1977
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,158
kind of weirdly nerfed i guess this one

1978
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,158
would work

1979
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,960
i don't know what a brain monster is

1980
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,560
even to be completely honest with you

1981
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,079
um i'm not sure what's a familiar i

1982
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,239
don't even know which these things are

1983
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,920
anymore they were just test things that

1984
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:51,359
kind of got pulled

1985
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,840
sort of slowly

1986
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:57,198
uh through the code base as we

1987
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,199
like changed other things and we're

1988
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:00,399
working on other things

1989
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:01,678
they

1990
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:03,439
you know

1991
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,840
um

1992
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:08,638
they kind of got like

1993
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:11,199
yeah set in this kind of weird way so

1994
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:16,239
i kind of feel like this stuff probably

1995
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:16,238
also is going to end up being

1996
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,880
like shouldn't this part be

1997
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,639
in the

1998
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,400
non-stop

1999
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,239
portion because something that's in the

2000
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,238
middle of animating that gets paged out

2001
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:32,479
of this set it's like we don't

2002
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:35,678
we probably don't pick up that animation

2003
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:38,479
we probably reset at that point right

2004
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:41,199
so it would be a little weird

2005
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,198
i would think

2006
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,039
but i don't know

2007
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,118
uh so that all looks fine for now like

2008
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:04,319
those guys are hopping around and it's

2009
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:08,079
all fine

2010
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:09,759
um so now inside the actual entity code

2011
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:14,079
let's see if we break anything by

2012
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:16,560
switching to the new dt that's there

2013
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:18,079
so instead of this that's just like four

2014
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:19,679
which was just like some hard-coded

2015
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:21,519
thing which you know we just said like

2016
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:24,158
that's what it will be for now

2017
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:26,639
um we're gonna set it to be like

2018
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:28,158
parameterized per entity so the entity

2019
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:29,440
itself just says like here's what i

2020
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:30,238
think

2021
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:34,399
um

2022
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:36,718
my animation update rate should be

2023
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:36,719
um

2024
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,719
okay

2025
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,239
so

2026
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,158
uh

2027
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:43,839
all the hopping people are working now

2028
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:45,039
and so now we just need to go to the

2029
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,800
glove

2030
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,479
and when we set the animation for the

2031
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,000
glove we set it to something and that

2032
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:53,759
would allow us to set it to be a

2033
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,840
particular speed or whatever right

2034
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,800
um

2035
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:00,039
that

2036
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,039
would be

2037
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,639
so

2038
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:44,719
so really i'm not sure

2039
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:45,599
where and or how

2040
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:49,800
we

2041
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,800
want to set this

2042
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,840
good

2043
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,719
uh

2044
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:34,719
this part is

2045
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:34,719
a little more confusing so

2046
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:42,158
like if an entity's movement rate is set

2047
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,560
to zero then it will never advance to

2048
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:46,319
the next thing which seems bad and maybe

2049
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,159
we want us to special case that like

2050
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:50,960
zero just means you immediately switch

2051
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:50,960
to the next one

2052
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:55,840
i'm not sure

2053
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:09,519
i'm not sure what that should do

2054
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:12,519
that's that's a difficult call

2055
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,520
um

2056
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:45,519
yeah hmm

2057
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:48,000
i say so i'm not sure how i want to deal

2058
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,840
with that i i'm guessing that we want

2059
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,399
something like

2060
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:54,319
and i don't know i'm just just vaguely

2061
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,479
guessing here i'm guessing we want

2062
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:59,118
something like when you go to process an

2063
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:00,238
update for an entity if the if the dt

2064
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:02,319
movement

2065
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:06,158
is actually zero then it just sets t

2066
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:07,198
movement to be one exactly

2067
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:08,799
right

2068
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:13,118
so like

2069
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:14,320
you know if nd dt movement equals zero

2070
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:15,599
or

2071
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:16,880
you finished

2072
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,440
either one

2073
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,199
right um and i don't know how i want to

2074
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,198
deal with that i'm just i just haven't

2075
01:41:21,198 --> 01:41:25,359
really thought about it much right we'll

2076
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:25,359
see

2077
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:29,520
but it's probably something like that

2078
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:30,479
right

2079
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:33,840
so

2080
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:35,279
while we're doing punches here right uh

2081
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,800
like i was saying you probably want the

2082
01:41:35,279 --> 01:41:39,118
speed

2083
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:41,600
uh for this to be

2084
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:43,839
different than it is at the moment

2085
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,840
um

2086
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,039
so i don't know what the speed wants to

2087
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:51,279
be it's but it's probably faster than

2088
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:53,679
hopping right

2089
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:53,679
um

2090
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:01,198
so like that's probably more like what

2091
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:03,440
you would normally expect

2092
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,439
um

2093
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:14,679
how do you get how am i getting three up

2094
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:14,678
up three

2095
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,199
that's a bug

2096
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:42,158
anyway

2097
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:43,279
all right so i think that's good enough

2098
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:45,279
for now

2099
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:47,599
uh with the attack pattern speed yes the

2100
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:48,559
attack pattern does define the speed so

2101
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,320
basically

2102
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:53,600
uh

2103
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:56,399
you can see that um

2104
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,119
we've got it here and we've got it here

2105
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:00,799
so

2106
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:01,679
we that is what will happen eventually

2107
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,600
so

2108
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:05,440
uh

2109
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:09,560
in the code

2110
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:09,559
in this part of the code

2111
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:15,630
[Music]

2112
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:26,880
so this part right here

2113
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:29,359
when it does this it will do you know

2114
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,359
it would do

2115
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,239
a set

2116
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:33,519
for

2117
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:35,279
the

2118
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,880
the dt movement

2119
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:39,439
right

2120
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,639
uh i did not do that yet because i mean

2121
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:42,158
i guess i could do it now because i

2122
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:44,319
don't know that these are set properly

2123
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:47,359
yet they might be

2124
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:47,359
um but i think

2125
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,399
like

2126
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:55,400
the glove

2127
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,399
so

2128
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:13,840
so yeah we have to go set the glove

2129
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:15,359
stats but we can do we'll just do that

2130
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,360
and that's fine

2131
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:19,439
so like if we set this now it won't work

2132
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:20,799
is my point um but but we can just go

2133
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,638
set the gloves that's not hard and

2134
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,719
that's all we would really need

2135
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:27,440
so for the move we could set the speed

2136
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:30,158
here right to and and now we just need

2137
01:44:27,439 --> 01:44:31,519
to make sure we actually go set it uh in

2138
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:34,000
the glove stats otherwise it won't do

2139
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,280
anything

2140
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,840
but we can definitely do that what we

2141
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:39,840
would need to do here is say okay the

2142
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:43,759
base stats for the glove when we set the

2143
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:45,839
max move count

2144
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,960
we would need to set the base stats for

2145
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,639
the other

2146
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,880
things so

2147
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,880
the

2148
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:57,519
the move cue like

2149
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:57,519
or move square a b and c

2150
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:05,520
we need to set these to something right

2151
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,519
and who knows what they should be

2152
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:18,639
um

2153
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,639
but now we should in theory if we wanted

2154
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:23,118
to if we switch back to that sort of

2155
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:25,118
other test one where we say like oh the

2156
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:27,359
attack pattern is is going to be this

2157
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:27,359
now

2158
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,639
um

2159
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:32,800
because there's a b and c we could now

2160
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:34,159
go to the glove and

2161
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,719
set it so that like one of those is

2162
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:37,920
really slow like like the in between one

2163
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:43,319
is very slow

2164
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:43,319
so it goes like slow fast slow fast

2165
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,719
right

2166
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:06,079
so again uh

2167
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:08,079
not a lot of interesting stuff there

2168
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:10,158
just sort of getting the basics down so

2169
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:10,880
we can start to work on

2170
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:13,359
the

2171
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:15,359
feelings the feel it feels of the

2172
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:16,960
gameplay uh

2173
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:19,439
which will acquire us like doing a bunch

2174
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:22,960
of tuning code here

2175
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:22,960
um if that makes sense

2176
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:27,920
uh was pressed okay thank you yeah we'll

2177
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,760
we'll deal with that stuff a little bit

2178
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,880
later

2179
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,119
all right i think that's i'm going to

2180
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,800
call it for today that's fine we're

2181
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:36,238
we're more or less where we need to be

2182
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:39,840
so that's good

2183
01:46:36,238 --> 01:46:41,678
um i will be back here next weekend to

2184
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:44,239
probably we'll do like

2185
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:46,239
try to do damage next

2186
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:48,079
and then we'll maybe collapse down to

2187
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:49,919
grid which is a big change we have to

2188
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:51,600
make and i think we'll just simplify

2189
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,039
everything so we'll do that

2190
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,079
so we can pull out a lot of this code

2191
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:55,039
because there's just too much code in

2192
01:46:54,079 --> 01:46:56,399
there right now that doesn't really do

2193
01:46:55,039 --> 01:47:00,560
anything

2194
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:02,799
um it's just there to support like

2195
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,960
not being on a grid

2196
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,760
you know

2197
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,039
uh all right so that's it

2198
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,280
i'm gonna look and see i don't know if

2199
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:13,760
john's still streaming he's probably not

2200
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:17,359
um but if he is

2201
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,360
we will go there for sure

2202
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,439
um so give me one second to

2203
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:24,800
see but uh yeah i guess i'll stop

2204
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:26,399
recording first so thanks everyone for

2205
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,159
joining me and i will see you next

2206
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:29,839
weekend

2207
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:32,638
and and soon you'll be sent to jonathan

2208
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,639
blue
