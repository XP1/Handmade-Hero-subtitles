1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,338
start recording hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:08,099
welcome to handmade Hero show recode a

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,870
complete game live on stream we are in

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,530
the middle of trying to figure out how

5
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:17,939
our entities get sort of handled as

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:18,839
groups when necessary and yeah we sort

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,020
of started on that a little bit

8
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,759
yesterday but I thought about it after

9
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:25,980
having started down a certain path

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,750
yesterday and I was thinking I kind of

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:36,469
thought of a different idea that I

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:40,079
hadn't considered and I wasn't sure

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:43,679
exactly what I do and don't want to do

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,000
in terms of trying stuff out there so I

15
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,250
wanted to briefly go over kind of what

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,320
my thinking was and why I was thinking

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,520
it with you so that you'll know where

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,378
I'm coming from because I think I may

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:58,890
reverse course slightly from what we did

20
00:00:52,378 --> 00:01:01,828
yesterday okay so here's the essential

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,689
problem that we have that is that let's

22
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,700
say that we have two entities such as

23
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:09,269
with our hero where we've got kind of

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,710
the you know the torso piece or I guess

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,959
right now we're kind of cut we've been

26
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:15,780
calling that the body and then we've got

27
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,609
the head and these are actually separate

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,259
entities and in theory during parts of

29
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,790
the game they may even detach if you

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,599
have like some kind of magic spell or

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,400
something who knows right so they're

32
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,408
capable of acting separately but they're

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,960
also capable of acting together and this

34
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,640
is like a case that I want to start

35
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,589
working out a little bit more to try and

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,790
make sure that it's handled cleanly

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,189
because I think we're going to need this

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,618
in more cases as well and so one of the

39
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:44,758
examples that I think is worth noting

40
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:47,549
for for this right is let's say we

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,310
wanted a snake like boss monster or just

42
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,079
not even boss monster but just a monster

43
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:56,280
and you know maybe that thing kind of

44
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,559
looks you know like a little like snaky

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,629
sort of thing where it's got sort of a

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
headpiece you know with like antennae or

47
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:04,828
whatever and then little you know body

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
pieces here that that it kind of has

49
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:08,758
maybe I don't know if they've got legs

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,459
or what's going on and it can occupy you

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,889
know many squares right and when the

52
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:19,920
headpiece moves you know the body pieces

53
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:21,119
I move with it right and obviously you

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,009
know you'd want to make it so that if

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
you attack and kill this piece then it

56
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,989
becomes sort of severed but maybe like

57
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,179
this part still walks around and this

58
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,860
part does too so it's like it you know

59
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,840
it breaks into two pieces and then keeps

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,320
moving right and so you know we I feel

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,000
like we're gonna have multiple different

62
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,489
places where this sort of thing comes in

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,919
yet another example might be you know

64
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,319
let's suppose that I've got some enemy

65
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,909
creature like boss monster kind of a

66
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,269
thing that's like you know some piece

67
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,669
that's sitting across a couple squares

68
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,890
or whatever but then it also has you

69
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:01,009
know like little like arm things that

70
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:04,379
come out to try and get you or whatever

71
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:05,909
and maybe those are you know somehow

72
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,620
attached or maybe it's got a little

73
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,879
floating piece that goes around with it

74
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,090
that like kind of circles it or whatever

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,739
and again like you know in a lot of

76
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,930
these cases you sort of end up in this

77
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,430
situation where the it's very similar to

78
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,790
the way the entity system was sort of

79
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,530
does

80
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:21,599
I was conceptualizing having that work

81
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,280
in terms of just having sort of this

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,590
collection of properties and things

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,150
without having to really define what it

84
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,370
is so that it can sort of amorphous lee

85
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,980
shift between different sort of ways of

86
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,230
being the same has started true for

87
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,229
these things like you know if there's

88
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:38,369
two or three arms to the guy and a body

89
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,319
or whatever then they should be

90
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,209
controlled as such if one of the arms

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,769
gets detached and needs to go off and be

92
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,120
a separate entity for some reason and

93
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,159
isn't controlled by the main entity or

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,319
something that should be fine you know

95
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,739
you kind of want this flexibility to

96
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,959
sort of mix and match these entities at

97
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,209
will and not really have to worry about

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,370
their controllers being something you

99
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,840
create up front you kind of want them to

100
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,299
be able to sort of have these

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,099
controllers be more dynamic than that

102
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:11,310
right that's kind of tricky so what I

103
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,840
was thinking is rather than go down the

104
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:17,250
route that we were going down yesterday

105
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,410
where we sort of have this notion that

106
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,988
entities kind of know about who they're

107
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,400
paired with and it's this mutual

108
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,649
direction kind of a thing

109
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,239
I'm concerned about that because I just

110
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:30,418
don't feel like that is the natural

111
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,728
way to write the code and like you saw

112
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,589
me struggle with it a bit and I mean

113
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:36,899
struggles a weird word because I guess

114
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:38,728
it wasn't like it wasn't working but you

115
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,888
saw me have to do a bunch of things to

116
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:42,538
like figure out well where does the code

117
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,210
for the head go where does the code for

118
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,839
the body go right and we kind of it was

119
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,638
kind of

120
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,758
you kinda just want to have a head body

121
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,500
controller that does both of them right

122
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,180
and then if there's a separate

123
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,579
controller that only does bodies that's

124
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,220
fine or maybe just have some if code but

125
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:02,339
spreading the code out to two different

126
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,169
things is not so good right we'd rather

127
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,269
have the code in one place and then it

128
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:08,158
just does well if there isn't a head

129
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:11,430
then just don't do the head part maybe

130
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:14,550
but you know it's not like we want to

131
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,918
write this code in isolation of knowing

132
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,900
about both entities and so forcing it

133
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:23,490
into a concept that every entity

134
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:25,918
simulates itself it's like I'm falling

135
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,110
into the trap that I would never have

136
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:31,258
fallen into in regular code right I

137
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,169
would always tell someone not to be an

138
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,870
OOP programmer right I would say why are

139
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:39,689
you writing this code that's that's like

140
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,060
focused on breaking up the code amongst

141
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:45,000
objects when the natural place to write

142
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,589
it is across the objects right and the

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,750
same thing is true in the entity system

144
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:51,478
like why would we break up the

145
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,158
controller for a head in a body when the

146
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:54,990
more natural way to write that is a head

147
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:56,370
body controller that just checks to see

148
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,960
whether the head is there or not and

149
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,530
then does one thing or another

150
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,149
right and so what I'd rather do is step

151
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,728
back from that sort of OOP

152
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,468
like stupidity and go into something

153
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:09,329
that's again more focused on the

154
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:11,550
algorithm and how can we get the entity

155
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:15,180
system to work in this way that works

156
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,098
across objects and so I thought of a way

157
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,329
to actually do that which is kind of

158
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:21,870
interesting I hadn't really concerned

159
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:24,629
this before and so I think this is what

160
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,340
I'd rather try and again I don't have a

161
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,810
lot of examples yet so I'm just trying

162
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,519
it I'm trying to figure out what might

163
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,769
work for this guy and then we could

164
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,139
maybe write another one for something

165
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:37,019
like you know maybe that's snake dude

166
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,629
and and so I could make like a snake

167
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,180
creature and then we could see like does

168
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,279
it hold up or doesn't it hold up because

169
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,689
we have one use case and we can figure

170
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,069
out something that works for that but

171
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,600
then you know maybe writing another use

172
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,579
case would be a good way to validate it

173
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,169
and make sure that oh it's it's not just

174
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,180
like something that only works for this

175
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:56,508
one case it works across more than that

176
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,000
right so here's what I thought of and

177
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,759
it's a little weird but I feel like it's

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,500
interesting so the way that we have

179
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,840
things work now is right we've got this

180
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,089
sort of sim region concept right and

181
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,399
when we unpack things we sort of have

182
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:12,649
all these chunks in the world and they

183
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,529
get unpacked into the sim region right

184
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:18,829
and then we have actual entities and so

185
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:20,538
during that unpacking process we see all

186
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,459
these entities come through and we put

187
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:24,019
them into the hash table so that we know

188
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:26,508
what their IDs are and we can look them

189
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:28,069
up a by ID if we happen to have an

190
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:32,120
entity that wants to like you know chase

191
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:33,889
another entity and so the idea of an

192
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,569
entity reference in that case still

193
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,210
makes a fair bit of sense to me and I

194
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:41,689
don't think it necessarily needs to get

195
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:43,909
removed because that still seems

196
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:45,529
reasonable meaning a couple there's some

197
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,860
entity reference things that still make

198
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,879
sense which are not things you know if

199
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,970
it's not something I'm talking about

200
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,189
controlling if it's something that I'm

201
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,199
actually talking about I'm looking at

202
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:59,029
this guy or I'm attacking this guy that

203
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,288
I think can stay the way we had it where

204
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:02,000
there's just this notion of an entity

205
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:04,538
reference and an ende can reference

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,310
other entity in that way that seems fine

207
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:09,529
what doesn't seem fine was the thing

208
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,550
about entities coming together to form a

209
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:14,899
coherent operating unit and so that's

210
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,509
the part that I wanted to focus on

211
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,908
fixing so what I thought I would do is

212
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:22,550
say okay what if in addition to the hash

213
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:26,418
table we also have a thing that's like

214
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,210
controller templates and I don't mean

215
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:31,848
templates like the C++ guy in that that

216
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:33,528
suck i mean--can templates like in a

217
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:36,708
literal sense like we have sort of like

218
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:38,389
ideas of what a controller can be and so

219
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,129
one example of a controller template

220
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,408
might be the hero controller that we've

221
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,028
talked about and that has a slot for the

222
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:49,970
body and it has a slot for the head

223
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:52,338
right okay now any entity in our system

224
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,160
when it's packed into the chunk can have

225
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,839
a thing in it and they all I guess what

226
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,469
probably have one well no I guess only

227
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,660
entities that can have controllers

228
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,139
active on them would have this I suppose

229
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:08,539
would have what's called a controller

230
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:11,060
tag on them or something like this

231
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:17,838
some name of that type and what that

232
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:23,239
would have is the template type and an

233
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,439
instance ID right now the instance ideas

234
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,360
can come from the same place as our

235
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:28,698
entity ideas ideas come from just a

236
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,470
monotonic increasing thing and the

237
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:34,870
template type is what kind of controller

238
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,160
it's currently expecting to have right

239
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:42,289
furthermore we add one more thing in

240
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:44,750
here which is the slot now these things

241
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:49,309
and I suspect this slot will be like a

242
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:52,458
slot no it's all right it's just a slot

243
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:54,049
and so this is you know this could just

244
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,229
be an index we'll have to see how we

245
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,328
want to store it all right the template

246
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,399
types are all the different controllers

247
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:02,899
that we might have just any controller

248
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,089
that we might have so the hero

249
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:09,350
controller the snake controller that

250
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,759
whatever blah blah blah right so all of

251
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,610
our things get a controller and they get

252
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,379
an instance ID which says what group is

253
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,409
this actually associated with so if I

254
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:21,009
create a hero each of the pieces of that

255
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:23,838
hero would have a template type that was

256
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:25,970
the hero controller right it's one of

257
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,560
these and it would have an instance ID

258
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,860
that's just some instance ID that's

259
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,379
picked that all of them share right when

260
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,509
they get unpacked we have a separate

261
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,250
hash table for instance IDs we look up

262
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,259
in the instance ID to see if we already

263
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,308
have a controller at that instance ID

264
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:45,919
and if we do we insert this entity into

265
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:49,370
its corresponding slot body or head or

266
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:52,009
whatever now if this slot is an array

267
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,929
type slot then it can have multiple in

268
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:57,019
there right you can stick a bunch of

269
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:59,269
them in there and if it doesn't then it

270
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:02,929
can only have one right and we have to

271
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,549
decide how we deal with conflicts and

272
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,078
maybe the way we deal with is you could

273
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:07,849
always have more than one in there and

274
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,289
it's the controller's responsibility to

275
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,810
do so

276
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:13,240
think smart if it's got multiple of them

277
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:18,008
who knows right I'm not sure how exactly

278
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,589
that would work okay so this way

279
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:24,699
the way things work is at any time we

280
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:27,040
can just take any entity right and make

281
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:28,958
it into its own thing by just assigning

282
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,519
it a new template type which is whatever

283
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,609
controller we want to have in a new

284
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,528
instance ID right and what slot it goes

285
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,720
in in there we can group entities

286
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,458
together by just giving them the same

287
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,440
Endocyte so if some guy wants to like

288
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,719
pick up something and stick it on and

289
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,790
use it as his arm we just take its

290
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,800
template type and assign it to whatever

291
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,328
his controller is you take its instance

292
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,219
ID in a science or whatever his instance

293
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:53,469
ideas and we take its lot and assign it

294
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,160
to arm now that thing just has a new arm

295
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:00,190
right and they're all gathered together

296
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:03,250
based on whenever the sim region is you

297
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,230
know gathers the things up anything that

298
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,720
happens to be in that room is controlled

299
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,199
by that thing and this word would work

300
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,389
in ridiculous scenarios if I batch this

301
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:16,149
guy's arm off right and now I'm carrying

302
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:19,600
the arm for this creature around with me

303
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:22,000
somehow right if I walk off the screen

304
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,629
and carry it up over and drop it

305
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,909
somewhere if that guy comes walking over

306
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:30,159
and can get to his arm right he still

307
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:32,230
knows when he walks into the region that

308
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,269
that's his arm and his controller will

309
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:38,170
still see it in the arm slot and go oh

310
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:40,539
that thing was part of me right so it

311
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:42,278
can do all of the things that you would

312
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:44,259
normally do if you created some kind of

313
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:47,019
super structure but it's entirely on

314
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:49,899
demand so it can be broken and streamed

315
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:52,480
apart and doesn't have any sort of clean

316
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:55,120
up or or deletion associated with if

317
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,730
there's no maintenance it's all stored

318
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,120
eats per entity and assembled at same

319
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:03,188
time so there's no overhead essentially

320
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,078
to doing it and there's no restrictions

321
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:07,240
on doing it you don't have to keep these

322
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,679
things live or worry about what happens

323
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,759
if it thinks there's a head there and

324
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:12,099
there isn't during those thing because

325
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,938
they're all always assembled each time

326
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,939
you go to do a sim

327
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:21,419
I don't know so maybe there's something

328
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,759
I'm not thinking of but it feels really

329
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:25,769
right to me and it gets rid of that

330
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,549
object-oriented nastiness that's what

331
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:32,250
makes things so ugly and bad in regular

332
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:34,829
code I don't want that inherited into

333
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,559
our entity system in just another form

334
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,810
and so I think this gets us around that

335
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,639
and allows us to write the code in a

336
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:45,349
natural way so I'm just going to go and

337
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:49,559
do that and see what happens

338
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:51,720
okay so first things first I don't know

339
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,279
why I'm Solinsky Trey because I'm oh I'm

340
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,200
in the wrong place well it doesn't

341
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,980
matter I guess I can just when I load it

342
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,009
we'll fix it

343
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:03,990
so to go to hand-made project do a

344
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:07,919
little bill Deepu then really to be

345
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:10,590
honest probably what I do here is I just

346
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,129
revert yesterday's changes to I don't

347
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,899
think I even want them but we didn't

348
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:18,509
change very much so I probably won't

349
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,409
bother going through that actual I don't

350
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:21,480
know what I'm trying to think of what

351
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:23,279
I'm actually oh yeah I probably won't

352
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,710
actually bother going through that but

353
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,289
really what we did yesterday we just

354
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:31,170
don't need because we're never going to

355
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:33,959
stream out array storage at least not of

356
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:35,699
references that I can think of so we

357
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:43,800
really just don't need to do that it's

358
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:44,970
it's simply not necessary by the way I

359
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,059
don't know if Allen's watching he was

360
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,790
wondering how to encounter that bug let

361
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:52,619
me see if I can do it again this was a

362
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,750
bug Allen was asking me about and I was

363
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,810
just able to make it happen so I've

364
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:00,659
loaded the hand-made here a project I go

365
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:08,189
let me switch to a buffer roll my CP and

366
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:11,100
if I hit X I'm locked up so all I have

367
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,810
to do is open a buffer hit X and the

368
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,590
first time I do that it looks like it

369
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:18,269
locks up then as soon as I switch that

370
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,330
buffer to something else I'm back in

371
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:23,699
here and it never happens again

372
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,830
so it must be something with the first

373
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,410
time you create something in a panel

374
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:29,700
like that yeah and it has to do with I

375
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,439
think it's like we were looking at my

376
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
for code or custom it does have

377
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,650
something to with my for code or custom

378
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,629
because I think we had nerfs and things

379
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,370
when we were working on it originally

380
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:39,629
that weren't implemented yet in for code

381
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,519
or weren't working it for coder so it

382
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:44,820
may be just that but that's how you

383
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,059
reproduce the bug if that helps so load

384
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,160
a buffer hit X to spawn the new window

385
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:51,899
that windows locked but as soon as you

386
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,129
change buffers it unlocks and then it's

387
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,929
never a problem again as far as I can

388
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,629
tell so it's only it has to be like an

389
00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:01,199
empty panel and you have to X you know

390
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:04,049
use the X command to move into it I

391
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,840
guess seems like it and I don't know if

392
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:09,149
that happens if I delete stuff down to

393
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:14,129
an empty panel I know how to get back to

394
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:15,659
an empty panel I don't know how to get

395
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:18,960
back to an empty panel so I'm not sure

396
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:28,169
how to see if it ever happens outside of

397
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:30,120
that yeah let's see and it looks like I

398
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:32,039
guess maybe doesn't have to be empty it

399
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,340
looks like the compilation buffer was

400
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:38,969
enough but it's very clear that after I

401
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,810
get out of that it doesn't happen again

402
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:47,610
like Here I am kidding X all day long

403
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:50,250
and no no big deal right so so I have no

404
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:52,320
idea but it just must be something

405
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,820
peculiar all right so anyway sorry for

406
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,770
that diversion I just know that was a

407
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,300
bug Alan wanted to fix and so I wanted

408
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:58,860
to make sure I got that repo in there

409
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,199
like I said it may just be something

410
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,769
with my four code or custom but that's a

411
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:09,690
yeah now we know all right so anyway

412
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:11,099
inside sim region and entity I have to

413
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,410
repair a little bit of the damage I did

414
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,939
and simply say that now we're not

415
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,730
probably going to store relationships

416
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,320
anymore we're just going to have the

417
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,180
entity references the way that they used

418
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:28,639
to be

419
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:31,279
right Crips like so and these

420
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,660
relationships are not gonna be there

421
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:33,609
anymore right that's just not going to

422
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,670
be a thing anymore

423
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:40,969
and let's see entity references valid

424
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:43,100
that's gonna be not having to check the

425
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,779
relationship stuff so I don't even know

426
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:52,309
yeah this doesn't really need to be

427
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:54,549
there anymore what is happening this

428
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:58,250
doesn't need to be there anymore and

429
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:59,629
this doesn't need to be there anymore

430
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:05,420
either

431
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:09,980
yeah so it's something like this okay

432
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:12,769
so hmm what we would be replacing this

433
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,960
with again is I kind of want this notion

434
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:18,289
of the template of thing this goes away

435
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,960
and so in here I essentially want you

436
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:27,559
know a thing that's like entity

437
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:36,920
controller type and this is like a

438
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:39,649
controller you know none controller hero

439
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,570
and you know let's be optimistic and say

440
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:46,450
we're gonna have a snake controller as

441
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:46,450
well right if that makes sense

442
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,820
okay so these controllers are the things

443
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:58,240
that'll kind of assemble up the

444
00:18:54,819 --> 00:19:00,250
creatures and so in here I would have

445
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,058
something that would say okay I've got

446
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,679
the entity controller type and that's

447
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:09,819
the type of the controller template that

448
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,380
I want to use right and this can just be

449
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:13,480
set to none if it's just an MD that

450
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,070
doesn't have that type of controller and

451
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,000
then it has like an entity controller

452
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:21,250
slot and I don't really know that I want

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,429
that to be anything like I said we'll

454
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,599
write the code for it you know in I

455
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,160
don't know I'll call it writing the

456
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,689
usage code first because I kind of just

457
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,679
have this imaginary thing in my head so

458
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,419
we're just gonna have to kind of play

459
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,240
with it and see by writing a hero

460
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:35,799
controller but at the moment but until

461
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,390
we actually have some more code that I

462
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:39,279
can actually look at I'm thinking this

463
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,740
is just a thing that's like literally an

464
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:45,339
index right and there so there's just

465
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:48,039
you know some number of slots on this

466
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:54,879
controller and you can pick which one

467
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:57,789
you go in so I can have the controller

468
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,650
type I can't have a controller slot and

469
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:03,190
I can have a controller instance ID

470
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,169
right and that can just be an entity ID

471
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,929
I don't know that we need it to be

472
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:09,820
separate and I'm just so I'm not sure

473
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:11,470
but again at the moment I'm going to

474
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:12,689
keep them separate and this is just to

475
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:18,210
make sure that I don't accidentally

476
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,210
conflate them right

477
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:33,380
and so so this would essentially be what

478
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,440
would be necessary to assemble those

479
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,810
sort of meta entities right you can kind

480
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,380
of think of this as you know the the

481
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:47,899
entity kind of that's built out of this

482
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:50,000
set of entity pieces if you will and you

483
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,100
know there's a couple things about it

484
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,500
that I'm not quite sure about yet

485
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,750
like whether the itself needs additional

486
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,670
storage and if it itself needs

487
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,440
additional storage there are some things

488
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,509
we could do and that's why I like I said

489
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,299
I don't know if this is a separate ID

490
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:07,279
like if the if the superstructure also

491
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,379
has data then this would have to be one

492
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,200
of these where it's like this is my sort

493
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,780
of meta entity that that I'm that builds

494
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,950
you know out of me essentially but I

495
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,329
don't know if we need that or if we

496
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,160
don't and for them I don't know if we

497
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:21,409
want that or we don't like I think we

498
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,330
might want to make it more that the

499
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,670
properties of the meta anity are

500
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,529
determined by its sub entities because

501
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,000
that's kind of what makes the organic

502
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:32,539
Ness whereas if it just sort of has

503
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,900
inherent properties I don't know like

504
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:38,450
you know I feel like you want the brain

505
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,090
of the thing to be based on what it has

506
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:43,309
on it and so like if the thing gets its

507
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:46,099
head chopped off I don't want it to

508
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:48,470
still necessarily know a bunch of

509
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:50,959
settings that we magically set it should

510
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,549
become an auto stupid arm that has like

511
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,680
let's just derived from whatever it's

512
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:58,460
derived from so I don't really know that

513
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,830
part yet so for the moment I was gonna

514
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,990
say that these are separate and you

515
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:05,750
can't use like an entity controller ID

516
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:09,529
anywhere else like it's just literally

517
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:11,390
for this one hashing operation and it's

518
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:14,119
a totally separate table from the entity

519
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:18,230
ID table that's just my thinking at the

520
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:19,399
moment so we'll see and technically

521
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,720
since this is something we're playing

522
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,930
with here I feel like these should kind

523
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,819
of go down here right and so this kind

524
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,789
of replaces the notion of the entity

525
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:29,720
type because now the entity itself never

526
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,369
has a type

527
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,100
it just has whatever is controlling

528
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:38,459
at this time because that's the only

529
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:40,798
thing that's actually unique meaning

530
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,690
only one thing is allowed to control me

531
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,609
it's either the players controller or a

532
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,890
thing or whatever so rather than saying

533
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:48,269
this is a hero we're never gonna say

534
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,850
that again we're just gonna say it has a

535
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:52,950
hero controller on it but whatever it is

536
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:55,288
is defined by other things right and

537
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,600
then if for some reason some part of it

538
00:22:55,288 --> 00:23:00,240
gets broken off that part can just be

539
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:03,538
picked up by another controller and it

540
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,980
just off it goes and it it's type it has

541
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:08,548
nothing to do with that right it may be

542
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,659
a glove it's type is not glove right it

543
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:11,490
just happens to be part of the hero

544
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,870
controller in the glove slot if it

545
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,970
breaks off later it can become a piece

546
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:16,500
of something else and you know that's

547
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,360
kind of the way that I want it to work

548
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,619
right so that's why I'm trying to get

549
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:21,750
away from the notion that an entity

550
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:23,428
itself has an intrinsic type and more

551
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,679
that that is a diffused piece of

552
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:27,028
information sort in many places so

553
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,380
instead of type determining who your

554
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:29,548
controller is and how you're drawn will

555
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,730
do something each one of those should be

556
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:34,889
defined by other things and so we want

557
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,110
to break that entity type into multiple

558
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:40,919
things that can that could be different

559
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:42,689
right again so that's just kind of I

560
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,190
kind of explained that yesterday by just

561
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,960
trying to continue to say why I'm

562
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,159
pushing towards this rather than just

563
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,440
having one universities because I'm

564
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,970
trying to find where that other I'm

565
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,769
trying to get to this other place right

566
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,259
that I feel like is there in my head but

567
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:59,668
I don't really know which is kind of the

568
00:23:55,259 --> 00:24:01,950
nature of architecture right okay so

569
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:05,250
that's what I actually want to do we now

570
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,830
no longer really have any sort of me and

571
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,319
it kind of a thing like I don't have an

572
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:12,240
actual entity reference anymore that

573
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,548
actually needs to happen but you know I

574
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,649
should probably you know like I said we

575
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:18,509
do want entity reference I'm not getting

576
00:24:16,648 --> 00:24:21,689
rid of entity reference it's just not

577
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:23,759
actually a thing anymore that it that is

578
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,130
in any of the creatures we have it will

579
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,240
be I think target like who I'm targeting

580
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,860
when I'm attacking or stuff like that

581
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,390
will be an entity reference so I think

582
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:33,599
there will be any references it's just

583
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:36,028
now the controller aggregation replaces

584
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,048
pairing so pointers back and forth to

585
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:41,009
people they're gone

586
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:44,058
right okay so in here we have an entity

587
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:45,809
hash right which is one of these guys

588
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:53,430
but we're also going to

589
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:54,779
have a controller hash and I don't know

590
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,430
why I call it an entity controller

591
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:57,990
because it's not like we have other

592
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,080
controllers oh well

593
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,180
and you know what controller might be a

594
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,980
weird word because controller sounds

595
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,190
like game controller so maybe before I

596
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:13,019
get too far next we could call it brain

597
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:16,350
maybe cuz that's like you know what's

598
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:20,369
the brain type it's not maybe the most

599
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:27,929
descriptive but it's gonna be unique you

600
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:30,239
know what I mean so let's try that let's

601
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,610
just say we have like these sort of

602
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:37,140
slots and it's just its brain right

603
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:41,669
brain so I'm gonna go ahead and make

604
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:46,230
each of those make each of Em's 50/50 to

605
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:49,529
do two two and then in here I'll with a

606
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:53,430
brain hash which sounds like some kind

607
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:56,519
of a bad atom like an after-school

608
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:59,340
special or something so this would be a

609
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:06,480
pointer to one of our brain things and

610
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:10,769
in here we would have a brain ID which

611
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:19,880
is the ID which is the ID right why this

612
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:19,879
is index so seems the same same right

613
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,150
that's probably too many right there's

614
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:31,069
not many of these so it's probably more

615
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,070
like a you know that sort of thing

616
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,740
since mobs are cheap I don't know that

617
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:39,179
power of two is such a good idea I feel

618
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,278
like in the future we probably want to

619
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:44,038
make that a prime number and deal with

620
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,038
the mod but you know again minutiae we

621
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:49,528
can work out anytime we want really

622
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:50,970
so these frame hashes right are just

623
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:53,220
things where we can kind of look up and

624
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:59,519
say okay let's see if we've got one of

625
00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:02,569
these wait a second how does this deal

626
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,569
with duplicates

627
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:16,340
is this an internally chained hash this

628
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:24,160
must be an internally chained hash huh

629
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:32,269
oh yeah it is okay well that makes sense

630
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:35,660
all right so anyway Jimmy so anyway this

631
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:36,920
is supposed in that case to our entity

632
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,390
hash we might as well to store the

633
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,710
entities directly in there probably I

634
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:43,100
don't know if that would be bad for cash

635
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:46,340
reasons because you'd lose a bit more of

636
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:48,529
the hash testing but I do kind of wonder

637
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:54,079
if we should just have this the entity

638
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:55,639
do you know what I'm saying but that's

639
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,799
it that's that's a story for another

640
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,080
time all right so we've got our brains

641
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:04,029
our brains will get assembled as we sort

642
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:07,609
of you know wish these things up and

643
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:09,139
yeah I feel like I guess I don't so I

644
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:11,689
don't really know what this value should

645
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:15,650
be you know I don't really have any idea

646
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:21,590
but the again these have a cost to them

647
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:24,019
and the cost is the clearing right so

648
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:30,069
there is an upfront cost for figuring

649
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:32,960
out essentially there is an upfront cost

650
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:34,700
to having this be arbitrarily sized

651
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,200
because we have to do it every frame we

652
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,580
can do incremental clears and other

653
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,960
sorts of stuff like that in the future

654
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:41,480
but it's definitely the kind of thing

655
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,880
that you know it's probably gonna be you

656
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,039
know could be a pressure point who knows

657
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,410
so anyway we have our brain hash as

658
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:50,149
entities come in and we see controller

659
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,550
IDs for them we'll add in the brain hash

660
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:55,730
obviously we would have our controller

661
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:57,980
ID of zero be reserved for no controller

662
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:00,529
and a core controller type at least we

663
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:04,849
have a reserved no controller sort of a

664
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:12,980
thing for that so that's easy enough and

665
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:15,619
I think I think that's about it it's

666
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,190
true that since controller ID can be 0

667
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:19,788
it's possible that brain type actually

668
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,759
doesn't have to

669
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:26,408
null so I'm gonna stick it like that for

670
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,819
now and say that you actually don't need

671
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:32,509
one here because if your controller ID

672
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:34,220
just isn't set to anything then if your

673
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:38,419
color ID is set to zero then your

674
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,739
controller type right doesn't have to it

675
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:42,619
doesn't have to have a zero element not

676
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:43,210
that that matters to anyone ever but

677
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:48,259
it's fine

678
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:51,288
all right so during this this simulation

679
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:53,538
step what we want to do here is when we

680
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:56,919
call identity right

681
00:29:53,538 --> 00:30:01,989
which I guess is this situation here I

682
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,989
guess I don't know add into the raw I

683
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:13,098
don't even think anyone's calling this

684
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:22,489
anymore are they I guess I got a stub

685
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:30,769
that out for the moment all right moving

686
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:32,389
on what is going on there we go

687
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,858
moving on I'm gonna have to sort of

688
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:37,699
clean up the damage I did yesterday like

689
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:40,038
I sang so in order to do that we've got

690
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:46,848
PAC at any reference array really isn't

691
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:49,128
a thing anymore so traversable reference

692
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:50,418
and PAC entity reference how can any

693
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:53,238
reference is really just going to be

694
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:57,769
what it was before I guess so

695
00:30:53,239 --> 00:31:03,679
we just have this and I believe that the

696
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:08,319
entirety of that code was was just

697
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,320
saying if the ref had a pointer

698
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:19,190
right basically that if the reference

699
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:31,190
was a pointer then the ref ID where is

700
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:33,590
it index what it's called here yeah so

701
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:36,500
if we have a pointer set then we're

702
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:45,859
going to go ahead and set the the index

703
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:52,069
equal to the pointer is ID like so and

704
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:55,339
if we didn't what we want to do here is

705
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:59,359
say well we'll either clear it or leave

706
00:31:55,339 --> 00:32:02,389
it the same if the if the element is not

707
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:05,928
in the hash table right so if if the if

708
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:09,740
this sim region doesn't have one of

709
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:12,110
these guys in there then we we would

710
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,950
assume you know that that we'd get rid

711
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:14,899
of it

712
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,670
the other thing true that I think is

713
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,100
true is during this pack we'd probably

714
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:20,808
want to check if it's deleted right so

715
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:28,629
we'd probably say like if deleted or

716
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:28,629
something like this right

717
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:43,849
something like this

718
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:45,019
so in here this is kind of temporary for

719
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:46,250
the way we're doing the packing because

720
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:47,389
we don't actually pack it down we leave

721
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,759
the same but we still need to do the

722
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,470
operation of packing to make sure that

723
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,298
the index season pointers stay in sync

724
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,400
so we want to do something here where we

725
00:32:53,298 --> 00:32:57,859
base to say okay if this reference is

726
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,720
set to something valid if it's a deleted

727
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:01,819
entity if it's entity that no longer you

728
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,278
know got marked as being removed from

729
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:07,278
the set of entities that there are in

730
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:08,898
the world then you know we can we would

731
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,148
want to get rid of it right we'd want to

732
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:13,189
say like okay you know don't don't

733
00:33:11,148 --> 00:33:15,019
consider this as a dude anymore

734
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,220
don't you know don't think that you're

735
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:20,119
following this guy or whatever because

736
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:23,899
he's gone otherwise we would take its ID

737
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:27,168
and say that's the new thing to store if

738
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:30,500
we don't have a pointer then clearing

739
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:32,990
the index is only valid if this thing is

740
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:39,919
it is in the table so like it you know

741
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:42,190
is in hash table excuse me we would want

742
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,190
to say

743
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:55,729
something like this or what is it called

744
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:57,169
stem region the reason for this is well

745
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,870
let's say that I'm referencing somebody

746
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:01,990
and that somebody walks out of the

747
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:04,639
simulation region they're just gone

748
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:08,840
well I'm a swan I still remember that

749
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,840
right so I want to look and go oh okay

750
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,230
if my pointer is zero that means that

751
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,690
this guy is no longer visible to me now

752
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,389
but I may want to store the index still

753
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:23,480
so what I want to do there is say okay

754
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:27,679
did I set this value to zero meaning I'm

755
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,269
trying to clear it or did the guy just

756
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,519
go out of the sim region is no longer

757
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:34,759
here and that's why the pointer didn't

758
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,739
get loaded this time around right and so

759
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,390
in that case I just want to see well is

760
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:40,039
it in the hash table if it's in the hash

761
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:41,210
table then I said it that some of us

762
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,070
have set it to zero and they're trying

763
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,780
to clear out this reference so let me do

764
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:52,269
that up when I pack it let me get rid of

765
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:55,580
it right that's basically all I'm saying

766
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:57,199
okay so I don't know like I said it's a

767
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:58,190
little janky I'm not sure about this yet

768
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,199
but that's basically the way it works

769
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,510
the problem here is when we're doing our

770
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:04,129
packing we don't always have a sim

771
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,260
region when we're doing our packing and

772
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:11,000
the example there is we don't have a sim

773
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:13,850
region during the pack if like say we're

774
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,800
doing world creation at that time you

775
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:19,099
know what I mean so I don't really know

776
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,150
exactly how to approach this again it's

777
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,730
something that we're gonna have to work

778
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,440
on as we go forward but I would say it's

779
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,030
probably something like okay you pass

780
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,429
some region if you don't pass this image

781
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,940
and then the pack doesn't do this so if

782
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:37,669
there's no sim region or it's in the

783
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:39,500
hash table and I guess I'll take a look

784
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:42,289
at instant region and see exactly how

785
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,869
that query ends up happening load entity

786
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:48,670
reference here does get hash from ID

787
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:48,670
this situation and

788
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:59,250
I think that's really all I have to do

789
00:35:53,619 --> 00:36:01,809
so if I say get hash from ID sim region

790
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:11,099
ref index I don't know why insisted on

791
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:11,099
putting that as an dot it's not a dot

792
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,699
all right so I come in here and I say

793
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:24,489
well is this thing deleted and that's a

794
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:25,989
query that we're gonna have to do like

795
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:27,250
later we don't really ever delete

796
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:30,339
entities at the moment but we're gonna

797
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,570
start right so we say if it's deleted I

798
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,980
don't want to start reference to it

799
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,130
otherwise I do want to store the

800
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,630
reference to it if there's no sim region

801
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:40,150
at the moment so it's world creation

802
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,990
time or I'm trying to get the hash from

803
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:46,570
the ID here and I see if anything came

804
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:47,739
back if something does come back then I

805
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,970
want to clear it because that means it

806
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,709
should have been there so someone must

807
00:36:48,969 --> 00:36:54,279
have actually tried to be getting rid of

808
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:55,630
it but if if I don't then I leave it be

809
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,800
because it's just somebody who walked

810
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,300
out the region it still wants to be

811
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,710
there right so again in here so we kind

812
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,839
of have this thing where we're we're

813
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:13,088
we're doing the sim region is passed

814
00:37:04,838 --> 00:37:17,219
through again and here we've got the

815
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,219
same sort of things in regions in region

816
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,440
and I would say this is probably yeah

817
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,440
all of this stuff just passes it through

818
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:34,870
and like I said I'm still not 100%

819
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:36,190
certain about that it definitely like

820
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,019
there's definitely some jenkki 'no stare

821
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,789
and so it's a question of whether i can

822
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:43,599
think of something smarter to do there

823
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:46,869
and maybe I can maybe I can't I'm not

824
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,849
sure we'll find out okay

825
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:53,889
ah let's keep going here so is deleted

826
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:56,079
would be something on the entity and at

827
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:58,029
the moment I guess we have this entity

828
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,239
flag deleted so you know it's gonna be

829
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:05,590
basically a thing that's like is deleted

830
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:16,889
is just it takes an entity and returns

831
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:16,890
like eflags and any flag deleted right

832
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:26,260
and that's really all it is but it looks

833
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:32,470
like I've got an is set here so I guess

834
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:37,230
this is really just is set entity any

835
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:37,230
flag deleted right

836
00:38:41,969 --> 00:39:07,949
so moving along this is dot value get

837
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:07,949
hash from ID is not sound really - ID

838
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:21,489
so if you say get entity by ID and it

839
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:27,659
can't refer to it here this this I feel

840
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:27,659
like this wants to be this doesn't it I

841
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:37,450
mean get entity by ID should be doing

842
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:48,579
the same check right and this is

843
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:51,000
essentially this so I don't really know

844
00:39:48,579 --> 00:39:54,340
why those two were different

845
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,559
probably just vestigial remains we have

846
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,108
made a lot of changes here at some point

847
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:02,079
we should probably kind of go through ok

848
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:06,759
so sorry back to what I was doing before

849
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,069
so get hash from ID I could actually

850
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,099
have this just you get entity by ID and

851
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:15,010
have this be a free you know a function

852
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:16,450
that's sort of pre callable but I don't

853
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:24,450
know I'm gonna actually just do it like

854
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:24,449
this all right so let's see

855
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:36,179
no operator right you are sir pack

856
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:38,069
entity into chunk so pack entity into

857
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:39,409
Chuck doesn't take three arguments and

858
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:56,460
that is actually true

859
00:40:39,409 --> 00:41:04,170
it takes a sim region now let's see sim

860
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:10,970
region have so these have to be entity

861
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,970
hash now you've got multiple hashes

862
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:16,380
check entity into world so these are

863
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:24,380
just taking zero because they do not

864
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:24,380
have a sim region same here

865
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:47,608
is that true all right no so this does

866
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:49,650
have some reason yeah these are not

867
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:52,319
necessary anymore so these these are

868
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,780
just they just don't exist anymore right

869
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,280
those are all gone but we will sort of

870
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,160
want to do a thing here where we say

871
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:04,500
like okay allocate another entity ID

872
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:06,289
right and we want to sort of make a

873
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:16,829
brain ID for it

874
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:27,389
right so we'd say let's get a brain

875
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:29,039
let's let's let's add a brain and all

876
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:30,480
that's going to do is give us an ID it

877
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,519
doesn't actually to create anything it

878
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,460
just gives us a token that we can use

879
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,829
and then we would say all right the the

880
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,769
brain ID so we just come back to entity

881
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:43,049
here and all of these fields like

882
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:50,030
controller type controller slot these

883
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:50,030
are all going to be set here

884
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:56,078
now how I want to do brain slot I'm not

885
00:42:54,489 --> 00:43:00,298
sure that's something that we're going

886
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,980
to have to play with a little bit and

887
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:08,289
we'll kind of see why I say that in a

888
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:09,608
second there's gonna be a little bit of

889
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:10,750
touching this there because we want that

890
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:12,608
to be something that works nice and

891
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,730
clean and there's gonna be a little bit

892
00:43:12,608 --> 00:43:18,639
of work in us getting that to happen but

893
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:20,289
you know at the moment let's say that it

894
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:29,469
worked like this even though this is not

895
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:32,440
how it's actually going to work so these

896
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:34,179
are basically both the same in all

897
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,588
respects except for what slot they go

898
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:37,629
into right so they both have the same

899
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:39,460
controller one of them that goes into

900
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:41,559
slot 0 what I'm going to slap one right

901
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,519
and the reason I say that I don't really

902
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,660
want to do it that way is cuz I don't

903
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,088
want to have to remember a bunch of

904
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:47,588
indices like the ped goes in slot 0 and

905
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:49,869
the brain you know blah blah blah I want

906
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:51,308
that to be cleaner so we don't have to

907
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:52,838
constantly be remembering a bunch of

908
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:55,298
indices or creating the ton of

909
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,739
enumerators or something like this so

910
00:43:55,298 --> 00:44:02,068
we'll want to kind of make that be a

911
00:43:56,739 --> 00:44:02,068
little bit more straightforward as we go

912
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:17,588
we're then that we're okay so here is

913
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:19,389
something to add a brain all this is

914
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:22,150
going to do is exactly the same thing

915
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:25,269
that we do up here where we do last huge

916
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:26,710
storage index right that's that we're

917
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:28,719
just going to grab exactly that same

918
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:34,240
thing so we're just gonna say ok there's

919
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:36,519
a brain ID oops the brain ID just equals

920
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:40,598
whatever the current storage situation

921
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:45,789
is and then we can like sort of lock

922
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:50,650
this guy up to be here with the the

923
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:54,750
other dudes alright so in here I think

924
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:56,889
we called this index map it's not value

925
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,480
there we go

926
00:44:56,889 --> 00:45:00,548
and then this sort of pure identity

927
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,309
thing so this is now gonna be quite a

928
00:45:00,548 --> 00:45:04,338
bit different and the way this is going

929
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,809
to work and

930
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:12,518
and I'm kind of really excited like I

931
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:12,519
said I'm pretty excited about this I'm I

932
00:45:12,998 --> 00:45:16,848
have a good feeling about the way this

933
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:19,788
is going and here's why

934
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:21,170
right so what do we want to do right how

935
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:22,969
do we want this code to normally work

936
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,068
well if we were just writing it without

937
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:26,960
all this crazy permutations that we want

938
00:45:25,068 --> 00:45:29,329
to support you know probably we just

939
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,999
write some code that's like for each

940
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:33,950
player move your guy in the direction

941
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:37,338
you want them to go and then simulate

942
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:39,379
everything right like and that's sort of

943
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:41,179
what we had here for our code like we

944
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,369
had these controllers and then we had to

945
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:45,440
put the controller stuff into things and

946
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,809
then we came back here and we were like

947
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,700
picking up we were like finding what

948
00:45:47,809 --> 00:45:51,710
controller you were associated with and

949
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:56,358
like picking that back up again right

950
00:45:51,710 --> 00:46:02,509
and crap like this and so now I think

951
00:45:56,358 --> 00:46:05,239
what we can do is we can make like we

952
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:07,608
can make this work exactly that way but

953
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:09,679
in an organic like real fashion for

954
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:11,808
that's uniform across everything and

955
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,429
doesn't have that like right and pick

956
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:19,190
back up it can like do the thing that it

957
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:21,379
wants to do and then later you know and

958
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,759
then not have that that weird like

959
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,710
constant I have to pass things through

960
00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:29,659
this dance Larry structure if that makes

961
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:31,489
sense so yeah so up at the top here what

962
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:35,960
we'd be doing is we'd be saying like hey

963
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:38,719
I need to loop through all of the brains

964
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,369
that are in here right and I don't

965
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,679
really remember to completely honest

966
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:46,278
with you I don't really remember how the

967
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:48,978
sim region went about organizing this I

968
00:46:46,278 --> 00:46:51,079
guess it's just a maxim D count entities

969
00:46:48,978 --> 00:46:52,728
sort of a situation and then we've got

970
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,528
the hash table that internally chains

971
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:55,998
into there so I'm assuming that we would

972
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:58,389
do the same thing here right and just

973
00:46:55,998 --> 00:46:59,718
have a max brain count frame count and

974
00:46:58,389 --> 00:47:02,389
brains

975
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:04,219
so in here before anything else happens

976
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:09,889
we just have our brain indices we'd go

977
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:14,630
over each one of these which is whatever

978
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:17,328
so it's the sim region brain cap

979
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:19,970
we go over the brain index and then in

980
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:24,380
here we would have you know brain star

981
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:28,608
brain equals sin region brains but brain

982
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:31,548
index and then here's where we would do

983
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:32,719
the actual logic for whatever those

984
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,518
things are

985
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,259
so in our bringing obviously we'd have

986
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,868
whatever the brain type is and we'd have

987
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:41,539
the brain Kiro code in here and we'd

988
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:44,960
have the brain snake code in here which

989
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:48,200
we haven't written yet and I guess we

990
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,059
also have a brain familiar we sort of

991
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:52,368
had although that's I don't know that we

992
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:55,309
really that a brain familiar that's more

993
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:57,140
of a behavior type and we probably will

994
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:58,819
have yet another thing later down the

995
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:01,308
road which is like what behavior

996
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:04,099
something is doing at the moment which

997
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:09,589
will sort of be a separate issue but

998
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:12,170
yeah okay so we've got brain here oh

999
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:14,568
brain snake and then we have like an

1000
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:18,318
invalid default case here no if we have

1001
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:19,788
yeah we do you know where things

1002
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,940
wouldn't work so we come through here

1003
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:24,799
and in this case you know if we've got a

1004
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:28,028
controller that's involved we would

1005
00:48:24,798 --> 00:48:31,038
sample the controller and presumably

1006
00:48:28,028 --> 00:48:33,949
that's actually this code here we could

1007
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,569
lock that up into there and that's

1008
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:38,268
actually what I probably would like to

1009
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:40,849
do but we'll hold on that off on that

1010
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:42,828
for a second and then we've got sort of

1011
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:45,650
this code down here which is the stuff

1012
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:48,200
for the the hero head and the hero body

1013
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:51,200
and the hero head and body now don't

1014
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:52,879
really have to be controlled in this way

1015
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:57,739
anymore they could we can do these

1016
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:59,028
things together right but I guess I'll

1017
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:01,269
hold off on that for one second till we

1018
00:48:59,028 --> 00:49:05,690
get our compiler errors cleaned up okay

1019
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:07,248
so let's go into some region here and

1020
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,358
I've got this brain stuff these will

1021
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:14,988
probably get pulled out to their own

1022
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:17,630
file in a minute but not yet and then

1023
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:19,849
we've got to just kind of deal with with

1024
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:25,849
some of these these other things here

1025
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:27,800
yeah okay so these parity count things

1026
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:30,680
all of this stuff is really

1027
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,420
like I said let's let's just if this is

1028
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:34,779
your if zero these things out here for a

1029
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,780
second

1030
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:41,809
yeah cuz these these we don't really

1031
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:48,530
want at the moment so I'm just gonna

1032
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:59,960
take care of them briefly doo doo doo

1033
00:49:48,530 --> 00:50:03,019
doo and this guy has to actually return

1034
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,490
this result all right so I got to clean

1035
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:06,289
some stuff up so this will still work

1036
00:50:04,489 --> 00:50:07,459
but that's I just don't want to leave us

1037
00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:08,509
in like a bogus day because this is

1038
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,769
going to take us a while like we're

1039
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,730
gonna it's going to take us you know on

1040
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:13,960
Monday we're gonna have to do some of

1041
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:20,809
this as well all right

1042
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:23,000
so Pat Kennedy reference oh so in this

1043
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:24,829
case I guess we have to check to see to

1044
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,260
make sure that the index is not already

1045
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:39,348
zero because obviously that we don't

1046
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:40,760
need to do any more processing on so if

1047
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:42,588
it's already zero we don't have to

1048
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,200
decide whether to clear it it's already

1049
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:48,769
clear right so that's pretty

1050
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:56,179
straightforward okay so here we are with

1051
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:59,300
you know our sort of our disabled

1052
00:50:56,179 --> 00:51:01,098
controllers if you will and so now what

1053
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,369
we need to do is figure out how we want

1054
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:07,369
to write these cleanly right so I want

1055
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:10,130
to again sort of ping back to the usage

1056
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:13,579
code and try to figure out how I would

1057
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:15,320
want these two to be written given the

1058
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:17,269
best possible circumstances and see if I

1059
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:22,700
can reverse engineer back into that

1060
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:24,980
right okay so let's start with this kind

1061
00:51:22,699 --> 00:51:33,980
of ugly controller code here and let's

1062
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:38,719
grab that no this is not okay so I'm

1063
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:41,659
gonna grab all the hero head code which

1064
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:51,469
is all this and I'm gonna bring that up

1065
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:58,909
into let's see here brain hero there's a

1066
00:51:51,469 --> 00:52:00,019
lot of code so inside brain hero you

1067
00:51:58,909 --> 00:52:02,960
know sort of got this notion of

1068
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:05,300
controlled hero and controlled hero like

1069
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:10,070
all that really is is sort of the the

1070
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:11,990
was the you know we were sort of looking

1071
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,460
over these controlled heroes to find

1072
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:17,899
whichever one it was that we were

1073
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:19,519
looking at and obviously that's

1074
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,930
something we could probably optimize a

1075
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:27,050
little bit better because there's really

1076
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:29,809
no like we could have it so that these

1077
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:32,000
line up it could be that your ID like

1078
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:33,889
your controller ID is just lines up with

1079
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,588
the like with the actual physical

1080
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:37,608
controller 0 0 1 2 3 or whatever so I

1081
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:39,380
feel like we could do this a little bit

1082
00:52:37,608 --> 00:52:41,598
better but I guess for the moment that

1083
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,400
it's fine doesn't really matter we can

1084
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,099
just have it you know that there's a

1085
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:50,088
brain ID and that brain ID is what's in

1086
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:53,300
the test hero if that makes sense so I'm

1087
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:54,858
gonna do that first and foremost but

1088
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,380
then I'm also gonna go down here and

1089
00:52:54,858 --> 00:53:00,759
grab the body stuff so this this stuff

1090
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,760
doesn't really have to happen

1091
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:15,159
let's go ahead and get this up here so

1092
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:16,630
here's the body code I don't know what

1093
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,399
that bug is I've been noticing that for

1094
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,300
a coder bug happen

1095
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,660
weird stuff just turns bright white and

1096
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:27,160
it later willed stop being bright white

1097
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:29,920
but like you got to do something to it

1098
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:31,449
yeah there you go so like it gets

1099
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,000
confused about the syntax highlighting

1100
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:37,409
in some kind of way that I'm not super

1101
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,409
confident how it you can reproduce it

1102
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:44,619
but anyway so now this code just

1103
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,300
literally needs to do a thing where it's

1104
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:50,679
like all right I've got this brain I've

1105
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:52,660
got head and body and both both of these

1106
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:56,889
are things that could may or may not be

1107
00:53:52,659 --> 00:54:05,379
there right so you know what this is

1108
00:53:56,889 --> 00:54:07,119
what hard to do is and then as we go

1109
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:12,789
through here we can basically say like

1110
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:15,849
okay there is no longer sort of a

1111
00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:18,099
concept of a you know entity

1112
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:20,019
quote-unquote that's primal it's more

1113
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:21,610
like okay this is you know is this the

1114
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:23,230
head or just the body right so this is

1115
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:30,820
code that only happens on the head

1116
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:33,820
branch all the rest of this code is code

1117
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:39,430
that just happens in general okay well

1118
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:41,700
so here's some more head style code in

1119
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:41,699
there

1120
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:49,480
yeah where else is entity referenced I

1121
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,599
guess I could just compile because

1122
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,369
entity won't be a thing there we go so

1123
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:56,500
yeah so in here like this is obviously

1124
00:54:54,369 --> 00:55:00,930
like our brain ID is going to equal the

1125
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,929
brain ID of the hero

1126
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:17,199
and let's see rains obviously would also

1127
00:55:14,739 --> 00:55:21,849
presumably always have their ID I don't

1128
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:24,009
know why we're still storing these in

1129
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:27,509
the hash I guess to just make comparison

1130
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:27,510
faster but I'm going to put you in here

1131
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:51,240
again so I'm that's like an optimization

1132
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:53,250
really of laughing that out but we don't

1133
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:55,858
actually know that that's a win to do

1134
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:58,530
that so it seems kind of stupid to have

1135
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:00,239
that be a thing in there so I would say

1136
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,650
that that that's like a premature

1137
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,809
optimization and we would want to

1138
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,059
actually look at and see if there is a

1139
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:11,279
real reason why we were doing it before

1140
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:14,519
just doing it this is not Nike all right

1141
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,550
so hand made that H has those controller

1142
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:19,800
those controlled heroes and so in here

1143
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:27,869
these are going to be brain like what

1144
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:29,670
brain ID I go with but again that's like

1145
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:31,079
something that we may want to just we

1146
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:32,789
can probably just do the reverse lookup

1147
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:37,910
now but we'll we'll leave it like that

1148
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:41,789
for the time being so yeah bringing ID

1149
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:51,779
is not wait what value is not a member

1150
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:56,068
of brain ID it's not when did it not

1151
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:59,819
when did it cease to become if it's

1152
00:56:56,068 --> 00:57:09,329
index that's no good

1153
00:56:59,818 --> 00:57:15,509
all right so get closest reversible on

1154
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:19,890
this entity so when we do this was doing

1155
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:23,089
the closest one on the head so I guess

1156
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:23,088
this entire thing

1157
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:33,650
I guess this debug spawn code is really

1158
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:36,560
just debug code but we could say that

1159
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:42,889
you know this is this is only happens if

1160
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:49,389
the head is here DT is that something

1161
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:49,389
that is not constructed till later yeah

1162
00:57:59,568 --> 00:58:09,000
let's see con hero consort Andi facing

1163
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:11,250
direction this is again the head and we

1164
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,318
need to clean up this code a lot like a

1165
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:19,858
lot a lot so that's kind of a separate

1166
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:36,420
issue let's see where's my head code

1167
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:37,739
down here and so I guess GDP yeah again

1168
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,440
these are sort of things that are only

1169
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:42,298
going to be used in in a second here but

1170
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,798
we'll see we just have we have way more

1171
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:45,690
this is the kind of code cleanup that's

1172
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:47,429
really hard to do in a handmade hero

1173
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,750
context because normally I'd spend you

1174
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:50,279
know four hours going through all this

1175
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,940
stuff and making it right but it like I

1176
00:58:50,280 --> 00:59:04,170
literally can't which is troublesome but

1177
00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:09,088
anyway so this is the head again and in

1178
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:13,559
here I guess we'd sort of be saying when

1179
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:15,298
we you know we obviously also only ever

1180
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:16,859
do this stuff if we have the head and

1181
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:18,449
we're probably gonna want to coalesce

1182
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:19,739
these out into chunks that are like

1183
00:59:18,449 --> 00:59:21,449
here's the part if we're both the head

1184
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:22,949
and body here's a part for only a body

1185
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:32,358
here's a part for only a head kind of a

1186
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:32,358
thing so these we already have all of

1187
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:40,849
right and these are talking about that

1188
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:40,848
what the body's going to do

1189
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:52,259
and let's see we've got our head Delta

1190
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:54,719
stuff here here if we have a head as

1191
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:56,610
well we figured that out and that's all

1192
00:59:54,719 --> 01:00:02,609
good and off we go

1193
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:06,570
I don't remember how delete entity works

1194
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:23,400
did we actually to be actually implement

1195
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:24,780
that we did so I would like you to be

1196
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,610
able to call the lead on anything even

1197
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,040
if it doesn't exist so I'm gonna leave

1198
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,960
that like this and I'm assuming that we

1199
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:32,190
actually implemented that yeah we did

1200
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:37,289
there we go

1201
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:39,630
okay and so one thing we could do here

1202
01:00:37,289 --> 01:00:42,230
too is we could say like these things to

1203
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:47,550
do fillies in for the brain to do Casey

1204
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:51,179
check that they're not deleted and we do

1205
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:53,400
let's start being more conscientious of

1206
01:00:51,179 --> 01:01:00,809
that aspect of it

1207
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:07,500
brain ID is now nothing and brain ID

1208
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:09,529
value and so this is brain ID and so now

1209
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:17,880
again this little kind of lines up

1210
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:20,400
relatively nicely because we have

1211
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,260
everything slot in properly right this

1212
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,750
is going to return that brain ID that it

1213
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:27,030
generated and now the controller is

1214
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:28,199
attached to that and you can kind of see

1215
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,150
that this is starting to make more sense

1216
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:32,639
now too because before when we did add

1217
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:34,349
player well we we sort of arbitrarily

1218
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,539
said that the player was the head and

1219
01:01:34,349 --> 01:01:38,489
now we don't really have to say that

1220
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:41,400
anymore we just say we created this

1221
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:43,139
notion that there is a group a loose

1222
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,500
collection of things that comprises the

1223
01:01:43,139 --> 01:01:49,019
player it's this if you are playing that

1224
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:52,019
player anything that has that tag is

1225
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:53,880
under your control right and so if we

1226
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:55,650
created more things that would sort of

1227
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,960
glom onto you that's just how that would

1228
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:59,930
work and they

1229
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,710
self-assemble right it's kind of a

1230
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:05,838
bottom-up parsing sort of a situation

1231
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:08,630
okay so I'm gonna end there and go to

1232
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:10,460
Q&amp;A but we have to we've got a bunch of

1233
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,650
we got one more pass over before we're

1234
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,800
actually done so we haven't done this

1235
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:24,639
yet we only did the the initial part but

1236
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:24,640
I'll go ahead and go to the Q&amp;A

1237
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:34,719
and that's good so next we can just

1238
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,848
basically brain week right like next

1239
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:40,539
week we can find figure this out see if

1240
01:02:36,849 --> 01:02:42,910
we can make clean a nice clean set of

1241
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:44,710
controller code for the body pull that

1242
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:47,889
out into a set of files like our brains

1243
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:50,530
file make the snake see if the snake

1244
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:52,839
works and then you know that will tell

1245
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:53,619
us is this was this a good idea it's a

1246
01:02:52,840 --> 01:03:02,039
bad idea

1247
01:02:53,619 --> 01:03:02,039
right and and there you go

1248
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:27,179
questions and answers questions and

1249
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:30,019
answers questions answers no questions

1250
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:30,019
so there are no answers

1251
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:18,079
well this is going to be quick maybe

1252
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:18,859
though I must have missed the bit about

1253
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,730
the snake

1254
01:04:18,858 --> 01:04:33,679
what is that so a snake is I was just

1255
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:36,338
saying like so I was trying to think of

1256
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:38,989
examples of creatures that aggregate

1257
01:04:36,338 --> 01:04:43,818
potentially multiple entities and don't

1258
01:04:38,989 --> 01:04:46,098
necessarily have like a fixed idea of

1259
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:48,469
what comprises them so you know we have

1260
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:52,609
our hero and the hero is comprised of

1261
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:54,078
like the head you know and the body but

1262
01:04:52,608 --> 01:04:54,710
I was thinking another obvious one to

1263
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,298
try

1264
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:58,639
that's just like a standard kind of game

1265
01:04:56,298 --> 01:05:01,338
enemy that would be easy case to

1266
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:04,639
practice on in terms of seeing whether

1267
01:05:01,338 --> 01:05:07,429
this architecture works right is you

1268
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,838
know a snake creature so you know it

1269
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:13,548
starts off and it's kind of got a little

1270
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:16,639
head right and then it's got like a you

1271
01:05:13,548 --> 01:05:22,730
know body parts here and here and then

1272
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:25,608
maybe like a little tail right and so

1273
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:29,269
these could a great up to be a single

1274
01:05:25,608 --> 01:05:30,889
controller as well which can think about

1275
01:05:29,268 --> 01:05:32,750
what it wants to do so it doesn't just

1276
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:34,190
have to like oh each one of these guys

1277
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:35,599
just knows to follow the person in front

1278
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:37,429
of them we can make something more cop

1279
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:42,170
kid like oh we can decide to like swing

1280
01:05:37,429 --> 01:05:47,210
his tail around or do whatever right so

1281
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:48,710
that's what I was thinking of more and

1282
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:51,740
yes someone said it's more of a

1283
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:54,259
millipede and yeah I mean like I guess I

1284
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:58,868
really mean more like centipede like the

1285
01:05:54,259 --> 01:05:58,869
game centipede right it's much closer

1286
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,160
sort of the creature had mind

1287
01:06:09,818 --> 01:06:14,079
how long do you hope this will go on for

1288
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:15,940
do you see some yourself doing some

1289
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,278
doing a different game once this is

1290
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:22,239
finished no this will be like the only

1291
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:24,278
game that I do on a stream because it'll

1292
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:27,369
take a long time like I think I

1293
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:29,498
estimated 600 days and based on where we

1294
01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:31,298
are that might be correct or it might

1295
01:06:29,498 --> 01:06:32,889
not be I don't know there might be too

1296
01:06:31,298 --> 01:06:35,949
much gameplay in here so it might be

1297
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:38,259
that the 600 because remember a day is

1298
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:42,579
only one hour so it's 600 hours it's not

1299
01:06:38,259 --> 01:06:45,400
very many hours to make a game in you

1300
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:45,910
know it's it's 14 weeks or something

1301
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,900
like that

1302
01:06:45,909 --> 01:06:51,818
12 weeks I don't know 14 how many weeks

1303
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:56,528
is that if you were working 40 hours a

1304
01:06:51,818 --> 01:06:57,728
week it's 15 weeks 15 weeks is just not

1305
01:06:56,528 --> 01:06:59,708
very long to make a game from scratch

1306
01:06:57,728 --> 01:07:01,958
you know if you're making a game and

1307
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:03,338
some completely pre-built engine and all

1308
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:06,669
you're doing is like setting some entity

1309
01:07:03,338 --> 01:07:09,058
flags or something then you know short

1310
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:12,749
but if your since we're eight everything

1311
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:15,400
that's just not very much time and so

1312
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:16,419
you know I don't know if if that'll be

1313
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,028
accurate or not because there might be

1314
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:23,769
too much gameplay in this game to get it

1315
01:07:19,028 --> 01:07:25,268
all in that but you mentioned you'd

1316
01:07:23,768 --> 01:07:26,768
spend four hours cleaning code why not

1317
01:07:25,268 --> 01:07:28,838
have a hand made hero day once every

1318
01:07:26,768 --> 01:07:30,698
other month or so and deal with problems

1319
01:07:28,838 --> 01:07:32,108
with that yeah we could I just don't

1320
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:34,838
know how useful that is because like you

1321
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:39,098
can't choose when that happens really I

1322
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:40,599
mean like I could try it's difficult you

1323
01:07:39,099 --> 01:07:43,690
know it's something I would consider as

1324
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:45,338
we get further along potentially easy

1325
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,539
sigh about the one entity per grid

1326
01:07:45,338 --> 01:07:48,099
spot-checking how will you handle

1327
01:07:46,539 --> 01:07:50,019
leaving a spot just before a monster

1328
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:51,519
lands there right now it's binary do you

1329
01:07:50,018 --> 01:07:53,409
plan to add a fuzziness as you step out

1330
01:07:51,518 --> 01:07:55,718
the square onto another one and a

1331
01:07:53,409 --> 01:08:00,129
monster lands on your spot we will see

1332
01:07:55,719 --> 01:08:04,900
how it goes at the moment the answer is

1333
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:06,969
that in general I think that you're

1334
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:12,719
probably thinking of it slightly

1335
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:12,719
differently which is to say that

1336
01:08:14,989 --> 01:08:19,710
the case is more about you hopping on to

1337
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:21,270
a monster slot coz a monster is never

1338
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:22,980
gonna hop on to your spot unless it's

1339
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,630
attacking you and intact doesn't have to

1340
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:28,678
give up the square that it's on probably

1341
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:30,569
my guess but it's probably more like if

1342
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:32,460
a monster was hopping off of this slot

1343
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:35,609
and you're about to hop on to it what

1344
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:38,250
happens right and I still think it is

1345
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:39,809
it's just when you're here everything up

1346
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:41,279
to this point you're still on this

1347
01:08:39,809 --> 01:08:43,529
Square and if you want to cross that

1348
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,719
center line this guy's got to be

1349
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:49,020
vacating right this guy's got to be

1350
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:50,939
vacating a square and when we do that I

1351
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,650
think we'll probably be like earliest

1352
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:55,138
option to vacate or something

1353
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:57,118
so monsters will probably vacate

1354
01:08:55,139 --> 01:08:58,828
immediately if they can they'll look

1355
01:08:57,118 --> 01:09:00,328
look at this is they'll vacate right

1356
01:08:58,828 --> 01:09:04,769
here and then jump off so you'll be able

1357
01:09:00,328 --> 01:09:07,710
to jump in but either way like this is

1358
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:10,109
just how the game design works so there

1359
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,399
may be some janky nough Swit goes like

1360
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:16,230
that may not be the smoothest feeling

1361
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:19,408
thing but tough right the game design

1362
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:24,149
requires that you can always be on a

1363
01:09:19,408 --> 01:09:26,629
particular square and so that's just how

1364
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:26,629
that'll be

1365
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,659
guitar someday I will have to ask you

1366
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:58,369
about how to think when representing

1367
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:00,289
dating the program I understand struck

1368
01:09:58,369 --> 01:10:05,420
seems a raisin such but what regulates

1369
01:10:00,289 --> 01:10:06,769
when to use which well I mean basically

1370
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:09,890
if you've been watching handmade hero

1371
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:11,570
you can see the process it's not there

1372
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:17,980
isn't a rule about when to use which

1373
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:21,500
it's about having gone through enough

1374
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:23,119
architecture to know how to experiment

1375
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,460
and figure out right because you'll

1376
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:27,890
notice like anytime I'm at something

1377
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:29,060
where I I don't have a prefab solution

1378
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,890
in my head where I'm like this is how I

1379
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:32,060
like to do X it's like something I've

1380
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,920
never done before or it's something

1381
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:36,650
where I want to try a new way of doing

1382
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,239
it than what I used to do I go through

1383
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:41,210
some permutations right I don't just sit

1384
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,709
down and go here's the answer because

1385
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:45,230
we're not far enough along in

1386
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:48,380
programming as an art form or a science

1387
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:50,928
to know the answer to have a structure a

1388
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:54,560
program only very very simple programs

1389
01:10:50,929 --> 01:10:58,699
have that right have a known best answer

1390
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:02,270
and usually you know what you are

1391
01:10:58,698 --> 01:11:04,039
writing is not unknown thing so the

1392
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:05,600
answer is rarely how do you know which

1393
01:11:04,039 --> 01:11:07,850
is when what's use and here are the

1394
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,190
rules it's more like you need to do the

1395
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:12,380
things I do on handmade hero right you

1396
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:14,299
need to go through and do architecture

1397
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:16,760
many times different kinds of

1398
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:18,739
architecture and practice seeing how

1399
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,600
they come out and then your brain will

1400
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:22,939
start to train up on knowing how to do

1401
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,440
that path finding right and I don't

1402
01:11:22,939 --> 01:11:26,419
think there's a substitute for that

1403
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:29,089
people who think that they can draw like

1404
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,140
UML diagrams or that here's this method

1405
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:32,150
of drawing things on index cards

1406
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:34,960
whatever it's like no it's like that is

1407
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:38,809
not work the thing that works is

1408
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,880
practice and in learning to do it it's

1409
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:43,070
like you know no one can tell you how to

1410
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,929
hit a golf ball or kick a soccer ball or

1411
01:11:43,069 --> 01:11:46,759
whatever it's like they can coach you

1412
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:48,289
and you can see you do it and go oh

1413
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,060
you're not thinking about these

1414
01:11:48,289 --> 01:11:52,670
correctly whatever they can give you

1415
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:55,190
advice to guide you as you get better at

1416
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:56,929
this thing and watching someone who

1417
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:59,899
knows how to do it helps you get better

1418
01:11:56,929 --> 01:12:02,359
at that thing but there is no do these

1419
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:04,519
rules and outcomes the thing we're not

1420
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,739
anywhere close to that programming is

1421
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:09,250
way more like

1422
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:11,979
a sport or an art or anything else then

1423
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:14,770
it is a series of steps you just wrote

1424
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:16,389
apply because our understanding of it

1425
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:17,530
just isn't at that point yet and we

1426
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:19,660
don't even know if it ever be but

1427
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:23,920
assuming that someday it would be we're

1428
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:25,329
just not there yet so I would think of

1429
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,859
it more as like practice practice

1430
01:12:25,329 --> 01:12:29,470
practice practice do lots of

1431
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:31,239
architectures try lots of different ways

1432
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:32,829
of approaching the same problem write

1433
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:34,630
down why they succeeded and why they

1434
01:12:32,829 --> 01:12:36,309
failed write down what you think was

1435
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:38,199
better about one than the other how much

1436
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:41,260
code did they take how many bugs did you

1437
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:43,239
have right start to internalize all of

1438
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:48,640
those things because that's really the

1439
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:53,469
the key to understood to getting good

1440
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:56,530
enough to stop having problems working

1441
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:58,869
throughout architecture right and even

1442
01:12:56,529 --> 01:13:03,429
if you are very experienced at it and

1443
01:12:58,869 --> 01:13:06,189
have done it a lot even at that point

1444
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:08,170
you were still the reason you are good

1445
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:10,059
at it is not because you sit down and

1446
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:12,789
immediately know the answer it's because

1447
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:16,120
you know the process that you can use to

1448
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:17,920
iterate to get to the answer right or to

1449
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:19,750
get to the answer and answer that is

1450
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,369
good enough because there isn't a the

1451
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:26,590
answer there's many ways it could happen

1452
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:27,609
right so yeah practice observe and if

1453
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:30,130
you could find someone to give you

1454
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:32,079
advice like a like a mentor to give you

1455
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:33,690
advice about what you may or may not

1456
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:35,470
have done wrong in a program

1457
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:37,689
architecture that's another good thing

1458
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:40,180
to write just like you know in the

1459
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:42,189
sports analogy having a good coach helps

1460
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:43,900
they can't tell you how to do the thing

1461
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:46,419
but they can give you pointers that help

1462
01:13:43,899 --> 01:13:47,739
guide your practice of like ah yeah

1463
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,989
that's right you know maybe I'm dropping

1464
01:13:47,739 --> 01:13:51,760
my shoulder when I'm pitching this you

1465
01:13:49,989 --> 01:13:53,139
know pitch and it goes a little wild and

1466
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,199
they told me like keep the shoulder up

1467
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:59,400
and oh yeah there we go right that can

1468
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:59,399
help it in programming too right

1469
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:10,250
long brilliant so the idea is to have

1470
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,720
the entity system both be able to

1471
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:13,670
support groups of entities that change

1472
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,320
from one into another like a monster

1473
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:17,180
that mimics other objects and entities

1474
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:18,319
that when separated from the group can

1475
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:20,000
take action on their own like a

1476
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:24,259
necromancer resurrecting a ripped off

1477
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:32,229
arm yeah I mean the idea is simply to be

1478
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:36,800
able to form to be able to form without

1479
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:41,899
limitation sections that act on their

1480
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:43,940
own right so you know normally we might

1481
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:46,629
say each entity can think and it does a

1482
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:48,829
thing but I want to be able to have

1483
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:50,300
algorithms operate across entities

1484
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:51,949
because that was becoming a problem and

1485
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,659
I didn't like what that was going so the

1486
01:14:51,949 --> 01:14:55,849
idea here is just to make it simple you

1487
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:58,039
know it's very simple with our MV system

1488
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:58,820
now I believe and going forward so we'll

1489
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:00,769
get better and better

1490
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:03,500
it'll be very simple to do things like I

1491
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:05,300
want this thing to be more cursed or

1492
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:09,260
mote you know or to have a curse on it

1493
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:10,640
or do whatever right I think you know

1494
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:12,380
the way we're working on the ending

1495
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,289
system it'll be easy to just add stuff

1496
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:17,300
that you want but what it wasn't easy to

1497
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:20,899
do with the way that we had it was have

1498
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:22,579
multiple things have a piece of code

1499
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:24,949
that thinks across several of them at

1500
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:28,039
once and we were we were butting up

1501
01:15:24,949 --> 01:15:31,159
against that and so that's the reason

1502
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:32,779
this entity system I think wanted this

1503
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:34,880
sort of layer the brain layer that I

1504
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:36,529
wanted to try adding it so that I could

1505
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,779
write code that thinks across multiple

1506
01:15:36,529 --> 01:15:40,779
entities and make that be clean and easy

1507
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,730
so they left topic on average how many

1508
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:53,229
hours a day do you work on 1935

1509
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:55,578
well I'm at work from about 9:00 to 4:00

1510
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:57,019
and you know there's maybe like an hour

1511
01:15:55,578 --> 01:16:02,960
of lunch in there so so what is that

1512
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:09,260
like six hours or something yeah it's

1513
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:11,389
usually like six hours of of 1935 it's

1514
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:13,820
you know two hours roughly on handmade

1515
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:15,319
here or an hour and a half and then

1516
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:17,539
there's usually like an hour to of

1517
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:19,189
programming on web stuff or whatever the

1518
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:21,800
latest thing is like having to implement

1519
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:23,979
a mailing with system because whatever a

1520
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,980
bit

1521
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:32,480
Piggin heart on the note of UML how much

1522
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:34,519
or often would you say you deal with

1523
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:36,319
that at work if at all I've I've

1524
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,969
literally never seen anyone draw a UML

1525
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:41,500
diagram in my entire history of the game

1526
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:44,000
industry under any circumstances ever

1527
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,439
guitar 87 good answer I understand what

1528
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,020
you mean just do it enough and you'll

1529
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,019
see what works experience thanks yes yes

1530
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:55,579
Elysium have you thought about using

1531
01:16:51,859 --> 01:16:58,880
Vulcan so I think I've covered that

1532
01:16:55,579 --> 01:17:00,979
before like I looked at the design of

1533
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:04,329
Vulcan and I don't like it so we we will

1534
01:17:00,979 --> 01:17:04,329
almost certainly not use it on streem

1535
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:12,020
like the only reason we use it if for

1536
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:14,948
some reason we had to all right I'm

1537
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,949
gonna wrap it up here

1538
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:29,380
all right ooh

1539
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:31,270
as I dropped my water bottom glad these

1540
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:33,699
things are sealed well didn't spill at

1541
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:34,780
all thank you very much for joining me

1542
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:36,010
for a notice of hand right here it's

1543
01:17:34,779 --> 01:17:38,139
been a pleasure coding with you as

1544
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:39,340
always if you would like to follow along

1545
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,630
with source code at home you can always

1546
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:42,909
pre-order the game on handmade hero

1547
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:45,039
organ it comes with a source code so

1548
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:47,260
that you can sort of do experience with

1549
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:49,269
it and so on we also have a forum site

1550
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:50,829
you can go to if you would like to ask

1551
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,240
questions we have a patreon page you can

1552
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:55,090
use to support the video series if you

1553
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:56,079
like what you see and want to show your

1554
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:58,119
appreciation it's always much

1555
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,769
appreciated on our and certainly we also

1556
01:17:58,119 --> 01:18:01,659
have a schedule bot which tweets the

1557
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:03,070
schedule for the live stream so if you

1558
01:18:01,659 --> 01:18:06,399
want to know when they're gonna be you

1559
01:18:03,069 --> 01:18:08,019
can take a look at that or follow it on

1560
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:11,589
Twitter and it will tell you and then we

1561
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:13,630
also have a episode guide maintained by

1562
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:19,390
the king of annotation midlow himself

1563
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:23,020
and that got even cooler recently so

1564
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:24,600
there is now like a thing I don't really

1565
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:27,600
know how to get to it but I'll show you

1566
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,600
Andrew

1567
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:32,230
well his name is Andrew Johnson but he's

1568
01:18:29,829 --> 01:18:34,869
Andrew he's like Andrew JDR up here it

1569
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:37,419
is he's like Andrew JDR on like a

1570
01:18:34,869 --> 01:18:40,300
usually on like his handle that gone on

1571
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:41,949
a chats and stuff like that but he made

1572
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:44,980
this new thing so if you are someone who

1573
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:46,899
has pre-ordered the game you can use

1574
01:18:44,979 --> 01:18:48,639
your github access like the send owl

1575
01:18:46,899 --> 01:18:49,750
download page when you when you peer to

1576
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,920
the game you get like a little send out

1577
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:52,090
down you could download source and stuff

1578
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,699
there's a thing on there that's like

1579
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:56,440
github access and if you haven't done

1580
01:18:54,699 --> 01:18:58,479
that yet you can use that you can go

1581
01:18:56,439 --> 01:19:00,189
grab that key and you can put it in and

1582
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:01,329
authorize it's got instructions there it

1583
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:03,009
could authorize yourself for github

1584
01:19:01,329 --> 01:19:05,319
access on the github

1585
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:06,340
Andrew junior created this repository

1586
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:07,929
that's pretty cool

1587
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,460
you should check it out if you're if you

1588
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:12,100
try to follow along with the series at

1589
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:14,409
home because it's basically got this

1590
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:17,560
HTML directory which is just every file

1591
01:19:14,409 --> 01:19:19,420
as it currently is in the game but

1592
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,630
instead of these file being a CPP or an

1593
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:26,590
H file it's actually just an HTML file

1594
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:30,069
of the source code but in line with the

1595
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:31,270
source code I actually don't know how

1596
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:33,699
you wait oh sorry

1597
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:35,760
never mind it's the MD for some reason

1598
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:36,970
even though there's an HTML directory

1599
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,260
github

1600
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:39,640
use it so you can download it and do

1601
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,810
that but get up can't play it if you go

1602
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:43,000
to the MB directory it can display

1603
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:44,740
directly so if you click on one of those

1604
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,619
it will show you the source code and

1605
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:50,769
