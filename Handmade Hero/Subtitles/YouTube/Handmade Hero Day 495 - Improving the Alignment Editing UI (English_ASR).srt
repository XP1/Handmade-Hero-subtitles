00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,259
hello everybody and welcome handmade

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,990
here oh sure we could a complete-game

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,759
live on stream we are going to do I

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,949
guess you know honestly what it is

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,440
really is skeletal animation is what

6
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:19,919
we're doing today we don't have a need

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,600
for the deformations stuff that you

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,279
might do in a normal skeletal animation

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,590
system because we don't have 3d objects

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,390
we don't even really have any bone

11
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:32,099
binding information for our 2d objects

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,739
per se but even so we do kind of want to

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,019
animate them as if they did meaning we

14
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,549
want like a bunch of secondary stuff so

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,440
when our characters hop around we want

16
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,099
the heads to be kind of springy and we

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,479
implemented some of that stuff before

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,939
but the way that we did it was in a

19
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,738
fairly rudimentary sense where you

20
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:51,419
couldn't really build up any kind of

21
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,488
skeleton a priori and give it

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,739
information that would then look to the

23
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:58,468
art to see how it should be connected

24
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,599
and so what we want to do today and we

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,730
set ourselves up to do this yesterday

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,549
but we didn't actually have time to go

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,759
and start working on the code for the

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,740
actual sort of skeletal part of it is we

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,420
want to go in and add that ability

30
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,429
because now we have a little editor in

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,930
the game that allows us to like markup

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,490
our stuff with points that say out

33
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,070
things snap together that's basically

34
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:22,199
what a skeletal animation system does

35
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,269
offline usually so for example if

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,400
someone inside Maya creates a little

37
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,920
bone structure that bone structure is

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,380
typically exported and then you load it

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,540
into your game and those bones tell you

40
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,670
the information that we would want

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,530
inside handmade hero which is how does

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,540
each piece connect and where do they

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,219
connect right but we don't have that

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,990
information because our stuff just comes

45
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,609
in two sprites and that's intentional

46
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,559
because we don't really want to insert

47
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,819
tools into the art chain that are

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,040
complicated because this is supposed to

49
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,599
be an educational project and we want

50
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,310
people be able to add to it easily so if

51
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,618
they just can draw a bitmap in a bitmap

52
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,329
tool you want them be able to put that

53
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,950
into this game eventually right if

54
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,968
people are playing with it themselves we

55
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,950
don't want them to have to learn

56
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:03,059
something like Maya we don't want them

57
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,880
to have to learn something like spriter

58
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,960
if they can just use like Photoshop we

59
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:08,519
want to be able to get stuff into the

60
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,530
game but what that means is there's no

61
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,330
markup in there right there's nothing

62
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,699
that says how heads connect to bodies

63
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,620
and inside our

64
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:17,899
code we could special case every last

65
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,060
little thing and just describe all of

66
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,459
that in code but if we did that then

67
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,189
people who add new head's new bodies new

68
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:27,019
whatever couldn't really ever change the

69
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,789
basics of how they worked they couldn't

70
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:30,140
have heads that attached like lower on

71
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:31,609
the body or something for someone who

72
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,988
was hunched over or whatever right

73
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,580
they couldn't have bodies that had a

74
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,310
long skinny neck and put the head up at

75
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,830
the top instead if we hard-code all of

76
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,689
those ideas about how things are

77
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,489
attached directly into the code it

78
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:45,590
becomes much more limiting in terms of

79
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,239
what you can do when you put art into

80
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,950
the game and want to implement new

81
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,989
entities that maybe don't look exactly

82
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:54,018
like the old entities that were already

83
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:56,360
programmed by me so that's the goal and

84
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:57,709
we did a lot of work to make that happen

85
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,840
we have the ability to specify

86
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,180
attachment points in a fairly arbitrary

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,069
way and we now have an editor that lets

88
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,920
you in game adjust those attachment

89
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:09,919
points what we don't have is anything

90
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,419
that actually uses them right so we're

91
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,949
trying to do now is go back to that

92
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,619
stuff where we had the rudimentary

93
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:17,598
skeletal animation going on and we need

94
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,090
to rethink how that's working a little

95
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,919
bit to sort of start to use these points

96
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,920
and see where they should more

97
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,750
appropriately go right we want to figure

98
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,899
out kind of where that stuff is supposed

99
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,489
to happen and so what we want to do is

100
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,239
we want to have a way of saying look

101
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:39,200
when I animate this thing I animate my

102
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:42,139
my you know my the base of this this guy

103
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,089
like the torso whatever and maybe that's

104
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,069
attached directly to the world so I just

105
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,109
moved that point around but then the

106
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:50,419
head is like attached to the torso so

107
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:51,620
any animation that the head has I really

108
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,048
just kind of want to be able to describe

109
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,450
it relative to the place where it was

110
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,370
attached I I don't want to have to try

111
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,119
and animate the head to always appear to

112
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,219
be on the body

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,259
I want it just to naturally stick on the

114
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:05,000
body wherever it should and then I can

115
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,399
add any secondary motion I want right

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,379
that's the basic idea behind a skeletal

117
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,000
animation system is look we know these

118
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:12,918
things have to maintain their

119
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,289
connectivity that's you know how they

120
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,959
would work in the real world so I just

121
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:21,918
am going to keep them that way all the

122
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,959
time by default and they're offset from

123
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,539
that is all I'm really going to be

124
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:29,250
animating right so that's what we want

125
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,410
to start working with right we want to

126
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,970
start getting that sort of we want that

127
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,590
idea to be baked into how we're

128
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,510
animating things which is going to

129
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:41,669
require us to unwind a little bit of

130
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:43,680
what we did and sort of port it to

131
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,949
something that's a little bit more about

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,569
relative movement but fortunately we

133
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,490
haven't really written much animation

134
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,439
code we just did some basic stuff so

135
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,819
it's not like we have a ton invested in

136
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,500
the old way of doing things anyway it

137
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,159
was kind of all sketched out just in a

138
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,110
basic way so that's what we're moving

139
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,210
towards today I think we should be able

140
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:15,480
to make a good dent in that so let's get

141
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:16,620
started oh okay so running the game so

142
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,530
we could take stock of where we're at

143
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,720
here oops I guess I accidentally nuked

144
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:23,789
our thing when I did MS dev CL on the

145
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,550
priests name there okay there we go uh

146
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,290
so you know getting started with this

147
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,689
you can see you know we've got right now

148
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,650
we're loading the cat as our as our hero

149
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:36,629
so what you can see is we're at a point

150
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:38,879
where we've done all the work to import

151
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,199
new art assets such as the CAC we have

152
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,420
an editor that would allow us to select

153
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,829
the cat and we can even change like

154
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,949
alignment points and stuff like that

155
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:48,599
right but what we don't really do is use

156
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,149
those alignment points in any way to

157
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,650
actually connect things so a couple of

158
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:56,729
things here are the things I want to do

159
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:58,469
in in no particular order today so we

160
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,080
want to snap the cat's head to the cat's

161
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,430
body right we want it to go up here so

162
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,680
that's gonna require to set two

163
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,410
alignment points one is this alignment

164
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,069
point right which says where on the cat

165
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,689
head we want to snap to right and so

166
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:15,509
it's probably something like this point

167
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:18,389
right here so you want two things one we

168
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,579
want to do that snap in two we want to

169
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,129
see that snapping point so I want to add

170
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:25,439
something that's when I'm doing this

171
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:27,959
right when I'm editing an alignment

172
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,480
point I want to have a notion of the

173
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,449
fact that I'm editing it and I want to

174
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,759
draw it so I can see it because right

175
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,409
now I don't really know where it is like

176
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,699
I've got a vague idea that it's probably

177
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,710
in the center of this thing

178
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,339
this this rectangle here that we're

179
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:43,799
drawing is

180
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:48,149
election box but I don't really know

181
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,639
right so I want to draw that point too I

182
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,649
need to be able to say when I do this

183
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,990
stuff here so I say look that's the

184
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:56,969
default alignment point but then maybe

185
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,978
later when I'm doing this I add one

186
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,639
right and I'm gonna add in here the base

187
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:04,560
of neck I want to be able to snap those

188
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,269
together so I want to be able to say

189
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,899
look the default of this goes to the

190
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,698
base of neck

191
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,769
you saw me write the code for that

192
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,478
yesterday so the entities the entities

193
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:14,689
know they're supposed to be doing that

194
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,728
they're just not doing it so I need the

195
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:20,160
implementation of that snap so this will

196
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:23,039
snap to here when I actually set it and

197
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,470
then finally of course I need there to

198
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,939
be some way to draw that so when I'm

199
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,130
moving this around I need to see that

200
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:30,899
point so I can position it right where

201
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:33,659
it it should be in terms of the head

202
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,579
attachment right so I need all those

203
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,030
things then we got to do a couple other

204
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,969
things

205
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:40,978
remember selecting an entity it might

206
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,139
have multiple parts of my have multiple

207
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,089
components I want those components

208
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,460
listed in the editor so I can pick which

209
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,679
one I'm editing head or body right for

210
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,620
example I want that in the air so we got

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,569
to get that in there and then finally we

212
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,519
need to start talking about sizes right

213
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:58,379
now like this cats way too big right the

214
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,819
cat should occupy like one square it

215
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,519
should be fairly tiny on the square

216
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,620
that's something that we want to start

217
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,680
working on in terms of how we specify

218
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,478
the sizes of things and that's gonna

219
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,220
require two things one it's gonna

220
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:14,310
require us to start obeying these

221
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,200
relative size information pieces that we

222
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,269
put on there but number two it's gonna

223
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,459
require us to start thinking about how

224
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:24,089
we want to actually specify size to

225
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:28,079
begin with because we have we want that

226
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:32,098
to work in a very broad parametric sense

227
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:35,490
what I mean by that I mean that let's

228
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:39,028
suppose you are a human right and then

229
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,589
you are turned into a cat there's two

230
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:43,679
ways we might want to think about that

231
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,930
one is that you become a cat cat size

232
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,319
and one is that you become a cat at

233
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:54,059
human size right another way to state

234
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,580
that would be if a human got a cat head

235
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,439
for some reason

236
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,139
cathead shouldn't be cat head sized

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,090
probably chances are what you wanted is

238
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,819
for the cat head to be human head sized

239
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:07,129
what that means is that we have two

240
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,020
notions of scale we have a notion of

241
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,389
scale that says how big the thing is

242
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:14,569
relative to whatever the general scale

243
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:17,449
is so for example this bitmap is

244
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,960
supposed to be roughly this size for a

245
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,120
head so head shape how do I fill out the

246
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,290
how big should this bitmap be scaled to

247
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,360
occupy the size of a head then there's

248
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:31,939
another scale which is how big is this

249
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,940
entity which determines how big its head

250
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,520
is regardless of which one of those

251
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,320
bitmaps it chooses if it chooses a human

252
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,929
head or a cat head it should still be

253
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,250
the same size similarly if a cat ends up

254
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:45,229
with a human head that head should be

255
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,120
small like the small cat head would be

256
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,250
so you see there's there's different

257
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,049
things there right there's the size of

258
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,139
this head relative to other heads so we

259
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:56,240
know how they all line up to keep all

260
00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:00,470
heads to be roughly the same size no

261
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,269
matter how the artist drew them and then

262
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,850
there's how do we actually want to talk

263
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,740
about the size of this entity and we

264
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,080
have those two things already in the

265
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,789
game but we have to make sure that now

266
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,580
we're rigorous about it because a

267
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:15,769
mistake in that line will cause us to

268
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,920
lose that ability to mix and match parts

269
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:21,110
and we'll have this gigantic explosion

270
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,329
of special case hacks that are doing

271
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,070
things like checking oh if I'm a cat

272
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,570
head on a human body then add this

273
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,420
excellent right we don't want any of

274
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,460
that we want that to just work so it's

275
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:34,189
excellent we know everything we have to

276
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,170
do we've got a clear test case here like

277
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,910
I want my cat to look right when it's

278
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,169
hopping around and obviously it looks

279
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:41,000
completely wrong right now

280
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:43,939
so we know when we've done the right

281
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,299
thing and so let's just start working on

282
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:50,150
that part of the problem right and we'll

283
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:53,329
take each one of those things as we go

284
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:55,879
okay so let's start with something basic

285
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:58,670
let's start with being able to see the

286
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:00,620
point that we reading and pick which one

287
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:02,299
of the things in the list we're going to

288
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,460
edit we know those things have to happen

289
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:06,589
we just got finished doing the editor

290
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,810
let's actually go ahead and add some

291
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,320
stuff to it while it's still fresh in

292
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,969
our mind

293
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,070
how it works so that if we find there

294
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,670
are some things that we can't do that we

295
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:20,090
would like to do that can be improved

296
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:23,269
right so what we want to do here is say

297
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:26,120
look inside you know inside this system

298
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,279
there's we want to maybe be able to draw

299
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,279
our attachment points like we maybe want

300
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,750
to be able to draw which attachment

301
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,039
points are being used or something like

302
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,120
this and there's a couple of different

303
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,919
ways we can do that

304
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,960
I think the way that I would like to do

305
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,539
it first is just by drawing all

306
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,610
attachment points and then maybe we add

307
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:46,429
the ability to turn them on and off at

308
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,379
will let's see again and remember one of

309
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:50,149
things I was ragging on QT the other day

310
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:53,600
and here's another good example of why I

311
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:55,730
rag on Qt all the time it's because I

312
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,190
hate those retain mode kind of things I

313
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,920
just want to show how easy it is when

314
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:03,470
you're not doing that to just add things

315
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,240
in in a trivial way right it just it you

316
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,920
don't have to retain any information you

317
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,480
don't have to make creation calls or any

318
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,639
of this sort of stuff you can just add

319
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,370
stuff freely and it just becomes very

320
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,289
very easy I know our UI system is crappy

321
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,049
because we spent no time on it so I know

322
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:21,889
it's not very good but still even in

323
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:24,500
it's such crappy state watch how easy it

324
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:26,659
is to do stuff to it without ever having

325
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,299
to really change the UI system and

326
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:31,159
keeping all of the data on our side

327
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:34,339
under our control in the place that we

328
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:37,159
want right so let's go ahead and do that

329
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,810
so if I want to inside my editor right

330
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,629
let's say I want I know that we've got

331
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:45,189
these instant in the file formats I know

332
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:48,799
that we've got like this notion of these

333
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,870
inside each of the bitmaps I've got this

334
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,699
set of alignment points right so I know

335
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,799
that I've got these HHA alignment points

336
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,509
and here you can see like how many of

337
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,519
them there are right I've got 12 of

338
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,340
these and so that's how many we were

339
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,470
drawing right so what I'd like to do is

340
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,330
I'd like to draw all of them I'd like to

341
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,279
draw them all in different colors so I

342
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,690
can see them quickly let's say so I'd

343
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,519
like a color table I don't know if we

344
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,520
have a color table it looks like we do

345
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:25,749
maybe we have a color table but it's not

346
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:30,509
the world's best color table because as

347
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:30,509
you can see here doesn't go up very high

348
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:40,358
one two three four five six seven eight

349
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:43,629
nine ten I'd like to get maybe at least

350
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:51,129
sixteen colors in here yeah I'm saying

351
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:52,479
to you about thirty forty fifty so I'd

352
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,100
like to go ahead and make it so that I

353
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:57,160
can draw these in some you know

354
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,209
different color right I'd like to I'd

355
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,738
like to have more of these and

356
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,448
furthermore I kind of want this color

357
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:03,548
table everywhere so I'm gonna call this

358
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:04,719
well actually you know what it is it's a

359
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:06,639
it's already even though it's debug

360
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,089
color table its it's already global and

361
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,519
it's not tied to the debug system so

362
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:14,079
that's fine right so you can see here is

363
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,350
we kind of have our Fulbright's here

364
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:20,108
we've got red green blue then we've got

365
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,629
magenta cyan and I'm sorry yellow cyan

366
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:25,600
and magenta we then have sort of the

367
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:28,359
half colors right we've got you know the

368
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,918
half colors here for each of our our

369
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:32,079
Fulbright's and we have all the

370
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:34,328
permutations of that and then when we

371
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:38,408
get down here we kind of start to run

372
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:41,308
out of colors at this point so I'm gonna

373
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:41,308
have to make up some new ones

374
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:53,230
maybe what we're gonna do is some more

375
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:55,570
subtle gradations there you know maybe

376
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:59,320
we can do some clothes that look maybe

377
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:04,089
more like this so if we do that that

378
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,890
gives us a lot more options for for how

379
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,130
we distribute because since there's more

380
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:11,409
of these you know I can I can kind of

381
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:13,838
run the I can run the clock out there

382
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:16,719
for a while and just say all right we've

383
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,670
got you know that and then we've also

384
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,470
got boobs maybe I'll do it keep the

385
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:27,699
order the same there got that and that

386
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:29,950
and then I've got this guy and that gets

387
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,390
me up to 16 don't know if those are the

388
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,830
best color choices maybe we can try and

389
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,850
pick some better ones later but you know

390
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,649
there we go that's talking about color

391
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:39,250
table so I want to be able to draw these

392
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:40,419
points and I want to be able to draw you

393
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,909
know so when I'm renting one of these

394
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,949
elements I want to be able to show where

395
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:47,769
all the attachment points actually works

396
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,950
and that will help us in the future to

397
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:54,639
like kind of debug what's going on with

398
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,680
it so if I drop into the entity system

399
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,019
here and we go down to where these are

400
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:02,349
actually being processed so inside the

401
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:05,289
piece indexes here for each piece we can

402
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,149
see in here whether or not this is the

403
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:10,539
the one that we're trying to highlight

404
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:12,909
right and so when we push the volume

405
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:17,079
outline on there what I can do in that

406
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:19,870
case as well is I can for each of the

407
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,560
none for each of its alignment points

408
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,929
that was set I could draw that here as a

409
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,399
point right I could draw a little box in

410
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:29,399
place so that's what I want to do

411
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:41,579
so let's do that let's get the align

412
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:44,339
point index and we'll just go through we

413
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:47,099
know what the bitmap is it's in here and

414
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,750
what I should probably do here is maybe

415
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,209
make that be something that happens in

416
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:57,240
here because it we don't have these

417
00:16:51,208 --> 00:17:00,659
otherwise right oops

418
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,990
and furthermore if I'm doing two of

419
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,439
these

420
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:12,838
maybe this are equal here maybe that

421
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:14,069
should just kind of come up here oops so

422
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:18,869
there I've got like a little highlighted

423
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:20,428
option that I check and that way you

424
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,889
know as far as the hit test is concerned

425
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,750
I can always just ask that it you know

426
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,910
is it highlighted and that way we know

427
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,439
that if we want to change the rules for

428
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,548
how we do highlighting we just do it in

429
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,620
one place we don't have to do it

430
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,910
everywhere in the code so if we're

431
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:35,609
highlighting we go through all of these

432
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,679
so here's that bitmap I have to fit my

433
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:38,729
info I guess oh and furthermore I guess

434
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,009
that's have to go inside here because

435
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,740
it's only if we actually succeeded in

436
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:45,150
getting the bitmap we know that that

437
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,829
bitmap info is the thing that has the

438
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,630
actual line points on it right remember

439
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:50,939
that's this thing here so you want to

440
00:17:48,630 --> 00:18:00,659
look at all those aligned points in

441
00:17:50,940 --> 00:18:02,580
order like so and as we go through each

442
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,440
of those aligned points we want to get

443
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,859
out what the align point actually was

444
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,370
and draw it now we don't want to do that

445
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:14,250
because we can we can do the get type on

446
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:16,798
that we don't want to actually get the

447
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,619
align point in the case where the align

448
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:23,970
point is set to none because remember

449
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:25,639
everything can have 12 of them cuz we

450
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,779
just packed a bunch of data in there and

451
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,690
just you know that's how much room we

452
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,369
have so we just used it right everything

453
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,900
can have 12 of them and if you can have

454
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:35,250
12 of them it means that a lot of them

455
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,840
aren't gonna be set we're never gonna

456
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,429
have 12 like the number of attachment

457
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,428
points probably 2 or 3 for most things

458
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:52,549
so in that case you can see we really

459
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,928
want to check first you don't want to be

460
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,989
drawing a ton of points that don't mean

461
00:18:53,929 --> 00:19:01,729
anything it just clutters the view so

462
00:18:56,989 --> 00:19:04,129
here in HHA a line point ap I'm just

463
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:06,229
gonna grab the one we're talking about

464
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:08,898
in this iteration of the loop I'm gonna

465
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:12,139
ask what type it is

466
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:13,548
and I'm gonna say if that's not none at

467
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:15,228
the moment I don't need to know the type

468
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:17,019
any more than that and it may be in the

469
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:19,190
future we want to be able to stick some

470
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:20,388
information on there or something but

471
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,788
the moment we don't want that so I'm

472
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:25,098
just gonna say I'm gonna get the type

473
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:27,618
and if the alignment point is not none

474
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:30,229
I'm gonna draw it right I'm just gonna

475
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:31,968
draw it in there so in order to do that

476
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:35,028
I don't know like our renderer doesn't

477
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:38,119
really have the idea of points per se I

478
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:39,528
don't think so you know I'm probably

479
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,848
gonna have to put a cube on there

480
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:43,548
because we don't really have anything

481
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:45,618
else right it's not so much that I want

482
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:48,048
to push a cube it's just that I don't

483
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:50,868
really have anything else so I'm gonna

484
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:53,138
push a cube on there and I'm just gonna

485
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:56,449
push a really small cube on there right

486
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:58,098
I'm not gonna use any actual texture on

487
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:01,219
it so I'm just gonna take the render

488
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:03,019
group and I'm gonna use the white

489
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:04,580
texture on it so I'm not gonna actually

490
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:07,759
put that and then I'm gonna set the

491
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:09,319
color so we know what the point is gonna

492
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,409
be whatever the alignment point should

493
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,538
be so we don't know what that is till we

494
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,580
compute it we do know the radius is

495
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:21,229
going to be something tiny and then we

496
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:23,628
know the color Jimmy we know that color

497
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:25,038
is going to be that that sort of debug

498
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:28,579
color table stuff that I was talking

499
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:30,169
about before so let me see do we have a

500
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:32,798
get D we don't have a get debug color

501
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:32,799
call yet

502
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:43,819
it would appear take a look here

503
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:44,869
I tell you these little crackers are

504
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:55,308
good but they kind of got stuck in my

505
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:58,369
throat I need to work on my sponsorships

506
00:20:55,308 --> 00:21:00,170
I need like a sponsorship for those

507
00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:05,089
little oatmeal cookies there's super

508
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:06,590
delicious you know I'm saying you got to

509
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:13,240
sign those those big deals those big

510
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:16,579
advertiser deals hi I'm Casey Mira Tori

511
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,370
when I'm programming I like to eat you

512
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:24,470
know I don't forget their nature valley

513
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:25,789
almond buttered biscuits and sometimes

514
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,079
they get stuck in my throat but don't

515
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,079
let that stop you from buying them

516
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:36,678
because they're delicious and when you

517
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:39,439
eventually die from choking you'll be

518
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,019
happy that you choked on whatever they

519
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,360
were called all right so let's go back

520
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,730
in here you can see us doing the debug

521
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,649
color table mod thing here not a fan of

522
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,620
that let's just make that a call it get

523
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,720
should be in the first place

524
00:21:50,619 --> 00:22:02,209
so in here we can just say look you know

525
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:06,710
give me a get debug color for or get

526
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:12,759
debug color three and then you can just

527
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:14,509
pass in whatever you want and so it will

528
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,609
index that for you

529
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:18,319
and so in this case what we want to do

530
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:21,859
is say that the result is equal to the

531
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:25,668
debug color table reference by the value

532
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:27,558
mod the however many there are right so

533
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,299
that way it will wrap if you pass in a

534
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:31,339
value it's too high you'll just keep

535
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:34,970
getting cycles of those sets of colors

536
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:37,759
and if you wanted a version that was

537
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,870
bigger so that it had the one implicitly

538
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,500
added so you don't have to do it

539
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:44,509
yourself you can just kind call the

540
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,970
debug color for one and we'll thunk for

541
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:48,879
you and append the one right since most

542
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,679
people are going to want to do that

543
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,780
anyway we can also go a little bit

544
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,120
further

545
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:57,980
and have you pass him what you wanted

546
00:22:56,119 --> 00:23:00,649
the Alpha value to be just for maximum

547
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,029
convenience and then we'll set the

548
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,550
default value that way you can even

549
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:06,379
specify the Alpha yourself look at that

550
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:08,930
service ladies and gentlemen I mean I

551
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,350
tell you it doesn't get any better than

552
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,470
that

553
00:23:09,349 --> 00:23:15,859
so get debug color for we're gonna do

554
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:18,640
the the render now I'm gonna pass that

555
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:23,869
index in so that it will draw it there

556
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:27,770
and then I want to make sure that I'm

557
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:29,119
doing that push cube properly looks like

558
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:32,299
I've got everything now I don't need any

559
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:34,549
of those other things there should be

560
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,279
fine so now that I get that push cube

561
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:39,559
that should draw all of those points and

562
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,990
the only thing I've it and it'll tell me

563
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,519
right or it should tell me

564
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:49,279
somewhere in here is hoops

565
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:51,190
I forgot that has to go here now there

566
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,299
we go

567
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:58,509
the only thing that actually is a

568
00:23:53,299 --> 00:24:02,269
problem now is that if you look at the

569
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:04,730
the call here I need to compute this

570
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:06,710
thing right I got a compute where this

571
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,839
alignment point is relative to the

572
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,130
bitmap and so that's gonna be sort of a

573
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,929
separate pass that we'll have to do a

574
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,940
little bit later for now I'll do the

575
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,500
basics to try and make it work but we'll

576
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:21,799
talk about that in a second I

577
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:22,940
we need the alignment point to the get

578
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,399
type bits

579
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,690
there we go sorry just needed that that

580
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,590
doesn't want a pointer at once the

581
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:32,630
actual values so now we're just down to

582
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:35,929
this align P so I'm gonna go ahead and

583
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,910
take that align P and try to compute it

584
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:40,940
here so we need to figure out where it's

585
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:44,000
gonna be relative to anything and you

586
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,259
can see us you know here we don't really

587
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,029
know what we're doing right we're

588
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:48,859
passing this in to get bitmap to him and

589
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:51,109
also there's sort of stuff fortunately

590
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:53,809
for us once we have the bitmap dim we

591
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:55,969
can sort of maybe do a little bit kinda

592
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,579
sorta if your squint at it and don't

593
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,920
look too hard the get bitmap dim call

594
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:03,019
oops that's an asset rendering that get

595
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,450
bitmap dim call you know all it's doing

596
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:06,829
it produces those sizes when it actually

597
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,590
goes to fill that out you can

598
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:11,928
see it creating the Dimpy here that sort

599
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:15,769
of lets us know what's supposed to be

600
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:19,070
happening so if we want to we can kind

601
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:20,839
of abuse this call we don't even have to

602
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:23,178
re-implement ourselves we're gonna abuse

603
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:26,359
that call to generate other point

604
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:28,220
locations not necessarily how we want to

605
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,769
do it in the end because like I said

606
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,329
this code is gonna get rewritten now

607
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:34,399
that we're doing it as more of a

608
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:37,158
skeletal system we're gonna update we're

609
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:39,829
gonna upgrade that code but for the time

610
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:43,639
being right this will at least keep the

611
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:45,859
computation consistent so there's that

612
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:48,379
Dimpy coming through there that's all we

613
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:51,349
should really need to do so all we need

614
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,200
now is instead of passing this here what

615
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:56,898
we want to do is that ap we want to get

616
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,490
the P percent of the particular one in

617
00:25:56,898 --> 00:26:00,859
question right so now we're passing

618
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,210
instead of this one here was just doing

619
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:04,099
it grabbed the first alignment we'll use

620
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,100
that this one's saying for each one we

621
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:09,558
want to go ahead and actually get it so

622
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:20,509
now looking that through here what's the

623
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:26,288
problem can't really read this because

624
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:26,288
it's going off the end here push cube

625
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:33,829
trying to match argument list render

626
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:36,970
group render texture v3o so what's the

627
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:45,250
problem there show me show me the call

628
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:45,250
should push cube call oh right

629
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:53,349
just need that replicate that value out

630
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:55,089
since we want forgot our cubes and not

631
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:57,099
really cubes they're actually arbitrary

632
00:26:55,089 --> 00:27:00,639
boxes should probably be called push box

633
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:02,799
if we're being honest about it so anyway

634
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,420
what I'm doing now is I'm drawing those

635
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:11,710
points in now we can test to see if

636
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:15,700
that's working at all and it might not

637
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:18,910
be right so we'll see so there's it's

638
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,558
drawing a point right and I can add more

639
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,610
of these points here and see if they

640
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,619
work at all

641
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:24,759
you know we're drawing I mean I don't

642
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:27,129
know if those are being drawn the right

643
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:29,440
place they're probably not but there we

644
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,300
go we're actually drawing them they're

645
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
probably not because this doesn't

646
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:36,549
include the offset of the entity so we

647
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,740
need probably to go in here when we

648
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:41,109
actually draw it we're gonna have to do

649
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,160
this sort of thing right so we're

650
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:53,349
actually yeah like in fact looking at

651
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:55,870
this I think so if I'm passing in the

652
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:58,269
enemy ground plus the offset plus a

653
00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:59,469
piece offset which again this is you can

654
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:00,910
see why we want to simplify this right

655
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:06,549
there's way too much stuff going on in

656
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:10,630
there the Dimpy gives us what exactly it

657
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:14,339
gives us that offset minus the alignment

658
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:21,540
stuff so that that actually looks though

659
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:21,539
that looks like it should be correct to

660
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:27,189
be honest with you right because I mean

661
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,480
look at how this is gonna happen we're

662
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,980
gonna call this we're gonna take the

663
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:37,230
ground key plus the offset plus the

664
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:37,230
piece offset right so we're actually

665
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,170
ah

666
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:56,720
that's gonna tell you where you would

667
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,620
base the bitmap right so what you

668
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:05,839
actually need here is these need to be

669
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:08,719
pluses you know I'm saying so it's not

670
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:12,470
quite so it's it's really we want the

671
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,170
dim align X and the dim align Y and so

672
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:18,110
so this really doesn't give us the

673
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,960
correct values we could cheat it though

674
00:29:18,109 --> 00:29:23,209
if you look at what happens here we just

675
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,850
want to go out from there on the

676
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:30,019
alignment so what we could do is is

677
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:32,719
cheese out by just telling it to go than

678
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:35,660
negative right so it's like produce the

679
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,990
opposite sign when you do your

680
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,679
calculation and that's probably a

681
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,308
reasonable trick in this case I think

682
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,769
famous last words

683
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:49,129
so if I go to the point editor now let

684
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:50,990
me just see where we've got here if

685
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,490
that's actually the right thing I'm

686
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,470
trying to think about which one we're

687
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,789
editing to I don't really know well if

688
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,110
that's we should see that peg to this so

689
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:01,490
that still doesn't seem to be the

690
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:02,389
correct thing I feel like that should

691
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,799
have been the correct thing though

692
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,800
although it's being drawn

693
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:23,689
no I think that should have done it

694
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,980
correctly so what I'm missing something

695
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,590
I'm actually missing something because

696
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:29,180
that should have been okay because if we

697
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:32,029
want you know if you look at what this

698
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:35,570
is doing here it's subtracting how much

699
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:39,710
you want to align by it subtracting that

700
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:42,619
away so when you draw it I guess the

701
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,809
thing is you need to take where you were

702
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:47,959
drawing the head and actually put it on

703
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:51,589
there so I suppose technically the issue

704
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:55,579
there is this piece of information that

705
00:30:51,589 --> 00:31:00,139
came back here right this piece Dimpy

706
00:30:55,579 --> 00:31:02,299
that is actually cutting the base so

707
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,070
meaning the base is wherever we drew the

708
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:05,990
thing and then the align point needs to

709
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:08,480
be pegged still to that do you know what

710
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,130
I mean so I think it's still correct to

711
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,140
use the negative there it just we need

712
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:15,860
to account for the alignment that was

713
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,640
happening in the previous case what's

714
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:21,859
that called

715
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:25,580
Dimpy is that what's called no oh sorry

716
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:29,209
it's a bitmap damn bitmapped in there we

717
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:31,069
go so we need to pre say okay I'll set

718
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:33,230
the bitmap however you're gonna bitmap

719
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:35,389
draw up there we then need to base our

720
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,789
alignment points thing off of that

721
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,590
because otherwise it won't be pegged to

722
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:41,899
the actual movement of the bitmap and

723
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,189
then we want to go the opposite in right

724
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,640
I know it's a little mind-bending that's

725
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:50,480
graphics for you so hopefully now it's

726
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,160
actually correct in theory right

727
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,779
and it does appear to be because there

728
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,180
it is underneath it I would like it to

729
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,379
be above I want it to be raised up a

730
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,269
little bit because I don't want it to be

731
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,730
occluded so that we can actually see it

732
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:04,309
in this case so I would like to say you

733
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,740
know let's also in this case move it a

734
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:08,480
little bit towards the camera so I would

735
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,700
like to say like maybe move it

736
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,009
one unit towards whatever where the

737
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,200
camera is pointing we actually do know

738
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:18,799
where the cameras pointing because we

739
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,960
have a notion of the cameras axis right

740
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,960
you can see even here where we do that

741
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,019
you can see you've got inside the group

742
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,720
game transform we know what direction

743
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:29,490
the cameras

744
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,808
pointing that cameras the axe is just

745
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,279
pointing back towards it so we can move

746
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:34,139
it closer to the camera so it's a little

747
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,210
bit easier to see where that alignment

748
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,820
point actually is so I'm gonna go ahead

749
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,110
and do that as well so that should give

750
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:41,939
us a way to draw all of our alignment

751
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:43,859
points which will let us see what's

752
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,470
going on on any particular entity here

753
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:48,298
so if we like click on one of these guys

754
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,548
oops I gotta go in editor mode first if

755
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:53,279
we click on one of these guys and try to

756
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:56,000
edit it if I look I should be able to

757
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,678
now see alignment points for everybody

758
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:04,288
again why is that not that should have

759
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:06,990
been closer to me I'm not sure why we're

760
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:08,908
getting that sort of gross that offsets

761
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,140
not enough do we just make sure let me

762
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:12,000
see what's going on there because I'm

763
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,940
not really entirely certain

764
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,369
let me try moving it much closer to the

765
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:23,100
camera in this case and we'll see if

766
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:25,439
that works so there that that works

767
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:27,779
better maybe it's a little bit too much

768
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,630
you might say but in this case there we

769
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,700
go so if I'm editing the alignment

770
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:35,250
points let's say I create two of them

771
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,230
right so here's me changing the

772
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,990
alignment point on the head here's me

773
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:43,589
changing another point on that surface

774
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:46,048
right and so you know if I wanted the

775
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:47,849
nose I could place that there and then

776
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:48,960
now when I changing the base alignment

777
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:51,298
point you can see the nose stays

778
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,610
properly pegged to it so I think that's

779
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:57,389
now a letting us edit those pretty

780
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:59,579
cleanly right that seems pretty good to

781
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:02,220
me now there's some things I could do

782
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,960
here again since it's free for me to

783
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,400
move these close to the camera I might

784
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,740
move them quite a bit closer to the

785
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,358
camera in this case and then just make

786
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,010
them smaller so you know what I could do

787
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,108
is say like move them three units closer

788
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:16,109
to the camera and just make them very

789
00:34:13,108 --> 00:34:17,969
very tiny that would allow them to

790
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:20,579
always kind of be floating up near where

791
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,598
we were we could instead try to do

792
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,009
something where we render them on a

793
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,659
separate path so they don't get depth

794
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,980
occluded I don't really want to go down

795
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,809
that route because it just adds a lot of

796
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,469
complexity of the renderer that I'm not

797
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:33,210
really sure I want right so here we go

798
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,769
with that there's the point that's maybe

799
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,579
a little too small it's go ahead and

800
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:41,070
just make that slightly larger maybe two

801
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:43,139
five let's say and

802
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,970
make that a little bit bigger there I

803
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,779
don't know if that's actually gonna get

804
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:53,569
any bigger out there it goes

805
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:53,570
there we are maybe a little bigger still

806
00:34:53,750 --> 00:35:00,210
and we'll call that a day so now we have

807
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,369
the ability in the game to to create

808
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,019
arbitrary attached points and see them

809
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:05,849
which is what we needed so you know I

810
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,639
should be able to literally go in here

811
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:10,170
and add all of these the other thing

812
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,670
that I'd like to do because you can kind

813
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,470
of see now you know if I had all these

814
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:19,019
things let's say I just had a ton of

815
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:20,849
these points everywhere right now here's

816
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,500
the part so I said I was going to show

817
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:24,119
some stuff that was easy with the UI and

818
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,380
then I proceeded to not actually go do

819
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,059
anything related to the UI really

820
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,760
because this is all just in the renderer

821
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,500
now's the part I was gonna say so maybe

822
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,690
I don't want to render all of these and

823
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,900
maybe I want to see pretty clearly in

824
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:39,389
here what each of those actually what

825
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,579
their colors were and so what I can do

826
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:43,949
really trivially just just super simple

827
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,940
right because again with oops I don't

828
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:50,489
know I did that we've have another open

829
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:53,550
again when you have you UI that has a

830
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:55,619
nice immediate mode interface to it it

831
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,230
makes it a lot easier for me to just say

832
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:59,940
Oh anytime I wanted a button on

833
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,070
something I'll just make that a button I

834
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,340
don't have to create it I don't have to

835
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:08,670
track it I can just I don't have to use

836
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,800
any types in the UI system at all I can

837
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:14,039
just say look this used to be a label

838
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,400
it's gonna be a button now right and

839
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:19,500
that's all I would have to do so in here

840
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,420
I can say okay you know I want this to

841
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,610
be a button right and you know I don't

842
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,039
have a button F because I didn't write

843
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:32,700
one of those so I'm just gonna create

844
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:34,230
that myself here although I could make a

845
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:44,369
button F pretty trivial I just don't

846
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:45,599
really think it's worth it well because

847
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,969
you know you think about it it's just

848
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,799
that code right there I mean why not

849
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:52,129
save people the trouble it seems

850
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,019
reasonable right I mean here's that call

851
00:36:52,130 --> 00:37:02,640
for the button you know what I mean

852
00:36:55,019 --> 00:37:04,079
so you know why not do it I mean maybe

853
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,569
I'm the only person who ever calls it

854
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:12,210
but yeah maybe someone else will find it

855
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:14,880
useful seems reasonable to me all right

856
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,490
so what do I need here I just need dev

857
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,740
ID and I would need to have the enabled

858
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:24,179
flag here because I can't pass it as

859
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,349
default parameter since there's just who

860
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:28,589
knows what parameters come in there but

861
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:30,839
otherwise it's mine right I could also

862
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,460
make this enabled come back here if I

863
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,590
wanted to make it more consistent with

864
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,869
it I suppose but I'm probably I could do

865
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:50,010
that so all right let's go ahead and

866
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:52,380
just pass those through all right so

867
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:55,560
anyway let's let's go ahead and call

868
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,930
that button F now and I will pass the

869
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:02,309
various things in here I want to create

870
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:04,739
an editor now for this stuff where that

871
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:06,869
button can be clicked on and off and you

872
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,219
know I'll be honest now I think about it

873
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,200
even though I'm glad I made that but

874
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,269
enough really this is gonna be more of

875
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:15,559
an editable boolean probably so it's

876
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:21,449
probably more like more like this

877
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:23,639
editable boolean F and in this case

878
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:27,118
right I want to be able to say here's my

879
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:29,309
editable boolean and I want to edit some

880
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,780
boolean that turns the rendering of

881
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:36,000
these points on and off right so like I

882
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,130
want to be able to say like render this

883
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,340
on render this off do you know whatever

884
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:43,200
you want right and so again it's super

885
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:46,050
simple for me to do this because I can

886
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,969
always just make any of these things do

887
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,710
that I just I don't know whether it's

888
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:51,358
better to do it this way or not it's I

889
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,429
really couldn't tell you at this point I

890
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,309
start thinking like well maybe you know

891
00:38:53,429 --> 00:38:58,139
maybe I should just do this format

892
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:59,219
string here because it just seems like

893
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:02,069
it might be getting a little long in the

894
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:04,349
tooth it's so easy to create these I'm

895
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,000
tempted to just do it but in this case

896
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:08,519
maybe it's better just do it this way so

897
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,159
that it's usable by everybody you know

898
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,840
it's just that right so if I wanted to

899
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:14,460
create a button here you could push I

900
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,289
don't know whether I want to do inedibly

901
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,429
or not I maybe we'll just use the button

902
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:19,259
because I want to be able trust my own

903
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:21,089
backdrop color too so I think what I'll

904
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,760
do is I'll just pass it here I'll just

905
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,930
say all right if this button gets pushed

906
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,180
then I'm going to toggle whether

907
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:29,609
rendering of that things on or off I'm

908
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:33,149
gonna use dev ID from pointer to create

909
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:35,490
a point here a to create an attractor

910
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:38,070
here the classifier in this case I don't

911
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:40,709
need the label text I just made the

912
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,450
enabled is always true pretty much well

913
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:46,400
you know what that's not true I could

914
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:49,439
make it so that ones that aren't used

915
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,260
are always off you know that that is one

916
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,889
thing I could do so what I could do is

917
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:58,100
this here could be the enabled and then

918
00:39:55,889 --> 00:40:02,759
the backdrop color I'm just gonna use

919
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:04,319
get debug color for for that point index

920
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,420
which is the same thing I used in the

921
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:10,800
renderer to select what the point color

922
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:13,470
was right and then all I need now is I

923
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,640
need to actually say well so I want to

924
00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:17,429
be able to click on all the buttons

925
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:20,670
there and I want something in my editor

926
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:22,919
to track I just want to know which for

927
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:26,430
each of those alignment points I want to

928
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,180
know I want to know whether they're like

929
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:34,409
on or off right so I want like something

930
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:36,719
like draw a line point you know I I want

931
00:40:34,409 --> 00:40:41,009
something like this and I want that to

932
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:49,368
be set based on how many there are so

933
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:51,230
you know for let's see here where is it

934
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:55,470
it's not it

935
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:57,389
so in file formats I just in here want

936
00:40:55,469 --> 00:41:00,029
to be able to say however many of there

937
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:04,980
are of these right so I want like an

938
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:06,480
array count of these and unfortunately

939
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,789
it's kind of nasty because you can't

940
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,199
it's sometimes difficult to reach in

941
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:13,199
there and get one of those so you kind

942
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,719
of have to do ridiculous stuff like this

943
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:18,179
to it to be able to actually access

944
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,250
those things so I'd have to think about

945
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:24,139
how to actually get the array count out

946
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,139
of that thing I might just do this

947
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:36,269
and then it can just mirror it like that

948
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,829
right so in here I'm going to say look

949
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:40,409
that's how many of those we're gonna

950
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:43,199
have and then inside the in-game editor

951
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:44,429
I can just you know keep my own list of

952
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:54,209
those so I can just feel like alright

953
00:41:44,429 --> 00:42:01,708
you know for each of these and we'll

954
00:41:54,208 --> 00:42:03,808
just set them all to true so then when

955
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:04,919
we actually go to run this I'm sorry

956
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,999
when we actually go to compile this

957
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,400
right the only thing we're really

958
00:42:05,998 --> 00:42:11,399
missing here

959
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,298
whoops format string now I guess I could

960
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,880
call this point name or something temp

961
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:19,288
is not a very good name for that um we

962
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,420
need a pointer here and we need to know

963
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:23,219
what we're actually going to be toggling

964
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:27,420
in this case right we need to know what

965
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:29,400
the what the difference what the render

966
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,619
difference was here and so what I want

967
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,298
to do is I want to snap a copy of that I

968
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,818
mean I want to snap a pointer to that

969
00:42:33,298 --> 00:42:37,619
boolean because this is the thing that

970
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:40,349
I'm editing right I'm editing whichever

971
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:44,849
the point whichever one of these points

972
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:46,640
here whichever one of those billions I'm

973
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:50,759
talking about for this particular point

974
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:53,098
that's the like point toggle that's the

975
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:56,670
like draw toggle for this point so I

976
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:58,338
know that I want to I well I know that

977
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:01,019
that's the thing that I want to edit I

978
00:42:58,338 --> 00:43:03,929
probably want to draw the color

979
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:06,508
differently so if it's enabled it will

980
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:09,778
drawn its color if it's not it will just

981
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:11,699
draw it as like a generic like dark

982
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:14,748
color or something I don't know what the

983
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:17,130
color should be but something like that

984
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:19,588
and then if you click on it the draw

985
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:22,499
chocolate just gets get swapped right

986
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:25,018
and so that's really all I need to do

987
00:43:22,498 --> 00:43:27,118
don't ask me why I left that boolean

988
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:30,208
line in there it doesn't belong there at

989
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,130
all and so now I just created an array

990
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:34,618
of edit of those things to be editable

991
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,820
and when I go in here to actually edit

992
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:37,829
them

993
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,910
now when we look at that you can see

994
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:43,739
that it's actually each of those each of

995
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:46,949
each of those things is available for me

996
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:50,099
to click on right and so I just wanted

997
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:52,319
to emphasize did you see how like really

998
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:53,460
I went in and added the button F because

999
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,010
I thought maybe that would be convenient

1000
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,449
but we ended up not needing it so

1001
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:00,420
literally I didn't have to interact with

1002
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:02,219
the UI system at all I didn't have to

1003
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,990
create anything I didn't have to store

1004
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:05,759
any pointers I didn't have to set any

1005
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:08,759
user data I didn't have to respond to

1006
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,060
any events I had to do anything I wrote

1007
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,880
one little if statement and I was able

1008
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:17,610
to make these match the colors of the

1009
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,410
things their control the data I actually

1010
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,570
wanted to control which was array of

1011
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:23,909
boolean that I made and put where I

1012
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,950
wanted to I never have to worry about

1013
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:27,899
them being out of sync they're always in

1014
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:31,649
sync they cannot they literally cannot

1015
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:33,269
be out of sync right every last thing

1016
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:37,559
was perfect and it was three or four

1017
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:39,300
lines of code in QT you'd be inheriting

1018
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,610
from stuff you would add to like go have

1019
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,200
some custom color thing you'd be setting

1020
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:46,260
things back and forth and connecting

1021
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:48,509
it's like show me the thing where that's

1022
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,860
three lines of code in QT and then I'll

1023
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,260
start thinking that those are okay

1024
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,150
interfaces like they're not right this

1025
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:58,940
is the entirety of the code that got

1026
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,940
written this this right there

1027
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:13,349
technically it's one line of code right

1028
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:15,029
to do all of that anyway so one line of

1029
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:16,409
code and mind you would be one line of

1030
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,290
kony if there were an infinite number of

1031
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:20,670
buttons and not figuratively indifferent

1032
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:21,809
of buttons if there were literally an

1033
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:25,110
infinite number of buttons it would

1034
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:26,969
still be one line of code right because

1035
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:28,440
you know it would only be calling it for

1036
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:31,799
the ones you actually wanted at that

1037
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:36,150
given time anyway enough bagging on QT

1038
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,460
and other badly designed it yet so in

1039
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:41,280
here right when we asked for the button

1040
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:45,630
and we toggle it you can see in here I'm

1041
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:49,140
I'm not III I don't want to ever draw it

1042
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:51,838
if it's not set in the first place so

1043
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:53,429
I think I probably want here too you

1044
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:58,199
know in this we're we're doing the

1045
00:45:53,429 --> 00:46:00,598
enabled thing I think I want that to be

1046
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:03,449
the other way round meaning I

1047
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,190
accidentally said it so that it I told

1048
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:07,528
it that it was enabled only when it was

1049
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,358
set to none what I actually want is I

1050
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:12,119
want and enabled when it's not set to

1051
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,518
none right so that was just a miss type

1052
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:16,829
on my part so this is what I actually

1053
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:18,509
want so only ones that are set get the

1054
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:20,039
color and the other ones can't be turned

1055
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,650
on or off anyway

1056
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:24,839
that way you only see those ones right

1057
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,369
in this case and that allows me to turn

1058
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:28,349
them on and off I don't know that I'll

1059
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:29,640
be doing that much but it's a very least

1060
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:31,470
I wanted the colors there so I figured

1061
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:32,670
while I was setting the color I might as

1062
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:34,469
well of made it clickable because it's

1063
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,970
no more work for me because then I can

1064
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:37,618
say oh I don't want to see these I'm

1065
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:38,009
just looking at just those or I don't

1066
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,190
know

1067
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:44,640
you know don't ask me why I just did

1068
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,869
just have how I did it we probably will

1069
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,389
never click that button but it can't

1070
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:51,210
hurt to have it right so all right so

1071
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:52,558
now that's done and what I do need to do

1072
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,778
now is I need to figure out some way

1073
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,339
I've got the rendering and here is that

1074
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:59,969
rendering kind of wasp oops not that

1075
00:46:56,338 --> 00:47:02,219
that rendering wants to be set in here

1076
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:05,518
to kind of correlate back right like

1077
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:08,219
each I don't want to draw this if it's

1078
00:47:05,518 --> 00:47:08,699
the drawing is is not enabled you know

1079
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:12,689
what I mean

1080
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:14,509
so I need something here that will allow

1081
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:17,909
me to access that piece of information

1082
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:20,730
now I have the hit test so that's

1083
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:23,699
probably a good place for that so what I

1084
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,980
want to do is add into my game editor I

1085
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:26,669
want like a function here that I can

1086
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,389
call

1087
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:33,539
that's like should draw a line point and

1088
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:35,670
it will pass the hit test and through

1089
00:47:33,539 --> 00:47:38,160
some crazy set of gyrations we don't

1090
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,778
care what it is if I pass you in

1091
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,239
alignment point index you have to tell

1092
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:47,130
me if I should be drawing that alignment

1093
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:51,328
point index right and so in here I will

1094
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:58,048
call that now and say you know should

1095
00:47:51,329 --> 00:48:02,530
draw a line point and so if it's none I

1096
00:47:58,048 --> 00:48:06,280
won't draw it and if it's a turn

1097
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:11,080
off I also yeah that's another case in

1098
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,980
which I won't draw it right and so now I

1099
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:13,840
have to figure out a way to actually

1100
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,900
implement that function right because

1101
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:19,420
it's not defined now and so I need to

1102
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,690
define Eid to make a route I need to

1103
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:25,030
make a way to get back to from the hip

1104
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:27,400
test I need to be able to do like

1105
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:33,730
something like this right I need to be

1106
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:36,010
able to loops so I need to be able to

1107
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,199
say like the result is false if the AP

1108
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:50,260
index is in the array bounds of this

1109
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:53,109
thing right so I just want to say look

1110
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:55,720
if I can just give him back whatever

1111
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:59,380
that you know whatever the alignment

1112
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:01,089
point toggle was in this case so I need

1113
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,099
to do something like this the hit test

1114
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,360
at the moment doesn't get back to the

1115
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:07,299
editor but you know what it's pretty

1116
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:11,380
easy for it to do so and I don't mind if

1117
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:12,760
it does so the in-game editor cure can

1118
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,130
be there and then people can ask that

1119
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,200
question in the editable hit test I will

1120
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:19,750
have to initialize it right if I just

1121
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:22,329
ran it now we'd crash because that hit

1122
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:31,480
test would not actually be able to do so

1123
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:32,829
let me also predefined that okay so if I

1124
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,469
was to run now we just crashed because

1125
00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:37,750
that thing's at zero so as soon as I go

1126
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:39,759
to actually ask that question you can

1127
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,489
see we get we get biffed right there

1128
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,050
right so I need to set that when we

1129
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:46,049
actually create the editable hit test

1130
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:54,039
hit test so inside the begin hit test

1131
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:55,930
call when we create one of these we need

1132
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:58,750
to set it up so that it can always get

1133
00:49:55,929 --> 00:50:00,909
back to the editor that created it and

1134
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,800
ask that question other than that I

1135
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:04,389
think we're pretty much done so that

1136
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,100
gives us the entirety of that particular

1137
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:07,900
visualization like I said which was the

1138
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:09,940
first one that I wanted the ability to

1139
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,990
see all the hit test points that were

1140
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:16,420
involved okay and so now let's just make

1141
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:19,179
sure it works you know here's all our

1142
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:22,539
limit points as we edit them and I can

1143
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:24,669
turn them on and off in this case and

1144
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:27,340
they work just fine right so I think

1145
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:29,079
that's all good we've accomplished what

1146
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:32,190
we want to accomplish there and we don't

1147
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:35,019
really have to do anything else right

1148
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:44,019
that's all yeah that all works pretty

1149
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:46,150
well uh you know I just realized moving

1150
00:50:44,019 --> 00:50:47,679
it along the camera Z isn't what I

1151
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:49,869
actually meant to do

1152
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:53,069
I meant to move it along the vector

1153
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:55,269
between it and the camera let me just

1154
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,470
take this moment I know that now we're

1155
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:59,130
supposed to be doing that let me just

1156
00:50:56,469 --> 00:51:02,259
take this one to explain what I'm saying

1157
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:06,090
so what I wanted to do is I wanted to

1158
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:08,740
see where on the bitmap these points are

1159
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:10,240
but I didn't want to add a special

1160
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:13,719
purpose thing to the renderer to draw

1161
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,189
them without the depth testing on right

1162
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:17,889
I didn't want that to I didn't want to

1163
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:20,650
complicate our renderer to do that since

1164
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:23,529
this is only for the debug tools and the

1165
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,849
debug editing right so what I wanted to

1166
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,710
do was just move them closer to the

1167
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:30,099
camera so they would just sort that way

1168
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,630
to begin with right now there's two ways

1169
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:34,029
I could have done that I didn't think

1170
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:35,920
about the other way because you know I

1171
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,480
just wasn't thinking I guess and I also

1172
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,900
don't know whether that way exists

1173
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,730
inside push cube we have a way of

1174
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,610
actually biasing our death coordinate

1175
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:48,010
that's the W we we made our W actually

1176
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:49,599
be able to do that that's probably what

1177
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:53,260
I should have done that's a much easier

1178
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,909
way of solving this problem and so maybe

1179
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,310
I'll go do that but what I was gonna say

1180
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:59,230
I just wanted to illustrate you can see

1181
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:00,820
when I move around those other points

1182
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,440
change their location relative to the

1183
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,970
head the reason is because of the

1184
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,030
perspective effect they're right they're

1185
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:09,819
actually hovering up there and what I

1186
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:12,550
kind of brain farted on there was that

1187
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,720
if you want things to stay in the same

1188
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,780
place

1189
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:19,299
relative to projection you need to move

1190
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:23,110
things along the line from the point in

1191
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:25,870
question to the camera position not

1192
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:29,230
along the camera Z which is actually a

1193
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:29,889
line that's just perpendicular to the

1194
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:33,579
screen

1195
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:35,949
right one is actually the line along the

1196
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:38,500
projection and that will keep them in

1197
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:39,969
the same place and the other is a is a

1198
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,230
perpendicular line to the screen which

1199
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:45,239
won't

1200
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:45,240
and so I screwed that up that was wrong

1201
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:52,840
if I want to fix that problem is when we

1202
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:55,209
go in here so if I look at push cube

1203
00:52:52,840 --> 00:53:01,180
right and we look at what's happening in

1204
00:52:55,210 --> 00:53:04,840
there the Z bias it goes into the the

1205
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:09,399
peeper ammeter here but we're only able

1206
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:11,950
to pass a an abstract P there we're not

1207
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,930
really able to set a Z bias that right

1208
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:18,849
there is where the Z bias would go and

1209
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:21,250
so if we wanted to we could add the

1210
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:23,170
ability to specify that out maybe I'll

1211
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,909
just do that because why not and then

1212
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,530
that solves our problem without me

1213
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:30,069
having to actually compute that line

1214
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:39,190
which is trivial to do but why bother so

1215
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:40,900
here's that Z bias and I'm gonna set

1216
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:43,539
that equal to zero so that most people

1217
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,869
who push a cube never see it I'm then

1218
00:53:43,539 --> 00:53:49,230
I'm gonna go ahead and go back into the

1219
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:49,230
entity renderer

1220
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:53,889
and then when we're pushing this cube

1221
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:56,619
down I'm gonna set that Z bias so rather

1222
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:59,349
than doing this which moves it I'm gonna

1223
00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:01,299
use the fact that we have a Z bias and

1224
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:03,099
I'm gonna go ahead and set it and I'm

1225
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,539
gonna set it to something very high so I

1226
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:06,730
essentially want to move it quite a bit

1227
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:10,230
closer to the camera like way way closer

1228
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:14,019
to the camera right I don't know offhand

1229
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:15,760
unfortunately just trying to think

1230
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:17,619
through here I don't remember what we

1231
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:23,950
were passing here so we need default

1232
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:27,179
cube layout 0 for the admission 0 for

1233
00:54:23,949 --> 00:54:27,179
the light source so it looks like that

1234
00:54:32,028 --> 00:54:38,659
so now hopefully we can still draw these

1235
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:40,068
things and you know I'll be honest I

1236
00:54:38,659 --> 00:54:49,869
don't see them so I guess it did not

1237
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:49,869
work which is unfortunate

1238
00:54:53,150 --> 00:55:02,190
so I'm assuming if I set that to zero it

1239
00:54:55,349 --> 00:55:03,569
would meaning they will get drawn right

1240
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:08,159
yeah there they are

1241
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:15,570
I want to see so if I set this to Tendo

1242
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:20,429
they presumably don't draw no they do so

1243
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:22,230
I guess that ten is just not enough is

1244
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:26,329
that all the problem is it just that we

1245
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:26,329
need more Z bias than ten is that all

1246
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:43,860
well now they're not yeah now so I don't

1247
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,269
know that doesn't look like it works for

1248
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,760
some reason I'm have to go look and see

1249
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:53,400
why because I'm not sure how we compute

1250
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:55,920
that Z bias that's the only thing so I'm

1251
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,389
kind of just like blindly setting values

1252
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,700
and seeing if they work which is usually

1253
00:55:57,389 --> 00:56:00,900
not a good plan but since I wasn't

1254
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:06,269
really planning on looking at this

1255
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:07,740
particular thing maybe it does it and I

1256
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:10,969
don't know does it go the other way like

1257
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,969
is it supposed to be more like that

1258
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,349
I'm gonna have to go look at the shader

1259
00:56:34,298 --> 00:56:48,608
applying the guessing is not work does

1260
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:52,160
not work so I'm guessing that that must

1261
00:56:48,608 --> 00:56:53,480
bias the Z and a whit let's look at this

1262
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,000
look at the shader because now I just I

1263
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,920
just don't know and now I'm curious so

1264
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,028
if we go to the OpenGL shader what do we

1265
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,690
what are we actually doing there with

1266
00:56:59,028 --> 00:57:05,659
that parameter so if I go to busy by a

1267
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:10,970
shader I think is what would be being

1268
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:13,489
called herbs OpenGL out there here's the

1269
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:18,009
Z bias program so you can see the Z bias

1270
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:22,298
here it grabs the the W value from that

1271
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:22,299
and then what does it actually do

1272
00:57:29,059 --> 00:57:42,860
it creates a modified Z and sets that it

1273
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:45,920
takes the it takes the vertex scene it

1274
00:57:42,860 --> 00:58:09,130
just adds the Z bias to the actual Z

1275
00:57:45,920 --> 00:58:12,050
value what why do we do that what is the

1276
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:13,730
okay so we're reduced asleep at the

1277
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:17,170
switch here because look we load the Z

1278
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:21,139
bias out and then we do the transform

1279
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:30,579
but why wouldn't we be applying that

1280
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:40,279
after the transform right I mean is

1281
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:42,380
there really I mean okay so I guess if

1282
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,260
you really want to think of it that way

1283
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:48,470
it makes some sense to apply it before

1284
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:50,600
hand because you if you're trying to

1285
00:58:48,469 --> 00:58:53,659
make sure that it only makes things

1286
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:55,639
appear to be standing up more tall than

1287
00:58:53,659 --> 00:59:05,119
it should only ever work in the Z

1288
00:58:55,639 --> 00:59:07,429
direction I mean that's true but is that

1289
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,819
really necessary I mean is that the best

1290
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:12,230
way to do that because you know does

1291
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:17,330
that actually produce better results

1292
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:19,340
than if you just added the Z into the Z

1293
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:21,199
you know once you actually transfer them

1294
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:23,380
if you just offset the Z by a certain

1295
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:23,379
amount

1296
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:35,459
hmm either-or looking at that I don't

1297
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:39,548
see why this wasn't working right

1298
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:41,948
because if the Z vertex is Z value

1299
00:59:39,548 --> 00:59:43,958
actually just gets added directly like

1300
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:48,009
that it should just work

1301
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:49,748
after the transform right look I don't

1302
00:59:48,009 --> 00:59:53,278
see where the problem comes in here

1303
00:59:49,748 --> 00:59:57,818
because after you do the GL position and

1304
00:59:53,278 --> 01:00:00,429
you you know you take the modified Z

1305
00:59:57,818 --> 01:00:01,989
where you've transformed both things and

1306
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:05,288
then you take the modified Z for use

1307
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:07,778
with the depth buffer that should have

1308
01:00:05,289 --> 01:00:08,769
just worked and I don't know why it

1309
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:10,958
wouldn't have

1310
01:00:08,768 --> 01:00:17,078
I guess one reason is maybe we got too

1311
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:19,748
far so it it clipped itself off I mean

1312
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:21,759
that could be meaning if that was the

1313
01:00:19,748 --> 01:00:23,498
case then you know you just needed this

1314
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:26,039
to be something else it just needed to

1315
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:30,728
be a different value that is actually

1316
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:39,609
within those bounds I don't know we can

1317
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:40,118
try it I don't think that's it so that's

1318
01:00:39,608 --> 01:00:42,909
interesting

1319
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:47,559
there you see it working just fine right

1320
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:54,538
but not in this mode so not once the

1321
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:57,369
camera is locked but I have no idea why

1322
01:00:54,539 --> 01:01:01,019
it must be because of the way we're

1323
01:00:57,369 --> 01:01:03,400
computing the Z depth or something I

1324
01:01:01,018 --> 01:01:10,598
mean look at that that actually works

1325
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:11,048
great but go like that and suddenly it's

1326
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:16,568
broken

1327
01:01:11,048 --> 01:01:19,298
and even if you know even if I get to

1328
01:01:16,568 --> 01:01:23,248
almost exactly the same position I mean

1329
01:01:19,298 --> 01:01:23,248
that's very close right

1330
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:42,210
I mean that's almost imperceptibly close

1331
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:46,950
that's super close so something about

1332
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:48,780
the Z bias do we like turn off Z bias or

1333
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:59,699
something when we're in that camera mode

1334
01:01:48,780 --> 01:02:03,150
like what's going on there right it

1335
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:07,199
could be because of the Z range so one

1336
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:08,280
difference is you know in the if we look

1337
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,980
at what happens in the renderer I

1338
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:16,050
believe the Z ranges are different in

1339
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:20,130
those two cases I guess you know in here

1340
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:23,490
we've got a bunch of settings for like

1341
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:26,460
ranges of things and the near clip plane

1342
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:29,609
far clip plane I guess are things that

1343
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,929
are actually getting set there you can

1344
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:33,599
see the near claim far clipping it

1345
01:02:30,929 --> 01:02:38,759
passed in here so if I actually go to

1346
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:41,489
world man look at what those are you can

1347
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:44,760
see that if the FARC if we're in debug

1348
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:46,829
camera mode the far clip plane is like

1349
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:56,730
set to a drastically different groups

1350
01:02:46,829 --> 01:03:00,150
different value in that case and the

1351
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:03,750
near clip plane is too so in debug

1352
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:06,000
camera mode so I guess what's happening

1353
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:10,739
is in debug camera mode the near clip

1354
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:15,869
plane is set in so so you can see it's

1355
01:03:10,739 --> 01:03:18,539
set at 3 so if the camera was like 8

1356
01:03:15,869 --> 01:03:22,230
above wow so basically this is getting

1357
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:25,409
clipped by that clip plane so it's like

1358
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:27,449
it has to be less than 5 because 5 is

1359
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:34,199
exactly where it would have been clipped

1360
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:37,349
oh my lord that is a mind bender but

1361
01:03:34,199 --> 01:03:38,730
okay so it was getting clipped off the

1362
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:40,380
near clip playing because the near clip

1363
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:44,849
planes actually pretty far out in the

1364
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:48,150
game camera Wow folks graphics always

1365
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:51,000
too complicated for its own good so

1366
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:54,900
in this case you can see now that it

1367
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,849
stays pegged pretty well right and it it

1368
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,548
will drift a little because remember the

1369
01:03:56,849 --> 01:04:01,920
head itself is tilted a little so you

1370
01:03:59,548 --> 01:04:05,460
can never get it quite exactly right

1371
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:09,000
I could myself account for the tilt and

1372
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:11,369
if I wanted to do that you know it would

1373
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,409
be pretty straight forward it's just we

1374
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:16,140
have to first take the next step that we

1375
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:18,808
were going to take out here in order to

1376
01:04:16,139 --> 01:04:21,598
do it and that is you can see here we

1377
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:23,700
create x and y axes that are actually

1378
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,609
bent from what the at ones in the world

1379
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:29,098
are and so as we pull those out here

1380
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:30,960
which is exactly what I wanted to do for

1381
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,220
the actual usage of these points that's

1382
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,490
the piece transform part here was gonna

1383
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:39,269
be about as we move those out we'll be

1384
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:40,919
able to really peg it exactly so that's

1385
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:42,179
that's just a better thing all around

1386
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,849
because that will allow us to have

1387
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:47,699
perfect pegging in a second here after

1388
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:49,710
we do that part of it but before I do

1389
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:50,969
that and we may have to wait to the next

1390
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:53,250
stream for that because I got other

1391
01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:54,989
stuff I got to do right now what I do

1392
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,429
want to do is just get back to the

1393
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:58,078
editor side of things there's one more

1394
01:04:56,429 --> 01:05:00,899
thing we need and that is that when we

1395
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:03,809
pick something in the asset editor

1396
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:05,519
remember I picked this I've got this

1397
01:05:03,809 --> 01:05:09,059
problem I go to a senator I pick it

1398
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,710
what's going on here which one am i

1399
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:13,289
editing I'm editing the head I'm hitting

1400
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:15,179
the body I can switch the alignment

1401
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:16,650
point editor but I can't control which

1402
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:20,190
one of those two things I'm editing

1403
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:23,818
that's not what I want I want instead to

1404
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:26,789
be able to pick out of the asset which

1405
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:29,009
one of those I've got how do we do that

1406
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:30,960
we need to add a secondary thing that

1407
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:32,730
allows us to look at some of the things

1408
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,740
that were clicked on and pick them

1409
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:36,719
separately so one of the things we

1410
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:39,298
didn't do in our UI is have a bitmap

1411
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:42,088
picker it should be pretty easy actually

1412
01:05:39,298 --> 01:05:44,519
for us to add exactly such a thing to

1413
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:47,969
our UI system because it's pretty

1414
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:50,309
flexible so if I just go ahead and add

1415
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:52,889
that in it will allow us to do a pic

1416
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:55,170
probably pretty easily so let's say I go

1417
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:59,909
into our editor I can probably add the

1418
01:05:55,170 --> 01:06:01,798
picking pretty trivially honestly I can

1419
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:06,659
probably do something where it actually

1420
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:09,028
is what's room in I'm looking for it's

1421
01:06:06,659 --> 01:06:11,458
probably pretty easy to actually add

1422
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:13,228
this editor without seeing the bitmap so

1423
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:16,078
I could just add a little nubs to pick

1424
01:06:13,228 --> 01:06:18,989
them I'll do that first and then after

1425
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,910
we have that working properly I'll go in

1426
01:06:18,989 --> 01:06:23,150
and add a widget that actually just

1427
01:06:20,909 --> 01:06:25,889
shows the bitmap itself because that's

1428
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:27,479
easier for us to use and shouldn't be

1429
01:06:25,889 --> 01:06:29,728
actually very hard to edit because like

1430
01:06:27,478 --> 01:06:31,468
I said if you make a good UI API to

1431
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:34,198
begin with it's pretty easy to just tack

1432
01:06:31,469 --> 01:06:36,269
stuff on to it so let's go ahead and do

1433
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:38,729
that inside the asset editor what we

1434
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:40,379
have here is editing an active asset

1435
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:42,018
what we want to be able to do is switch

1436
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:46,229
which active asset we're actually

1437
01:06:42,018 --> 01:06:48,868
editing and so the way we can do that is

1438
01:06:46,228 --> 01:06:50,728
back out here inside update and render

1439
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:52,890
we've got this notion of like you know

1440
01:06:50,728 --> 01:06:54,718
undo and redo right so you know in here

1441
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:56,719
where we're actually editing this thing

1442
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,670
so I'm in the editor and I picked this

1443
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:01,409
we kind of just have this understanding

1444
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:03,989
right here of what's going on we don't

1445
01:07:01,409 --> 01:07:07,018
have any narrowing any selection stuff

1446
01:07:03,989 --> 01:07:08,849
let's add some selection stuff okay

1447
01:07:07,018 --> 01:07:12,748
so what I'm going to do here is say

1448
01:07:08,849 --> 01:07:17,009
let's let's add some stuff here let's

1449
01:07:12,748 --> 01:07:20,368
make a row for this let's have something

1450
01:07:17,009 --> 01:07:23,159
that shows the selection all the things

1451
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:25,469
in the selection and so the way I can do

1452
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:27,958
that is just do a for I loop over what I

1453
01:07:25,469 --> 01:07:29,548
already sort of set up to do this which

1454
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:31,498
is inside the in-game editor we have

1455
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:33,509
this notion of an active group

1456
01:07:31,498 --> 01:07:35,218
what's an active group well an active

1457
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:38,009
group is the thing that has almost

1458
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:39,509
exactly what I wanted it's got a number

1459
01:07:38,009 --> 01:07:41,728
of assets in it and I can loop through

1460
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:44,159
which ones they are right that's exactly

1461
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:46,318
what I wanted so in here what I can do

1462
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:49,618
is say okay let's go through each of

1463
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:52,498
those so for the editable asset group I

1464
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:54,329
can just say what's the asset index it's

1465
01:07:52,498 --> 01:07:56,338
actually an asset index index if you

1466
01:07:54,329 --> 01:07:58,199
think about it right because we're

1467
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:01,018
actually indexing into a list of access

1468
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:02,459
indices so it's an asset index index for

1469
01:08:01,018 --> 01:08:04,108
each of the ones in there actually it's

1470
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:07,548
not in a rake count it's for that active

1471
01:08:04,108 --> 01:08:07,548
group editor active grip

1472
01:08:07,989 --> 01:08:17,109
group there it is ask count for each of

1473
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:20,050
those that we have in our pick I can

1474
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:23,019
draw something that lets me sub select

1475
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:26,110
out of those whichever one I wanted

1476
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:30,490
right so what I can do there is say well

1477
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:33,279
for each of those you know if if they

1478
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:34,840
push a button that's whatever you know I

1479
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:39,579
don't know it's gonna be a bitmap button

1480
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:45,850
at some point probably right if I pick

1481
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:47,529
this bitmap button then I I switch to

1482
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:49,420
that asset that's that's all we're

1483
01:08:47,529 --> 01:08:52,569
talking about here so I've got an

1484
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:55,090
editable asset in each of these cases so

1485
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:57,549
all I want to do here is say this is the

1486
01:08:55,090 --> 01:09:00,310
editable asset if I go to this active

1487
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:02,380
group and pick out one of the assets so

1488
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:04,960
there's the asset index index when I get

1489
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:08,520
that editable asset out what I can do is

1490
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:16,810
say look here's the button it's gonna be

1491
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:18,100
this asset index and this asset ID those

1492
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:20,590
are actually the things that are going

1493
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:23,289
to get picked here and what I can do is

1494
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:25,720
you know we already know we already know

1495
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:28,390
what that looks like so insight editor

1496
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:31,240
interact we already had a thing that was

1497
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:34,510
gonna do that so in here you did those

1498
01:09:31,239 --> 01:09:38,050
pics and whatever and I don't remember

1499
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:39,820
exactly how we did it it's here right

1500
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:44,550
yeah so you can see it here let's just

1501
01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:46,929
pull that out let's make these be

1502
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:53,500
something a little bit more specific

1503
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:58,750
there so like this whole thing probably

1504
01:09:53,500 --> 01:10:00,279
should come out and we'll look at how

1505
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:02,260
that's going to go in a second so what

1506
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,699
I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna instead

1507
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:07,000
of doing what we're doing before I'm

1508
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:09,729
gonna say editor active group equals

1509
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,920
editor hot group so when you pick an

1510
01:10:09,729 --> 01:10:15,129
asset we're actually gonna do this and

1511
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,800
then we're going to do inside there is

1512
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:21,550
set the asset index to whatever the

1513
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:29,289
first one was right

1514
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:34,350
so I'm going to do like I guess I can

1515
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:34,350
still do this now that I think about it

1516
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:43,420
all I want to do here is make this a

1517
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:46,259
little bit more systemic so I'm gonna

1518
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:49,869
say look this is the one it's this one

1519
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,520
right that's the one you should use and

1520
01:10:49,869 --> 01:10:57,090
so then I'm just gonna pull this out

1521
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:57,090
here and maybe I'll even do this

1522
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:07,660
so essentially you can to clear it you

1523
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:09,280
just pass zero right so then I've got to

1524
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:12,569
think here this is going to be setactive

1525
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:14,710
asset it's gonna take the in-game editor

1526
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:19,840
and it's gonna take the asset you

1527
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:22,149
actually wanted me to select like that

1528
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,369
makes sense and then so in here we would

1529
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:33,189
just say look if there if you pass me a

1530
01:11:24,369 --> 01:11:40,449
valid one I'm gonna use it but if you

1531
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:43,899
didn't I'm just gonna clear it makes

1532
01:11:40,449 --> 01:11:45,789
sense so then we just have this is now

1533
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:48,939
something that's a utility function so I

1534
01:11:45,789 --> 01:11:50,769
can make that happen wherever it wants

1535
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:52,960
to so in here if someone was gonna

1536
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:56,350
select something I can just say set

1537
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:58,539
active asset and I can say this is the

1538
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:00,460
asset to select so now all I need is a

1539
01:11:58,539 --> 01:12:02,170
way of actually drawing the various

1540
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:04,090
assets I don't really have a way of

1541
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:07,420
doing that right now I'm just gonna draw

1542
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:09,430
a blank thing instead and that way I can

1543
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,380
switch between them just as a test and

1544
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:13,180
then we'll make the bitmap thing that

1545
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:18,039
actually lets us you know do that

1546
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:21,730
specific selection so now when we go

1547
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:25,569
into the button code I just have to

1548
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:27,069
actually sit here there we go I just

1549
01:12:25,569 --> 01:12:30,009
have to actually pass the rest of the

1550
01:12:27,069 --> 01:12:32,889
stuff I need a dev ID here I can do that

1551
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:34,900
probably by just using the actual dev ID

1552
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,949
of the asset itself I'm guessing

1553
01:12:34,899 --> 01:12:38,198
don't think there's any reason why I

1554
01:12:35,948 --> 01:12:39,339
couldn't do that maybe there is maybe

1555
01:12:38,198 --> 01:12:41,379
there is enough to think about that a

1556
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,840
little bit later the classifier in this

1557
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,989
case good I don't know just be you know

1558
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,300
the Edit asset there we go

1559
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:52,408
because that's unique in this case and

1560
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:54,909
so then we've got label text and enabled

1561
01:12:52,408 --> 01:12:56,619
there's the label text the enabling is

1562
01:12:54,908 --> 01:12:58,988
always gonna be true the background

1563
01:12:56,619 --> 01:13:01,059
color can stay as it is and then we just

1564
01:12:58,988 --> 01:13:02,709
we need to change this to be a bitmap in

1565
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:05,289
the future and so we're gonna work on

1566
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:07,000
that in a second here so I think that's

1567
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:10,448
everything we would need to be able to

1568
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,890
sub pick assets inside there and so now

1569
01:13:10,448 --> 01:13:13,928
you know when we select one of these we

1570
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:16,390
should have a thing that shows how many

1571
01:13:13,929 --> 01:13:19,210
assets were under the cursor there and

1572
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:21,310
be able to actually pick between them so

1573
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:24,158
you know we can we should be able to

1574
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:27,789
select different assets in this case you

1575
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:30,759
can even see like if we look there was a

1576
01:13:27,789 --> 01:13:33,789
another asset that it was picked it

1577
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:36,460
probably isn't is that really an asset

1578
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:37,988
that's probably just a room which

1579
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:41,079
doesn't probably have anything in it

1580
01:13:37,988 --> 01:13:42,428
right but you can see now when I pick so

1581
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:46,000
let's say you know let's say I picked

1582
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:49,149
down that line right so like the pic was

1583
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,189
like right there I need to make it so it

1584
01:13:49,149 --> 01:13:52,658
doesn't actually reap it on camera

1585
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:54,729
that's probably something I should do

1586
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:56,439
but you can see when we pick down that

1587
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:58,419
line you can see now I can select

1588
01:13:56,439 --> 01:14:02,319
everything that was down that line just

1589
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:04,359
by just by doing this right which is

1590
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,670
pretty awesome you know what I mean

1591
01:14:04,359 --> 01:14:10,408
so now anything that's under the cursor

1592
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:21,550
all the way down like 16 deep we will at

1593
01:14:10,408 --> 01:14:25,299
sixteen eight so eight deep down we can

1594
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:26,679
you know get hey probably that's the

1595
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,170
answer right there one two three four

1596
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:31,750
five is in me so everything down there

1597
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:33,100
we can now pick outside of the UI in a

1598
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:36,850
little like convenient little picker

1599
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:39,370
that's exactly what we want in that case

1600
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:41,350
because that allows us to really cleanly

1601
01:14:39,369 --> 01:14:43,000
pick between these the thing that's not

1602
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,739
so clean about it is we can't tell who

1603
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,090
we're talking about that's why I say

1604
01:14:44,738 --> 01:14:47,888
let's go ahead and add something that

1605
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:48,430
actually shows a little tiny little bit

1606
01:14:47,889 --> 01:14:51,789
map don't

1607
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:55,840
big just a little bit map in there that

1608
01:14:51,789 --> 01:14:59,109
we can then use as the differentiator

1609
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,760
okay so in order to do that what we need

1610
01:14:59,109 --> 01:15:02,679
is some way of actually looking up with

1611
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,840
the bitmap is fortunately we have an

1612
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,520
asset index in this case so we should be

1613
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,440
able to actually look it up in the same

1614
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,730
way we were looking it up here so we

1615
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:12,460
should be able to do something that

1616
01:15:09,729 --> 01:15:15,189
looks essentially like this outside in

1617
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:16,600
the selector and then we just do it for

1618
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:19,149
all of the things that run to there

1619
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,130
instead of only the active one just in

1620
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:23,349
this one case so we go ahead and get the

1621
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:25,210
assets we see if those assets are

1622
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:27,700
bitmaps and if they are we can display

1623
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:30,130
them here and we can use the actual

1624
01:15:27,699 --> 01:15:32,859
bitmap itself as the way of displaying

1625
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:35,380
what's going on right so we know we've

1626
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:37,420
got to get bitmap call that we can use

1627
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:40,300
to actually get the bitmap after the

1628
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:47,350
fact and then we'll actually do that

1629
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:53,320
here so I'll bitmap loaded bitmap equals

1630
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:57,310
get bitmap right assets bitmap index

1631
01:15:53,319 --> 01:16:00,069
which is whatever the asset index is so

1632
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:04,780
I think that's all there is to it

1633
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:08,549
and so when we now come in here like

1634
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:12,309
that I just need to pass this bitmap in

1635
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:15,190
and along with that a notion of the

1636
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:17,560
signs so like how tall the bitmap should

1637
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:19,689
be I don't know how tall it should be

1638
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:25,390
let's just say we're gonna draw it in a

1639
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:27,460
64 by 64 square so I'm gonna say that's

1640
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:30,789
the width and the height of what I want

1641
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:32,920
the actual blocks to be and so I'm gonna

1642
01:16:30,789 --> 01:16:35,829
be able to say bitmap button this is

1643
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:37,149
some bla bla bla bla bla that's gonna

1644
01:16:35,829 --> 01:16:40,180
happen here and then I've got some

1645
01:16:37,149 --> 01:16:42,969
things like highlight or active it

1646
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:44,680
should always be active the highlight

1647
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:47,530
should only be true if this is the

1648
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:50,350
active asset and I know that that's true

1649
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:52,090
because I can look to see whether this

1650
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:54,910
is the one that's being edited at any

1651
01:16:52,090 --> 01:17:01,020
given time by saying well if the Edit

1652
01:16:54,909 --> 01:17:01,019
assets asset index equals the editors

1653
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:09,549
a Civ asset index then I know that this

1654
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:11,860
should be highlighted right I does that

1655
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:15,670
make sense so you know something like

1656
01:17:11,859 --> 01:17:18,519
this that should be everything that I

1657
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:21,100
need that's it for the for the u.s. to

1658
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,880
have it so nicely actually implement

1659
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:28,750
that in the actual bitmap system itself

1660
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:32,529
as we go now I don't actually

1661
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:35,470
necessarily in this case need to

1662
01:17:32,529 --> 01:17:37,300
actually load the bitmap so I could make

1663
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:39,670
it so that that passes instead of a

1664
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:54,449
bitmap pointer it could just pass the

1665
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:54,449
bitmap ID right I don't really know

1666
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:01,090
which one of those it should be if I

1667
01:17:59,859 --> 01:18:02,349
look at what happens the code here

1668
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,489
I could probably simplify this quite a

1669
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:07,180
bit if I just didn't have to do that

1670
01:18:03,488 --> 01:18:10,689
right so another way of looking at it

1671
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:14,159
would be to say well maybe it would just

1672
01:18:10,689 --> 01:18:14,159
be nice if we could do this

1673
01:18:27,029 --> 01:18:33,489
you know um because that simplifies the

1674
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:35,050
code gorilla and then that goes into the

1675
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:38,469
bitmap button code which is better

1676
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:40,570
because that code can then you know be

1677
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:43,539
shared across anyone who wants to pop up

1678
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:46,119
a bitmap for a button for some reason so

1679
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:49,949
that seems a little bit better on the

1680
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:51,909
whole so I'm gonna go ahead and make the

1681
01:18:49,949 --> 01:18:53,949
extraordinary claim that that's what

1682
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:56,949
should happen I realize that maybe I'm a

1683
01:18:53,949 --> 01:18:59,679
little far afield there but okay so if

1684
01:18:56,949 --> 01:19:02,590
we do bitmap button and then I do WI

1685
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,539
layout here and we want all the same

1686
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:07,060
stuff basically so it's you know it's

1687
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:08,680
the same code in terms of what's going

1688
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:15,090
on but instead of the care label text

1689
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:18,220
there I'm just gonna do a bitmap ID okay

1690
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:24,220
we then need to know the width and the

1691
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:32,550
height we whoops that actually came

1692
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:32,550
first and then we need like enabled and

1693
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:44,920
and highlighted so there's our code for

1694
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:49,060
bitmap button subtly speaking we want to

1695
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:52,750
do this right so we want to do basically

1696
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:54,850
the same stuff here but this part has to

1697
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:56,920
trick change rather dramatically so it's

1698
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:59,380
only like that like the very preamble

1699
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:03,399
part that's really gonna be what we're

1700
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:07,510
using here and so we need to kind of

1701
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:12,149
rewrite this part to be to work with a

1702
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:16,829
bitmap right so if I go up and look at

1703
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:20,279
what goes on in here just looking at

1704
01:20:16,829 --> 01:20:20,279
what we've got

1705
01:20:25,019 --> 01:20:35,260
yeah like you know this we're gonna have

1706
01:20:33,219 --> 01:20:36,969
to do basically this stuff and it's

1707
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:40,479
gonna have to change pretty dramatically

1708
01:20:36,969 --> 01:20:43,899
so we want that as our basic idea of

1709
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:47,079
what's going on in the code but it's got

1710
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:51,219
to be modified quite a bit so we'll

1711
01:20:47,078 --> 01:20:53,889
start by saying ok let's get started

1712
01:20:51,219 --> 01:20:57,279
here in terms of looking at the UI

1713
01:20:53,889 --> 01:21:00,248
itself we really just need the assets

1714
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:02,498
pointer here so it's really the render

1715
01:21:00,248 --> 01:21:04,059
group that we care about not so much the

1716
01:21:02,498 --> 01:21:08,529
UI you can see what's going on here

1717
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:10,510
we're not really using that UI as much

1718
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:13,538
well we kind of are so we'll keep that

1719
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:19,289
out but we really want this we want the

1720
01:21:13,538 --> 01:21:22,748
render group to be out here so that's

1721
01:21:19,288 --> 01:21:26,518
coming out here we don't have a text

1722
01:21:22,748 --> 01:21:29,649
bounds we know what the rectangle is

1723
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:33,340
because we've been told what the

1724
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:37,748
rectangle is so we know that we've got a

1725
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:40,708
rectangle min/max essentially that looks

1726
01:21:37,748 --> 01:21:40,708
something like this

1727
01:21:42,118 --> 01:21:47,708
you know I'm saying saying there so we

1728
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:50,198
know we've got something like this and

1729
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:53,170
then we've got this dimension stuff here

1730
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:56,049
which is which could be sort of written

1731
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:57,788
off the same thing as well right so we

1732
01:21:56,050 --> 01:22:08,349
can do that but if you look at what it

1733
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:11,170
actually needs in this case the height

1734
01:22:08,349 --> 01:22:12,578
part so it's it's really the dim could

1735
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:18,368
really be expressed I guess more

1736
01:22:12,578 --> 01:22:20,349
succinctly this way right so that gets

1737
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:22,509
our dim that's how much space we're

1738
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:24,400
going to take out we ask for that and we

1739
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:27,248
get back how big it should be this all

1740
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:30,038
probably works just fine we've got the

1741
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:31,420
backdrop color here that we wouldn't

1742
01:22:30,038 --> 01:22:35,050
have because there really wouldn't be a

1743
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:35,980
backup color per se so this is probably

1744
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:41,529
a

1745
01:22:35,979 --> 01:22:44,649
an on a non thing because we probably

1746
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:46,179
want to do a rect outline of this thing

1747
01:22:44,649 --> 01:22:48,519
when it's selected and then just nothing

1748
01:22:46,179 --> 01:22:50,920
but it's not I guess I don't know that's

1749
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,570
hard to say maybe what we really should

1750
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:57,940
do is just pass one in here and then

1751
01:22:52,569 --> 01:23:01,329
have that lighted up or not that I

1752
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:03,428
really just don't know but either/or

1753
01:23:01,329 --> 01:23:04,929
once we actually get here what we want

1754
01:23:03,429 --> 01:23:07,630
to do is we want to do a push bitmap

1755
01:23:04,929 --> 01:23:09,069
call to actually draw this thing so

1756
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,719
let's just start with that and then

1757
01:23:09,069 --> 01:23:12,908
we'll play around with the rendering a

1758
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:16,600
little bit later on so maybe like we

1759
01:23:12,908 --> 01:23:18,339
just don't do this yet and we say like

1760
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:21,100
yeah not gonna happen

1761
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:23,920
so in here we'll do the the push bitmap

1762
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:29,289
let me look inside the renderer for how

1763
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:31,989
we want to do that where is our where is

1764
01:23:29,289 --> 01:23:38,920
our drawing is it push up right and push

1765
01:23:31,988 --> 01:23:43,178
bright so it looks like we more or less

1766
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:47,109
want this right that will give us this

1767
01:23:43,179 --> 01:23:49,868
will give us what we're looking for in

1768
01:23:47,109 --> 01:23:52,149
terms of a quad that's constructed it's

1769
01:23:49,868 --> 01:23:55,000
not necessarily exactly how we might

1770
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:57,939
have wanted the construction to be but

1771
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,149
it's good enough so here we need to get

1772
01:23:57,939 --> 01:24:03,669
that renderer texture so we need that to

1773
01:24:01,149 --> 01:24:10,839
have been queued up so we'll have to do

1774
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:14,260
that here so that's I'm gonna have to do

1775
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:17,170
the center P is pretty easy it's gonna

1776
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:19,360
be whatever the element bounds of the

1777
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:22,420
center of the elements bounds are so

1778
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:24,939
it's really just gonna be this and we

1779
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:32,319
know that we don't care so much about

1780
01:24:24,939 --> 01:24:34,509
our Z location here I guess it's the UI

1781
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:36,158
text transform is where it should be

1782
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:38,800
roughly because it's on the text layer

1783
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:41,019
so I believe it's that is what we would

1784
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,119
want our Z value to be you know what I

1785
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:47,349
mean

1786
01:24:43,118 --> 01:24:49,689
the size is just the elements bounds the

1787
01:24:47,349 --> 01:24:52,810
color is going to be well all

1788
01:24:49,689 --> 01:24:54,819
the rest of this stuff is the same so we

1789
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:57,780
don't really need to worry about into

1790
01:24:54,819 --> 01:25:02,559
the rest of that I think that's just

1791
01:24:57,779 --> 01:25:07,198
that's just all there is I think the

1792
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,199
menu v-max UV we could pull out we could

1793
01:25:08,189 --> 01:25:13,299
if we wanted to we could actually use

1794
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,760
the width and height to pull that out

1795
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:17,079
into the menu v-max UV I'm gonna leave

1796
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,280
it this way for now because I actually

1797
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:20,350
think it would be nice throughout the

1798
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:22,000
see how much of the texture our stuff is

1799
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:24,340
occupying you know unfortunately

1800
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,069
sometimes it's not very much and so I'm

1801
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:30,699
gonna leave that for now but we could

1802
01:25:27,069 --> 01:25:32,198
change that later all right so the next

1803
01:25:30,698 --> 01:25:35,469
thing we have to do is actually

1804
01:25:32,198 --> 01:25:37,988
implement that that sort of ability to

1805
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:43,239
get the bitmap out so that's really just

1806
01:25:37,988 --> 01:25:47,829
gonna be this we're just gonna try and

1807
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:50,500
get that bitmap ID if we get it we're

1808
01:25:47,829 --> 01:25:55,479
gonna call push sprite and we're going

1809
01:25:50,500 --> 01:26:02,500
to go ahead and and pass the the bitmap

1810
01:25:55,479 --> 01:26:05,799
texture handle texture handle I think I

1811
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:08,140
think it's dr. handle and then if we

1812
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,940
can't we're gonna ask the asset ID to

1813
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:11,380
load it we're not gonna set them missing

1814
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:14,769
bounds because this is an editor it

1815
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:18,039
shouldn't ever it shouldn't ever cause a

1816
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:23,410
delay in rendering the border in this

1817
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:26,920
case I'm not sure that we know what that

1818
01:26:23,409 --> 01:26:29,380
is because normally that gets passed in

1819
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,630
as layout thickness so I guess in this

1820
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:33,430
case I'm just gonna say it's always the

1821
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:34,090
layout thickness you can't really change

1822
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:35,680
it

1823
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:37,779
maybe we should allow you to change it

1824
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,460
but in this case I'm not going to if we

1825
01:26:37,779 --> 01:26:43,929
pull this code out into a separate pass

1826
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:48,779
then we would the item interaction here

1827
01:26:43,930 --> 01:26:48,780
is just the interaction specified

1828
01:26:51,140 --> 01:27:10,910
the group in this case is the render

1829
01:26:52,970 --> 01:27:16,630
group v2 v3 Z is that all was there

1830
01:27:10,909 --> 01:27:33,889
another one push right rectangle 2 2 v2

1831
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:36,020
so in this case it wants that alright so

1832
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:37,430
we'll see in theory that should have

1833
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:39,140
given us something I may have messed

1834
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:40,760
something up there but that should give

1835
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:44,539
us the ability to have bitmap buttons

1836
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:46,909
maybe hopefully possibly who knows Hey

1837
01:27:44,539 --> 01:27:50,390
look it worked really well so there's

1838
01:27:46,909 --> 01:27:52,760
all of our there's all of our sprites

1839
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:54,860
the problem is like I said we're just

1840
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,989
doing 0 to 1 so we're just seeing

1841
01:27:54,859 --> 01:27:59,509
whatever the texture had in it in its

1842
01:27:56,989 --> 01:28:01,279
entirety which may not really be the

1843
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:04,400
best thing to show there but you know

1844
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:06,649
for the moment it's fine with me and so

1845
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:09,109
those are all the things you know that

1846
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:11,719
we that are poked behind the cursor so

1847
01:28:09,109 --> 01:28:14,269
if I actually go here and and I can

1848
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:16,789
drill down on that line you can see like

1849
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:21,800
each of these each of those is all the

1850
01:28:16,789 --> 01:28:25,699
same right like there you go

1851
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:28,579
because each of those is is one of the

1852
01:28:25,699 --> 01:28:31,970
the same kind of tiles you know what I

1853
01:28:28,579 --> 01:28:34,159
mean and so if I pick something that's

1854
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:35,240
more kind of goes through a couple

1855
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,970
different things then you can kind of

1856
01:28:35,239 --> 01:28:40,609
see ok so there was a floor there was

1857
01:28:37,970 --> 01:28:44,690
the cat there was the old torso on the

1858
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:47,299
guy there was the another floor tile

1859
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:49,339
there was the right you know cat tile

1860
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:52,340
there's the wall let's pick through

1861
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:56,829
there so now what I really need to do is

1862
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:56,829
I need to find some way in here of

1863
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:07,979
I want to find some way in there of

1864
01:29:03,649 --> 01:29:11,639
picking like like drawing a like making

1865
01:29:07,979 --> 01:29:13,739
it clear whether it's selectable and if

1866
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:17,130
it's selectable it wasn't selected you

1867
01:29:13,739 --> 01:29:19,529
know what I mean so I want in there to

1868
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:26,369
have something like when you select this

1869
01:29:19,529 --> 01:29:32,659
thing you know if it's highlighted then

1870
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:32,659
we push a rect outline on there I guess

1871
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:39,660
that does something and I don't know

1872
01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:45,689
what that something is but like you know

1873
01:29:39,659 --> 01:29:48,359
it's just I don't know maybe you can set

1874
01:29:45,689 --> 01:29:50,549
that color probably I'm guessing but you

1875
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:55,259
know something like that so you know

1876
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:56,940
when you're in here I want to be able to

1877
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:59,010
see that I can't really see it probably

1878
01:29:56,939 --> 01:30:02,129
because it's not thick enough I would

1879
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:06,090
also like that to be afterwards so it

1880
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:08,100
has preference so that's gonna be what

1881
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:09,750
are our transforms inside WI I don't

1882
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:13,560
actually even remember to be honest with

1883
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:15,210
you there's a couple different sorting

1884
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:18,450
layers that we were using to keep things

1885
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:20,609
out so we've got the text transform

1886
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:22,829
shadow transform UI transfer and backing

1887
01:30:20,609 --> 01:30:27,829
transform tool tip transform I'm not

1888
01:30:22,829 --> 01:30:27,829
sure which of those really we want I

1889
01:30:29,149 --> 01:30:35,719
guess I'll say you Y transform what are

1890
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:35,719
those what are those set to

1891
01:30:41,619 --> 01:30:48,559
so I guess I might want this to be text

1892
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:55,039
transform and this to be UI transform

1893
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:58,490
I don't know so we'll just make that do

1894
01:30:55,039 --> 01:31:06,529
what it does and we'll see what has to

1895
01:30:58,489 --> 01:31:17,380
happen afterwards all right so how do I

1896
01:31:06,529 --> 01:31:19,849
set a thickness anyone now there we go

1897
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:23,829
so I want this to be reasonably thick

1898
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:23,829
selector maybe that

1899
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:43,110
seems pretty good right so now I can set

1900
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:48,900
like okay you know I want why does that

1901
01:31:43,109 --> 01:31:52,809
why does that go away what is this

1902
01:31:48,899 --> 01:31:59,769
wonder what is this something oh that's

1903
01:31:52,810 --> 01:32:00,670
the room so I wonder if I should

1904
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:02,770
double-check

1905
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:08,020
maybe I should still ask if the asset is

1906
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:10,300
a bitmap when I pointed out here mmm

1907
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:14,320
because maybe we do want to just look if

1908
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:18,730
there's not a well maybe not all right

1909
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:21,130
don't know so I'm going to go ahead and

1910
01:32:18,729 --> 01:32:24,699
say look let's see if this works

1911
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:26,380
suppose I want to edit the alignment

1912
01:32:24,699 --> 01:32:29,409
points on these two things so the cat

1913
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:31,300
right so I can pick the cat here and I

1914
01:32:29,409 --> 01:32:33,609
can just say you know here's the

1915
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:35,560
alignment of the cat in general right

1916
01:32:33,609 --> 01:32:37,119
and you know maybe I just want that to

1917
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:40,990
be whatever that is I don't know what it

1918
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:43,300
wants to be but then I can add another

1919
01:32:40,989 --> 01:32:45,729
alignment point there and say look

1920
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:50,260
that's the base of the neck it's going

1921
01:32:45,729 --> 01:32:52,539
to be like right there right and now

1922
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:54,369
that set up properly I flip back to here

1923
01:32:52,539 --> 01:32:57,100
I say that's the default alignment on

1924
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:59,979
this thing and so that makes it pretty

1925
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:02,590
easy for me to edit like I mean that was

1926
01:32:59,979 --> 01:33:05,169
trivial and that's great so and then I

1927
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:06,550
can go back and save it when we

1928
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:10,750
implement the save feature or whatever

1929
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:12,369
right so that seems pretty good and so

1930
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:15,159
now those things just have to actually

1931
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:16,689
get used we're at the five-minute

1932
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:18,460
warning now so I guess I'll leave it

1933
01:33:16,689 --> 01:33:21,929
there for today that's pretty good I'm

1934
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,930
pretty happy with where we got on that

1935
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,650
and we'll go from there

1936
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:41,960
can I give QA no I can't so I've got to

1937
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:54,969
do what we've learned is I have to do QA

1938
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:59,000
in pound hero only right there it goes

1939
01:33:54,969 --> 01:34:02,989
all right any questions on that does

1940
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:09,760
anyone have any questions on that

1941
01:34:02,988 --> 01:34:09,759
on what we just did questions concerns

1942
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:14,198
does anyone have them

1943
01:34:22,868 --> 01:34:32,958
does anybody have oh I like that feature

1944
01:34:29,050 --> 01:34:35,479
that's kind of fun you can see what the

1945
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:38,628
top of the scope was by mousing over

1946
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:43,128
that's nice don't know that I'd ever use

1947
01:34:38,628 --> 01:34:46,158
it how come a-near clip-point is set at

1948
01:34:43,128 --> 01:34:49,248
five and not closer it's not set at five

1949
01:34:46,158 --> 01:34:52,038
set three but the reason it's set closer

1950
01:34:49,248 --> 01:34:54,438
is because we wanted to eliminate things

1951
01:34:52,038 --> 01:34:57,288
that were in front of the like like

1952
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:58,878
upper floors and stuff so that's just

1953
01:34:57,288 --> 01:35:01,819
what we had picked because of how we

1954
01:34:58,878 --> 01:35:02,208
decided to construct things you know

1955
01:35:01,819 --> 01:35:04,248
what I mean

1956
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:12,128
so that our alpha fading clips that out

1957
01:35:04,248 --> 01:35:12,128
there if that makes sense

1958
01:35:17,488 --> 01:35:22,349
we'll be showing linkages between

1959
01:35:19,409 --> 01:35:23,939
alignment points there are no linkages

1960
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:25,770
between alignment points at the moment

1961
01:35:23,939 --> 01:35:31,500
if that makes sense

1962
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:32,580
oh are you saying I'm sorry not know

1963
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:39,090
what you're saying are you saying you

1964
01:35:32,579 --> 01:35:41,219
want to draw the just the entity I'm not

1965
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:42,510
sure let me say a couple things about

1966
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:45,930
that and maybe answer the question maybe

1967
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:47,640
doesn't our art assets do not have the

1968
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:50,989
concept of linkages between alignment

1969
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:54,060
points they just have alignment points

1970
01:35:50,988 --> 01:35:56,009
entities specify when they are created

1971
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:58,140
which alignment points they want to use

1972
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:59,820
to line themselves up but it's per

1973
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:01,140
entity so every entity can be

1974
01:35:59,819 --> 01:36:05,519
constructed differently if it wants to

1975
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:07,320
be so there is no way to edit that it's

1976
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,420
intentionally in the procedural

1977
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:11,009
generation side of things so we don't

1978
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:13,020
need to draw the linkages between

1979
01:36:11,010 --> 01:36:16,440
alignment points because you can't edit

1980
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:18,360
that that's strictly in the game the

1981
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:21,329
only thing that the art asset is allowed

1982
01:36:18,359 --> 01:36:23,519
to specify is if someone wanted to use a

1983
01:36:21,329 --> 01:36:27,029
particular type of alignment point which

1984
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:28,469
one would it be right so that's why

1985
01:36:27,029 --> 01:36:29,149
we're not drawing that does that make

1986
01:36:28,469 --> 01:36:31,319
sense

1987
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:32,549
what would you say is crappy in your

1988
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:34,859
current implementation about the I am

1989
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:36,810
GUI a lot of stuff is crappy about it

1990
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:38,359
right because we wanted to minimize the

1991
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:41,070
amount of time that we spent

1992
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:42,509
implementing the actual back end right

1993
01:36:41,069 --> 01:36:45,449
we just wanted something simple there

1994
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:46,590
and so it's got a lot of hacky stuff in

1995
01:36:45,449 --> 01:36:47,880
it right it was just whatever is the

1996
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:49,860
fastest is what's in there

1997
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,819
you know so if you were actually trying

1998
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:53,460
you know let's say you're trying to

1999
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:54,869
compete with QT right and you want to

2000
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:56,730
make an eye on GUI that's supposed to do

2001
01:36:54,869 --> 01:36:58,019
that you need a lot you need to spend a

2002
01:36:56,729 --> 01:36:59,729
lot more time on like your widget

2003
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:01,170
rendering and how the layout works like

2004
01:36:59,729 --> 01:37:03,359
you need to put a lot more code in there

2005
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:04,289
right because a lot of that stuff has

2006
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:09,389
nothing to do with the user interface

2007
01:37:04,289 --> 01:37:11,039
that's just it's just polished right and

2008
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:13,079
so all of that work would have to be

2009
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:15,090
done and it's not done and ours is

2010
01:37:13,079 --> 01:37:17,519
crappy right it doesn't look very nice

2011
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:20,850
you know and so yeah you know you need a

2012
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,180
lot of that to be done if that makes

2013
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:23,180
sense

2014
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:25,050
your visual design and typography

2015
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:27,270
exactly the things I was complaining

2016
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:29,579
about on the pre stream about how CSS is

2017
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:31,110
terrible all of the stuff that CSS sucks

2018
01:37:29,579 --> 01:37:33,618
that we need to do

2019
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:36,118
a good version of that to make a nice

2020
01:37:33,618 --> 01:37:38,908
beautifully laid out properly aligned

2021
01:37:36,118 --> 01:37:40,948
fonts nice edging nice anti-aliasing

2022
01:37:38,908 --> 01:37:42,719
like all that stuff that's all real work

2023
01:37:40,948 --> 01:37:44,158
that has to be done now granted QT

2024
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,439
doesn't do most of that either booty

2025
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:48,379
looks like crap most the time too but if

2026
01:37:46,439 --> 01:37:51,439
you were actually wanting a really good

2027
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:53,940
GUI system whether it's I am or not

2028
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:56,759
that's a lot of work that has to go into

2029
01:37:53,939 --> 01:38:01,138
there's a lot of graphical polish that

2030
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:02,789
has to go in there would it be useful to

2031
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:04,079
add mouse wrapping like in blender so

2032
01:38:02,789 --> 01:38:06,118
you can drag past the end of the scream

2033
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,429
and ending values sure if this was like

2034
01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:10,139
again that's exactly what I mean by

2035
01:38:08,429 --> 01:38:11,789
polished that if you were trying to make

2036
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:14,429
a very polished editor sure you would do

2037
01:38:11,789 --> 01:38:15,899
that we probably wouldn't spend time on

2038
01:38:14,429 --> 01:38:18,469
that because it's not really super

2039
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:18,469
necessary

2040
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:45,510
okay not seeing anymore questions

2041
01:38:40,118 --> 01:38:45,509
so maybe we can wrap things up early

2042
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:06,409
it's an overhead when checking for if

2043
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:09,560
button when doing that every frame well

2044
01:39:06,409 --> 01:39:12,710
so two things about that first of all no

2045
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:14,960
not really and the reason for that is

2046
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:17,480
because if you're drawing something then

2047
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,000
it's usually comparatively free to check

2048
01:39:17,479 --> 01:39:22,729
the boundaries of its rectangle which is

2049
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,649
all the if button does so in terms of

2050
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:26,329
overhead it is an overhead that

2051
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:30,289
literally can't really show up on your

2052
01:39:26,329 --> 01:39:32,539
profile now the larger question which is

2053
01:39:30,289 --> 01:39:35,000
isn't it an overhead to have to redraw

2054
01:39:32,539 --> 01:39:37,609
the entire frame every time yes but

2055
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,250
that's not a restriction of I am GUI you

2056
01:39:37,609 --> 01:39:43,399
can easily just call I am GUI once and

2057
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:47,149
just you know save the results into a

2058
01:39:43,399 --> 01:39:49,779
bitmap and only call it again when the

2059
01:39:47,149 --> 01:39:53,359
user actually tries to click on it right

2060
01:39:49,779 --> 01:39:55,550
if that's what you want now granted if

2061
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:57,859
you do that then you can't make you eyes

2062
01:39:55,550 --> 01:40:00,079
that respond to Mouse moves in complex

2063
01:39:57,859 --> 01:40:01,969
ways which is one of the powers of I am

2064
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:04,460
GUI so I usually advocate just draw the

2065
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:05,690
whole thing every frame when someone's

2066
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:07,340
actually interacting with it because

2067
01:40:05,689 --> 01:40:10,309
then you can be much more responsive and

2068
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:12,980
everything can change as the user moves

2069
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:15,140
it around which is nicer so I prefer

2070
01:40:12,979 --> 01:40:17,750
that but if you just art maybe you're

2071
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:19,730
just concerned in minimizing the amount

2072
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:23,840
of battery usage or something like that

2073
01:40:19,729 --> 01:40:25,819
then you can trivially just not call the

2074
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,909
UI to be redrawn or edited or anything

2075
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:30,909
until they actually click the button

2076
01:40:27,909 --> 01:40:30,909
right

2077
01:40:34,939 --> 01:40:41,000
will you ever make an emote or just

2078
01:40:37,579 --> 01:40:43,760
steal one of John's so you'll have to

2079
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:49,340
forgive me I don't know what that means

2080
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:53,090
am I allowed to make new emotes I is

2081
01:40:49,340 --> 01:41:02,140
that something I can do and if so how do

2082
01:40:53,090 --> 01:41:06,190
I do it like I don't I you'll just

2083
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:08,570
forgive me I don't know what that is I

2084
01:41:06,189 --> 01:41:10,369
stream on Twitch but I'm not much of a

2085
01:41:08,569 --> 01:41:12,079
twitch streamer if that makes any sense

2086
01:41:10,369 --> 01:41:15,399
don't forget to Like and subscribe

2087
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:18,529
thanks for the 12-month sub and so on

2088
01:41:15,399 --> 01:41:20,719
but I literally don't know where that is

2089
01:41:18,529 --> 01:41:22,399
like I'm looking now and I have I have

2090
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:25,659
no idea where is there a thing for that

2091
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:25,659
on the dashboard or something

2092
01:41:32,488 --> 01:41:37,769
what's the reason you I use this loses

2093
01:41:34,649 --> 01:41:44,699
state when you HOT load so the reason

2094
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:47,219
for that is it it doesn't always right

2095
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:50,449
but sometimes it does and the answer

2096
01:41:47,219 --> 01:41:54,539
that is one of the ways that you make

2097
01:41:50,449 --> 01:41:56,369
creating the UI easier on the user is by

2098
01:41:54,539 --> 01:41:58,769
letting them use things like transient

2099
01:41:56,369 --> 01:42:02,430
pointers to identify things so for

2100
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:05,570
example if you look at where we set

2101
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:10,829
things up when we're using the UI you

2102
01:42:05,569 --> 01:42:13,439
can see inside dev ID from pointer you

2103
01:42:10,829 --> 01:42:15,899
can see where we're passing transient

2104
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,129
pointers sometimes right you see that

2105
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:21,899
how that's happening

2106
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:25,529
those transient pointers are only valid

2107
01:42:21,899 --> 01:42:27,988
in the code as it was loaded originally

2108
01:42:25,529 --> 01:42:29,670
when we do hot code reloading some of

2109
01:42:27,988 --> 01:42:31,919
those things may get reallocated or

2110
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:34,440
moved around like string pointers for

2111
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:36,899
example and now they don't refer to the

2112
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:39,719
same thing anymore so the UI system when

2113
01:42:36,899 --> 01:42:40,979
it goes oh he's not he hasn't selected

2114
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:42,149
that thing anymore it's like you

2115
01:42:40,979 --> 01:42:44,429
selected some different thing or

2116
01:42:42,149 --> 01:42:48,059
whatever right that's where the state

2117
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:49,469
gets lost does that make sense and so

2118
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:51,420
you could make it so that it preserve

2119
01:42:49,469 --> 01:42:52,859
the state but I don't really want that

2120
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:54,690
because I don't care that much about

2121
01:42:52,859 --> 01:42:58,559
preserving the state during hot load of

2122
01:42:54,689 --> 01:43:00,839
the editor so I don't want to force the

2123
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:03,510
people using and by that I mean me but

2124
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:04,710
the user of the editor I want them to

2125
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,969
still be able to just use pointers

2126
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:07,710
because it's just more convenient for

2127
01:43:05,969 --> 01:43:09,719
them to do it means they don't have to

2128
01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:14,039
introduce IDs and stuff that they don't

2129
01:43:09,719 --> 01:43:22,350
want can you play around with it a

2130
01:43:14,039 --> 01:43:25,560
little more well I mean I'm happy to do

2131
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:27,870
so but I think I did all the things that

2132
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:29,940
we could do by the way we really need

2133
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:32,340
that these two guys not snapping to the

2134
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:33,509
corners is really driving me nuts I got

2135
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:37,289
to fix that one of these one of these

2136
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:38,730
days I'm happy to play we ran with it a

2137
01:43:37,289 --> 01:43:40,590
little bit more I just don't know what

2138
01:43:38,729 --> 01:43:43,409
it actually is that you would want me to

2139
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:46,260
do I mean here let's add some points we

2140
01:43:43,409 --> 01:43:49,590
can move them around

2141
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:53,760
I guess in here somewhere

2142
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:54,510
and then in here I could I mean what I

2143
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,949
could do right

2144
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:58,110
it's oops I moved that to the wrong

2145
01:43:55,948 --> 01:43:58,888
place we have undo so I can undo it

2146
01:43:58,109 --> 01:44:01,078
right

2147
01:43:58,889 --> 01:44:11,779
I can even undo the creation of those

2148
01:44:01,078 --> 01:44:15,198
things right so that all works real well

2149
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:17,939
so we have undoing redo which is good

2150
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:20,038
you know I can pick some of these other

2151
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:22,500
things and the you know the selection

2152
01:44:20,038 --> 01:44:25,679
isn't undo isn't an undo or redo so

2153
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:28,319
that's properly separated out between

2154
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:31,828
the two you know I can and I don't know

2155
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:34,229
that's some more in here I don't know so

2156
01:44:31,828 --> 01:44:38,219
I mean yeah I can play with it but I

2157
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:41,518
don't have much you know I I don't

2158
01:44:38,219 --> 01:44:43,590
really have any it doesn't do anything

2159
01:44:41,519 --> 01:44:51,329
other than what you already saw me

2160
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:53,730
program it to do so with software

2161
01:44:51,328 --> 01:44:55,408
rendering you can do hot regions that

2162
01:44:53,729 --> 01:44:57,388
are redrawn when the user fiddles with

2163
01:44:55,408 --> 01:44:59,069
UI elements can you anything similar be

2164
01:44:57,389 --> 01:45:01,949
done with hardware rendering yes

2165
01:44:59,069 --> 01:45:04,649
certainly so what you need to do if you

2166
01:45:01,948 --> 01:45:05,969
want to have hot regions that are

2167
01:45:04,649 --> 01:45:08,069
redrawn only when the user fiddles with

2168
01:45:05,969 --> 01:45:09,480
the UI elements and you've already seen

2169
01:45:08,069 --> 01:45:11,578
me implement the code necessary to do

2170
01:45:09,479 --> 01:45:13,578
this actually inside the renderer so

2171
01:45:11,578 --> 01:45:17,279
we've already done stuff like this is

2172
01:45:13,578 --> 01:45:18,689
you just create so remember even in here

2173
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:20,578
is currently stands right now we don't

2174
01:45:18,689 --> 01:45:21,839
render directly to the back buffer when

2175
01:45:20,578 --> 01:45:23,759
you've rendered to intermediate buffers

2176
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,130
which then get composed to make the back

2177
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,289
buffer so if what you wanted to do was

2178
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:29,909
eliminate redraw on the UI and so you

2179
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:31,198
would only redraw when the user fills

2180
01:45:29,908 --> 01:45:33,929
with UI elements what you would do is

2181
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:36,598
create one more back buffer that back

2182
01:45:33,929 --> 01:45:38,219
buffer would hold lease the UI and every

2183
01:45:36,599 --> 01:45:41,038
time you draw UI you draw it into the

2184
01:45:38,219 --> 01:45:44,340
back buffer for the UI then that gets

2185
01:45:41,038 --> 01:45:45,599
composed onto the game right and you've

2186
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,889
already seen me do all those things all

2187
01:45:45,599 --> 01:45:48,210
those things we already did inside the

2188
01:45:46,889 --> 01:45:50,550
renderer so you can go back and watch me

2189
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:52,078
do those we did them so we just add one

2190
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:55,260
more back buffer that's the UI state and

2191
01:45:52,078 --> 01:45:59,099
then what we do is we never clear that

2192
01:45:55,260 --> 01:46:00,180
buffer right so we just draw the UI into

2193
01:45:59,099 --> 01:46:02,310
it and we leave it

2194
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:04,289
it is and then whenever we want to

2195
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:08,490
redraw a piece of the UI we clear just

2196
01:46:04,289 --> 01:46:11,100
the rectangle that occupies that part of

2197
01:46:08,489 --> 01:46:13,349
the UI and then we redraw with the with

2198
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:16,140
a scissor region just set to that we

2199
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:22,620
just redraw that part so it's very very

2200
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:31,350
simple actually so the finish became

2201
01:46:22,619 --> 01:46:33,149
sick with almond milk no so you just key

2202
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:35,910
you get an ax to draw something cute

2203
01:46:33,149 --> 01:46:37,109
like a cat and then you upload the kitty

2204
01:46:35,909 --> 01:46:40,579
image to twitch

2205
01:46:37,109 --> 01:46:43,920
well yeah but where is there somewhere I

2206
01:46:40,579 --> 01:46:51,899
guess I can just search online for how

2207
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:56,100
do I upload emotes you know what here

2208
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:59,159
I'll just I'll just send an email and

2209
01:46:56,100 --> 01:47:01,220
you know I'll I'll try to figure that

2210
01:46:59,159 --> 01:47:01,220
out

2211
01:47:21,899 --> 01:47:28,539
so here's an email I will add Anna and

2212
01:47:26,198 --> 01:47:34,988
myself and we will try to figure that

2213
01:47:28,539 --> 01:47:36,130
out but yeah I mean so the reason I have

2214
01:47:34,988 --> 01:47:37,299
not done that is because I literally

2215
01:47:36,130 --> 01:47:40,239
just don't know anything about it so

2216
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:42,730
I'll go search for like how do I upload

2217
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:46,049
whatever and we'll go from there let me

2218
01:47:42,729 --> 01:47:46,049
see if I have any more questions

2219
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:52,229
[Music]

2220
01:47:58,039 --> 01:48:02,269
a page on the twitch dashboard huh all

2221
01:48:00,979 --> 01:48:04,279
right I don't know where it is

2222
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:05,570
maybe it's under like clips or

2223
01:48:04,279 --> 01:48:07,460
collections or something I don't know

2224
01:48:05,569 --> 01:48:08,809
I'll just I'll find it I'm sure there's

2225
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:09,829
a tutorial okay I'll just search the

2226
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:20,690
tutorial I'm sure there's a tutorial

2227
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:27,050
somewhere is it costly to re update the

2228
01:48:20,689 --> 01:48:30,379
image to the GPU so I think this is a

2229
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:33,409
question on so it says what is the best

2230
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:36,279
way to add an add to an atlas map is it

2231
01:48:33,409 --> 01:48:40,579
costly to reuptake the image on the GPU

2232
01:48:36,279 --> 01:48:43,099
the answer is no it's usually not costly

2233
01:48:40,579 --> 01:48:47,420
and the way that you do it is you in

2234
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:50,570
OpenGL you use text sub image to update

2235
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:52,279
just that sub image we're doing almost

2236
01:48:50,569 --> 01:48:55,309
exactly the same thing just with a

2237
01:48:52,279 --> 01:48:57,349
texture array so instead of calling text

2238
01:48:55,310 --> 01:49:01,490
sub image 3d you would call text sub

2239
01:48:57,350 --> 01:49:03,730
image 2d makes sense so that's really

2240
01:49:01,489 --> 01:49:06,139
all there is to it

2241
01:49:03,729 --> 01:49:08,449
what do you think about a tree based on

2242
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:10,190
do system where you do not lose the redo

2243
01:49:08,449 --> 01:49:12,949
state when changing after undo but

2244
01:49:10,189 --> 01:49:15,079
create branches I think they're cool but

2245
01:49:12,949 --> 01:49:20,449
the interface to an artist can be pretty

2246
01:49:15,079 --> 01:49:22,069
confusing so you have to the the thing I

2247
01:49:20,449 --> 01:49:24,199
would encourage there is to think about

2248
01:49:22,069 --> 01:49:25,670
how are you going to expose it in a way

2249
01:49:24,199 --> 01:49:27,139
that the artist won't get really

2250
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:30,529
confused about what you're showing them

2251
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:32,329
right because remember an artist isn't a

2252
01:49:30,529 --> 01:49:36,259
programmer they don't know about things

2253
01:49:32,329 --> 01:49:38,449
like tree based change representation

2254
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:40,130
right they just look at what the app

2255
01:49:38,449 --> 01:49:43,250
shows them and they learn to use that

2256
01:49:40,130 --> 01:49:44,989
and so you have to present it in a way

2257
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:47,779
that they're going to let go oh I get it

2258
01:49:44,989 --> 01:49:49,189
right and you certainly could do that by

2259
01:49:47,779 --> 01:49:51,259
showing like a timeline that has

2260
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:53,000
branches on it or something but then you

2261
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:54,560
have to ask to have also is it worth it

2262
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,029
like art is the value that they're

2263
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,190
getting out of having that extra UI

2264
01:49:56,029 --> 01:49:59,989
that's kind of onerous and overbearing

2265
01:49:58,189 --> 01:50:01,639
is it worth it right and maybe the

2266
01:49:59,989 --> 01:50:03,279
answer is yes me the answer is no just

2267
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:10,400
something to think about

2268
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:15,710
so thoughts on ML will your game use it

2269
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:17,929
M L the programming language maybe you

2270
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:19,579
mean machine learning I guess what I

2271
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:21,619
would say is regardless of whether you

2272
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:23,359
mean ml the programming language for a

2273
01:50:21,619 --> 01:50:25,099
machine learning the concept the answer

2274
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:26,359
is still no the game won't use it so I

2275
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:29,539
guess I can answer the question even

2276
01:50:26,359 --> 01:50:30,559
without knowing what the question is you

2277
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:32,479
said you wouldn't use the internet at

2278
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,850
work I'd like to do that but I'm missing

2279
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:36,439
MSDN on the GL document and the GL

2280
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:37,820
documentation what do you do when you

2281
01:50:36,439 --> 01:50:39,109
don't have this information locally

2282
01:50:37,819 --> 01:50:41,359
available asking because I prefer not to

2283
01:50:39,109 --> 01:50:44,210
have the internet brown coding to things

2284
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:46,159
you can do number one for GL

2285
01:50:44,210 --> 01:50:51,560
documentation you can download the spec

2286
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:54,079
which is what I do from OpenGL org or

2287
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:56,330
the Chronos you can just download the

2288
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:59,899
spec and then it's used that PDF offline

2289
01:50:56,329 --> 01:51:02,869
and that works pretty well so that's one

2290
01:50:59,899 --> 01:51:06,139
way to go the other thing for MSDN is

2291
01:51:02,869 --> 01:51:10,420
you can try to get offline MSDN it's

2292
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:14,060
hard but you can try it I would say look

2293
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:19,909
just bite the bullet do your research on

2294
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:22,640
MSDN online and just bite the bullet the

2295
01:51:19,909 --> 01:51:25,970
fact that you have to use MSDN a few

2296
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:27,560
days keep that programming isolated and

2297
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:29,720
then go back to having no internet after

2298
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:31,670
you're done I really wish you could get

2299
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:37,659
MSDN offline unfortunately you can't

2300
01:51:31,670 --> 01:51:37,659
anymore but what can I say

2301
01:51:46,409 --> 01:51:50,050
one bit brain you talked about threading

2302
01:51:48,488 --> 01:51:52,389
being hard to say would use open and P

2303
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:54,429
if that's it no so when I meet when I

2304
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:57,910
say threading is hard what I mean is

2305
01:51:54,429 --> 01:51:59,079
that architectural e speaking threading

2306
01:51:57,909 --> 01:52:00,639
is very difficult and it's very

2307
01:51:59,079 --> 01:52:03,189
difficult because C++ doesn't really

2308
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:04,539
support what you need openmp probably

2309
01:52:03,189 --> 01:52:06,069
doesn't either I haven't spent a lot of

2310
01:52:04,539 --> 01:52:10,090
time looking at it but what I'm talking

2311
01:52:06,069 --> 01:52:11,859
about is things like if you have a large

2312
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:15,640
number of threads working on something

2313
01:52:11,859 --> 01:52:20,738
let's take a very simple case so let's

2314
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:24,579
suppose that all of my game is running

2315
01:52:20,738 --> 01:52:26,979
and then the user decides in the

2316
01:52:24,579 --> 01:52:31,869
settings menu that they're going to

2317
01:52:26,979 --> 01:52:37,779
switch from OpenGL back end to direct3d

2318
01:52:31,869 --> 01:52:40,059
back end right every thread that was

2319
01:52:37,779 --> 01:52:45,130
currently working on something graphics

2320
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:47,170
related is now some kind of wrong you

2321
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:48,730
know I'm saying anything that was

2322
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:50,920
working at an asynchronous transfer is

2323
01:52:48,729 --> 01:52:53,409
wrong anything that was waiting on the

2324
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:55,690
results of a compute operation is wrong

2325
01:52:53,409 --> 01:52:58,359
there's a lot of wrong going on and

2326
01:52:55,689 --> 01:53:00,579
those all have to be shut down and their

2327
01:52:58,359 --> 01:53:01,779
memory has to be properly reclaimed and

2328
01:53:00,579 --> 01:53:05,100
their resources have to be properly

2329
01:53:01,779 --> 01:53:07,479
freed and all of those things right and

2330
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:10,150
new things have to be started up that

2331
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:16,269
all properly use the new direct3d

2332
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:19,509
version of everything right these kinds

2333
01:53:16,270 --> 01:53:22,270
of waves through the codebase are very

2334
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:27,969
hard to model and hard to make efficient

2335
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:30,090
in my experience and I just don't see a

2336
01:53:27,969 --> 01:53:32,770
lot of people solving those problems

2337
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:34,480
they can they usually do one of two

2338
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:37,090
things either they solve a problem that

2339
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:38,439
I really just don't have which is how do

2340
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:40,029
I get a bunch of threads to all

2341
01:53:38,439 --> 01:53:42,399
cooperatively work on a math problem

2342
01:53:40,029 --> 01:53:44,229
it's like that's like day two of

2343
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:47,529
multi-threaded programming like it's not

2344
01:53:44,229 --> 01:53:49,419
an issue so things like OpenMP I'm

2345
01:53:47,529 --> 01:53:51,039
guessing don't really have much to offer

2346
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:55,140
me because the problem they're solving

2347
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:55,140
is a problem I don't actually have right

2348
01:53:56,159 --> 01:54:02,380
or they solve the problem

2349
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:04,480
the C++ way of now every last little

2350
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:08,010
thing does 10 times more work than it

2351
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:11,799
has to do so it's like everybody is like

2352
01:54:08,010 --> 01:54:15,510
creating tons of allocation free release

2353
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:19,869
open lock like tons of just interrelated

2354
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:21,969
disastrous lockup on every little thing

2355
01:54:19,868 --> 01:54:23,500
whether it's opening a file advocating a

2356
01:54:21,969 --> 01:54:27,880
little bit of memory doing this doing

2357
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:30,760
that right and so I just the the right

2358
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:33,039
answer is something that correctly looks

2359
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:36,150
at these waves and can break them apart

2360
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:38,800
for you and can automatically do the

2361
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:41,529
aggregate freeze and releases that you

2362
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:44,980
need and we just we're nowhere close to

2363
01:54:41,529 --> 01:54:52,988
having that kind of correct analysis you

2364
01:54:44,979 --> 01:54:55,089
know so like job management just isn't a

2365
01:54:52,988 --> 01:54:57,578
problem like that's not a problem I have

2366
01:54:55,090 --> 01:54:59,078
job management is trivial so if the

2367
01:54:57,578 --> 01:55:01,059
primary thing you're offering me by

2368
01:54:59,078 --> 01:55:06,250
getting your system is job management I

2369
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:09,849
I don't care right like that's just not

2370
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:11,469
the that's not the hard part you know

2371
01:55:09,849 --> 01:55:13,000
talk to me when you do really good

2372
01:55:11,469 --> 01:55:16,029
aggregate memory management

2373
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:18,069
that's super efficient and doesn't do

2374
01:55:16,029 --> 01:55:19,779
stuff like have to walk trees or check

2375
01:55:18,069 --> 01:55:22,359
things like that's actually just really

2376
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:26,050
kind of knows like okay I can set these

2377
01:55:22,359 --> 01:55:27,609
one or two points where I know after all

2378
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:30,070
these things correctly finished I can do

2379
01:55:27,609 --> 01:55:31,448
one block free and when these things

2380
01:55:30,069 --> 01:55:33,279
need to start up I can do one block

2381
01:55:31,448 --> 01:55:34,750
allocate and I properly have them laid

2382
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:38,380
out and look like when it actually does

2383
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:39,639
all that stuff okay but until I see some

2384
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:41,560
evidence that that's going on I'm

2385
01:55:39,639 --> 01:55:42,849
skeptical and maybe only oh maybe only

2386
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:43,210
baby has it I haven't looked at open

2387
01:55:42,849 --> 01:55:45,730
mimpi

2388
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:50,170
maybe it's awesome I doubt it but you

2389
01:55:45,729 --> 01:55:52,649
know maybe it is all right I think we're

2390
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:52,649
all done

2391
01:55:54,810 --> 01:55:57,880
thank you everyone for joining me for

2392
01:55:56,649 --> 01:55:59,889
the upside of handmade hero it's been a

2393
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:01,480
pleasure coding with you as always if

2394
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:03,220
you would like to follow along the

2395
01:56:01,479 --> 01:56:04,779
series at home you can always pre-order

2396
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:08,110
the game at handmade hero or it comes

2397
01:56:04,779 --> 01:56:13,989
the source code so that you can play

2398
01:56:08,109 --> 01:56:15,189
with it yourself until next time have

2399
01:56:13,989 --> 01:56:17,800
fun program you'll see on the internet

2400
01:56:15,189 --> 01:56:20,500
it probably will not be next weekend it

2401
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:25,779
will be much sooner because we are still

2402
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:29,500
celebrating Crump of Slav I hopefully I

2403
01:56:25,779 --> 01:56:30,789
said that right Columbus laughs for the

2404
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:32,529
next couple weeks which means there will

2405
01:56:30,789 --> 01:56:34,420
be lots of surprise dreams probably all

2406
01:56:32,529 --> 01:56:37,149
throughout the week so I will see you

2407
01:56:34,420 --> 01:56:41,500
back here probably sooner rather than

2408
01:56:37,149 --> 01:56:43,539
later but until that surprise occurs

2409
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:44,739
have fun program run I'll see you on the

2410
01:56:43,539 --> 01:56:46,420
Internet

2411
01:56:44,739 --> 01:56:49,149
I don't know if John's dream in a day

2412
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:52,510
but I set up the handmade hero twitch to

2413
01:56:49,149 --> 01:56:55,059
automatically host John if he is so if

2414
01:56:52,510 --> 01:56:58,329
he is it should switch right over to him

2415
01:56:55,060 --> 01:57:00,730
if he's not well I guess we don't get to

2416
01:56:58,329 --> 01:57:03,760
see that today but hopefully we do all

2417
01:57:00,729 --> 01:57:07,979
right I'm gonna sign off thanks for

2418
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,980
coming everybody see everyone next time
