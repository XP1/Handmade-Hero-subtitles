1
00:00:02,658 --> 00:00:07,889
all right hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,010
the third and final part of the career

3
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:12,449
stories I guess technically there's only

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,250
really two parts for this is just the

5
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,948
wrap up this is that this is the coda if

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,570
you will so the sort of the the end note

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,760
to it so as anyone who's watched either

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,250
of the first two videos now would be

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,320
more than aware the idea behind this was

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,469
just to sort of get experiences from

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,929
people who have changed to software

12
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:36,570
development from some other career or at

13
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:38,429
least tried to and maybe haven't been

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,509
successful yet or maybe failed and went

15
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,920
back to what they're doing or maybe

16
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,808
succeeded and now are doing it for a

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,219
living right so anything just the

18
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:48,570
attempt was the common thread and I read

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,129
all the submissions that I got online

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,340
and there was quite a lot there right

21
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:57,839
there's I think now something like 3

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,309
plus hours of readings of folks telling

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,699
their stories and saying sort of how

24
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,959
things happened to them and you know

25
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,590
what their experience was what their

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,719
takeaways were from it and so looking

27
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,299
over all of that I think there is you

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:15,000
know kind of two two things that I'm

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,479
interested in one is like what are sort

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,129
of the the basic sort of takeaways from

31
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,539
it that everyone could sort of say

32
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,629
there's a you know the what are the

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,330
common threads here and and that sort of

34
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:30,420
thing and then the second one is like is

35
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:33,060
there anything in particular in terms of

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,019
stuff we do on handmade hero that could

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,978
be useful in terms of helping people who

38
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:44,340
want to make that that's which right and

39
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:47,908
so for the first part what I think I

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,320
heard a lot in in those sorts of stories

41
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:55,189
talking about the career move is that it

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:59,209
really did sort of feel to me like

43
00:01:55,188 --> 00:02:02,669
there's a bit of a latent sort of

44
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:07,349
inherent draw towards this activity you

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,170
know and i think that squares well with

46
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,519
my experiences just personally as

47
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,719
someone who didn't switch crews who just

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,870
always did it

49
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,609
I think it is kind of true that software

50
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,939
development is the sort of thing that

51
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,400
you just sort of have a natural draw to

52
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,199
or you don't much like a lot of things

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,270
you might want to do like you know being

54
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,000
an illustrator and artist or something

55
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,070
like this I think that's very different

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,449
from saying like talent or not talent

57
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,069
right like are you going to be good at

58
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:37,739
it or not or anything like that I'm

59
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,780
stepping back what I'm saying I feel

60
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,760
like a lot of I heard a lot of people

61
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,710
sort of talking about the fact that just

62
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,629
this is the thing that they kind of are

63
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:50,129
drawn to write their kind of drawn to

64
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,870
the idea of doing this programming so

65
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:53,310
much so that they would do it in their

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,050
spare time or they like to tinker with

67
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,550
this or you know they used to do it when

68
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:01,830
they were little and then rediscovered

69
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:04,410
it again and cetera et cetera so I do

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,150
think the first step to this it does

71
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,280
kind of sound like if you're someone

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,379
who's thinking about this it does kind

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,569
of seem like well is that piece there

74
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,810
right like do you find yourself

75
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:18,509
naturally drawn to this activity not so

76
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,599
much as a career thing but just as

77
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:24,989
something that you find engaging right

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:30,359
does the mental curiosity for you hold

79
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:32,700
that appeal or does it not right and I

80
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,040
feel like that's kind of true just

81
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,839
across the board like I would say that

82
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,939
that's probably why I got into software

83
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,400
development even though I didn't do it

84
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,469
as a career change the reason I got in

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,569
intuitive career at all was for those

86
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:49,500
exact same reasons right it was

87
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:52,829
specifically because I felt that draw

88
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,750
right and I wanted to satisfy that

89
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,600
intellectual curiosity that was

90
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,599
naturally there for this activity right

91
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:07,409
so I would say you know thinking about

92
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:10,409
whether you really have that desire to

93
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:12,299
do it is probably a really good first

94
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:13,739
step because it may be that it's

95
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,668
something that you really don't have

96
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:21,180
that much inherent motivation to do and

97
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:24,329
if that's the case you know programming

98
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,430
does take a lot of work to learn you

99
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:29,550
even not particularly advanced

100
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,819
programming it's a foreign concept in a

101
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,370
lot of ways right it's it's not

102
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:38,848
extremely straightforward by any stretch

103
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,680
of the imagination right and so I think

104
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:42,839
that you don't want you know if you're

105
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,968
just looking for a career change I don't

106
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,339
necessarily think that you want to pick

107
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:49,379
software engineering unless you have

108
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,579
that inherent sort of pull towards it

109
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,908
because I think you're just going to be

110
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:56,668
unhappy with the decision in the end

111
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:58,110
probably you know now again that's just

112
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:59,818
total speculation though so you

113
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,439
shouldn't take my word for it that's

114
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,150
just you know again these are just kind

115
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:08,459
of the things that I took away from it

116
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:09,568
and on the flip side of that or I

117
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:12,120
shouldn't say flip side i just made a

118
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:14,490
corollary to that is I can also tell you

119
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,528
that the the great programmers that I've

120
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,310
known so people who are exceptional at

121
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:22,050
it they all have that right so if you

122
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,819
are interested in getting into soft

123
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,310
relevant because you would like to excel

124
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,740
at it I can certainly tell you that I've

125
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,959
never met a great programmer who didn't

126
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,840
have that right who didn't have that

127
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,120
inherent sort of pull towards this as an

128
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:39,899
activity and so I think that's a really

129
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,019
important thing to think about and just

130
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:45,299
to consider if we can make any takeaways

131
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,459
at all like everyone's circumstances are

132
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,588
obviously different and so I don't know

133
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,359
that there's any way to say anything

134
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:53,610
definitively but in and so much as we

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,810
can I think that that squares with my

136
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,069
experience and I heard it in a lot of

137
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,689
the stories and so I think that that's

138
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,509
something that we can probably draw from

139
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:02,310
and say think about that do some

140
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:08,460
thinking on that and see where you land

141
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:10,889
on that right now another sort of thing

142
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,778
that I feel like was sort of confirmed

143
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:14,668
for me by these but it may just be

144
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:18,449
confirmation bias on my part I don't

145
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:22,348
know but one of the questions that I get

146
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:25,020
a lot that you know i would say comes up

147
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:27,000
more frequently than then pretty much i

148
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:30,120
don't know maybe any other question

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,870
really from newer people who are

150
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,800
approaching this or considering this is

151
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,189
how much math do i need to know right

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,740
and

153
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:42,480
and I I kind of think that one of the

154
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,310
things that you didn't hear much in the

155
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,720
stories was oh I learned a lot of math

156
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,120
or I spent a lot of time learning math

157
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,510
or my math background really helped me

158
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,519
you know there were some people who had

159
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,959
sort of math in their stories there was

160
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,949
a little bit of math was touch upon once

161
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,979
or twice but you'll notice

162
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,620
overwhelmingly math was not involved

163
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,569
here right math was not a central topic

164
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,250
the people who were doing these

165
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:10,769
switching while they may have come from

166
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,899
sort of technical things often IT sorts

167
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:15,060
of stuff for that sort of thing or web

168
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,889
development the number of people who

169
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,959
came from seriously hard math stuff

170
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,639
wasn't actually that high it was maybe

171
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,009
you know it was it was less than half

172
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,779
even you know there was a someone who

173
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:29,039
had a math background there was someone

174
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:31,409
who had a like an architecture

175
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,540
background those four things surely

176
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,790
there was math involved in in these

177
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,830
sorts of things right but there were

178
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,689
also people talk about like oh I was

179
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:44,579
doing you know restaurant management or

180
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:46,800
I came from an art career right like

181
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:51,180
maxi on your segment from from Pixar

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:55,050
right so you know the fact that math is

183
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,550
important in in programming in a number

184
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,530
of ways I want to say that I think

185
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,750
there's a very clear distinction there

186
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:06,000
between math being important and saying

187
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,250
that math itself is some kind of a

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,029
predetermined or prerequisite for

189
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:14,790
getting into programming for me math

190
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:18,449
came after programming and I think for a

191
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,400
lot of people that can be true I have

192
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:22,500
never really felt like I faced a serious

193
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,418
impediment to being able to program well

194
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,480
because I learned math through

195
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:36,360
programming not the other way around and

196
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:38,250
I think that that there is actually I

197
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,440
don't want to say the word harms that

198
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,288
sounds though too harsh but I think

199
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,520
there is potential for deleterious

200
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:49,769
effects from the stereotype that people

201
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,340
who are good at math or naturally

202
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:52,960
gravitate towards math

203
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,550
are the people who will be good at

204
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,440
programming and naturally gravitate

205
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:59,049
towards programming I don't think that's

206
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,900
true I don't think that's true at all i

207
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:05,559
think they are largely unrelated in a

208
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:07,179
lot of ways right i know lots of great

209
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,429
programmers who were great

210
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,689
mathematicians I know lots of great

211
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:14,620
programmers who are horrible

212
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,440
mathematicians right and so I really

213
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,830
just don't think that those two things

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,260
are implicated or correlated in the way

215
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,139
that a lot of people think they are and

216
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:30,370
to give sort of a more concrete example

217
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:34,149
of this of how pervasive I think this

218
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:37,240
thinking is especially outside of maybe

219
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:40,360
programmers themselves I remember like a

220
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,159
year or two ago I can't remember quite

221
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,539
how long maybe a year and a half ago I

222
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:49,079
remember listening to a story on NPR

223
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:51,250
where they were talking about like

224
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,500
they're basically trying to unpack you

225
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,039
know why there weren't as many women

226
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,080
going to CS programs or graduating from

227
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,169
CS programs as they thought there should

228
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,790
be or that were traditionally the case

229
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:07,839
in the earlier days you know why was

230
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:12,069
there a kind of a fall-off in that and

231
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,050
so on and this has very little to do

232
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,570
with the story but it was the the sort

233
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:18,669
of inherent assumption in the story that

234
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,550
I thought was interesting when they

235
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:24,509
decided to talk to women who had fallen

236
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:26,979
out of these paths for various reasons

237
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:29,980
they were always very sure to emphasize

238
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,470
how good those people were at math

239
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,779
originally like that was some kind of

240
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,009
evidence about they should have been

241
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:39,189
good at programming or this was a

242
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:41,519
natural sort discipline and so I feel

243
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,080
like there's this cognitive sort of like

244
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
capture here maybe in the outside world

245
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,560
that programming in math if you were

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,450
naturally interested in math or

247
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,589
naturally good at math you you're going

248
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,660
to naturally be good or naturally

249
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,740
gravitated towards programming the

250
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:56,379
reason that I think that might be

251
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,659
deleterious is because when you want to

252
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,360
so for even taking that same story when

253
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:03,490
do you want to analyze something or when

254
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,050
you want to go figure out how do we fix

255
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,778
a problem like how do we convey

256
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:09,899
more people to get into programming or

257
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:13,509
to do a certain type of programming if

258
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,220
your mental model is I want to go start

259
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,379
looking at let's say the kids who are

260
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,959
good at math and they're going to be

261
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:22,480
good at programming right I think that

262
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,819
may be fundamentally misguided right I

263
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,879
was always much better at language arts

264
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:31,060
and like creative things than i was at

265
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,620
math much much better you know my grades

266
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,838
in English class would have been far

267
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,028
superior to my grades in math class

268
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,269
across the board right that's just the

269
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:43,419
way it was and so I think one of the

270
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:46,659
things that we run the risk of doing by

271
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:49,360
making this connection is you may end up

272
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:53,409
looking in the wrong places but or in

273
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,620
too narrow of places for candidates for

274
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:58,028
these things right and so to tie it back

275
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,769
to that story if one of the things that

276
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:01,240
you want to do was to get more women

277
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:03,490
interested in programming let's say at a

278
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,610
younger age and you decided to focus all

279
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,490
of your efforts on younger girls who

280
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:13,800
were good at math right you may be

281
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:18,039
cutting out a huge segment of the of the

282
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:20,078
eligible population there because that

283
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,958
may not be the right people right

284
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,359
programming is not the same as math and

285
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,028
the mindset that's necessary to be a

286
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,350
good programmer is not the same as the

287
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:33,820
mindset that's necessary to be good

288
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:38,800
mathematician right and so the fact that

289
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:42,610
you need math for programming is not a

290
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:45,429
the same as saying that good being good

291
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,600
at math or drawn to math will make you

292
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:48,698
good at programming or drawn to

293
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,190
programming and again to tie that back

294
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:55,028
to my personal experience I strongly

295
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:58,899
dislike math up until I left high school

296
00:12:55,028 --> 00:13:00,578
actually strongly dislike math very much

297
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:05,740
did not ever want to do it for any

298
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:10,028
reason I was so much not on the math

299
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:12,639
side of things that I had an incredibly

300
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:14,470
hard time for example and I think I've

301
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,049
said this way back at the beginning of

302
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,019
handmade hero I had an incredibly hard

303
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,899
time

304
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:23,688
learning equations in math and the

305
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:26,869
reason is because in computers right an

306
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:29,838
equal sign in most languages means

307
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:32,389
assignment it's a temporal operator it's

308
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,249
the things before that happens are

309
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:38,720
different than the things that happen

310
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:41,540
after if I have a statement that says a

311
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,100
equals B then that does not mean that a

312
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:45,078
and B were equal for all time in

313
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,909
programming it means that before the

314
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,188
statement a was not equal to be

315
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:52,188
potentially and after the statement a is

316
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:54,528
now equal to be right I learned that

317
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:57,558
when I was seven years old I wouldn't

318
00:13:54,528 --> 00:14:00,318
have calculus for another 5 i'm sorry i

319
00:13:57,558 --> 00:14:02,178
wouldn't have algebra is what sorry I

320
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:04,998
didn't mean to caucus I meant algebra I

321
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:06,409
wouldn't have algebra until 7th grade is

322
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:11,379
when they started taking pre algebra

323
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:14,480
right so it was going to be another

324
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,100
seven years eight years I don't even

325
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,039
remember what the how the grades go

326
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,369
exactly in terms of when age wise you

327
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,019
took them but I new programming for so

328
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:26,028
much longer before that that when they

329
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,860
tried to teach me that as like I have I

330
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:30,438
don't understand what this is this makes

331
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,509
no sense to me how can you say this

332
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:34,278
equals line here it's like these two

333
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,600
things like it would have already made

334
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:39,740
this assignment up here right it was

335
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,839
very confusing in my head and so you

336
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,839
know there is a certain amount of

337
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,670
logical thinking that has to happen in

338
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,379
order to understand programming it has

339
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:50,539
to be a very because computers are so

340
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,980
precise you do have to understand the

341
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:55,818
concept that these things are not

342
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,470
flexible they are rigid right but

343
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:59,719
there's not that much of a difference

344
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,428
between that sort of thing and in fact I

345
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,918
would argue perhaps less of a difference

346
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:04,999
between that sort of a thing and the

347
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:07,938
sort of thing you would have to

348
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:09,889
understand to be a good storyteller for

349
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:12,019
example someone who understands that

350
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:14,028
things have a sequence of events and the

351
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,328
audience understands things based on

352
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:19,548
what you've told them so far right and

353
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:21,438
being able to keep very large worlds in

354
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:24,828
your head at once like you know I

355
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:28,308
imagine George Martin would probably be

356
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:30,168
a pretty good programmer right because

357
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:30,959
if you can conceptualize that many

358
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:33,360
characters

359
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,490
that many things going on at once in

360
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,740
many ways that to me feels more like

361
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,000
programming than a lot of math things do

362
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:44,159
right and so I I don't know that again

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,100
maybe just confirmation bias on my part

364
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,839
i don't know because i think you know

365
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,460
thought it was true before an hearing

366
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,320
these stories and not having people

367
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,810
mention that a lot not having said oh i

368
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,570
was always good at math and so right or

369
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:59,779
I really liked math and so we didn't

370
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,450
hear that very much in the stories or

371
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:04,889
you know in there in the stories I feel

372
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,080
like that kind of squares with my

373
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:13,319
opinion on it which is that I think the

374
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:16,530
sort of perspective of whether math is a

375
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:20,490
prerequisite or pre indicator for being

376
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:23,759
a good programmer outside of that sphere

377
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,149
of people who've actually know in and

378
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:31,319
out as professionals at in the public at

379
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:35,429
large that linkage of the two I really

380
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,220
do think maybe doing a lot of sort of or

381
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:40,769
maybe putting up a lot of unnecessary

382
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,690
impediments to people who would be going

383
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:47,460
into this career and could potentially

384
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:50,610
excel at it because they're just hearing

385
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:54,000
that math and programming thing be

386
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,680
really tight and so you know take the

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,080
perspective of somebody who's really

388
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,689
good like I said like maybe like I was

389
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,540
really good at writing maybe stories in

390
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,580
English class or something like this has

391
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,889
that intellectual curiosity of maybe I

392
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,649
would like to learn how my computer

393
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:13,680
works but is constantly hearing this

394
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,570
sort of oh well it's mathy it's all math

395
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,650
the math is the important part if you're

396
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,889
not good at math you're not going to

397
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:24,000
that's the wrong message to send right

398
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:26,880
and and also similar like I said if

399
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,920
you're looking to do sort of programs

400
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,550
that are trying to target people who

401
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,160
aren't getting into computing right now

402
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:38,309
restricting yourself hort or sort of

403
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,570
tailoring what you're doing towards the

404
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:44,190
math the people who have proclivities

405
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,849
towards math or who are currently

406
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,700
excelling

407
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:49,859
math related things as the sign that

408
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,590
they'll you know transition computing or

409
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:54,869
want to be I just I don't find that to

410
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:58,409
be a good idea I think that's probably

411
00:17:54,869 --> 00:18:01,409
wrong so that's just you know again

412
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,779
something that I maybe am putting too

413
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,600
much emphasis on because I want to

414
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:08,190
confirm my hypothesis about that but

415
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,928
that was something that I just really

416
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,580
didn't notice you know in the stories is

417
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:13,110
that there wasn't that underlying thread

418
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:14,339
and I think that's that was true for me

419
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:16,168
and it sounds like it's true for these

420
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:21,000
other folks and I think it's true for a

421
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:27,090
lot of people that said I love math now

422
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,210
right most of the things that I do in

423
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:33,000
programming now I various some math

424
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,860
background to it right and I've had to

425
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,269
use a lot of advanced mathematics stuff

426
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:39,808
that I never would have dreamed by what

427
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:46,288
have you learned in my day to day

428
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:48,829
programming so even more strenuously

429
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:51,769
adding to this what I might suggest is

430
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:55,889
that in a lot of ways I think

431
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:58,558
programming and computers are a very

432
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:01,110
important tool for people who do not

433
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:05,399
like doing math the way math is normally

434
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:09,798
done in a school setting textbook style

435
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:13,590
math computers can really turn somebody

436
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:17,158
who never was good at math didn't like

437
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:20,069
to do math strongly disliked taking math

438
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:22,289
classes was not a strong performer in

439
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:24,418
math in school and turned them into

440
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:26,879
someone who loves math who does

441
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:29,009
day-to-day work using math who looks for

442
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,650
answers to things with math who explores

443
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:35,339
possibilities in math that was certainly

444
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:39,659
what happened to me and so I also see

445
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:43,109
that as yet another reason not to try

446
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:46,620
and link those two things the priests

447
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:49,379
offer you know pre-programming love of

448
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,989
math to a post programming love of math

449
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,240
I really just don't think they're

450
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,150
related at all you might have somebody

451
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,620
right now who is doing very poorly at

452
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,700
math

453
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:03,589
school and if you taught them to program

454
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:08,360
they would suddenly open up this whole

455
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:13,039
world of of math to them that they might

456
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:15,139
really enjoy now again I am saying all

457
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,308
these things data free I have no way to

458
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,080
back them up I don't know that we ever

459
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:20,329
really could or at least not with our

460
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:24,949
current you know level of understanding

461
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:27,409
the human brain but to give a possible

462
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,940
explanation for why that's true and just

463
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,250
to give again some more evidence

464
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:36,830
potentially or some more food for

465
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:40,549
thought there if you take what it means

466
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:43,220
to be someone who's creative right what

467
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:45,639
is creativity to a large extent well

468
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,500
it's sort of harnessed randomness right

469
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,809
you know the the ability to make

470
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,869
something new involves being able to

471
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:55,849
come up with new randomized ideas that

472
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:58,308
you know haven't existed before right

473
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:00,500
coming up with a new story or a new

474
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:02,660
piece of music or whatever is about

475
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,069
taking random ideas and random thoughts

476
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,290
and these sorts of things right and

477
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:08,539
constraining them down into something

478
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:11,119
that fits certain grammar or certain

479
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:14,629
form that can be shared and and

480
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,609
expressed and so on right and so if you

481
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,809
look at the kinds of people who are

482
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,919
going to be good at some of these

483
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:23,389
disciplines there's a lot of of

484
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,769
randomness in their thinking and I don't

485
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,690
mean that to say that they can't be

486
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,220
logical because I consider myself in

487
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,920
this camp I consider myself someone

488
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,410
who's in that high randomness camp

489
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:37,009
having lots of random ideas right means

490
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:39,740
that your brain enjoys seeing different

491
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:42,589
possibilities and things and permuting

492
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,308
and and sort of shaking up the the

493
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:48,169
marble jar right or you know pulling out

494
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:50,000
the the lottery number and seeing what

495
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,039
this new number is right or playing the

496
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,069
slot machine right in it likes this

497
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,990
random you know ideas sort of changing

498
00:21:55,069 --> 00:22:01,819
and mutating and playing with the

499
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:04,130
possibilities math education as as it's

500
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:07,369
taught at least in this country but most

501
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,130
places is very much about never having

502
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,699
those random ideas right you are meant

503
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,530
to be

504
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,450
a computer yourself you are meant to do

505
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:18,500
the algebra yourself line after line

506
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:23,900
right and heaven forfend you make a

507
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:27,890
mistake using computers to do the math

508
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:30,620
for you using computers to verify your

509
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:35,120
results using computers to draw your

510
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:37,879
results for you all of these things take

511
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,339
math take the part of math that's about

512
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,660
not having the creativity and not having

513
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:44,119
the randomness and all those sorts of

514
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,540
constrained very like you know rigid

515
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:49,549
parts and they offload that job to the

516
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:54,289
computer because hey guess what it's

517
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:56,269
very good at not being creative it's

518
00:22:54,289 --> 00:23:00,259
built to not be creative right we have

519
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:01,730
to add creativity to it by you know in

520
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:03,680
fact it can even generate a random

521
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,779
number a lot of the time right you know

522
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,640
it's only recently that computers had

523
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:10,819
built in ways of generating random

524
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,930
entropy right but anyway neither here

525
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:17,809
nor there and in so doing by offing

526
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,029
that's puters you open up the ability

527
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:24,470
for people's whose brains are more

528
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:27,049
scatter shot like that to harness the

529
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,600
power of math and to enjoy map and to

530
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:31,549
use it and to have a fun experience

531
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,019
because with programming you only have

532
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,639
to come up with the idea once you

533
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:37,670
clarify it in the computer will do it

534
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,580
right contrast that to map the way it's

535
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,289
normally done where it's like we learn

536
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:44,449
this postulate or this theorem and then

537
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:48,079
I got a crank through 30 examples where

538
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:50,690
I'm doing it myself right that is so

539
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,490
uncreated and so against the grain for

540
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,370
creative person it's really hard for

541
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:59,230
them to keep their mind on that the

542
00:23:55,369 --> 00:24:03,259
whole time in order to do that job right

543
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:05,150
whereas the idea behind it whatever the

544
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:06,529
posture that was they could just go oh

545
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,810
okay that's interesting that's a new

546
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:10,910
piece in my brain that I can be creative

547
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,950
with and used for a purpose right and

548
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,110
now you've taken that sort of Drudge

549
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:19,250
work out of it it becomes accessible to

550
00:24:15,109 --> 00:24:22,609
them because there's nothing inherently

551
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,109
uncreated about the act of using math or

552
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,899
developing new math

553
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:31,639
those things are not uncreated right and

554
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,440
so I think that that is kind of a kind

555
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,400
of a really important thing to

556
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,370
understand that programming is a way of

557
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,290
opening up mathematics to people who

558
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:44,899
wouldn't necessarily be able to excel at

559
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:46,250
it now they can potentially right now

560
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,130
they can make really interesting

561
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,859
contributions potentially to math

562
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,890
related things even though they may

563
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:57,139
never have been able to be good enough

564
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,750
at by hand math to ever have done them

565
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,759
right or to ever even have known they

566
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:06,829
wanted to to never even be motivated

567
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:08,869
enough to get to that point and so just

568
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:10,189
to put a final cap on that because again

569
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:14,719
i think it's like a really important

570
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:18,679
point if you go back and look at what

571
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,029
happened to in my life i almost

572
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,120
certainly would not have been a

573
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:25,490
programmer today if what had happened in

574
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,189
my life was that I didn't have a father

575
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:32,269
who was a programmer so I wasn't exposed

576
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,558
to it early I went to school you know

577
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:35,660
didn't have a computer in the home let's

578
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:39,079
say because at that time it wasn't

579
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,370
common wasn't that common or if it was

580
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,808
you might not know it was programmable

581
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,399
like you might have had a Commodore 64

582
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:45,109
which would have a great machine to

583
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,940
learn programming on you may not have

584
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,469
known that programming was even

585
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,539
something could do with it there was no

586
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:57,798
internet you may never have just

587
00:25:50,539 --> 00:26:00,139
encountered that idea right so go back

588
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:01,460
in time that's not what my dad did for a

589
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,929
living he did something else so i don't

590
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,819
know i don't know about programming I go

591
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:07,870
to school I take math classes they're

592
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:12,409
awful right I hate it I don't like that

593
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:14,359
someone then says oh hey you know here's

594
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,220
the thing it's computer programming you

595
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:20,389
know if you like math you'll really

596
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:23,990
enjoy it I'm never gonna do that right

597
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:26,509
you know I'm never going to go do some

598
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,339
activity that people are telling me if I

599
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:30,319
liked math I'd like it or something

600
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:33,079
right because I don't like math right

601
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,819
now secretly I do I just don't know it

602
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,189
yet right I haven't had the experience

603
00:26:34,819 --> 00:26:39,859
of a Drudge free

604
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:43,279
math so I don't know that I like it

605
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:46,369
right but just from my experience that's

606
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,559
what happens and so again I really just

607
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:52,369
wanna because I've never really talked

608
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,289
about that whole thing as a as a topic I

609
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:55,879
really want to emphasize that as

610
00:26:54,289 --> 00:27:01,309
something that I think we need to

611
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:04,820
reconsider just broadly about the

612
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:06,139
messaging around programming because I

613
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:10,579
think if the messaging around

614
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:13,160
programming is always that it has a the

615
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:16,189
same sort of like people who want to do

616
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,650
math want to do it I think if that's

617
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,259
always the messaging I think we are

618
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:24,230
cutting out a large segment of the

619
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:28,670
people who might be very good at it not

620
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:31,400
to mention enjoy it which include myself

621
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:34,340
in right I include myself in that group

622
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:39,040
I conclude myself in the group of people

623
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:42,579
who would be cut out of that and and

624
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:48,849
like I don't see programming as a thing

625
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:52,789
that we're math is the primary indicator

626
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:57,039
a great historian might be a great

627
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:57,039
programmer right I see just as much

628
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,870
similarity to programming and history as

629
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:04,759
I do to programming and math right

630
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:06,349
reading through all kinds of texts

631
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,000
learning lots of different languages you

632
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:10,639
could read the source material putting

633
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,690
together what happened in time those

634
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,640
sound like the the the modus operandi of

635
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,039
a great debugger right a person who's

636
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,350
going to be great at debugging problems

637
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:23,659
math factors into it not at all right I

638
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:26,569
can't think of anything math related

639
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:30,140
that would make you be a good at

640
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:33,079
debugging right like I said language

641
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,460
arts being able to conceive of stories

642
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,619
peeing able to keep the pieces in your

643
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,759
head things which don't exist very large

644
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:43,869
sets of things big ideas big things

645
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:46,549
right interconnect interconnections

646
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:48,649
these sorts of things are very important

647
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:51,019
for systems architecture right very

648
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:53,660
little math or none at all involved in

649
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:55,519
systems architecture work right and so I

650
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,710
feel like all of these disciplines

651
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,150
there's a lot in common in various

652
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,100
programming activities and various

653
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:04,340
Princeton's there's a lot in common with

654
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:06,649
other disciplines and I think looking at

655
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:09,799
it from the lens of math is very bad

656
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,240
it's not to say that we don't also very

657
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,799
much want the people who are very good

658
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,720
at math because there's a ton of

659
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,089
programming problems that are sort of

660
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,380
these very focused math like things that

661
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,569
we need to work through in a math like

662
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,390
fashion where the more math thinking you

663
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:24,319
can do the better and that's where you

664
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,780
want the people who have been

665
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,509
traditionally told you know this will be

666
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:31,700
good for you but that's a very narrow

667
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:34,700
slice and there's this much wider slice

668
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:42,080
that I don't think we're looking at okay

669
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:44,150
so that's nothing so finally third thing

670
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,980
that I want to say about the entries

671
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,300
that I received and I'll kind of close

672
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,210
on this because I talked a lot about

673
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:54,559
sort of all that base in there the third

674
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:57,490
thing that I want to say about them was

675
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,309
that I feel like it's cemented for me

676
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:05,000
the fact that whatever you were doing

677
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:10,339
for your previous career you can still

678
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,539
get into programming right I saw just

679
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:14,839
lots of different stories from people

680
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:17,000
from very disparate circumstances in

681
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:20,359
terms of what their previous occupation

682
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,119
was and I didn't really hear any sort of

683
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:26,119
a common thread there may be there were

684
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:29,089
slightly more stories from people coming

685
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,439
from like IT ish things and that makes

686
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,329
sense because hey if you're around

687
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,519
computers all the time maybe you're more

688
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:36,619
likely to think of that and switch into

689
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,400
it but we are plenty of stories from

690
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:44,089
people from everything else right you

691
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:47,090
know artist architect restaurant

692
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:49,279
business you know military like there

693
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:52,759
there really wasn't this sort of

694
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,440
constrained narrow pool of previous

695
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:56,839
occupations that people were coming from

696
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,940
it felt like that was very very broad

697
00:30:56,839 --> 00:31:01,669
and so the fact that it was very broad

698
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:04,400
to me suggests that yeah I don't think

699
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,960
you need to

700
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,500
worried what your previous occupation

701
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,569
was if you find yourself drawn towards

702
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,269
programming for whatever reason I think

703
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:17,069
you should consider it you should start

704
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:20,750
thinking about it because there doesn't

705
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:23,429
seem to be a hard and fast limitation

706
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,589
based on what you have studied in the

707
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,960
past what your career choice was in the

708
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:30,299
past it doesn't seem like that's really

709
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,340
an impediment based on what your careers

710
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,589
you may have harder obstacles to break

711
00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:36,329
through because you know if you come

712
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:38,309
from a very well-paying career

713
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:40,829
background it may be more easier for you

714
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:42,960
to take time off and study if you work

715
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:45,029
if you have to work less hours for your

716
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,769
pay you can spend more time at home

717
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:49,200
learning to program so it can definitely

718
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:52,379
be easier or harder based on your career

719
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,870
just in terms of having the resources to

720
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,990
pursue a career change at all right so

721
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:59,250
that does seem true but I didn't hear in

722
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,859
the stories and I think it's very

723
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:06,930
important to note I really didn't hear

724
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:09,539
any sorts of reasons why previous career

725
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,830
choices would make it impossible for you

726
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:15,299
to switch to programming or that you

727
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:18,269
that it's too late to learn right it

728
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:21,059
seemed like at least up until about 30

729
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,879
years old anyway I didn't hear anything

730
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:25,919
about that the fact that we didn't have

731
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,110
a lot of people right in who were over

732
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,330
30 I don't know if that means at some

733
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:32,819
point it does become harder to learn I

734
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:34,109
don't know I suspect it probably not

735
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,599
it's probably just that most people

736
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:38,639
don't really consider career changes

737
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,769
very much at that point you know by the

738
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,810
time you're 35 40 maybe you're just not

739
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:44,789
considering career change much so the

740
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:46,529
reason we don't get a lot of stories you

741
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:48,329
know it just is just sampling error at

742
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:50,819
that point it may be that it still could

743
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:53,819
work just fine for you if you are 40 and

744
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,750
you know like like I am and want to

745
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:57,750
change their career in software

746
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,890
development maybe it would be fine so I

747
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,720
don't know that we can draw too much

748
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,400
from stories we haven't heard but what I

749
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,920
think we can draw from stories that we

750
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,350
have heard is that the choice of career

751
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,920
in the specific discipline does not seem

752
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:13,619
to be a major impediment in any

753
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,289
particular way journalist was another

754
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:20,229
one right so there's so many different

755
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:21,909
careers that people came from I find

756
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,579
that to be very encouraging because it

757
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:28,660
suggests to me that you can make that

758
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:29,769
switch and so if software engineering or

759
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,250
software development is something that

760
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:36,549
you think holds some attraction for you

761
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,740
I think the the overall takeaway is that

762
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:40,480
if you are willing to work at it it

763
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,460
doesn't seem like your current career

764
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,230
choice is an obstacle and I think that's

765
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,450
very positive and I'm pretty happy that

766
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,599
that was what we overwhelmingly I think

767
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:52,120
heard from the people who wrote in so on

768
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,279
that note I will conclude this video

769
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:55,719
serious and I hope that everyone has

770
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:57,639
enjoyed it I know it's a departure from

771
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,940
what we normally do on handmade hero but

772
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,920
I just wanted to take a chance on

773
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,289
answering question that people had

774
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,610
written in and asked many times that I

775
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,019
never had a good answer for so I'm

776
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:11,259
hoping that this video series is now

777
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:13,719
something that they can go to and at

778
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,730
least have an answer I don't know how

779
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:18,039
good our answer was but we tried and so

780
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:20,349
hopefully now that's something that they

781
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:22,840
can use in their decision making process

782
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:24,880
or to help them through that transition

783
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,669
if they do decide that it's something

784
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,169
they want to do so that's about it again

785
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,609
there will be a blog post that

786
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,859
accompanies these free videos and I hope

787
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,929
to try to put a bunch of links in there

788
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,519
that you can use so if you watch this

789
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:39,460
series from start to finish if you

790
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:40,269
watched all three parts and the reason

791
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,000
you watch them is because you're

792
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:44,519
considering such a career change please

793
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,230
do look for the blog entry that

794
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,940
accompanied these videos because that

795
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,380
blog entry will have links for example

796
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,380
to discussion forums you can use to talk

797
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,750
to other people about this to the

798
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,150
resources that we mentioned in in the

799
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,920
course of the stories that may have been

800
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,789
hard to hear the links or I may not have

801
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,590
been able to read the links Couture too

802
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:03,489
complicated those will be accompanying

803
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,530
it so if you want to get that

804
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:08,259
information definitely check out that
