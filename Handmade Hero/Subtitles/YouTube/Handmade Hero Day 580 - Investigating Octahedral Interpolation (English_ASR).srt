00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:07,528
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,620
Hero show recode a complete game live on

3
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:15,990
stream we are I think at the point where

4
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:17,730
we're gonna try and you know crank

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,589
turned the crank on the lighting we've

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,420
gotten to the point where it's the

7
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,278
octahedral light maps are actually

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,840
working quite nicely there's one thing

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:28,320
in there that looks a little suspicious

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:31,920
to me just in terms the results that I'm

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,820
not sure I mean I I don't actually know

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,160
whether it's a problem or not and more

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,259
specifically I don't actually know

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,359
whether it's a problem with the

15
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,710
octahedral lighting or just something

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,359
like a problem with our light

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,840
calculation in general but there is a

18
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:56,219
certain quality to the light map result

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,250
that looks a bit cube-like and I think

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,370
that probably weren't some further study

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,260
but other than that I feel like the

22
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:07,200
octahedral lighting is actually working

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,950
quite nicely it was surprisingly good

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,840
once we remembered to actually turn on

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,600
trilinear filtering

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,140
I'm sorry bilinear filtering for the

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,309
samples somehow I just when we were

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,070
looking at it forgot to turn that back

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,299
on once we got everything working and

30
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:27,408
once we turn that on it was like oh wow

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,600
this looks actually really good so I

32
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:34,229
think what that means at least for today

33
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:38,519
I think what I'd like to do is start to

34
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:40,650
tighten up the actual sort of data flow

35
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,950
pattern that we've got in there right

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,290
now

37
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,118
and I have a pretty good idea of how I

38
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,130
think I want to do that and I'll kind of

39
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:50,609
walk through that first but basically

40
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,228
what I want to do is we you know I've

41
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,450
done tons of experimentation with the

42
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,118
lighting system so it's kind of just a

43
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,460
mess at this point and now that I'm

44
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:01,379
seeing the octahedral of Maps I'm fairly

45
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,199
high confidence that that's what I want

46
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,539
I like the way it's looking what I want

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,409
to do now is just kind of take a you

48
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,989
know a comb and sort of smooth out the

49
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,879
lighting system so that it's you know

50
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,240
fairly min

51
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:20,299
and just doing things the way it will do

52
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,100
them for the octahedral Maps and so the

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,350
very first thing I want to do there is

54
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,599
just make sure that I'm writing directly

55
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:29,180
into the octahedral map at all times so

56
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,609
right now what we're doing is we're

57
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,370
doing a process where we actually create

58
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,290
like a secondary buffer right and then

59
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,420
we put it into the octahedral map I

60
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,489
think we probably want to do something

61
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:44,079
where we're operating directly in the

62
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:47,450
octahedral map as much as possible and

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,610
you know that's actually a fairly tricky

64
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:51,289
thing to get right we're gonna have to

65
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,480
spend some time getting that right and

66
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,090
the reason for that is while it will be

67
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,429
fairly straightforward I think to get

68
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,319
our system updating the octahedral map

69
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,879
directly for the actual lighting

70
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,049
computation because it's very simple we

71
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,310
just say look here's where you're

72
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,090
looking in the octahedral map to write

73
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,879
this thing or whatever we do have to fix

74
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,420
the code that does the in-place block

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,419
copies so if you remember when you move

76
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:21,349
around the world we need to preserve the

77
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:22,189
light Maps so when the center of the

78
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,159
lighting system

79
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:27,949
you know moves around we need to move

80
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,469
the octahedral map so that it aligns

81
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:32,449
with the move in the world because we

82
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:35,359
have effectively infinite sized worlds

83
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:36,889
for all intents and purposes so we're

84
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,720
never we're only we can only store the

85
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:40,969
light map information just around where

86
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,210
the character is we can't afford to

87
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,219
store the light maps for the whole world

88
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,740
and I mean even and I mean I guess even

89
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:50,150
if we did want to store them we would

90
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,680
still need to do something like this in

91
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,400
order to keep track of where each piece

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,700
was going to be so we want to do is make

93
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,310
it so that we just update that map the

94
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:03,500
light map in place right and we've

95
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,259
already got codes that's doing that for

96
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,939
the voxel version of this but what we

97
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:10,189
want to start doing is just getting rid

98
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:12,229
of that voxel right because the voxel is

99
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:14,659
now unnecessary we've got a flattened

100
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:16,430
Atlas version of this thing that's what

101
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:19,100
we're using for sampling and since we're

102
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,620
using that for sampling that effectively

103
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,710
means that we don't want to store this

104
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,620
other representation that just costs us

105
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:29,539
a big copy all the time for no reason we

106
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,228
rather just keep the thing that we

107
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,620
actually care about and make that be how

108
00:04:33,228 --> 00:04:39,469
we get our data right and how we keep

109
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,860
our data preserved so I want to try and

110
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,310
move to that and I want to do that in a

111
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,620
couple steps and then the other thing

112
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,430
that I want to do is I want to start

113
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,389
putting in the actual like light

114
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,918
convection so the actual thing that

115
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,478
actually does the lighting which we have

116
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:59,810
in there but we haven't actually sort of

117
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:02,899
hooked up yet and so we kind of have a

118
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,310
bunch of things to do there and I think

119
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:07,849
what I'm gonna do is since the lighting

120
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,319
looks reasonable at the moment I think

121
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,419
maybe what I'll do is I'll push on the

122
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,569
second one of those first so let me try

123
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:18,319
to wire up the actual bounce based

124
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:21,259
lighting see if we can get that looking

125
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,439
reasonable and then after that's done

126
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:26,000
we'll try to move from that system which

127
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,149
is working directly on the voxel

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,160
representation to one that's working on

129
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:36,679
the flattened representation and that I

130
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,539
think will then conclude everything we

131
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,129
need to do with lighting you know maybe

132
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:43,009
there's an optimization pass that has to

133
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:46,629
happen there but pretty much that would

134
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,949
be it so I think we're getting close and

135
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:50,629
you know that's that's good news because

136
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,569
lighting is extremely hard and takes a

137
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:55,370
long time so you know it's pretty

138
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:58,550
encouraging to think that we might be

139
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,379
getting somewhere on it something that's

140
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,180
actually you know reasonably good

141
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:05,060
looking

142
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,819
let me first open up the game here and

143
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,280
just do a quick run so we can see what

144
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:14,300
I'm talking about so here you can see

145
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:16,759
the lighting with the actual diffuse

146
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,250
colors turned off so we're just we're

147
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,098
looking at just the white solution here

148
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,939
and of course our lights currently we

149
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:29,300
have only turned on one light that we're

150
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:30,800
looking at as a test it's not doing an

151
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,848
actual lighting computation we're just

152
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,009
testing the voxel the we're testing the

153
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:39,918
octahedral light maps to see what they

154
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:41,480
look like and you can see I'm drawing

155
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,149
the octahedral light maps down in the

156
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,439
corner here you can see that they've got

157
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:47,989
interpolation turned on that's why there

158
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,560
they kind of look you know that kind of

159
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,509
blurry look right we're zoomed in on

160
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,939
just one section of them over in the

161
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:59,990
corner and so this is just a test of

162
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:02,240
just a basic light source right and the

163
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,910
light source is like hovering right

164
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,410
about here in fact I think is that it

165
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:11,840
yeah it's this one right here right and

166
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,760
so you know if we kind of look up here

167
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,799
the bounce that we're getting it goes

168
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,379
like you know it hits here and comes up

169
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,870
towards us so we should always kind of

170
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:22,250
see it like in in this areas where we

171
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,569
should be seeing the light and that is

172
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,800
where we're seeing it we shouldn't be

173
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,050
able to see it out here because when we

174
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,240
hit one of these light probes you know

175
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,800
the bounce that we're seeing is gonna go

176
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,889
off to somewhere where there's no light

177
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,199
right so it looks relatively correct

178
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:39,529
there was and the reason I was saying

179
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,939
there was some weirdness here is there's

180
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:43,429
a couple of things that we're gonna have

181
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:46,069
to be aware of so one is there's a

182
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,319
definite like squareness to the light

183
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:51,980
you can see there's like a shadow that

184
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:55,339
looks like that like a cube shape to the

185
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:59,180
lighting and I don't know exactly where

186
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,679
this is coming from so that's a little

187
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,449
concerning to me and the reason it's

188
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,310
concerning is not because I'm sure it's

189
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:09,349
wrong but because I'm not sure it's

190
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:12,949
right i I really can't emphasize enough

191
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:15,710
how important it is to you know when

192
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:17,360
you're looking at stuff like this or

193
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:19,609
really anything right when you're

194
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,580
programming you always want to assume

195
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,590
that you have a bug and one of the

196
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:26,779
number one ways you can spot people who

197
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,069
don't really know how to program is that

198
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,939
they try to come up with explanations

199
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:34,599
for why something is correct rather than

200
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,549
assuming that there's a bug in something

201
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,530
because if you try to come up with

202
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:42,049
explanations for why it's correct you'll

203
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,759
usually find one right because computers

204
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,559
are very complicated unless there's just

205
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,309
an obvious like the game crashes or

206
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,289
something right

207
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:50,149
you can usually come up with some

208
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:51,980
ridiculous explanation as to why this is

209
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,079
okay so you know looking at this thing

210
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,070
I'll be like well you know well it's

211
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,810
because you know it's on a

212
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,090
axl so obviously they'll they'll be some

213
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:01,549
square artifacts as the thing the lines

214
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,410
with the lock right like I can always

215
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:07,069
come up with an explanation of why

216
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:08,959
there's not a bug in the code but I have

217
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:13,250
no way of knowing if that explanation is

218
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:15,050
actually true I'm not proving that

219
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,429
there's not a bug in the code I'm just

220
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:18,259
coming up with an explanation that

221
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:22,429
allows me to not have to go look for the

222
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:23,929
bug right and so what I find really

223
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:27,889
differentiates good programmers from bad

224
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:29,359
programmers is you may be a good

225
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,429
programmer assumes when they see

226
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,110
something that is just a little bit

227
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:38,319
suspicious right if there's any

228
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:43,940
suspicion at all assume it's a bug

229
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:47,120
and you have decisions here I don't have

230
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:49,640
to go solve this bug right now I can

231
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,659
still move on and do something else

232
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:58,419
I can even ship this with that in it if

233
00:09:53,659 --> 00:10:02,240
I want to but know that it is a bug

234
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:04,099
don't say that the code is correct when

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,919
it's not when you know that you have

236
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,200
evidence that's probably not know that

237
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,449
it there is a bug there because there

238
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,670
may be an important quality improvement

239
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,700
that you can make and when you are

240
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:17,959
making decisions throughout your project

241
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,000
you want to make those decisions

242
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,920
knowing that there might be a bug there

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,940
that you can improve right you can

244
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,120
improve the quality of the software

245
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,610
there deciding not to fix something

246
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,549
because it'll be too time-consuming or

247
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,230
whatever else is materially different

248
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:35,809
than convincing yourself that there

249
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,250
wasn't something to fix right because it

250
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:39,259
affects the decision making that you're

251
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,700
going to make throughout the project so

252
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,919
I'm not even saying that you have to fix

253
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,840
all your bugs because that may just not

254
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,809
be practical for the size of the project

255
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,940
or the amount of programming power that

256
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,500
you have you know how many man-hours you

257
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,150
have to spend on it or however you want

258
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,000
to measure your project size or those

259
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,679
sorts of things it's entirely possible

260
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,879
that this may be a bug that we just

261
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,199
can't ever fix because we don't have

262
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,929
time or any of those sorts of things

263
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,340
right that's fine but don't convince

264
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,469
yourself that something is working

265
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,490
properly because convincing yourself

266
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,709
that something is proper when you

267
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,680
have some evidence it's not is never

268
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:16,109
productive right that's just masking a

269
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,699
potential problem that should be weighed

270
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,870
against other things in terms of when

271
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,850
you're allocating your programmer time

272
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,230
hmm

273
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,209
so I'm sorry for that big long

274
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:26,220
digression but after having talked with

275
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,419
stripe this week and having experienced

276
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,459
what it's like to try and talk to people

277
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,379
who don't understand when they obviously

278
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:34,169
have bugs in their software and what

279
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:35,789
they'd rather do is try to convince

280
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,129
themselves that their software isn't a

281
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:40,049
buggy mess it's annoying

282
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:41,909
right it's it's really annoying to talk

283
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:44,069
to programmers who don't obviously

284
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,980
understand that they have lots of bugs

285
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,910
and there's tons of evidence of it

286
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,709
because if they just want to say we

287
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:51,360
don't care and we don't fix that because

288
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,859
we're an Internet company so we don't

289
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,600
fix bugs okay

290
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,509
like I get it you're trying to make

291
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,330
money not make good software but think

292
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,610
trying to rationalize away obvious

293
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,950
mistakes that are clearly there or that

294
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:06,720
at the very least you don't understand

295
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,270
yet so you can't say that they're

296
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,860
correct or incorrect regardless it's

297
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:12,569
just really frustrating and it makes it

298
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,310
very hard to have a discussion with you

299
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,290
right you can't actually get to the

300
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,208
bottom of a technical issue with someone

301
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:20,219
whose primary goal is to rationalize

302
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:23,039
away that there might be a bug in there

303
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,259
right so I would really encourage you to

304
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,669
not do that and I would always encourage

305
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:28,500
you to assume that you have a bug

306
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:31,828
anytime there's anything suspicious

307
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:35,549
until you have a complete pathology that

308
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:37,889
you can 100% point to and say look I did

309
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:39,629
as much due diligence as I possibly

310
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,389
could here and if there was a bug I

311
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,490
missed it but I didn't ever rationalize

312
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:46,828
it away I tried as hard as I could to

313
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,539
actually trace through this thing and

314
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:54,149
find it out and so short story long when

315
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,980
I look at this I know we have not done

316
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,720
enough work to say that that is an

317
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,028
artifact of the algorithm we just

318
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,149
haven't it's very likely that it's a bug

319
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:05,429
or if it's not a bug it's definitely

320
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,049
true that I don't and you probably don't

321
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:10,439
either because you've only been able to

322
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:13,500
see what I've done so far we don't know

323
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,480
what's causing it and if we don't know

324
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,879
we don't know it's a bug it's that

325
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,970
simple so let's go ahead and take a

326
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,789
a look at what we're doing here and I

327
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,009
don't know if we want to take a look at

328
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:29,838
this bug now but we want to keep this

329
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:32,539
test case in place because it's a really

330
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,639
easy way to look at the bug right it's a

331
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:37,578
very simple way for us to immediately

332
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,250
events this bug and so we don't have to

333
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:43,008
really you know think too hard about how

334
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,068
to reproduce it because we've got one in

335
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:48,050
here now so what I might do just because

336
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm curious and I'd like to know if

337
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:52,490
there's an easy way to sort of reveal

338
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,060
what might be going on here what I would

339
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:59,930
like to do is maybe what we could put in

340
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:01,849
here is some hotkeys for looking at some

341
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:03,379
of the actual quantities in here like

342
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,659
maybe there's some ways we can make it

343
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:08,870
really fast to switch between a few

344
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:10,909
different things in the lighting because

345
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,720
if I could see some of this stuff like

346
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:16,429
if I could actually flip between you

347
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,470
know show me the normals show me the

348
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:20,539
voxels and so on I might be able to

349
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,300
pinpoint like where this stuff is

350
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:25,039
actually changing right so that's one

351
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:27,889
thing I could do is add some more debug

352
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,679
view to it the other thing that I'm

353
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:33,470
thinking is as I look at what's going on

354
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:35,269
here the biggest thing that strikes me

355
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:39,019
about it right like the thing that is

356
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:41,688
the most intriguing is that I notice it

357
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:45,828
moves with the specular highlight right

358
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:49,969
so this line this fall-off line that I'm

359
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:52,879
getting here and you know you can kind

360
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,778
of see like as I move around that line

361
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,789
moves like very smoothly right so

362
00:14:56,778 --> 00:15:01,698
remember we're sampling this on a voxel

363
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:05,328
and if there was some kind of weird

364
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:07,549
interpolation error between voxels you

365
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:11,388
know I wouldn't be able to place that

366
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:13,609
line any anywhere I wanted right so I'm

367
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:15,860
pretty certain that we don't have an

368
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,560
obvious like discontinuity bug there

369
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,079
because it's actually happening anywhere

370
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,958
you want so it's a it's an artifact of

371
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:28,039
what happens during the interpolation of

372
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:30,259
two lightmaps samples let's say that

373
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:33,078
actually can place this anywhere you

374
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,950
want right it's where the fall-off

375
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:37,638
actually

376
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,970
ones there and so I'm more looking at

377
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,589
something that's about why isn't there a

378
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,560
like piece of lighting information

379
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:48,620
happening here you know what is actually

380
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:51,859
causing that sort of gap in the system

381
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,570
if you will and one thing I might be

382
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,810
able to do to make this a little bit

383
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,120
clearer to me is what if I took out the

384
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:02,419
height difference because I'm getting

385
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,519
like those periodic breaks because I the

386
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,919
floor is intentionally sort of jittered

387
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:11,269
around as an artistic thing that I

388
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:16,149
wanted to do if I went into the room

389
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:20,060
generator and oops that's no good

390
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,620
how do I I need to unify my key bindings

391
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:23,778
it's hard for me to do handmade here

392
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,839
every week because it's totally not even

393
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:30,409
remotely the same key bindings is my

394
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:34,160
actual editor work so it's like pretty

395
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:36,100
tough my brain always has to switch so

396
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:40,399
if I go into the room generator here and

397
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:44,990
we just want to take out some of that

398
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,629
jitter so I think the peasy offset here

399
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,879
that we've got I think that's the only

400
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:52,879
thing that's really you know changing

401
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:56,000
stuff if we take that peasy jitter out

402
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,730
of here I think that would stop our

403
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,740
floors from having any you know

404
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,449
difference and with the floors not

405
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,970
having any difference it should be much

406
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:07,578
easier for me to see you know the

407
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,860
lighting and the artifacts and the

408
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:11,328
lighting now of course there's lots of

409
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,519
grass there so actually let me let me

410
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:15,798
not go there because that induces a

411
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,150
pattern because there's a lot bunch of

412
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,039
sprites laid on top of each other so

413
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:25,429
what I'd rather do here is just kind of

414
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:27,470
get out to a flat room so here you can

415
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:31,160
see what's going on with the lighting a

416
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,140
little more cleanly there right and you

417
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,298
can sort of see right you can you can

418
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,640
see more how what kind of artifacts

419
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:39,558
we're gonna have and you can actually

420
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,660
see so there's some of the things that

421
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:45,129
are interesting about it right is you

422
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,169
can see on the edges how we get those

423
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,710
dropouts for like the

424
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:58,909
where the zeros are for the lighting

425
00:17:51,710 --> 00:18:00,940
there you can see how we get that um you

426
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:03,528
know you get that stair-stepping pattern

427
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:07,250
the stair-stepping pattern sort of

428
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:14,058
appears I guess I kind of want to say it

429
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:16,519
appears generally to be probably you

430
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:20,960
know roughly along the voxel everywhere

431
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:23,599
right so I I see some artifacts of the

432
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,069
stair-stepping I don't know that

433
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:29,928
stair-stepping of the the voxel based

434
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:34,099
sampling pretty much everywhere so

435
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:36,649
that's not really surprising right you

436
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:45,500
know that's what I would expect I don't

437
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:52,788
really see I guess I guess I'd to be

438
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:55,069
honest I guess I don't really see a lot

439
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:57,408
of evidence that it's obviously wrong

440
00:18:55,069 --> 00:19:03,259
it's kind of hard to tell like I guess I

441
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:05,960
would say it's a little odd to see two

442
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:07,610
separate bands moving so one of the

443
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,069
things that's confusing me right now as

444
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:11,808
I look at this a little more carefully

445
00:19:09,069 --> 00:19:14,210
is I sort of feel like I'm seeing two

446
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:17,359
lighting fronts at the same time that

447
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,240
doesn't make a lot of sense to me so I

448
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:23,178
see sort of like there's kind of a hard

449
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,690
edge here that seems pretty consistent

450
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:29,000
and then as I move this that's like the

451
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,919
specular I wondered so I guess it could

452
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,690
be like a specular versus diffuse thing

453
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,028
are we I'm trying to think about how

454
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,350
we're actually summing this out I don't

455
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:38,148
think so because we only have one

456
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,678
lighting equation so we are not actually

457
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:43,489
summing two things right

458
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,019
I don't think so not anymore so it's

459
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,109
kind of weird like I don't know how I'm

460
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:50,990
getting two separate lighting frontiers

461
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:53,418
like that right and it's very so it's

462
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,450
very confusing like where that fall-off

463
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:58,669
clipping is happening right it's just

464
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,279
very it's just very strange I I don't

465
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,990
know how that's happening

466
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,369
and of course you have to remember that

467
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,620
the way we're sampling this lighting is

468
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,149
kind of confusing but if you think about

469
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,829
it what's happening is we're actually

470
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,870
sampling it at each one of these pixels

471
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:13,179
so at every pixel we're looking up into

472
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:15,669
the voxel and we're blending between the

473
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,279
eight voxels that are neighbouring and

474
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,710
we're just summing those together right

475
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,200
so I'm not sure how we get like that

476
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:28,259
hard-edged and then as you do this the

477
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,490
edge a secondary edge wave comes through

478
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:33,099
like I just don't understand that

479
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:36,130
fundamentally speaking I don't get it

480
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:38,409
right and so what I'm interested in

481
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,360
doing to poke at this a little bit to

482
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,730
try and gain some intuition is can I do

483
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:45,819
some changes can i induce some

484
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,450
structured art into this that allows me

485
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:51,730
to see what's actually happening and one

486
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,690
of the ways I might start is I want to

487
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:59,230
kind of look at the renderer itself not

488
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,390
that part so let me go to the Z vias

489
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,460
program here what I kind of want to do

490
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,590
is take a look at how I'm actually

491
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,990
computing this lighting and see if

492
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:11,349
there's any particular parts of it that

493
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:14,650
like scream out as I'm looking at them

494
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:17,859
for if I shoved a particular known value

495
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:27,790
in here maybe I would get a little more

496
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:31,000
insight right so for starters one thing

497
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:36,129
I could do is we're doing a ton of this

498
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,349
like here's a sampling all of the voxel

499
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:44,850
locations and then we're interpreting

500
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:48,129
between them right so if I wanted to I

501
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:51,339
could look at just the base voxel for

502
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,770
example right I could say that instead

503
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:57,309
of all this stuff just overwrite the

504
00:21:53,769 --> 00:22:01,150
final one with the you know the base

505
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:03,509
voxel and then if we look at it what we

506
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,509
would see

507
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:13,950
is what the actual lighting computation

508
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:16,888
is for these pixels right and so what

509
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,679
you can see now is we get one thing we

510
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:23,729
would obviously expect which is that the

511
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,970
lighting is now uniform throughout a

512
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,819
particular cube in terms of some kind of

513
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:32,129
intensity value that we've got there but

514
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:34,648
then we also have this sort of overlaid

515
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:35,939
like secondary high light that's the

516
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:37,558
thing as this fifth I specifically

517
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,859
wanted to bug and that gives me a good

518
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:43,678
clue which I kind of already suspected

519
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:45,749
but again I'm trying to actually you

520
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,820
know suss out what's going on here which

521
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:53,629
is that this is because it changes so

522
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:55,798
cleanly and and evenly across the things

523
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:57,569
I'm just assuming that this is the

524
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,269
angular fall-off that I'm seeing here

525
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:02,519
right and what I'm having trouble

526
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:04,769
understanding is why the angular

527
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,778
fall-off is shaped the way that it's

528
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:09,358
shaped right I don't understand why the

529
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:12,808
angular fall-off wouldn't be smoother

530
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:14,970
than that why it has such a weird shape

531
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,440
to it but this gives me a very good

532
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,239
indication that it is the angular

533
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,028
fall-off is what I'm looking at there

534
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:24,149
and so I want to start looking at that

535
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:26,398
angular fall-off to try and figure out

536
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:29,579
why it shaped the way it is and either

537
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:31,319
convince myself through enough poking

538
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,628
that it actually should look that way

539
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:35,220
for some reason which again I'm kind of

540
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:38,009
doubtful of which is why I'm doing this

541
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,798
investigation or find the error like

542
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:44,128
find what I'm doing stupid that's

543
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:46,769
causing that now we don't really do

544
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:49,108
anything with the lighting in here that

545
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:52,429
has an angular component right all of

546
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:57,599
this stuff is just a direct sample so

547
00:23:52,429 --> 00:24:00,269
really all we do is prepare the angle

548
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,519
where the the vector we're going to

549
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:04,108
sample but all the sampling happens in

550
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,239
here so the only thing we can really

551
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:08,788
look at in here is are we doing

552
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:11,940
something reasonable with this so if you

553
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:13,259
take a look at this equation here what

554
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,999
we're doing is computing the reflection

555
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,269
vector and storing that in R so we've

556
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:19,920
got normalized a0 we've got the I minus

557
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,660
2 times inner

558
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,060
I rolled end times world end it's a

559
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,310
standard reflection so this is just

560
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:30,089
reflecting us about the world normal

561
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:32,129
right it's like hitting the plane of the

562
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:34,289
world number normal and bouncing back so

563
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:38,970
that's all that we're doing here and

564
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:42,649
then we use that eye vector as part of

565
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,269
our sampling right because we unwrap it

566
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:48,600
into I'm sorry we called the R vector

567
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:50,549
after we do that we use that our vector

568
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:52,949
to do our sampling by basically saying

569
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:56,069
look unwrap it into the octahedral map

570
00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:00,299
using the you know inverse mapping here

571
00:24:56,069 --> 00:25:04,559
and do the lookup now that could be

572
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:07,500
busted or it might not be and again I

573
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,139
have I think a good way of actually

574
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,539
isolating that problem when I look at

575
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,780
the game here and I'm moving around like

576
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:17,819
this what I could do is freeze the

577
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:20,190
octahedral map so that it's always

578
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:22,439
getting the same sample out because I

579
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:28,259
know the normal will change throughout

580
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:31,170
this thing and I believe we do some work

581
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:37,950
with the normal here don't we I know

582
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:39,390
maybe we don't yeah that all looks right

583
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,390
so we're just gonna do the basic

584
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:45,360
sampling lookup right yeah so all I

585
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,370
should have to do is freeze where I'm

586
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,949
looking in the octahedral map and this

587
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:52,229
should all stop right it should get the

588
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:55,170
same result like I shouldn't see this

589
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:58,110
and if I do see this still then I know

590
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:02,400
something weird is up right so if I went

591
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:05,039
and set the octahedral maps XY to some

592
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,950
kind of a known quantity right like and

593
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,680
I don't know where in the octahedral map

594
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,390
I actually have valid data so it's gonna

595
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,779
be kind of a crapshoot to find something

596
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:19,020
that's not like just black right but

597
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:22,109
once we get that I should be able to see

598
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:24,240
very clearly yes so once I get that I

599
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:28,299
can tell and and should have a very

600
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,000
clear no interpolation as I move the

601
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,509
the mouse around the view around and I

602
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,279
don't

603
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:35,589
so that's reassuring because it means

604
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,349
that at least there's not some weird

605
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:40,329
extra term getting thrown in there that

606
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:44,139
shouldn't be there we are actually just

607
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:49,659
sampling and off we go so now if I turn

608
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:52,210
back on the luring of the of the voxels

609
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,470
so I go to something that now should

610
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:58,990
vary per pixel but will not actually

611
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,759
have any angular component to it we

612
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,460
should again yeah just see a soft

613
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:06,009
version of this thing and that is what

614
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,900
we see right we see that this blends

615
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:12,250
together and it seems relatively

616
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:16,060
coherent so I would say that's pretty

617
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:19,599
reasonable right like that looks like

618
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:22,649
what we would expect so I think all of

619
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:27,669
the weirdness is coming from the actual

620
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:29,650
sampling of the octahedral map and again

621
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,380
I don't have a good understanding of why

622
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,750
that would be now one reason might be if

623
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,760
there's some badness in how we're doing

624
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:40,559
the octahedral lookup another might be

625
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:45,819
if the octahedral map itself has certain

626
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:49,269
issues right that unwrapping of lighting

627
00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:52,000
is a warp of the sphere and it's

628
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:56,769
possible that that warp is a problem

629
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,109
right I don't know so it's not

630
00:27:56,769 --> 00:28:00,819
immediately possible for me to say that

631
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:04,269
this is an artifact of the actual

632
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:06,819
mapping to the sphere because I really

633
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:09,309
have no way of knowing so that's a

634
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:11,230
little bit of an issue as well right but

635
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:14,470
you can see here that when I've locked

636
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:17,529
it down that weird sort of sampling went

637
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:20,610
away now since i when i unlock it right

638
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:23,200
and i go back to where we were before so

639
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:25,179
now we're actually gonna do the

640
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,880
octahedral lookup in the correct

641
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,620
direction so now you know when I'm

642
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:35,140
moving the mouse around I'm back to that

643
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:38,699
sort of same kind of same kind of shape

644
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,000
so here's what I will say about it

645
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,910
if

646
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,490
look at this actual shape it is kind of

647
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:49,960
the shape of the octahedral map warping

648
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:53,680
right and you know what I should look I

649
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,779
should see if I can grab one of our

650
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,380
viewers actually made a really cool

651
00:28:55,779 --> 00:29:12,279
little thing in decimo so you can let me

652
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:17,140
let me look real quick ha one second all

653
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:19,569
right so Jeff Knox actually wrote in one

654
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:24,220
of one of the viewers of the show he

655
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:27,669
wrote in this calculator on Decimus that

656
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:30,370
he made that's really a good idea he

657
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,710
basically just made a decimal that would

658
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:35,649
show the octahedral map which is pretty

659
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:38,380
great and so what it does and a lot of

660
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:43,930
bookmark here for it but you can you can

661
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:47,590
look at that URL it's sa Y ie 6 X bgl on

662
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:49,900
decimals comm slash calculator so if we

663
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:52,089
take a look at this and I'll put it in

664
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,560
here as a little like as a little

665
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:57,519
reminder case we everyone look at it

666
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:01,269
again if we look at what happens to the

667
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:04,329
graph of the octahedral map what Jeff

668
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:07,329
actually wrote is pretty cool so you can

669
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:09,639
see along the sphere where you are

670
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:12,519
around the ring of the sphere so if you

671
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,620
imagine the sphere this is just us

672
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,809
walking around the perimeter of the

673
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:19,359
sphere you know from negative PI to PI

674
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:22,059
right so just walking around the 360

675
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,909
degrees of the sphere right and then

676
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:26,829
here's like the Z slice so this is the

677
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,830
middle of the sphere this would be all

678
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:33,759
the way at the bottom tip and this would

679
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:36,549
be at the top right and so what you can

680
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,400
see is if we just make a full ring

681
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,319
around you can see that like hey it

682
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,970
collapses down to a point right here

683
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,279
which is what you'd expect and is

684
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:47,500
roughly a ring of the circle as we

685
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,509
expand but you can see that bowing that

686
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,660
happens there right do you see that and

687
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:53,619
you'll notice that's a very that shape

688
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,620
you

689
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:59,049
like really really familiar when we see

690
00:30:56,619 --> 00:31:01,750
kind of this sort of thing happening

691
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:04,930
here right you can see that we get that

692
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:07,329
same kind of bowing at here and here

693
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:10,180
right in two different directions that

694
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:14,589
curve sort of almost diamond D shape to

695
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:17,320
it so you know I get again like don't

696
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:19,750
really know what to make of some of

697
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,119
these things but it's a little bit weird

698
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:27,130
like I don't know if maybe there's just

699
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:29,469
a artifact of how low res our map

700
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,840
happens to be that you're just gonna get

701
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:36,299
some of these weird patterns as a result

702
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:39,759
again don't know but can't say for sure

703
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:42,149
so again it's pretty tough to really

704
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,369
understand exactly what's going on there

705
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,679
and it's hard to say like to what extent

706
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:50,529
that the sampling will have that sort of

707
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,019
a boundary problem but again as you

708
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,670
would expect when you're right on the z

709
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:56,200
equals 0 it's just a straight line

710
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:58,120
because that's the definition of how we

711
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,519
unwrapped it right we unfolded along

712
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:03,339
those lines and again the bowing is the

713
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:07,808
muck is very pronounced here and like

714
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:09,579
here right in the map but not here so

715
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:13,170
again I don't really know to what extent

716
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:16,389
that is playing a role in this as well

717
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,308
but what I would say is it's a little

718
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,100
bit difficult for me to understand some

719
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:23,649
of the patterns right so that pattern

720
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:25,329
for example I guess I could believe that

721
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,580
that pattern has something to do with

722
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:30,279
the fact that as I'm looking at it there

723
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:32,710
are like copies going on and maybe like

724
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,539
this pixel is you know not filled in for

725
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,009
whatever reason I don't know again I

726
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:38,799
could come up with reasons but I'm just

727
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:40,539
I'm not confident in I don't I don't

728
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,940
have any real way of knowing what's

729
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:45,670
going on there so what I'd like to start

730
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:50,470
doing is let's take a look and see what

731
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:52,058
happens if we maybe play with the

732
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:55,360
interpolation a little bit and see what

733
00:32:52,058 --> 00:32:58,629
we see and then maybe start stuffing

734
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:01,899
some specific values some like specific

735
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:05,200
color values in specific locations in

736
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:07,399
the octahedral map to see whether it has

737
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,129
to do with where in the map we

738
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:13,699
r-right because if this was something

739
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:16,098
that primarily occurred because of some

740
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,440
way of walking through the map we would

741
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:21,079
expect to see it particularly based on

742
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,808
where in the map you are but if we don't

743
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:31,699
see that then you know obviously that's

744
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:33,378
not true okay so let me go ahead and

745
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,088
turn interpolation off and see if I

746
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:39,648
still see this so I'm going to go into

747
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:44,838
the OpenGL side of things and I'm gonna

748
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:48,709
go to where we have the linear parameter

749
00:33:44,838 --> 00:33:50,509
are getting set here so in here I'm

750
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,288
gonna change this to nearest just so I

751
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:55,338
can see to what extent does this happen

752
00:33:53,288 --> 00:34:01,038
regardless of whether we're sampling

753
00:33:55,338 --> 00:34:04,069
with smoothing on or not right what just

754
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:16,250
happened why did I not see a difference

755
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:18,500
there oh wow so wait a minute oh I'm in

756
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,418
the pond I'm in the wrong place

757
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,250
we should delete this code this this

758
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:25,219
code is not even we don't need any of

759
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:28,818
this do we yeah and I don't think we

760
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:30,678
need any of this stuff yeah these are

761
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,329
extra like frame buffer things we don't

762
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,289
we don't care about this that's gone I

763
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,369
don't want to make that mistake again

764
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:38,629
we should also set a setting like you

765
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,588
can see we've got settings here we

766
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:42,348
should we should put some of this stuff

767
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:45,889
back in so the light sampling here this

768
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:48,740
is the one I actually wanted so you can

769
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:51,649
see me like moving around it with linear

770
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:54,108
sampling there here's without the linear

771
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:57,259
sampling so and what you can see is

772
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:59,929
actually it's just a hard edge now right

773
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:06,140
so you can see that it's absolutely

774
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:08,690
there but it's just a hard edge right so

775
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:10,489
I think this is great because since we

776
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,159
know that's a hard edge that just turns

777
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:15,229
into a soft edge later I think this

778
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:17,019
gives us a great way to start looking at

779
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,500
this right because now I'm SuperDuper

780
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:21,780
clear on where it is and

781
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,389
what's happening so let's try to figure

782
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,700
out like is this somewhere specific in

783
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:28,469
the map like maybe we've just done

784
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:31,019
something stupid at the edges of the map

785
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:33,539
or something so the first thing I want

786
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,940
to do is I'm gonna go in and start to

787
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,070
knock out certain copy operations we

788
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:43,110
were doing to see what to what extent

789
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:47,039
those play a role here right so if I go

790
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:49,680
to the actual lighting code right and I

791
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,779
take a look at that post pass that

792
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,730
copies the edges in what I'm going to

793
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,680
start by doing is just when we do that

794
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,559
edge pass so this is the edge pass here

795
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:03,569
what I'm gonna do is anywhere we were

796
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:06,840
gonna do a update I'm gonna put in an

797
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:09,420
optional thing that instead of actually

798
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:13,050
doing the correct rights it's gonna do

799
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:16,500
false rights so for example if I just

800
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:20,400
right here I'm doing this sort of Vaught

801
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:23,460
this copy right and if we look at what

802
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,650
lightbox we'll see is so in the game

803
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,530
render commands right what we're doing

804
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:31,200
is we're filling out this v3 and then

805
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,640
this V this this D here we're also doing

806
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:37,019
but I don't care about that because

807
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:39,150
again we're not using the depth yet so

808
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,340
we're doing this this light voxel see

809
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:45,480
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to like

810
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:48,690
have like two values that I copy out so

811
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,000
c0 the first one will be the one that

812
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,309
gets copied into the first location and

813
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,469
c1 the second one will be in the second

814
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:58,289
location so I've I've done nothing the

815
00:36:55,469 --> 00:37:00,629
copy is exactly as it was and I'm gonna

816
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:04,199
put in some if zero code here that just

817
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:08,640
puts in some like hard-coded fulbright

818
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:11,129
color values in place and there if zero

819
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:13,679
it out so if I recompile this I should

820
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:17,539
see no change right and I and I don't

821
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,919
like that's exactly what I expect right

822
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,050
and so then what I'm going to do is I'm

823
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,909
gonna say alright let's actually fill

824
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,170
these in now you can see I'm not getting

825
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,899
anything here because of where I am in

826
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:31,860
the world let's actually back that zoom

827
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,750
out and let's let's actually see if we

828
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,930
can

829
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,460
get a view of sort of the area that

830
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:39,889
we're actually in in the texture right

831
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:40,970
now so at the end of the rendering you

832
00:37:39,889 --> 00:37:43,909
know we've got this thing that puts

833
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:45,469
those in there right and I guess it's

834
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:46,699
during the Annette call that we actually

835
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:49,069
set those up though it's actually this

836
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:51,799
right here so let's actually zoom this

837
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,450
out and see if we can see a little bit

838
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,700
better what's going on in our texture

839
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:58,189
let's just see if we can find a place

840
00:37:55,699 --> 00:38:00,379
where it's actually looking at something

841
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,700
and I'm gonna try and find it here

842
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,890
because you can see the center looks

843
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:05,929
like maybe we're not in the right place

844
00:38:03,889 --> 00:38:07,759
at the moment we gotta like find what

845
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:11,829
this room where this room unpacks when

846
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,830
we're looking at it here so there's some

847
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,920
so I just want to be able to see like

848
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:18,679
part the part of the light map that's

849
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,539
actually valid at this point in time so

850
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:22,969
here we are looking at the light map you

851
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:24,739
can kind of see like that we've got a

852
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:27,349
pretty reasonable part of it here right

853
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:28,729
and as I turn around right this the

854
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:30,440
light Maps not going to change it'll

855
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,539
change as I move because that moves the

856
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,369
light source but this is just changing

857
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:36,860
the angle that we're sampling in so this

858
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:40,099
is just changing where in here we're

859
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:42,680
actually like sampling that's all that's

860
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:44,989
happening there with that angular change

861
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:47,629
so that that's sort of a separate issue

862
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:53,469
right so now let's take a look at what

863
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:56,690
we get here if I actually put in these

864
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:58,309
copy overwrites so now instead of

865
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,440
blending that border we're gonna have

866
00:38:58,309 --> 00:39:03,829
like a red and green line right that's

867
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:07,190
it there and what you can see as I'm

868
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:10,429
moving around here is like the red and

869
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:13,250
green is like nowhere to be found right

870
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:16,629
like we're just not seeing that like

871
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:19,130
anywhere in here you know I'm saying and

872
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:22,970
so you know there's a couple of things

873
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:24,590
that are kind of weird about that but if

874
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:27,980
you think about it I guess I'm not

875
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:30,650
surprised because the edges when we're

876
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,510
not interpolating you wouldn't ever hit

877
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,309
the edges right because we go right out

878
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,500
to the edge here but we never crossed

879
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:37,880
the boundary so in a sense that's

880
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,800
actually encouraging because with

881
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,440
interpolation off I suppose we shouldn't

882
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,300
see that right I mean we just we

883
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,450
shouldn't see that

884
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,760
difference there right so let's go ahead

885
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:52,939
and turn interpolation on real quick and

886
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,520
see cuz we hope to we do hope to see

887
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:58,010
those but that will also tell us are we

888
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,630
at that edge or not cuz I don't know and

889
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,960
we could also poke some structured art

890
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:05,750
in there to see that as well but you see

891
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,050
what I'm saying right so if I go to the

892
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:13,250
OpenGL renderer and I look for the GL

893
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:17,870
nearest here I turn this back to linear

894
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:19,610
like so and I can now see what you know

895
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:22,489
is there any red or green that shows up

896
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,650
on these edges right and so there's

897
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:27,529
nothing there right like it is

898
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:29,900
absolutely not there you can see that it

899
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:33,680
is getting sampled but it's absolutely

900
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,750
not in that location right so what's

901
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:38,179
most interesting about that is it means

902
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,889
that that artifact that we're seeing is

903
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:42,500
happening kind of in the middle of

904
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:45,799
things right it's happening like

905
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,110
actually like inside here somewhere and

906
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,560
we don't necessarily know exactly where

907
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,930
yet

908
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,139
but what we do know now is it's not any

909
00:40:50,929 --> 00:41:02,419
of these edge things so if I actually

910
00:40:53,139 --> 00:41:06,409
turn you know I might do this so I can

911
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:09,769
sort of say you know let's look at the

912
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:16,369
edge coloring here right and I'll do

913
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:18,019
that like so so I'm going to do this one

914
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:21,739
exactly the same way as I did the other

915
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:27,670
one so I'm just gonna put in a c0 I'm

916
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:27,669
gonna put in a c1 and then I'm gonna put

917
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,970
the ability to sort of color those

918
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:38,809
things specifically in the middle and so

919
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:41,659
now this will also create a border on

920
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:43,909
the other side so you know just in case

921
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:46,940
we're getting some sampling weirdness

922
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:50,869
there we should be able to see that as

923
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:54,740
well and again like you know looking at

924
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:57,799
what's happening here just nothing

925
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:59,299
happening without linear which is what

926
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,510
we would expect if we were doing our

927
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,640
mapping correctly turning linear on we

928
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,040
should see hopefully nothing in this

929
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:09,529
region and we don't so again that

930
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,719
sampling is is really only out at the

931
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,660
fringes you can see it out here and here

932
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:17,079
right but I'm not getting any of it in

933
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:20,719
the actual region that we care about so

934
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:24,019
again think I think you know to at least

935
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:28,279
a certain extent I would say the copy

936
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:33,550
like our copy operation itself doesn't

937
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:37,600
seem particularly implicated there and

938
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:40,940
right like like I'm not seeing much of a

939
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,069
you know of an implication that that

940
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,690
this border copy could really be part

941
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:49,610
could could be any particular part of

942
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:52,309
the problem so what that you know leads

943
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:55,370
me to start thinking about now is that

944
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:57,079
means this seam is something that's

945
00:42:55,369 --> 00:43:01,429
showing up during per pixel

946
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:03,380
interpolation it's based on the angle

947
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:05,960
not the location in the voxel so the

948
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:09,920
lerp is not particularly implicated here

949
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:12,289
right and furthermore I guess I'm

950
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:20,480
wondering to what happens if I turn the

951
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:22,519
loop off now oops so if I jump in to Z

952
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,949
bias program and turn that loop off

953
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:28,449
again I'm just curious what happens here

954
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:31,609
I don't quite remember you apologize I

955
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:34,369
want take a look so if I turn the lerp

956
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:36,769
of the voxel off now what happens to

957
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:39,230
that seam okay so this is even better

958
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:42,559
I've now eliminated like most of the

959
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:45,309
code right so we're now just looking at

960
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:50,049
this diamond pattern almost entirely

961
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:54,259
separately from any other issue right

962
00:43:50,050 --> 00:44:00,110
and what's more is I'm wondering - like

963
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:06,950
could I just pick a particular voxel out

964
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:09,500
and stop even go even less far right so

965
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:11,618
for example if I look at where I am you

966
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,048
know in the world so here we are

967
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:18,519
we're kind of right outside the hot

968
00:44:14,048 --> 00:44:20,498
region and down so you know the in terms

969
00:44:18,518 --> 00:44:23,459
of where we are in the voxel we're like

970
00:44:20,498 --> 00:44:23,459
dead center

971
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:31,298
we're pretty much dead center of the

972
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:35,259
voxel except in Y where we're back a bit

973
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:37,210
and well I guess even there were more

974
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:39,400
we're pretty close to the center we're

975
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:42,249
almost dead center voxel but we're a

976
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,950
little bit forward in Y and a little bit

977
00:44:42,248 --> 00:44:47,528
right in X right so we could kind of

978
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:52,568
pick whichever voxel we're fairly close

979
00:44:47,528 --> 00:44:55,389
to here and just lock to that voxel and

980
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:57,670
see the pattern like by itself almost

981
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:59,798
right now I don't know we care because

982
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:02,139
we can see it so clearly at the moment I

983
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:05,288
suppose we don't really care about that

984
00:45:02,139 --> 00:45:07,478
but it's at least worth noting that it

985
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:09,729
seems like what's in the voxel doesn't

986
00:45:07,478 --> 00:45:11,828
even matter because this thing happens

987
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:13,960
no matter where we are right we're here

988
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:16,660
or here or here it really doesn't matter

989
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,420
we're getting this sampling on every

990
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:22,088
possible voxel cell so it doesn't look

991
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,950
like it matters which cell were on the

992
00:45:22,088 --> 00:45:26,170
only thing that matters is that there's

993
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:28,210
any light there so we don't see any up

994
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,789
here because there's no light for us to

995
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:34,659
see but anywhere there was any lighting

996
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:35,859
at all we get this pattern right so I

997
00:45:34,659 --> 00:45:37,719
think this gives us a really good

998
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:40,838
opportunity to hunt for the bug right

999
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:43,659
we're in a really good place we're kind

1000
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:46,449
of like the cat that's sitting watching

1001
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:49,210
the the shrub that the mouse ran into

1002
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:50,798
and we just have to be patient and wait

1003
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,978
for the mouse to run out and when the

1004
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:56,858
mouse runs out we're gonna pounce right

1005
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:59,919
so let's take a look at some let's try

1006
00:45:56,858 --> 00:46:01,838
and figure out some ways we can poke you

1007
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,940
know let's let's SWAT our tail on the

1008
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,528
ground a little bit if you will to try

1009
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,420
and provoke the mouse to actually come

1010
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:09,420
out so we can pounce it

1011
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:20,519
so looking over here here are some

1012
00:46:17,309 --> 00:46:24,360
things that I'd like to see if i zoom in

1013
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:28,559
on some of these voxels I'm you know

1014
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:31,500
looking at this I almost want us to be

1015
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,789
able to move around in here like it'd be

1016
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,269
nice to be able to scroll this thing

1017
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:37,889
around right well force when we can't we

1018
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:39,030
don't have the yeah we'd have to spend

1019
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:40,799
some time writing that and I don't know

1020
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,769
it would probably be worth it but I

1021
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,539
don't really know so I'm kind of tempted

1022
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:47,039
to say let's just stay the course right

1023
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,389
now because I kind of feel like we're

1024
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,210
hot on the trail I don't want to spend

1025
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:54,929
the time the diversion and possibly lose

1026
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:57,119
the mouse right so the only thing I'm

1027
00:46:54,929 --> 00:46:58,949
thinking here is like well you know can

1028
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,960
we zoom in a little bit more on this

1029
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:07,319
right so oops that's not what I wanted I

1030
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,119
wanted that can we zoom in a little bit

1031
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,080
more on this and just take a look at

1032
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:16,049
where we are in the in the voxel in the

1033
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,369
atlas in the lighting atlas could be

1034
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,410
zoom in a little bit more on this and

1035
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:22,319
just see a little bit more clearly like

1036
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:24,269
what what we're looking at there and one

1037
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,559
thing I'll note is I'm assuming this

1038
00:47:24,269 --> 00:47:30,179
must be the wrong side of the voxel like

1039
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:33,599
if we just zoom out even a little bit

1040
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:37,980
more than this so let's say that I take

1041
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:41,009
that span up a little bit more I'm

1042
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:44,070
assuming that we actually are there's a

1043
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:46,500
brighter section somewhere right because

1044
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:48,300
it just this looks like that looks

1045
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,460
really bright and I'm not seeing that

1046
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:54,870
anywhere so I'm assuming this is like on

1047
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:57,599
another z sheet like it's we're on the

1048
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:59,730
wrong z sheet somewhere like these are z

1049
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,829
sheets I'm assuming we're on the wrong z

1050
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:03,990
sheet or something or maybe we're on the

1051
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:07,170
wrong y sheet I suppose is the other

1052
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:09,269
possibility so I'm not sure but I'm

1053
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,490
gonna hunt a little bit for it just to

1054
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:13,199
see if I can figure out like where the

1055
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:14,819
heck this thing is actually brighter

1056
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,980
because shouldn't it have something

1057
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:19,950
approximately that brightness which is

1058
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,139
quite bright there we go right I'm like

1059
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:24,480
we should see something more like what

1060
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:24,799
we're seeing here if we expect this to

1061
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,699
act

1062
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,920
be corresponding right so that's at

1063
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:32,899
least a little bit better so I'm going

1064
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,809
to keep hunting a little bit so it looks

1065
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,970
like towards the far side of the map

1066
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:41,179
towards the right side of the map is

1067
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:45,379
where we actually see those values right

1068
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:47,750
and let me let me actually go all the

1069
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:51,769
way to the end just to see what we get

1070
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:54,199
there so yeah it looks like it's not at

1071
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:57,949
the very end so it looks like 0.8 was a

1072
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:00,079
reasonable area let me just zoom out

1073
00:48:57,949 --> 00:49:07,339
even a little bit more see if we can't

1074
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:08,690
find yeah really just don't don't see a

1075
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:12,170
lot of brightness you can see in the map

1076
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:14,480
right there I can turn off the those

1077
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,550
bright colors and maybe we should make

1078
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,599
those a little bit less glaring at the

1079
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,450
moment but I could just turn them off

1080
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:27,049
entirely because now we know they don't

1081
00:49:20,449 --> 00:49:31,539
actually matter right yeah so let's take

1082
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:39,350
a look this should just turn those off

1083
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:41,389
entirely so I guess you know that's the

1084
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:43,670
brightest part of the map presumably I

1085
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:45,469
mean I guess I don't really know we can

1086
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:50,990
take a look at the other side of the map

1087
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:53,119
and see if on the far left side there's

1088
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:54,979
something brighter but it sure looked

1089
00:49:53,119 --> 00:50:01,039
like the brightest stuff was it like

1090
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:07,539
point eight and we'll see I suppose we

1091
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:07,539
can also zoom out even more right

1092
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:20,910
here's us looking at the point eight

1093
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:23,038
side of things again so you can see that

1094
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:25,348
it's just like each slice and it's like

1095
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,469
this is these are the Y slices right cuz

1096
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:31,048
remember Y is stacked that's why there's

1097
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:33,028
multiple of these and so you know I mean

1098
00:50:31,048 --> 00:50:36,298
which one's the brightest one I don't

1099
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:37,469
know exactly maybe this one here looks

1100
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:40,440
like it's getting a little bit darker

1101
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:43,338
over time there but that one looks

1102
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,338
pretty bright right there

1103
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:58,390
who that those two look particularly

1104
00:50:51,550 --> 00:51:04,590
bright don't they again just trying to

1105
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:09,639
find yeah so it looks like maybe this is

1106
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:12,000
oops looks like maybe this is our Jam

1107
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:12,000
here

1108
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:20,299
just want to get a little bit more zero

1109
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:27,080
it looks like that ones maybe even

1110
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:28,490
better should probably turn off some of

1111
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,650
those extra things we're compiling for

1112
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:37,429
no reason now since we actually care

1113
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:40,789
about the compile time in fact I might

1114
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:42,469
just go do that so in here we're

1115
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:48,440
compiling a bunch of stuff like the ping

1116
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:52,189
test the sphere generator that don't

1117
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:55,700
need to be the font the HHA editor like

1118
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:57,230
we're compiling a ton of things so let

1119
00:51:55,699 --> 00:52:02,210
me just see if that improves our time at

1120
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:03,829
all yeah I mean that's definitely a

1121
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,579
faster compiler right so we should

1122
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:09,799
probably just beyond that all right so

1123
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:11,989
if we take a look at this now we're kind

1124
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:15,230
of zeroing in on a nice bright one for

1125
00:52:11,989 --> 00:52:17,089
our current location and if I just go in

1126
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,519
here and maybe tweak this ever so

1127
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:21,470
slightly to try and just get that in the

1128
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,230
center and then zoom in on it a little

1129
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:28,069
bit I'm hoping that we can get a feel

1130
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:29,630
for what the map looks like in this area

1131
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,970
just so we know that we're looking at

1132
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,680
the same thing so I'm gonna start

1133
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:36,108
reducing I'm gonna zoom in a little bit

1134
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:38,539
here on it right and try to get it so

1135
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:43,969
we're looking at right in you know right

1136
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:46,039
in the sweet spot here and that's just

1137
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:47,899
again just to make it a little easier on

1138
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,460
us so I can kind of see what we're

1139
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,900
looking at and you can already see I'm

1140
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:55,760
gonna get some good information out of

1141
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:58,880
this you can see some differences abrupt

1142
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,570
differences in the map there so let me

1143
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,088
go ahead and zoom in a little bit more

1144
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:06,830
and possibly adjust so I wanna like I

1145
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:07,880
guess I don't know exactly which one of

1146
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:10,279
these I want to look at but we're in a

1147
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:14,420
pretty good area here so let me zoom all

1148
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:17,180
the way into our default zoom now and

1149
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,430
we'll take a look so I would say that

1150
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:23,868
actually that pattern right there is a

1151
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:25,489
pretty good indication of what's what

1152
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:29,530
we're seeing it looks like we're

1153
00:53:25,489 --> 00:53:31,289
actually writing into the actual map a

1154
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:35,790
very bad

1155
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:38,369
pattern right I'm kind of interested in

1156
00:53:35,789 --> 00:53:41,909
that so let me go ahead and go in one

1157
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:44,699
more zoom level here just to look at

1158
00:53:41,909 --> 00:53:47,099
that a little more closely and right you

1159
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:50,699
see like we're writing in basically the

1160
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:52,679
same the same exact values in here which

1161
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:56,250
seems really weird that we would be able

1162
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:57,929
to hit so precisely on that so I'm kind

1163
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:00,920
of wondering if maybe we've got some

1164
00:53:57,929 --> 00:54:03,089
kind of a weird like bug with how were

1165
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:06,570
trunking our values or something like

1166
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:08,670
that those values should probably not

1167
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:12,660
have those hard edges like they're

1168
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:15,329
having right because anytime you have so

1169
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:16,949
just to be clear on what I'm saying here

1170
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:18,779
it's like anytime you have two

1171
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:20,969
neighboring values that are the same

1172
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,470
then when you do that interpolation

1173
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,789
you're gonna have a constant value and

1174
00:54:22,469 --> 00:54:25,469
then all of a sudden you're gonna start

1175
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:28,860
changing the constant value right across

1176
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:33,929
that boundary and you're gonna your eye

1177
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:37,400
is gonna see that so it's probably the

1178
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:37,399
wrong time to talk about continuities

1179
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:44,389
excuse me

1180
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:54,210
but here's the thing your brain can see

1181
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:57,269
different kinds of continuity changes so

1182
00:54:54,210 --> 00:55:01,099
if you want to create a seam that you

1183
00:54:57,269 --> 00:55:03,119
can see a visible seam like an edge

1184
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:07,049
there's actually more than one way to do

1185
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,839
it one way is to make a large change in

1186
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:11,160
the actual color values or the intensity

1187
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,480
your joining what you're doing in this

1188
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,899
case we're just black and white so

1189
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,000
intensity do make a large change in the

1190
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,730
intensity from one pixel to the next

1191
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,260
right and that large change in the

1192
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:24,210
intensity will create an obvious seam

1193
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:28,170
and we have interpolation turned off

1194
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:32,010
right now so as the interpolation moves

1195
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:34,440
from one to the other of these right or

1196
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:36,240
from voxel to voxels so from here to

1197
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:41,099
here which it can also do right like

1198
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:43,019
this way a large discontinuous change in

1199
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,889
the actual intensity value will create a

1200
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:45,420
seam

1201
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:47,670
that's the kind of seams we're seeing

1202
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:51,450
here so all of these seams are that kind

1203
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:53,849
of a seam and we expect to see these

1204
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:55,469
kinds of seams because we have

1205
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:58,289
interpolation turned off so we should

1206
00:55:55,469 --> 00:56:03,199
see them all but the question is if we

1207
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:07,260
now go back in here right and I turn on

1208
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:09,328
interpolation so I say in you know in

1209
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:12,059
here where previously we were doing GL

1210
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:15,329
nearest I go and change this to GL

1211
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:17,010
linear like so now we're doing

1212
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:20,940
interpolation so there will now no

1213
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:24,359
longer be one of those changes anymore

1214
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,920
right now again we've locked the voxels

1215
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:28,768
so we're not interpolating on the voxels

1216
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,829
so of course that seam remains but where

1217
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:36,719
does that seem come from why can I see

1218
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:38,339
that so clearly right and usually the

1219
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:39,959
answer to how you create a seam when you

1220
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:41,338
have linear interpolation or something

1221
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:45,409
that on is because you've actually

1222
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:48,690
created a discontinuity one level down

1223
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:54,179
so you created a discontinuity in for

1224
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:58,349
example in the derivative of something

1225
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:59,730
so when it is it's going from one rate

1226
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:02,369
of change to another rate of change

1227
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:03,710
right and you perceive that difference

1228
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:07,500
in the two rates of changes as

1229
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:10,019
accelerating right as you see like a dip

1230
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,179
right your brain sees that this is

1231
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:13,558
smoothly going at one speed and then

1232
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:17,159
suddenly going at another or something

1233
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:20,130
like that right so I don't really know

1234
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:24,149
if that's implicated here or not right

1235
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:25,588
but it's entirely possible that it is it

1236
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:27,480
doesn't immediately strike me as that

1237
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:29,578
because this is interpreting out to zero

1238
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,349
and I would have expected to see an

1239
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,420
interpolation across that boundary

1240
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:36,660
creating a problem as well with that and

1241
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,338
I'm not really seeing that right so

1242
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:41,250
that's a little bit weird I like how

1243
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:44,608
that we've got a little interceding cube

1244
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:46,230
that was causing me a problem there so

1245
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:51,778
it's a little bit hard to tell about

1246
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:52,869
that specifically but you know off you

1247
00:57:51,778 --> 00:57:57,309
go

1248
00:57:52,869 --> 00:58:00,338
so I'm not sure why I'm not seeing that

1249
00:57:57,309 --> 00:58:02,619
transition boundary but again it could

1250
00:58:00,338 --> 00:58:04,690
actually be that I'm on like one of

1251
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:07,239
these voxels where it's almost black

1252
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,130
here and maybe so maybe one of these has

1253
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:12,728
it actually completely black and that's

1254
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:26,380
the one we're actually in in fact in

1255
00:58:12,728 --> 00:58:32,228
fact where's that edge coloring in fact

1256
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:35,160
KC says yes so in fact if we now turn

1257
00:58:32,228 --> 00:58:38,199
off nearest I'm sorry turn off

1258
00:58:35,159 --> 00:58:39,358
interpolation and look at the actual

1259
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:44,169
thing

1260
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:48,308
so actually though we probably can find

1261
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:51,818
one of these that does that change right

1262
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:54,819
oh oh never mind

1263
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:57,449
all right I thought I guess that was

1264
00:58:54,818 --> 00:59:01,420
just along the boundary so never mind

1265
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:05,048
never mind that Avenue is foreclosed

1266
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,880
right it's not that because actually if

1267
00:59:05,048 --> 00:59:08,679
you look those were just boundary copies

1268
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,329
that we're looking that way so I was

1269
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:15,068
just confused about where we are glad we

1270
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:17,890
have this that helps so I'm not actually

1271
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:20,139
sure right as I'm looking at this I'm

1272
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:23,379
not actually sure where that seam is

1273
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:26,228
coming in right I don't quite get it so

1274
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:30,969
what I want to do now is if I can I'd

1275
00:59:26,228 --> 00:59:34,239
like to poke in to some of these here

1276
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:36,729
some structured values so I can see like

1277
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,710
where is this coming from how are we

1278
00:59:36,728 --> 00:59:40,179
going from a super-bright value here

1279
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,728
like that's right in the middle of a

1280
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:44,768
voxel right and I know I'm not

1281
00:59:42,728 --> 00:59:46,478
interpolating I turned off voxel

1282
00:59:44,768 --> 00:59:46,929
interpolation so it can't be the voxel

1283
00:59:46,478 --> 00:59:49,838
interpolation

1284
00:59:46,929 --> 00:59:51,518
that's just picking inside the same

1285
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,259
voxel going from one thing to another

1286
00:59:51,518 --> 00:59:57,368
thing it went from this color to that

1287
00:59:53,259 --> 01:00:00,579
color how did it do that right so what I

1288
00:59:57,369 --> 01:00:03,519
want to do is try to find where this

1289
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:07,330
actually is right like where is that

1290
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:10,329
actually happening which voxel

1291
01:00:07,329 --> 01:00:12,960
atlas in the octahedral unwrapping which

1292
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:15,130
one is one of the I don't care which one

1293
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,179
let's say it's this one but doesn't

1294
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:19,210
matter I find any of them

1295
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:22,569
so again structured art to the rescue

1296
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:26,559
thank you Mike Biddle come as we always

1297
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:30,010
thank him for structured art if we want

1298
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:32,320
to take our copy so we're we're doing

1299
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:34,570
the edge coloring at anytime in here I

1300
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,970
could also just poke right into the

1301
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,380
thing like here's here's a bunch of

1302
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:40,599
pokes right here right we're just like

1303
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:42,730
sticking stuff into the voxel I can just

1304
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:46,210
do this and click some structured art

1305
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:49,059
into a particular pixel so let me try to

1306
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:52,210
find where that's happening by using

1307
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:55,960
like a structured poke here right so I'm

1308
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:57,420
gonna poke bright blue in there actually

1309
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,000
let's do a low

1310
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:04,750
I'm a polka yellow directly into the

1311
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,489
voxel at a particular location right so

1312
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,019
doing this won't do anything because

1313
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:09,579
this will just put it in the corner so

1314
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:11,170
what we expect to see now is a bright

1315
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:13,659
yellow dot in the corner and there it is

1316
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:14,950
right um maybe I don't want yellow you

1317
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:16,480
don't want purple because I'm not using

1318
01:01:14,949 --> 01:01:18,549
that for anything else I'll say purple

1319
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,980
so I put a bright purple dot in the

1320
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:23,170
corner then what I want to do is try to

1321
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:26,050
find and I have no idea where but I want

1322
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:33,909
to try and find the txt why that would

1323
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:37,000
put me on one of these things whoa that

1324
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:47,109
is not what I was expecting to see but

1325
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:52,389
oh I guess I should have Wow okay so

1326
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:54,610
actually those are just the texels those

1327
01:01:52,389 --> 01:02:01,409
are just the texels that's the

1328
01:01:54,610 --> 01:02:01,410
interpolation along the Texel right

1329
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:27,130
hmm so basically the problem here is

1330
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:31,299
just the interpolation isn't blurry

1331
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:34,599
enough I mean really that's all we're

1332
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:37,780
looking at these are just the texels of

1333
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:40,690
the octahedral map so I was very right

1334
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:43,650
that the bowing is what those curvatures

1335
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:46,960
are that's just the lat/long curves

1336
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:51,480
along the octahedral map that's just

1337
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:55,119
what we're looking at how fascinating

1338
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:58,059
all right so that makes me want to do

1339
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:01,509
the following test so what I'd like to

1340
01:02:58,059 --> 01:03:05,230
do is fill in the nine by nine rooted at

1341
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:07,720
that at three right so I'd like to

1342
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:10,329
basically do this and I'd like to start

1343
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:12,250
looking at our interpolator Wow that was

1344
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:16,230
fascinating do you see what I'm saying

1345
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:20,769
like because I assumed there was a bug

1346
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:23,199
now even if there isn't a bug I learn

1347
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:26,199
something like I now know what the heck

1348
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,759
I'm doing right but until we actually

1349
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:30,189
dug in there we really just didn't know

1350
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:33,610
what that was and it would have been so

1351
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:35,619
easy for me to just you know do what

1352
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:38,740
stripe does and assume that you know

1353
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:40,449
what's going on and totally not and just

1354
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:42,729
brush something aside right and that's

1355
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:44,439
really frustrating that people do that

1356
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:47,349
never do that you will learn something

1357
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,179
and we just did right like we just

1358
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:50,860
learned something huge and if there's no

1359
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:53,500
question that knowing that going forward

1360
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,180
will be very important to us even if

1361
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,639
there was no bug here it was really

1362
01:03:55,179 --> 01:04:02,019
important that we dug in hard to this

1363
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:05,039
problem and not cheese around right so

1364
01:04:02,019 --> 01:04:11,170
let's fill in a very specific matrix

1365
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:13,090
here of like known colors across our

1366
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,500
series so we can take a look at that

1367
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:16,750
interpolator and start to think about

1368
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:19,510
how we might be able to improve the

1369
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,500
quality for the cranium interpolation

1370
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:21,760
that we're doing here and maybe that

1371
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:25,030
means doing a little more sampling

1372
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:27,250
ourselves which in theory wouldn't be

1373
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:28,630
too bad because again like I think we've

1374
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,130
got because we're just sample

1375
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,590
from one texture and we'd be sampling

1376
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:33,400
right inside the texture in a very

1377
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:35,050
specific place

1378
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,389
we shouldn't be causing much texture

1379
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:39,430
bandwidth there so I think this the fact

1380
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:42,069
that these atlases are nicely compacted

1381
01:04:39,429 --> 01:04:44,829
in a way that a graphics card likes to

1382
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:46,059
see things will allow us to do more than

1383
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:47,769
we would have been able to do if these

1384
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:51,099
were spread out and voxel land or who

1385
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:52,509
knows what so if I go in here and look

1386
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:56,619
at what's going on

1387
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:59,410
I just want to spread these out so that

1388
01:04:56,619 --> 01:05:02,349
I can kind of get like a better idea of

1389
01:04:59,409 --> 01:05:05,949
of what's going on so I'm gonna try

1390
01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:07,989
doing like maybe I'll just do like

1391
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:11,609
arbitrary colors throughout so maybe

1392
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:11,609
I'll just do like this kind of thing

1393
01:05:14,489 --> 01:05:26,349
right and I'm not really sure again like

1394
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,150
what the best way to do this is like I

1395
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:31,839
just I'm just trying to assign color

1396
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:34,570
values that will give me some way of

1397
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:39,180
uniquely identifying where I am in the

1398
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:43,390
map for everywhere around this Texel

1399
01:05:39,179 --> 01:05:46,690
right so do you see what I did right I

1400
01:05:43,389 --> 01:05:49,839
just put in a 3x3 and I may have said 9

1401
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:54,039
by 9 which I didn't I meant 9 pixel 9

1402
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:55,600
Texel so a 3x3 centered around the

1403
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:59,019
particular one that we were looking at

1404
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,809
right just so I can see what happens

1405
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:03,250
with the interpolation right so again we

1406
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:05,199
can very clearly see what's happening

1407
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,489
now right we have a way better

1408
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,159
understanding of what we're doing here

1409
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:11,019
right we can see that is the sphere

1410
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:12,909
being unwrapped the sphere of lighting

1411
01:06:11,019 --> 01:06:15,039
being unwrapped there for us that's what

1412
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:16,929
we're looking at and now what we want to

1413
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:20,199
do is look at what happens when we turn

1414
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:22,419
on the interpolation and see why it is

1415
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:24,279
that we can't like shouldn't there be

1416
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:26,590
some way to smooth out the way that

1417
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:30,820
we're doing this interpolation to not

1418
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:33,519
see those those seams right and so what

1419
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:36,490
we're seeing in the seam is is the

1420
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:38,440
bilinear filtering artifact right so

1421
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:42,848
what we're seeing there is we're seeing

1422
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:46,659
that sort of square based interpolator

1423
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:50,048
coming to bite us right and so what we

1424
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:51,608
could do is try to use maybe some kind

1425
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:56,440
of a radial interpolator or something

1426
01:06:51,608 --> 01:07:02,889
right we could try to fuzz those to make

1427
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:07,329
those edges less linear and more for

1428
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:09,279
lack of a better word puffy right we

1429
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:11,680
could try to change those fault change

1430
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,930
those fall-off curves and produce

1431
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:18,399
something you know that was a little bit

1432
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:20,828
more diffusing in like us more of a

1433
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,568
spherical pattern right because again

1434
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:31,269
this is lighting on a sphere we don't

1435
01:07:22,568 --> 01:07:33,670
really want lines so I think what I

1436
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:36,088
normally do at this point is I'd

1437
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:38,230
probably go spelunking for some papers

1438
01:07:36,088 --> 01:07:41,940
and I try to figure out if anyone had

1439
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:45,039
done stuff about how do you interpolate

1440
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:49,358
points in an octahedral met or not in

1441
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,929
octal map points in a map to try and get

1442
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:52,568
better

1443
01:07:49,929 --> 01:07:56,608
sampling than linear that's what I'd

1444
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:59,679
probably do what I'm gonna do instead

1445
01:07:56,608 --> 01:08:00,429
just so you know is I'm gonna try and

1446
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:02,980
figure it out myself

1447
01:08:00,429 --> 01:08:04,449
and again that's more to show you how

1448
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:07,630
you might go about doing that if you're

1449
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:09,068
gonna spend more time on it so before

1450
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:10,809
looking we're gonna give it one crack

1451
01:08:09,068 --> 01:08:12,670
ourselves which we always try to do on

1452
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:14,440
handmade Hiro not because I think you

1453
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:16,029
should necessarily do that in actual

1454
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,048
practice I do think you should do that

1455
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:18,940
in actual practice when you're learning

1456
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:22,390
by the way I think you should always

1457
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:23,738
give something one go first but then you

1458
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,850
do want to go read about it when you're

1459
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:26,019
actually professional in programming I

1460
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,850
usually do the other way around

1461
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:29,170
I usually familiarize myself a little

1462
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,088
bit with what's already been done in

1463
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,579
that space before I give it a crack

1464
01:08:31,088 --> 01:08:35,710
myself because you know I don't want to

1465
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:37,269
go in blind for no reason I'm a might as

1466
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:39,279
well no I try to keep it in mind that

1467
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:40,810
that I should always look for novel

1468
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:44,199
solutions because oftentimes I can come

1469
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:46,870
up with something that might be new and

1470
01:08:44,198 --> 01:08:48,579
interesting but I like to know before

1471
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:50,108
going in what other people have tried in

1472
01:08:48,579 --> 01:08:52,600
case something seems particularly good

1473
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:55,150
to me or also so I can sort of see like

1474
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,450
what are some ideas about directions I

1475
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:58,779
could

1476
01:08:55,449 --> 01:09:01,649
go as well you know it helps so let's

1477
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:07,000
take a look at this interpolation here

1478
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:10,239
looking at this right what I'm kind of

1479
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,390
interested in is what if I just knocked

1480
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:15,429
out the center pixel so let's suppose

1481
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:17,860
that I wanted to look at that for for a

1482
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:19,750
pixel this one right here and I dropped

1483
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:23,159
it to no light so there's no light

1484
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:28,600
coming from the dead center pixel right

1485
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:31,329
if that happens you can see exactly what

1486
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:34,060
we're kind of getting right like you can

1487
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:36,399
see those lines and these are just

1488
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:38,530
derivative lines weird again it's never

1489
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:40,839
just continuously setting the value it's

1490
01:09:38,529 --> 01:09:43,389
just when you do interpolation in a

1491
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:45,760
bilinear fashion you're gonna see these

1492
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:48,070
derivative lines that you get in there

1493
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:51,970
as the change happens you can read them

1494
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:53,619
your your brain can see them right so

1495
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:55,869
I'm trying to think if maybe I could

1496
01:09:53,619 --> 01:09:58,420
make something that didn't have that and

1497
01:09:55,869 --> 01:10:01,149
I just interpolate in a slightly

1498
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:05,460
different fashion right so if I just

1499
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:07,869
figure out a way to you know produce a

1500
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:13,720
an interpolation that didn't have that

1501
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:15,460
artifact right hmm and so you know

1502
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:18,460
considering it I'm trying to think like

1503
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:20,050
what if I just did a radial of more of a

1504
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:22,810
radial fall-off so what if I just

1505
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:26,680
changed like how I was blending these

1506
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:29,620
two things so that hmm that maybe we

1507
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:32,079
didn't have that particular artifact

1508
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:34,059
right and I think we could actually

1509
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:36,369
probably do this just with by modifying

1510
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:39,010
the UVs but I don't know that I want to

1511
01:10:36,369 --> 01:10:42,449
like actually start with that because

1512
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:44,409
that way lies like a very specific

1513
01:10:42,449 --> 01:10:46,300
implementation and since I'm trying to

1514
01:10:44,409 --> 01:10:48,550
experiment I would want something that I

1515
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:51,390
could sort of screw around with more

1516
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:57,070
like something that I could actually do

1517
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:59,260
more sort of more like so what I'm

1518
01:10:57,069 --> 01:11:02,019
looking for I want something where I can

1519
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:04,840
do more experimentation you know more

1520
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:07,510
quickly so what I'm asking here is like

1521
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,190
where we're doing this sampling here so

1522
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:11,409
when I actually produce these

1523
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:14,829
values I'm wondering if when I

1524
01:11:11,409 --> 01:11:17,229
interpolate the light source here where

1525
01:11:14,829 --> 01:11:19,779
I interpolate the place I'm sampling in

1526
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:21,909
the octahedral map I'm just wondering if

1527
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:24,279
I can do my own blending so instead of

1528
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:28,779
this where we do the single look up here

1529
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:30,609
which again we might not want like it's

1530
01:11:28,779 --> 01:11:32,649
a little bit hard to give up because

1531
01:11:30,609 --> 01:11:34,210
it's nice to have it it's probably much

1532
01:11:32,649 --> 01:11:35,710
faster than if I do it myself I mean not

1533
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,680
much faster but a little bit faster at

1534
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:40,779
the very least so I don't want to give

1535
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,520
that up if we don't get a major quality

1536
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:44,500
improvement but if we got a major

1537
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,449
quality improvement again I'm sampling

1538
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,789
from neighbors I'm sampling the exact

1539
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:51,250
same samples that the bilinear fetch

1540
01:11:48,789 --> 01:11:52,930
probably would have sampled anyway so

1541
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:56,350
I'm staying in the texture cache just

1542
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:59,170
like they want me to and presumably you

1543
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:00,610
know doing the blending myself is going

1544
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:03,579
to add some overhead but wouldn't

1545
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:04,750
necessarily be the end of the world now

1546
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:06,789
because I never remember what we

1547
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:10,479
actually have access to and GLSL three

1548
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:13,140
right I'm on take a look and see what

1549
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:13,139
I've got Oh

1550
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:23,440
got that out hot got that on hockey so

1551
01:12:21,969 --> 01:12:25,689
just looking at the texture sampling is

1552
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:28,839
all I was interested in here I just want

1553
01:12:25,689 --> 01:12:30,849
to know which samplers I have and how I

1554
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:36,819
and what kind of sampling I have to work

1555
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:38,829
with so if we take a look in here here

1556
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:46,719
we go here's all of our texture

1557
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:52,000
operations that we have is this four or

1558
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:58,090
three three good ok so here's all of our

1559
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:01,109
texture operations and looking at what

1560
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:01,110
we've got here

1561
01:13:05,658 --> 01:13:10,638
this operation but probably what we

1562
01:13:08,538 --> 01:13:14,958
would want this would allow us to give a

1563
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:18,679
sampler I assume this is just the UV

1564
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:20,840
coordinate right and then I can give a

1565
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:24,819
specific pixel offset so I can sample

1566
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:27,439
the four texels in question there I

1567
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:29,389
assume that's what that would do we'll

1568
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:32,570
double-check cuz again I never remember

1569
01:13:29,389 --> 01:13:37,550
what all these crazy things do I know

1570
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:38,918
what I want to do oh actually no I take

1571
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:41,329
it back

1572
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:42,380
that doesn't look like what we want this

1573
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:45,288
looks like what we want because we want

1574
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:46,909
to fetch a single Texel right so Texel

1575
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:51,889
fetch offset is probably what we

1576
01:13:46,908 --> 01:13:54,228
actually want this basically says well

1577
01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:55,550
or is it because this doesn't do the UV

1578
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,070
mapping for us although I guess that's

1579
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:59,418
okay

1580
01:13:57,069 --> 01:14:01,609
but what we would like it to do is just

1581
01:13:59,418 --> 01:14:04,189
give us the do the UV for us we're gonna

1582
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:05,748
have to produce the fractional part for

1583
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:08,449
the blending anyway so I guess it

1584
01:14:05,748 --> 01:14:10,488
doesn't really matter but I guess this

1585
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:12,438
is what we would do so we'd call textile

1586
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,759
FETs offset or just actually I guess

1587
01:14:12,439 --> 01:14:15,079
test Tech's will fetch at that point

1588
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,958
because we we would be doing this

1589
01:14:15,078 --> 01:14:23,029
ourselves so we would just say look

1590
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:25,849
here's the offset here's the particular

1591
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:29,448
textile to sample we'd grab four of them

1592
01:14:25,849 --> 01:14:33,229
and then we'd do our own blend of the

1593
01:14:29,448 --> 01:14:36,078
four right just to see what different

1594
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:40,519
blends might do in order to sort of

1595
01:14:36,078 --> 01:14:44,929
change the way that that sample was

1596
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:48,289
perceived right and again this is just

1597
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:52,908
to see if different ways of blending the

1598
01:14:48,288 --> 01:14:54,859
lighting would change things so what I

1599
01:14:52,908 --> 01:14:56,598
want to do here is I would like to be

1600
01:14:54,859 --> 01:15:02,238
able to switch between these two things

1601
01:14:56,599 --> 01:15:03,529
fairly cleanly you know ideally so what

1602
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:04,759
I'm going to try here is something I

1603
01:15:03,529 --> 01:15:06,198
don't think we actually have ever tried

1604
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,599
before but I think it should just work

1605
01:15:06,198 --> 01:15:10,569
and that is to say that since if we were

1606
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:14,479
just passing a giant string to open gel

1607
01:15:10,569 --> 01:15:16,279
I think once we kind of do some

1608
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:18,179
computations here I should be able to

1609
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:22,149
just do the

1610
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:24,699
right well actually no I guess that's

1611
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:30,368
not entirely true I have to put this in

1612
01:15:24,698 --> 01:15:32,198
there oh you know what

1613
01:15:30,368 --> 01:15:35,228
no I'm dumb I don't have to do that I

1614
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:37,418
can just using f0 so if I want to write

1615
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:39,579
I can still use if Zi Rui can use if

1616
01:15:37,418 --> 01:15:41,198
blocks in my shader is just fine so I'll

1617
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:43,630
just let's do that I don't know why I

1618
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:45,098
did the other thing so what I should be

1619
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:46,958
able to do is do something I can turn on

1620
01:15:45,099 --> 01:15:49,719
and off in here so that I can overwrite

1621
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:51,399
this and do our own sampling so let's

1622
01:15:49,719 --> 01:15:53,439
say we're gonna return this result and

1623
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:59,018
I'm gonna do something that looks like

1624
01:15:53,439 --> 01:16:02,019
this right so if one we do the existing

1625
01:15:59,019 --> 01:16:03,820
lookup path right and what I want to do

1626
01:16:02,019 --> 01:16:05,380
is pull the a out of here cuz I don't

1627
01:16:03,819 --> 01:16:07,418
care about the depth part right now

1628
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:09,519
we're not using it we're just trying to

1629
01:16:07,418 --> 01:16:10,988
work out our lighting sampling and then

1630
01:16:09,519 --> 01:16:12,909
the death sampling we can work on later

1631
01:16:10,988 --> 01:16:14,828
is sort of an extra thing if we even

1632
01:16:12,908 --> 01:16:17,138
want it which we might not like we may

1633
01:16:14,828 --> 01:16:19,268
decide we don't need that if we don't

1634
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:22,269
have lighting bugs related to sampling

1635
01:16:19,269 --> 01:16:24,070
things through walls like right like the

1636
01:16:22,269 --> 01:16:25,958
only reason to have the depth is to

1637
01:16:24,069 --> 01:16:27,458
prevent you from sampling from lighting

1638
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:30,578
probes that you yourself should be

1639
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:33,219
shadowed by and that's kind of an extra

1640
01:16:30,578 --> 01:16:35,168
level of accuracy that we either do or

1641
01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:37,359
don't need based on the aesthetics of

1642
01:16:35,168 --> 01:16:40,359
the game and what we perceive it's not a

1643
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:43,089
yes or no thing it's a look this is just

1644
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:46,208
hand like sort of an intangible what do

1645
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:47,979
we think would this help or not so if

1646
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:51,038
the results are good enough when we're

1647
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:53,110
done with the color version that doesn't

1648
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:54,759
use depth we just won't use it so I

1649
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:56,708
don't want to do any work on that that's

1650
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,289
why it's just kind of been riding along

1651
01:16:56,708 --> 01:17:01,779
as just okay we can do a second texture

1652
01:16:59,288 --> 01:17:03,340
if we want to and we know we can but I'm

1653
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:05,380
not gonna try and make it sampling good

1654
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,819
or any of that stuff so that part is

1655
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:09,038
just a separate issue that we'll look at

1656
01:17:06,819 --> 01:17:10,748
later so right now we just want to

1657
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:12,518
update this and basically what I want

1658
01:17:10,748 --> 01:17:16,288
here is some way of producing my own

1659
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:18,729
blend value so I want to be able to take

1660
01:17:16,288 --> 01:17:22,569
three different samples here of the

1661
01:17:18,729 --> 01:17:24,070
color that would sort of be like around

1662
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:26,948
the horn exactly like we were doing

1663
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:30,609
before right I kind of want something

1664
01:17:26,948 --> 01:17:31,299
that looks like this where we do four

1665
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:32,889
sample

1666
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,719
to get the neighbor you know the four

1667
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:37,569
pixels that are on the sides of where we

1668
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:39,489
are and then I want to just do some

1669
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:41,799
experimentation to see if even without

1670
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:43,899
so we could choose to sample an even

1671
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:48,070
wider region of the tection and texture

1672
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:51,129
and try to do some kind of really much

1673
01:17:48,069 --> 01:17:52,988
fancier job on that interpolation but

1674
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:55,449
what I'd like to do here is maybe like

1675
01:17:52,988 --> 01:17:57,039
try just doing some radial sampling or

1676
01:17:55,448 --> 01:18:00,368
something on this or something like that

1677
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:04,029
right just to see if if changing the

1678
01:18:00,368 --> 01:18:06,789
interpolation curves is enough and it

1679
01:18:04,029 --> 01:18:08,889
might not be right but I just want to

1680
01:18:06,789 --> 01:18:15,698
see if changing the curves is enough and

1681
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:17,139
again I think actually I think we know

1682
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:28,629
we can't actually that doesn't work with

1683
01:18:17,139 --> 01:18:31,000
bilinear nevermind actually now what I'm

1684
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:32,980
saying that I think it does so what you

1685
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,229
probably would be able to do assuming

1686
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:37,388
we're doing bilinear right I'm assuming

1687
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:43,839
what we could do there is actually just

1688
01:18:37,389 --> 01:18:45,880
go ahead and compute the UV coordinates

1689
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,469
that are the blend that would be done

1690
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,469
radially and then just do the texture

1691
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:55,059
sample I think that probably actually

1692
01:18:50,469 --> 01:18:56,198
works and so now I think about it maybe

1693
01:18:55,059 --> 01:18:58,840
that's just fine

1694
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:04,589
so let me try to do this a slightly

1695
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:07,719
different way okay so backing this up

1696
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:09,489
here's our sample CUV here I'm guess I'm

1697
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:11,230
gonna take this out entirely and say

1698
01:19:09,488 --> 01:19:14,198
what if we just kept even just keep

1699
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:16,178
doing that and the only thing I'm going

1700
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:18,279
to if one in here is the thing where we

1701
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:20,800
take sample see UV and compute a

1702
01:19:18,279 --> 01:19:22,779
different value for it right so we're

1703
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,690
just gonna change how we're computing

1704
01:19:22,779 --> 01:19:27,789
the UV that we're sampling from I'm not

1705
01:19:25,689 --> 01:19:30,578
actually going to change the fact that

1706
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:33,000
it's a bilinear sample and let me

1707
01:19:30,578 --> 01:19:33,000
explain why

1708
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:40,309
as I get gotta get the owl of shame out

1709
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:51,139
of the way we haven't done anything

1710
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:53,810
shameful yet today alright so what I'm

1711
01:19:51,139 --> 01:20:03,039
saying here is if we take a look at what

1712
01:19:53,810 --> 01:20:03,039
we're doing here on day five eighty oops

1713
01:20:06,698 --> 01:20:20,149
so in terms of I'm gonna call this

1714
01:20:15,229 --> 01:20:23,118
bilinear fudge so what we know is that

1715
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:26,149
the graphics card will automatically for

1716
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:29,359
us if we have a situation where we're

1717
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:32,569
talking about four pixels or in this

1718
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:34,670
case texels and I want a sample of value

1719
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:36,710
somewhere in them then what we know is

1720
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:38,270
it will do the bilinear blend for us

1721
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:40,368
which basically constructs these two

1722
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:42,980
values and then constructs this value in

1723
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:45,710
theory but really what it's going to do

1724
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:47,419
after all of that is it's just taking

1725
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:50,480
what the coefficients would have been

1726
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:51,889
and doing a four-way sum right so it's

1727
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:56,439
doing something that basically just

1728
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:59,989
looks like alright the texture look up

1729
01:20:56,439 --> 01:21:02,658
at the end of the day at you know UV is

1730
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:05,629
going to be equal to like coefficient

1731
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:07,009
zero zero times Texel zero zero and

1732
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:09,859
maybe I'll write that as a small C

1733
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:12,020
coefficient zero zero times taxol zero

1734
01:21:09,859 --> 01:21:16,250
zero plus coefficient zero one times

1735
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:19,400
Texel zero 1 plus coefficient 1 0 times

1736
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:22,340
texture 1 zero plus coefficient 1 1

1737
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:25,539
times texture 1 1 right so it's just

1738
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:28,940
gonna be a summation of this form

1739
01:21:25,539 --> 01:21:32,090
regardless of what happens right it's

1740
01:21:28,939 --> 01:21:35,689
just gonna take and add up these four

1741
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:38,630
values multiplied each by some weighting

1742
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:41,928
factor so it's going to compute these

1743
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:46,578
and it's gonna compute those based on

1744
01:21:41,929 --> 01:21:47,909
the bilinear blend right but we always

1745
01:21:46,578 --> 01:21:50,429
know that it's going to come out

1746
01:21:47,909 --> 01:21:53,760
with a certain set of values that that

1747
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:57,720
will do this convex combination right

1748
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:00,119
and so all I'm wondering is can I just

1749
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:03,150
adjust those values and I don't

1750
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:08,130
necessarily know offhand so let me see

1751
01:22:03,149 --> 01:22:10,859
if I can right so what I want to do is I

1752
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:15,260
want to do something like this I want to

1753
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:17,969
say that the coefficient of T 0 0 right

1754
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:19,199
I want to say that there's something

1755
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:21,869
there's gonna be like a radial

1756
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:25,829
coefficient and the radial coefficient

1757
01:22:21,869 --> 01:22:29,340
of like t 0 0 right is going to be equal

1758
01:22:25,829 --> 01:22:33,000
to the distance equation from this point

1759
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:35,789
right so wherever I am I know that as I

1760
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,909
move away from this point the farthest I

1761
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:42,420
could be away from it in like if if a

1762
01:22:38,909 --> 01:22:43,710
pixel is 1 wide like we there's a value

1763
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:45,779
there that we don't know what it is

1764
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:47,550
because we're not actually in UV space

1765
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:50,189
at the moment I'm just talking about if

1766
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:55,289
this if this length was 1 and that

1767
01:22:50,189 --> 01:22:57,089
length was 1 so in that space then we

1768
01:22:55,289 --> 01:22:59,310
know that this length here would be 1

1769
01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:02,159
and this length here would be like root

1770
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:04,710
2 right and so the question is like

1771
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:07,289
alright when do we want this pixel to

1772
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:09,390
stop influencing things and if we were

1773
01:23:07,289 --> 01:23:12,289
going to make it be a radial fall-off

1774
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:14,430
right so it looked like that let's say

1775
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:17,489
then what we would do is say like let's

1776
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:19,860
say the radius of this thing is 1 so

1777
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:22,170
what I want to do is I want to take the

1778
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:25,439
radius of this right and so if we

1779
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:28,579
imagined the UV in here right like the U

1780
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:30,750
or the V displacement off of this thing

1781
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:32,220
and probably I should be doing this off

1782
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:35,670
of the bottom one so we're talking this

1783
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:37,650
way right so the U and V displacements

1784
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:41,279
of this particular one what we'd be

1785
01:23:37,649 --> 01:23:43,379
saying is that look we're gonna start at

1786
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:45,989
1 so if I'm right on the thing I'm gonna

1787
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:48,510
be full fully bright and then I'm gonna

1788
01:23:45,989 --> 01:23:51,659
subtract from there the square root of

1789
01:23:48,510 --> 01:23:54,060
the U squared plus the V squared which

1790
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:56,970
is the length of this vector and when it

1791
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:59,559
gets to 1 I want this to be 0 so I want

1792
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:01,630
this to be a clamp right

1793
01:23:59,559 --> 01:24:04,809
so this right here is going to be a

1794
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:08,730
clamp meaning I'm not gonna allow it to

1795
01:24:04,809 --> 01:24:10,960
go negative right and that will be my

1796
01:24:08,729 --> 01:24:13,178
equation so I don't know how to write

1797
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:17,529
clamp in any particularly convenient way

1798
01:24:13,179 --> 01:24:27,670
but let's just say maybe it looks

1799
01:24:17,529 --> 01:24:30,130
something like this so I want to clamp

1800
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:34,630
this so that it's only gonna go down to

1801
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:37,599
zero and never below right so if we

1802
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:40,150
imagine that I take each of these things

1803
01:24:37,599 --> 01:24:44,940
and I produce a radial fall-off for each

1804
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:47,828
one of the points of light here right

1805
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:50,618
then what I'm gonna get is I'm going to

1806
01:24:47,828 --> 01:24:53,259
get a series of values one for each of

1807
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:55,000
these where I'm just producing sort of

1808
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:57,550
inverse versions of exactly this

1809
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,889
equation because if I imagine that I'm

1810
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:02,920
talking about this square where like

1811
01:24:59,889 --> 01:25:05,529
here's T zero zero and like here's T 1

1812
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:07,840
zero or something and here's T 1 1 and

1813
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:10,599
here's T zero one right or something

1814
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:15,309
like that then I know that my fall-off

1815
01:25:10,599 --> 01:25:18,610
4000 is like UV right and I know that my

1816
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:21,190
fall-off 4001 is going to have the exact

1817
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:25,630
same V but it's just gonna have like 1

1818
01:25:21,189 --> 01:25:28,178
minus u so the r01 fall-off is just

1819
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:30,279
gonna be the exact same value but

1820
01:25:28,179 --> 01:25:33,190
instead of a u squared it's gonna be a 1

1821
01:25:30,279 --> 01:25:36,819
minus u squared right because the

1822
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:40,299
distance away from T 0 1 goes the

1823
01:25:36,819 --> 01:25:43,710
opposite way here as u gets higher my

1824
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:45,510
fall-off gets higher right I drop my

1825
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:48,819
contribution

1826
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:51,010
but as u gets hired here I increase my

1827
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:58,899
contribution so it's just the opposite

1828
01:25:51,010 --> 01:26:01,329
value there right I think that's really

1829
01:25:58,899 --> 01:26:05,879
all there is to it right so we're gonna

1830
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:05,880
have something that looks like this

1831
01:26:10,789 --> 01:26:13,789
oops

1832
01:26:19,229 --> 01:26:28,599
so here we have I don't know why I keep

1833
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:31,149
on do that so we're gonna have four

1834
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:35,710
different coefficients each one is just

1835
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:39,339
going to be the clamped version of the

1836
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:42,850
distance equation for that corner right

1837
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:45,909
and the only thing that's a little bit

1838
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:48,400
strange is we know that if we were to

1839
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:52,000
actually apply this literal equation so

1840
01:26:48,399 --> 01:26:54,519
exactly what I've written here we would

1841
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,560
actually end up with situations where

1842
01:26:54,520 --> 01:27:04,300
the brightness was not uniform so the

1843
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:08,800
contribution of these would not sum to

1844
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:10,029
one right so it would produce a radial

1845
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,520
blend but it would not produce a

1846
01:27:10,029 --> 01:27:17,349
balanced radial blend and that's because

1847
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:18,940
let's suppose we got to a position and I

1848
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:20,710
don't know if like right in the middle

1849
01:27:18,939 --> 01:27:23,769
would be a good example of where that

1850
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:25,210
would be but there's probably locations

1851
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:30,400
in here and we'd have to take a look

1852
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:32,199
guys in fact this might be a good case

1853
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:34,449
for me learning to use that Decimus

1854
01:27:32,199 --> 01:27:36,639
program we already saw illustrate

1855
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:38,409
something very well once today let's see

1856
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:42,430
if we can't catch lightning in a bottle

1857
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:43,869
a second time so if we go here I don't

1858
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:44,980
really know how to get a new one of

1859
01:27:43,869 --> 01:27:49,750
these but I assume I can just do that

1860
01:27:44,979 --> 01:27:52,449
maybe yeah so if we were to take a look

1861
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:56,289
at the total power so I'm gonna blend

1862
01:27:52,449 --> 01:27:58,599
two lights together right two lighting

1863
01:27:56,289 --> 01:28:00,159
samples together and you know in the

1864
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:02,440
actual case we're blending four together

1865
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:05,889
but because I'm just gonna want to graph

1866
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:08,919
one thing here let's just look at just

1867
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:11,860
what happens along this line so from t 0

1868
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,239
0 to t 0 1 i could i could do if we

1869
01:28:11,859 --> 01:28:16,630
assume that both of these lights were

1870
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:18,369
like full intensity the question is what

1871
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:20,829
would the intensity be along the line

1872
01:28:18,369 --> 01:28:22,659
now if they're both full intensity and i

1873
01:28:20,829 --> 01:28:24,850
do a bilinear blend I know that's a

1874
01:28:22,659 --> 01:28:26,680
convex blend I know that it's uniform

1875
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:28,270
way throughout so it would just be

1876
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:30,460
uniform brightness throughout right

1877
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:31,870
fulbright fulbright and throughout it it

1878
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,159
would just be full bright the entire

1879
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:35,079
because you're blending from Fulbright

1880
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:38,619
to Fulbright there's no Delta there

1881
01:28:35,079 --> 01:28:41,350
right but what would happen if I blend

1882
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:44,739
these two equations together right so

1883
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:46,710
what happens if I take and I say and I

1884
01:28:44,739 --> 01:28:49,210
have no idea how to use this program

1885
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:52,930
guess I would probably do a y equals

1886
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:54,819
does that okay so I do a y equals X is

1887
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:59,440
my variable so X in this case is going

1888
01:28:54,819 --> 01:29:04,529
to be u right and I say all right I want

1889
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:12,189
to take one minus the square root of U

1890
01:29:04,529 --> 01:29:15,340
squared nope where's that squared yep so

1891
01:29:12,189 --> 01:29:17,710
I want y equals one minus the square

1892
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:22,300
root of U squared right and that's my

1893
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:29,640
that's my my distance function there

1894
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:36,820
right and this is gonna be clamped so I

1895
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:39,430
don't know how to clamp this of course

1896
01:29:36,819 --> 01:29:42,699
in this case I guess if it's not radial

1897
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:44,170
this doesn't do anything so I guess I'm

1898
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:45,250
gonna have to do something a little bit

1899
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:47,170
fancier aren't I

1900
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:49,239
because if we just square root u squared

1901
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:52,659
the distance is just just along the line

1902
01:29:49,239 --> 01:29:57,569
and it's gonna to generate right we

1903
01:29:52,659 --> 01:29:57,569
won't any we won't get any of the nice

1904
01:29:57,779 --> 01:30:05,829
radial miss there right because yeah I

1905
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:11,140
mean that that doesn't really help us I

1906
01:30:05,829 --> 01:30:13,149
suppose I could do this right and then I

1907
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,560
would because that's still the same we

1908
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:18,549
don't have to actually do the square

1909
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,780
root in that case but again not sure

1910
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:21,390
that really helps us we'll see you in a

1911
01:30:19,779 --> 01:30:25,469
second

1912
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:25,470
so if I sum these two together

1913
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:36,300
nope there we go so if I sum these two

1914
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:37,859
together what you can see is the sort of

1915
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:39,270
thing I was talking about right now

1916
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:41,429
we'll take a look at what happens if I

1917
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:42,960
sum them the other way but if you take a

1918
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:46,280
look at what happens if I just sum these

1919
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:48,390
two together even though neither of them

1920
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:51,960
either one right because we're only

1921
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:56,250
looking at this this cube here the 1 0

1922
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:58,920
to 1 neither one of them ever goes above

1923
01:30:56,250 --> 01:31:00,869
the actual 1 point right

1924
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:03,270
there's the SEC there's the radial blend

1925
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:04,979
one way and here's the radial blend the

1926
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:07,190
other way and they both stay below the

1927
01:31:04,979 --> 01:31:09,988
entire time but because they are

1928
01:31:07,189 --> 01:31:14,039
nonlinear through the middle they can

1929
01:31:09,988 --> 01:31:16,738
blend together to be higher right and so

1930
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:18,269
if I were to normalize them right so I

1931
01:31:16,738 --> 01:31:22,859
would just say look there's the value

1932
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:25,140
and when I take and I add these two

1933
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:29,429
together I want to make sure that I

1934
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:33,840
divide by whatever the total value is

1935
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:35,400
going to be right so I do this that's

1936
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,400
how we would get a constant power

1937
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,619
throughout right so I would blend this

1938
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:45,420
much of 1 and this much of the other

1939
01:31:40,619 --> 01:31:47,819
right and I would I would normalize

1940
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:51,149
those weights by the 1 norm right to

1941
01:31:47,819 --> 01:31:52,889
keep us always in line and so if I I

1942
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:57,559
don't know how to graph like other stuff

1943
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:57,560
but you know like if you imagine nope

1944
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:03,329
there we go

1945
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:07,199
so if you imagine looking at the

1946
01:32:03,329 --> 01:32:10,619
contribution of this right you can see

1947
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:12,179
that it has a kind of it because it's

1948
01:32:10,619 --> 01:32:14,579
getting renormalized by the weight of

1949
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:16,710
the other one you can see it using a

1950
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:21,000
kind of ease in ease out curve almost

1951
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:23,340
now right rather than a line and

1952
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,899
similarly if i graph the other version

1953
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:28,529
it would just be the opposite curve

1954
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:33,269
right so if I copy this equation here

1955
01:32:28,529 --> 01:32:34,199
again again you'll have to forgive me I

1956
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:36,239
don't really know how to use this

1957
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:38,340
program so I'm kind of making it up as

1958
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:41,039
we go like it doesn't need these I don't

1959
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:42,029
I don't know I guess I did it that way

1960
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,100
the

1961
01:32:42,029 --> 01:32:45,809
better ways to select and then hit the

1962
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,550
divide sign and it knows what you mean

1963
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:51,539
so looks that looks a little better

1964
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:54,900
right so you can see the weights of the

1965
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:57,119
two of them normalized in there now like

1966
01:32:54,899 --> 01:32:58,739
I was saying before I guess if I do the

1967
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:01,470
square root here I'm not sure to what

1968
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:03,479
extent that really makes sense but let's

1969
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:09,980
take a look at that so if I were to

1970
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:09,979
duplicate this I guess I just do that

1971
01:33:10,069 --> 01:33:15,449
yeah so if I were to duplicate that and

1972
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:17,370
just put in the square root version just

1973
01:33:15,449 --> 01:33:18,630
so we can see but I assume that it

1974
01:33:17,369 --> 01:33:19,949
doesn't really do anything in this case

1975
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:26,750
because it just turns it into a lion

1976
01:33:19,949 --> 01:33:37,829
either way so if I do squirt use squared

1977
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:39,270
like so and then squirt again really

1978
01:33:37,829 --> 01:33:40,170
apologize I just I just don't know how

1979
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:41,640
to enter things into this program

1980
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:48,180
properly so it's kind of a learning

1981
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:51,600
experience er right so let's suppose

1982
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:54,440
that I do the Square rooted version so

1983
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:57,300
this is the distance function version

1984
01:33:54,439 --> 01:33:59,119
and I don't know how to like turn this

1985
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:02,730
off okay there we go

1986
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:04,859
so there's another version of this that

1987
01:34:02,729 --> 01:34:13,649
would show us what would happen if we

1988
01:34:04,859 --> 01:34:16,469
just do the yeah the - if we just do the

1989
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:19,170
two opposing ones now that's a little

1990
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:20,820
bit weird to me so I think I may be oh

1991
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:24,359
that's why I'm like it shouldn't those

1992
01:34:20,819 --> 01:34:26,099
both be aligned and that's just cuz I've

1993
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:30,439
again did exactly what I did on the

1994
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:30,440
board there we go

1995
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:36,300
no come on make that a squared how do I

1996
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:38,720
make that a squared oh there we go

1997
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,720
there we go

1998
01:34:38,988 --> 01:34:46,888
so if I actually do the distance the non

1999
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:50,609
squared distance you can see that I just

2000
01:34:46,889 --> 01:34:52,230
get the bilinear blend back right and so

2001
01:34:50,609 --> 01:34:54,598
what I'm thinking is maybe we just don't

2002
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:57,569
do that so we leave we leave in the

2003
01:34:54,599 --> 01:35:03,300
squared term right so we don't square

2004
01:34:57,569 --> 01:35:05,578
root we do clamp right we would like to

2005
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:08,190
clamp here and I'm not sure how to get

2006
01:35:05,578 --> 01:35:10,558
that clamp in there so it won't look

2007
01:35:08,189 --> 01:35:15,089
exactly like this if we clamp because

2008
01:35:10,559 --> 01:35:16,829
this I believe would include oh no we're

2009
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:18,480
fine because we can't go over one so no

2010
01:35:16,828 --> 01:35:19,679
this is the correct this is the curve

2011
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,779
because we're not looking at the

2012
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:24,480
diagonal when the diagonal can get past

2013
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:26,759
one right is where we get a problem

2014
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:29,069
right so like somewhere in here on the

2015
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,889
actual queue on the actual square but

2016
01:35:29,069 --> 01:35:34,408
this is just looking at one along the

2017
01:35:31,889 --> 01:35:36,300
radius so it this is this is exact so

2018
01:35:34,408 --> 01:35:39,689
this is what it will look like even with

2019
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:42,570
the clamp in place so if I were to

2020
01:35:39,689 --> 01:35:45,538
actually compute these values my

2021
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:48,599
argument is well at that point I know

2022
01:35:45,538 --> 01:35:51,569
they sum to one and once I know they sum

2023
01:35:48,599 --> 01:35:54,659
to one I should be able to just produce

2024
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:57,988
the UV values I think that would produce

2025
01:35:54,658 --> 01:36:00,839
the exact right combination of each of

2026
01:35:57,988 --> 01:36:02,759
these things right I mean that's my

2027
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,800
thought now I don't know if that's

2028
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:07,250
actually true and the reason is because

2029
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:10,679
there's four things involved here and

2030
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:14,038
having the weights properly sum to one

2031
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:15,809
it may do it in a way I'm not sure if

2032
01:36:14,038 --> 01:36:17,969
you can produce all no I should be able

2033
01:36:15,809 --> 01:36:20,750
to use all possible combination no

2034
01:36:17,969 --> 01:36:20,750
that's not true is it

2035
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:34,750
so I might have to think about that the

2036
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:38,020
question is can I always produce the

2037
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:40,270
correct version of this right now I

2038
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:43,000
don't know is there a way to make this

2039
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:45,610
can we look at can we do fancier things

2040
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,090
here I don't actually know like I assume

2041
01:36:45,609 --> 01:36:54,549
I can't do 3d graphs but maybe I can I'm

2042
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:59,520
not actually sure it was cool that this

2043
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:59,520
thing just knew that if I used you like

2044
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:05,139
it's really cool that it just kind of

2045
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:06,489
knows it's like hey I looked and I

2046
01:37:05,139 --> 01:37:08,560
noticed there was only two variables so

2047
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:11,169
I graphed him this way so what I'm

2048
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:14,409
wondering is if I was to make a 3d graph

2049
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:16,899
would it know what that was like

2050
01:37:14,408 --> 01:37:21,388
suppose in here I said well you know

2051
01:37:16,899 --> 01:37:21,388
actually what I wanted was V squared

2052
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:50,030
right does it no I guess I guess all it

2053
01:37:39,319 --> 01:37:51,920
will do is add a slider so yeah so I can

2054
01:37:50,029 --> 01:37:57,050
look I guess I can look at a 2d

2055
01:37:51,920 --> 01:38:01,060
cross-section of what's happening with V

2056
01:37:57,050 --> 01:38:10,869
I guess that's what I can do

2057
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:10,870
how do I oops

2058
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:18,739
there we go so I can look at a 2d

2059
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:25,670
cross-section of the answer I guess is

2060
01:38:18,739 --> 01:38:29,119
how this works by isolating a particular

2061
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:32,329
slice of V right and this will show me

2062
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:38,569
what the answer is specifically for just

2063
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:40,880
that curve right so like I said the

2064
01:38:38,569 --> 01:38:43,159
problem with this is unclamped I'm not

2065
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,440
sure how this would help us I don't know

2066
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:49,510
if this has any kind of functions like

2067
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:49,509
that I could look I guess

2068
01:38:54,439 --> 01:38:57,569
[Music]

2069
01:38:58,210 --> 01:39:01,319
maybe here

2070
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:21,000
[Music]

2071
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:25,679
I don't know where this would be I would

2072
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:37,800
assume that they would have something in

2073
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:40,050
there maybe not I don't know so I'm not

2074
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:43,770
sure if I can actually clamp one of

2075
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:44,969
these values you know that's something

2076
01:39:43,770 --> 01:39:46,380
that someone who knew how to use this

2077
01:39:44,969 --> 01:39:49,829
program would definitely be able to do

2078
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:51,539
and I don't know how to do it well you

2079
01:39:49,829 --> 01:39:55,590
know what did what did the octahedral

2080
01:39:51,539 --> 01:39:58,079
one do so there is so clearly like

2081
01:39:55,590 --> 01:40:01,020
there's like that's a function so with

2082
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,719
squirt so I guess it's just like is

2083
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:12,739
there some way to list the functions

2084
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:12,739
right like how did this and and and this

2085
01:40:15,469 --> 01:40:22,739
this is like looks like and define your

2086
01:40:18,149 --> 01:40:26,908
own so we could make our own clamp in

2087
01:40:22,738 --> 01:40:28,289
fact looks like this is a pretty cool

2088
01:40:26,908 --> 01:40:30,269
program it's just like I said I don't

2089
01:40:28,289 --> 01:40:32,519
know how to use it so you know like this

2090
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:35,940
part right here is an example it looks

2091
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:37,679
like you can just create your own like I

2092
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:38,819
could create my own clamp you know what

2093
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,789
I mean

2094
01:40:38,819 --> 01:40:44,179
and again I just don't know how to use

2095
01:40:41,789 --> 01:40:46,679
it so I won't do that at the moment but

2096
01:40:44,179 --> 01:40:49,069
it's pretty cool that you can do all

2097
01:40:46,679 --> 01:40:51,300
that stuff this is such a neat program I

2098
01:40:49,069 --> 01:40:56,519
don't know who made this but it's pretty

2099
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:58,320
awesome so anyway and they had to make

2100
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:01,679
all this in JavaScript right like I

2101
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:05,908
think that's pretty good right that's

2102
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:07,800
not fun so if you look at what's

2103
01:41:05,908 --> 01:41:09,119
happening here right this is the part

2104
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:10,889
that I'm talking about so the radial

2105
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:13,050
fault I just want to know like is it a

2106
01:41:10,889 --> 01:41:15,630
line always or not like but I'm assuming

2107
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:17,429
it's not if we normalize it out I'm

2108
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:18,949
assuming it actually has some shape to

2109
01:41:17,429 --> 01:41:21,439
it right

2110
01:41:18,948 --> 01:41:24,259
and you can see that if V equals zero at

2111
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:26,418
the v equals zero point it does actually

2112
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:28,099
look like a line which is a little bit

2113
01:41:26,418 --> 01:41:34,219
strange because I would have assumed

2114
01:41:28,099 --> 01:41:36,559
that it would not since in theory if V

2115
01:41:34,219 --> 01:41:38,380
is knocked out of this equation it

2116
01:41:36,559 --> 01:41:58,130
should look the same as this one right

2117
01:41:38,380 --> 01:42:09,708
so Oh cuz this is the ya no oops so

2118
01:41:58,130 --> 01:42:11,208
there we go okay so that's that's

2119
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:13,938
actually more we'd be looking like so if

2120
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:16,958
we use the squared fall-off right so

2121
01:42:13,939 --> 01:42:19,579
there's the squared fall-off curve and

2122
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:22,668
again like I think this would be

2123
01:42:19,578 --> 01:42:26,268
incorrect because it's not clamping

2124
01:42:22,668 --> 01:42:30,229
where it should be clamping right so

2125
01:42:26,269 --> 01:42:38,630
when it gets down to zero oh and this is

2126
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:42,619
not right either so when these values as

2127
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:45,409
we do this they're incorrect because the

2128
01:42:42,618 --> 01:42:48,018
clamping is not actually in place on the

2129
01:42:45,408 --> 01:42:51,708
on either on the numerator or the nut

2130
01:42:48,019 --> 01:42:54,439
denominator right so although we're

2131
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:59,269
properly now seeing what happens in the

2132
01:42:54,439 --> 01:43:01,789
case where V is not allowing you to push

2133
01:42:59,269 --> 01:43:04,760
over zero because when V is zero then

2134
01:43:01,788 --> 01:43:08,658
this equation does not need clamping but

2135
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:10,668
once V becomes larger than it does need

2136
01:43:08,658 --> 01:43:13,538
clamping and I just it would be nice to

2137
01:43:10,668 --> 01:43:16,519
be able to see what was happening there

2138
01:43:13,538 --> 01:43:23,229
with the clamping I wish is there no

2139
01:43:16,519 --> 01:43:28,060
clamp function so it knows ABS

2140
01:43:23,229 --> 01:43:33,809
oh it knows min all right

2141
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:37,840
well so if we took the maximum value of

2142
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:40,510
that and zero I mean if that's actually

2143
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,840
working that that's a clamp right

2144
01:43:40,510 --> 01:43:45,190
because we don't really need to clamp it

2145
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:48,400
on the high side even if we did we could

2146
01:43:45,189 --> 01:43:57,879
choose a min we just need to clamp it so

2147
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:58,869
that it doesn't go below zero right so I

2148
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,699
don't again

2149
01:43:58,869 --> 01:44:04,529
I don't know if this is right because

2150
01:44:00,699 --> 01:44:08,159
I'm not sure how to use the program but

2151
01:44:04,529 --> 01:44:08,159
you know we're gonna give it a shot

2152
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:19,920
possibly I mean maybe that worked I

2153
01:44:14,699 --> 01:44:19,920
don't know if it did or didn't

2154
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:33,780
so that doesn't seem particularly

2155
01:44:31,739 --> 01:44:41,429
logical to me it doesn't look like

2156
01:44:33,779 --> 01:44:42,479
that's actually clamping because I'm not

2157
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:48,810
sure where you would be able to get

2158
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:50,219
those those errors in there if I'm like

2159
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:55,320
I shouldn't ever be able to get a zero

2160
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:58,079
should I like that doesn't really make

2161
01:44:55,319 --> 01:45:00,139
sense so it's a little bit confusing

2162
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:06,630
like I think I probably did this wrong

2163
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:09,119
oh you know why because this max is in

2164
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:11,100
the wrong place I mean I could do it

2165
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:12,630
this way it'd be a min yeah

2166
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:15,900
so that's sorry that's wrong it's this

2167
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:17,760
way sorry again this is pretty confusing

2168
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:19,379
for me like I don't really know what I'm

2169
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,369
doing here so I'm like as I'm thinking

2170
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:21,810
it through I'm just kind of putting

2171
01:45:20,369 --> 01:45:22,890
things and I'm like wait a minute Noah

2172
01:45:21,810 --> 01:45:32,970
why are you doing that's not the math

2173
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:36,270
you actually wanted okay so if I say

2174
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:38,250
look the maximum of this is zero here

2175
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:46,530
and let me put this one in the same

2176
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:47,850
place so there we can see the

2177
01:45:46,529 --> 01:45:49,349
normalization a little bit more I'd

2178
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:55,050
still don't know if that's really

2179
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:56,970
working the way I think it should be cuz

2180
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:59,489
it looks like that I don't know why that

2181
01:45:56,970 --> 01:46:01,050
would again create any kind of a divide

2182
01:45:59,489 --> 01:46:04,109
error

2183
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:07,409
it shouldn't if I'm doing this right so

2184
01:46:04,109 --> 01:46:09,869
we take the maximum value of whatever

2185
01:46:07,409 --> 01:46:12,269
this is we want to clamp it to zero so

2186
01:46:09,869 --> 01:46:13,590
once this gets above one and this

2187
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:18,330
becomes negative we should be Street

2188
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:20,190
taking zero right and then we've got the

2189
01:46:18,329 --> 01:46:23,430
other one in here oh so I guess that's

2190
01:46:20,189 --> 01:46:25,619
yeah I guess when we think about that so

2191
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:27,630
when you're doing the V the problem

2192
01:46:25,619 --> 01:46:29,819
there is that we now no longer we don't

2193
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:31,920
have the other four we don't have all

2194
01:46:29,819 --> 01:46:34,469
four people who should be on the bottom

2195
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,210
with a V so that's actually that's what

2196
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:38,640
we would expect because normally now

2197
01:46:36,210 --> 01:46:40,239
what we would have is we'd have the

2198
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:43,420
other two in here

2199
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:50,399
right so in addition to the previous

2200
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:54,489
ones we would also have one minus V and

2201
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:59,199
one minus V so it would actually be that

2202
01:46:54,488 --> 01:47:01,359
right it's what we would have so yeah I

2203
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:09,099
guess we wouldn't really have that

2204
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:14,429
problem right so that would prevent us

2205
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:14,430
from ever getting a zero I think right

2206
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:23,890
and so that does give us what I would

2207
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:25,780
expect except at the zero okay so at

2208
01:47:23,890 --> 01:47:32,170
negative one it's still not giving me

2209
01:47:25,779 --> 01:47:37,149
what I would expect there right it's

2210
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:40,890
hard to see this can I yeah I can so at

2211
01:47:37,149 --> 01:47:48,969
negative one that would be you know this

2212
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:50,590
this should all I guess always be this

2213
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:52,119
would always be zero right and you know

2214
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:53,110
what V can't I don't know yet so that's

2215
01:47:52,119 --> 01:47:55,719
actually just wrong

2216
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:58,869
this can't be negative one anyway so

2217
01:47:55,719 --> 01:48:02,380
it's really just here all right

2218
01:47:58,869 --> 01:48:04,750
so there's the blend and it looks a

2219
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:06,369
little wonky like you can see that

2220
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:07,479
there's a weirdness there so let me just

2221
01:48:06,369 --> 01:48:08,829
take one more look to see if I've got

2222
01:48:07,479 --> 01:48:11,889
something that I think is actually

2223
01:48:08,829 --> 01:48:14,890
correct now so one minus the this is a

2224
01:48:11,890 --> 01:48:19,140
squared fell off here and clamped this

2225
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:23,579
is the squared fall off yep and clamped

2226
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:29,560
this is another squared fall off and

2227
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:35,050
clamped this is another squared fall off

2228
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:39,010
and clamped right I mean so that looks

2229
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:42,039
like it's correct the top one again is

2230
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:44,409
also clamped because we don't want to

2231
01:48:42,039 --> 01:48:50,880
consider any contributions that are too

2232
01:48:44,409 --> 01:48:55,889
high or too low yeah

2233
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:57,420
so if that's actually accurate I don't

2234
01:48:55,889 --> 01:49:00,060
actually need these intersection points

2235
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:07,230
so let's get rid of that and let's take

2236
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:10,409
a look so kind of what you see there is

2237
01:49:07,229 --> 01:49:13,709
it's not particularly compelling right

2238
01:49:10,408 --> 01:49:16,259
like it's alright and it has some of the

2239
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:20,429
properties that I might want but the

2240
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:25,170
fall-off is not really what I would have

2241
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:27,869
preferred right it's it's kind of got a

2242
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:29,520
nasty like I don't like those

2243
01:49:27,869 --> 01:49:33,090
discontinuities like I'd like to see

2244
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:35,100
something that had a little less

2245
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:36,750
discontinuities in it and the reason it

2246
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:38,940
has those discontinuities is cuz of the

2247
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:40,889
maxes right those create sort of hard

2248
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:43,379
braking points so I guess what I'm

2249
01:49:40,889 --> 01:49:45,690
wondering is can I make it so that we

2250
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:48,420
actually just maybe make the fall-off

2251
01:49:45,689 --> 01:49:49,948
across the entire thing so maybe I just

2252
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:51,690
say look all that work I did to figure

2253
01:49:49,948 --> 01:49:54,539
out how to maybe make max work and

2254
01:49:51,689 --> 01:49:56,849
hopefully like I'm interpreting this

2255
01:49:54,539 --> 01:50:02,969
correctly right but maybe what I should

2256
01:49:56,850 --> 01:50:06,539
do is say no let's let's actually not

2257
01:50:02,969 --> 01:50:08,969
introduce any discontinuities there well

2258
01:50:06,539 --> 01:50:10,079
let me leave this on the thing for now

2259
01:50:08,969 --> 01:50:19,739
well actually I guess I don't really

2260
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:21,988
need to so let's get rid of the max not

2261
01:50:19,738 --> 01:50:24,149
the Boeing 737 max of course the

2262
01:50:21,988 --> 01:50:31,529
wonderful airplane that crashes into the

2263
01:50:24,149 --> 01:50:33,569
ground due to software failures let's

2264
01:50:31,529 --> 01:50:35,969
get rid of the max so we just had the

2265
01:50:33,569 --> 01:50:38,069
turns on the bottom and all I want to do

2266
01:50:35,969 --> 01:50:40,590
is say look all right when we actually

2267
01:50:38,069 --> 01:50:42,869
drop this down I want to take and I want

2268
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:47,310
to add the route to term in there right

2269
01:50:42,869 --> 01:50:48,988
so meaning I want to take out I want to

2270
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:50,340
basically put in a thing and I don't

2271
01:50:48,988 --> 01:50:53,729
know if I can do this but let's suppose

2272
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:56,520
I took like like a scale value and said

2273
01:50:53,729 --> 01:51:01,079
scalar value equals 1 over square root

2274
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:04,020
of 2 right so basically reducing that a

2275
01:51:01,079 --> 01:51:04,779
billet so because I know that that as I

2276
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,880
square that

2277
01:51:04,779 --> 01:51:11,969
outright like as this squared value

2278
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:14,260
comes out my scale value I know that the

2279
01:51:11,969 --> 01:51:17,170
distance the radius that I want this

2280
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:19,420
thing to get to would be root two that's

2281
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:20,590
the distance along the the total

2282
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:23,440
distance around the diagonal of the

2283
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:25,599
square and this is actually the squared

2284
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:28,479
distance here so I believe it would just

2285
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:33,340
be actually the square of this right so

2286
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:35,259
it actually just be like 1/2 right so if

2287
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:39,038
I were to actually put in the one half

2288
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:42,250
term there I'm wondering what that would

2289
01:51:39,038 --> 01:51:48,099
do to my equation I mean I'm just

2290
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:48,788
curious right just to see what happens

2291
01:51:48,099 --> 01:51:50,469
there

2292
01:51:48,788 --> 01:51:51,670
and I guess so I must have messed that

2293
01:51:50,469 --> 01:51:52,868
up a little bit in my head let me

2294
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:55,149
actually write that out because it looks

2295
01:51:52,868 --> 01:51:57,189
like I'm wrong about that but point

2296
01:51:55,149 --> 01:52:02,738
being the scale value like whatever goes

2297
01:51:57,189 --> 01:52:15,279
in here I'm just curious what the actual

2298
01:52:02,738 --> 01:52:19,058
answer is yeah so I don't know we'll

2299
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:21,219
take a look but anyway that may be more

2300
01:52:19,059 --> 01:52:23,320
like what I want right so let me just

2301
01:52:21,219 --> 01:52:25,090
get the scale right on that but I think

2302
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:27,130
that may be what I want because then

2303
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:29,500
that way if I actually make these

2304
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:32,230
functions well-behaved in there I can

2305
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:36,698
get a curve and the curve won't actually

2306
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:39,509
be discontinuous I'll actually have one

2307
01:52:36,698 --> 01:52:42,399
that can step properly through itself

2308
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:46,929
now one thing I don't love here is I

2309
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:48,549
don't love the I don't love the rapid

2310
01:52:46,929 --> 01:52:50,109
fall off here I think I would prefer

2311
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:52,480
something shaped more like that so I

2312
01:52:50,109 --> 01:52:55,448
might continue just the shaping of these

2313
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:58,089
here and say maybe what I actually want

2314
01:52:55,448 --> 01:53:00,339
to do is make it so my fall-off curve is

2315
01:52:58,090 --> 01:53:03,369
something slightly different so what

2316
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:04,449
would happen I really need to learn to

2317
01:53:03,368 --> 01:53:05,649
use this because we could probably make

2318
01:53:04,448 --> 01:53:07,808
functions for doing this so I could

2319
01:53:05,649 --> 01:53:09,729
changes more rapidly but what would

2320
01:53:07,809 --> 01:53:14,909
happen if actually I wanted to do like

2321
01:53:09,729 --> 01:53:14,908
let's start over kind of into this now

2322
01:53:19,319 --> 01:53:25,269
so let's say I've got you V squared here

2323
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:26,889
right and what I actually want to do is

2324
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:30,100
before I was doing the fall off this way

2325
01:53:26,890 --> 01:53:35,140
right so we start at 1 and we drop down

2326
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:38,320
like that right and if I do 1 minus like

2327
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:40,300
u squared V squared right you can see as

2328
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:43,779
I do that slice it's it's pretty clean

2329
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:45,760
right looks looks pretty nice so the

2330
01:53:43,779 --> 01:53:47,889
problem that I'm getting is when I add

2331
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:50,530
that normalization in there and I don't

2332
01:53:47,890 --> 01:53:54,780
know if this thing supports no it even

2333
01:53:50,529 --> 01:53:54,779
has undo man this thing is it's amazing

2334
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:58,630
so that a problem I'm getting here is

2335
01:53:56,948 --> 01:54:02,169
like if you see what happens once I

2336
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:03,550
introduce the normalization right and it

2337
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:07,529
doesn't matter where the s is in there

2338
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:07,529
or not so no matter what the S is right

2339
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:16,449
so I can figure out what the S is just

2340
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:25,560
by trial and error right and I just need

2341
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:29,369
to figure out what actually that's ok

2342
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:29,370
that's the problem right there

2343
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:40,500
so I should be able to figure out some

2344
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:41,819
way of taking these values and I guess

2345
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:44,609
you know it now I think about it this s

2346
01:54:41,819 --> 01:54:46,619
since there's a one - in here as well I

2347
01:54:44,609 --> 01:54:49,049
suppose this s even has to probably

2348
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:50,189
happen beforehand so it may not be able

2349
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:52,829
to now but it should be able to be

2350
01:54:50,189 --> 01:54:54,659
pulled out hard to say so I need to make

2351
01:54:52,829 --> 01:54:56,939
this equation so it operates across the

2352
01:54:54,659 --> 01:54:59,670
square so I get an even interpolation on

2353
01:54:56,939 --> 01:55:01,679
it but either way once I add the

2354
01:54:59,670 --> 01:55:05,130
normalization you notice how I get a

2355
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:06,690
curve that drops off like this and I was

2356
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:09,270
kind of hoping for a curve that dropped

2357
01:55:06,689 --> 01:55:11,699
more like that and I guess the problem

2358
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:16,290
is I'm not sure how I would actually do

2359
01:55:11,699 --> 01:55:20,250
that in a way that actually has the sum

2360
01:55:16,289 --> 01:55:21,840
to one property so we do have a bit of

2361
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:25,260
an issue there and I'm not sure how I

2362
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:28,409
would really go about fixing that but

2363
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:30,960
let's just take a quick look over I'm

2364
01:55:28,409 --> 01:55:32,340
going to switch over here and see how I

2365
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:35,939
would get this to come out to be

2366
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:40,529
properly radial so if I assume that I've

2367
01:55:35,939 --> 01:55:42,559
got my square here and I want to make

2368
01:55:40,529 --> 01:55:47,670
sure that this point right here is

2369
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:49,500
actually the zero point you know what

2370
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:52,529
though thinking about that that doesn't

2371
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:55,319
work right either because if we did that

2372
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:57,719
then we would have to use those values

2373
01:55:55,319 --> 01:56:00,989
out here so we pretty much can't do that

2374
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:02,760
we do have to just clamp in there like

2375
01:56:00,989 --> 01:56:05,579
it has to clamp and get down to zero I

2376
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:06,720
mean we couldn't use negated but again

2377
01:56:05,579 --> 01:56:08,250
then you would you would have the same

2378
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:11,850
problem when you cross this line you

2379
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:13,079
would get a discontinuity so I don't

2380
01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:15,090
know it doesn't look like there's any

2381
01:56:13,079 --> 01:56:17,609
way to avoid that kind of wobbly shape

2382
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:20,340
to it right and the wobbly shape comes

2383
01:56:17,609 --> 01:56:22,079
because when you hit a place you know

2384
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:26,510
you're basically going to have for each

2385
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:32,579
of these you've got a circle right and

2386
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:36,530
each of these circles creates a

2387
01:56:32,579 --> 01:56:42,390
discontinuity in the interpolation right

2388
01:56:36,529 --> 01:56:44,759
so you have different places where

2389
01:56:42,390 --> 01:56:45,369
they're clamping would would kind of max

2390
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:49,750
out

2391
01:56:45,369 --> 01:56:51,550
right and I don't really know what to do

2392
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:55,840
about that part right I don't know what

2393
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:57,400
to do to fix that it's a little dicey

2394
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:02,350
right to figure out how we would

2395
01:56:57,399 --> 01:57:04,929
actually I'm assuming we would see that

2396
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:07,710
as well so we would we would change the

2397
01:57:04,930 --> 01:57:11,680
interpreters to have instead of this

2398
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:13,630
diagonal cross problem we would spread

2399
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:15,909
it out so that it's actually at four

2400
01:57:13,630 --> 01:57:19,480
things instead of two which I'm hoping

2401
01:57:15,909 --> 01:57:21,849
would give us a nicer interpolation but

2402
01:57:19,479 --> 01:57:23,799
at the end of the day there's still a

2403
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:26,920
discontinuity happening there I think

2404
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:31,600
that we would see in the interpolator

2405
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:36,329
and I'm not sure like I'm not sure what

2406
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:36,329
I would do to get around it either way

2407
01:57:37,569 --> 01:57:41,859
let me see I'm I want to know if I can

2408
01:57:39,909 --> 01:57:43,930
hack something in to allow us to sample

2409
01:57:41,859 --> 01:57:46,449
this and the problem is just figuring

2410
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:48,280
out how we're gonna do it so I think

2411
01:57:46,449 --> 01:57:50,970
what I will do is I'll use the way I was

2412
01:57:48,279 --> 01:57:53,170
suggesting originally just to make sure

2413
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:55,030
that I can play around with it a little

2414
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:57,850
bit easier before I try to do the UV

2415
01:57:55,029 --> 01:58:05,139
solving so rather than doing it this way

2416
01:57:57,850 --> 01:58:07,120
I'm gonna actually do this right so

2417
01:58:05,140 --> 01:58:10,210
we're gonna try and take an RGB sample

2418
01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:12,159
and I'm gonna produce that RGB sample by

2419
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:15,279
taking a sum right so I want to

2420
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:17,430
literally do exactly the thing that I

2421
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:17,429
said

2422
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:41,100
I want to do literally this right and I

2423
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:43,110
want these to all be computed based on

2424
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:45,539
the fall-off so I want to do that fall

2425
01:58:43,109 --> 01:58:48,809
off and then I need to actually produce

2426
01:58:45,539 --> 01:58:50,430
these values these textile samples and

2427
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:52,200
producing the Texas sample is gonna be

2428
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:54,630
the hardest part by far right because

2429
01:58:52,199 --> 01:58:57,179
it's a finicky like you know discrete

2430
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:59,340
lookup kind of operation but so in here

2431
01:58:57,180 --> 01:59:01,380
I want to go ahead and produce these C

2432
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:03,779
values I know I'm gonna have a UV

2433
01:59:01,380 --> 01:59:06,779
somewhere here right that's the offset

2434
01:59:03,779 --> 01:59:09,960
and what I need to do is for each of

2435
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:13,079
these I have to produce that UV by

2436
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:15,630
figuring out what the actual equation

2437
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:19,519
would be and like I said what I want to

2438
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:22,140
do here is say I want one - clamp 0 1 of

2439
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:26,100
some equation in here which is going to

2440
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:29,280
be something like you know square u +

2441
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:31,260
square V and so what I might do is

2442
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:37,439
actually to make this easier on myself

2443
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:40,170
just do that okay and so each of these

2444
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:42,479
is literally just gonna be the exact

2445
01:59:40,170 --> 01:59:45,149
same equation just with different things

2446
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:48,059
put in here then we're gonna have to

2447
01:59:45,149 --> 01:59:51,089
make a denominator right out of these

2448
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:54,660
which is literally just gonna be like C

2449
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:56,970
0 0 + C 0 1 plus C 1 0 plus C 1 1 right

2450
01:59:54,659 --> 01:59:58,500
and we're just gonna invert that and we

2451
01:59:56,970 --> 02:00:00,780
know that unless we really screw

2452
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:03,539
something up it can't ever be anything

2453
02:00:00,779 --> 02:00:07,170
other than a nonzero like this has to be

2454
02:00:03,539 --> 02:00:09,210
a number that's either like that's close

2455
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:12,359
to 1 right it's it's never going to be 0

2456
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:19,590
so then we just have to multiply each of

2457
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:25,259
these like so and then we can do our

2458
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:27,060
like conservative interpolation now we

2459
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:28,829
don't have to normalize them to 1 we

2460
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:30,330
could let the powers range and we'll

2461
02:00:28,829 --> 02:00:31,890
take a look at what that looks like

2462
02:00:30,329 --> 02:00:33,149
right we could try just turning that off

2463
02:00:31,890 --> 02:00:34,920
and see what the interpolation looks

2464
02:00:33,149 --> 02:00:36,739
like that way if it's not conservative

2465
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,180
it's not conservative right we don't

2466
02:00:36,739 --> 02:00:39,829
have to make it be concerted but I'm

2467
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:41,720
assuming that will get worse results if

2468
02:00:39,829 --> 02:00:43,789
it's not but we'll see right and

2469
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:45,530
furthermore we could conserve it in

2470
02:00:43,789 --> 02:00:46,909
other ways like there's other things we

2471
02:00:45,529 --> 02:00:47,869
could do to those equations so we have

2472
02:00:46,909 --> 02:00:50,329
to play around with it

2473
02:00:47,869 --> 02:00:52,039
so for each of these if we assume that

2474
02:00:50,329 --> 02:00:55,189
the first value is U and the second

2475
02:00:52,039 --> 02:00:58,880
value is V right then in this case the U

2476
02:00:55,189 --> 02:01:01,219
is going to be one minus U and in these

2477
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,859
cases is going to be one minus V right

2478
02:01:01,220 --> 02:01:05,240
but that's it so that's the entirety of

2479
02:01:03,859 --> 02:01:08,029
what we're doing we're just taking the

2480
02:01:05,239 --> 02:01:09,710
clamp of the squares like so and

2481
02:01:08,029 --> 02:01:11,119
producing those blend values so that's

2482
02:01:09,710 --> 02:01:14,659
just like a radial fall off on this

2483
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:17,119
thing now what we need to do is say okay

2484
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:18,889
after we do the radial fall off on it we

2485
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:21,800
need to actually have something to blend

2486
02:01:18,890 --> 02:01:24,650
here so we need like the basis UV and

2487
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:26,449
then we need the like offsets towards

2488
02:01:24,649 --> 02:01:29,329
the other values that we're actually

2489
02:01:26,449 --> 02:01:31,760
sampling so we need to figure out how to

2490
02:01:29,329 --> 02:01:33,289
sample this thing and in order to do

2491
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:36,710
that we're gonna have to use that

2492
02:01:33,289 --> 02:01:40,970
textile fetch function so if we go and

2493
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:43,250
look at here what we want to do is this

2494
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:45,230
textile fetch so we want the one that's

2495
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:47,960
going to take a 2d sampler and a 2d

2496
02:01:45,229 --> 02:01:51,739
point right and the LOD is always zero

2497
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:55,039
we're not doing mipmapping here so we

2498
02:01:51,739 --> 02:01:57,829
want to do a textile fetch call we want

2499
02:01:55,039 --> 02:01:59,569
to pass it the light that we're actually

2500
02:01:57,829 --> 02:02:00,949
talking about so light color sampler

2501
02:01:59,569 --> 02:02:03,079
that the map that we're actually talking

2502
02:02:00,949 --> 02:02:04,970
about we're going to take the I've Ekta

2503
02:02:03,079 --> 02:02:07,309
we want a sample into and that's just

2504
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:09,260
going to be like our UV that's our

2505
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:11,870
literal I've X so this is our this is

2506
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:14,480
our UV I guess what we should call this

2507
02:02:11,869 --> 02:02:17,720
is our UV I like our integer version of

2508
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:19,789
this right and then for each of these

2509
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:23,060
it's really straightforward because

2510
02:02:19,789 --> 02:02:26,149
we're just passing in for each one of

2511
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:28,190
these we want and do we have a v3 you I

2512
02:02:26,149 --> 02:02:32,989
don't know what we've got here are v3 s

2513
02:02:28,189 --> 02:02:34,549
I don't see that in here so I'm assuming

2514
02:02:32,989 --> 02:02:37,219
we have to actually use an I've ech

2515
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:38,930
three so for I Vic three I'm just gonna

2516
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:40,670
say like we've got that four eyevac

2517
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:43,640
three and five ik 2 I'm just gonna say

2518
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:50,390
that that's like v2 s is an i vac to

2519
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:56,260
write NV 3 s is an eye Veck 3

2520
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:56,260
you know I'm saying and the same here

2521
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:08,210
and that will just let me notate it the

2522
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:10,489
way we're used to outside and handmade

2523
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:13,569
hero instead of having to adapt to open

2524
02:03:10,489 --> 02:03:16,519
jails like nama clay Chur for no reason

2525
02:03:13,569 --> 02:03:18,920
so if I want to I can just say all right

2526
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:21,470
so we've got an offset here that we're

2527
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:23,600
going to apply actually guess it's a 2 s

2528
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:27,320
in this case because we want to do a 2 D

2529
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:28,670
sample I want to do this one right so I

2530
02:03:27,319 --> 02:03:31,670
want to take whatever the base is and

2531
02:03:28,670 --> 02:03:40,399
here I'm saying that I'm going to do a V

2532
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:47,359
offset carillon do you offset and here I

2533
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:49,519
want to do both so that's fundamentally

2534
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:54,739
what I'm doing here my U and V I know

2535
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:56,990
that I've got effectively a a UV that

2536
02:03:54,739 --> 02:04:00,529
I'm trying to sample right what I need

2537
02:03:56,989 --> 02:04:05,500
to do is find out how far away I am in

2538
02:04:00,529 --> 02:04:07,909
sort of the the textile space right I

2539
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:11,000
suppose this was possibly a bad name

2540
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:15,949
what I want to probably do is like Texel

2541
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:17,210
right or something like that so I

2542
02:04:15,949 --> 02:04:19,189
suppose what I want is something more

2543
02:04:17,210 --> 02:04:22,369
like that and in order to get a correct

2544
02:04:19,189 --> 02:04:26,750
answer here what I want is like t minus

2545
02:04:22,369 --> 02:04:33,170
T I like whatever my actual value was so

2546
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:35,619
I want to basically up convert this to

2547
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:40,340
an f32

2548
02:04:35,619 --> 02:04:42,260
and subtract so when I have the actual

2549
02:04:40,340 --> 02:04:44,900
integer location that I'm sampling at I

2550
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:49,070
want to subtract away however far away I

2551
02:04:44,899 --> 02:04:50,389
am from that integer location right so

2552
02:04:49,069 --> 02:04:53,449
this is the way that I would do this

2553
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:55,250
blending and in order to figure out what

2554
02:04:53,449 --> 02:04:58,189
the heck is going on here right because

2555
02:04:55,250 --> 02:05:00,199
we've got so much happening in here I

2556
02:04:58,189 --> 02:05:02,569
don't think that I could do and maybe

2557
02:05:00,199 --> 02:05:04,158
we'll do is just try to duplicate

2558
02:05:02,569 --> 02:05:07,670
everything first

2559
02:05:04,158 --> 02:05:13,460
so if I inside here said you know don't

2560
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:15,380
do that let me try to just produce the

2561
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:17,810
linear interpolation values first then

2562
02:05:15,380 --> 02:05:20,020
what I could do is actually have each of

2563
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:20,020
these

2564
02:05:22,908 --> 02:05:26,960
I could have each of these be the linear

2565
02:05:25,219 --> 02:05:28,550
interpolation value that it should be

2566
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:30,198
and I should be able to try I should I

2567
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:32,810
should figure out how to match open

2568
02:05:30,198 --> 02:05:37,039
jails result first right so in other

2569
02:05:32,810 --> 02:05:41,060
words when I have this set to 0 and I

2570
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:42,920
can pile right unless I have an a bug I

2571
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:46,010
should get I mean what I'm looking at

2572
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:48,139
here right I should get this and so I

2573
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:49,909
should be able to swap between these two

2574
02:05:48,139 --> 02:05:51,800
and if I produce the correctly

2575
02:05:49,908 --> 02:05:53,658
interpolation values I should get the

2576
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:56,779
exact same result so what I want to do

2577
02:05:53,658 --> 02:05:58,908
is make sure I can match OpenGL first so

2578
02:05:56,779 --> 02:06:00,649
that I know I'm not screwing this up and

2579
02:05:58,908 --> 02:06:01,960
then we can look at changing the

2580
02:06:00,649 --> 02:06:07,759
coefficients to see if they produce

2581
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:10,698
anything that's more satisfying right ok

2582
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:13,460
so if we then think about what these

2583
02:06:10,698 --> 02:06:16,250
values would have to be so we

2584
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:19,730
essentially have an interpolation across

2585
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:21,340
you and across V and so we know that

2586
02:06:19,729 --> 02:06:24,229
each of these is just going to be a

2587
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:27,920
multiplier of those two values right so

2588
02:06:24,229 --> 02:06:30,799
for C 0 0 it's just gonna be like 1

2589
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:34,908
minus u times 1 minus V right because if

2590
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:37,429
I met u 0 V 0 I'm just at you know my

2591
02:06:34,908 --> 02:06:43,279
current location and as I move away I'm

2592
02:06:37,429 --> 02:06:47,300
going to lose contribution in both U and

2593
02:06:43,279 --> 02:06:49,250
V linearly right so the same would be

2594
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:50,570
true here except the V is going the

2595
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:52,399
other direction the same would be true

2596
02:06:50,569 --> 02:06:56,090
here except the U is going the other

2597
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:58,399
direction and then in this case neither

2598
02:06:56,090 --> 02:07:00,440
are going right so it's it's both it's a

2599
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:03,738
different direction both of them so I

2600
02:07:00,439 --> 02:07:08,149
think that would be the correct way to

2601
02:07:03,738 --> 02:07:09,769
do the the blends on these and let's

2602
02:07:08,149 --> 02:07:11,920
just double check really quick to make

2603
02:07:09,770 --> 02:07:11,920
sure

2604
02:07:16,750 --> 02:07:21,560
so if you think about how this blend is

2605
02:07:19,130 --> 02:07:23,960
gonna work you know exactly how bilinear

2606
02:07:21,560 --> 02:07:26,000
blend works if i'm bilinear in-between

2607
02:07:23,960 --> 02:07:30,800
these and we're saying that this is t 0

2608
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:34,340
0 this is T 0 1 this is T 1 1 and this

2609
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:37,130
is T 1 0 so if these are my points and I

2610
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:39,409
assume that V is going this way and U is

2611
02:07:37,130 --> 02:07:42,050
going that way for my two parameters

2612
02:07:39,408 --> 02:07:44,359
that I'm blending all I need to do is

2613
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:45,980
say all right what are the bilinear

2614
02:07:44,359 --> 02:07:47,929
points that I'm first going to do let's

2615
02:07:45,979 --> 02:07:49,939
say along U so if I want to produce

2616
02:07:47,929 --> 02:07:54,440
these two points and we'll call these

2617
02:07:49,939 --> 02:07:58,250
two points T 1 and T 0 so what would T 0

2618
02:07:54,439 --> 02:08:05,238
be well T 0 is going to be 1 minus u

2619
02:07:58,250 --> 02:08:07,488
times T 0 0 plus u times T 1 0 right and

2620
02:08:05,238 --> 02:08:10,399
similarly T 1 is going to be the exact

2621
02:08:07,488 --> 02:08:14,209
same thing 1 minus u times T but now

2622
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:16,039
instead it's going to have this value is

2623
02:08:14,210 --> 02:08:19,010
going to be the upper Y right so instead

2624
02:08:16,039 --> 02:08:21,769
of 0 0 it's going to be 0 1 instead of 1

2625
02:08:19,010 --> 02:08:24,260
0 it's going to be 1 1 right so those

2626
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:26,510
are my two values here and then I need

2627
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:29,060
to blend these two together right using

2628
02:08:26,510 --> 02:08:32,929
V so then my final equation for my

2629
02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:42,980
texture sample in this case is going to

2630
02:08:32,929 --> 02:08:47,090
be 1 minus V times my 2 0 plus V times

2631
02:08:42,979 --> 02:08:49,729
my t 1 right and if I now go and look at

2632
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:51,739
what this multiplies out to be I can

2633
02:08:49,729 --> 02:08:53,629
just substitute these two values into

2634
02:08:51,738 --> 02:08:57,439
here and see what my terms end up being

2635
02:08:53,630 --> 02:09:00,859
right so if I take T equals 1 minus V

2636
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:05,198
right and here's my T 0 it's that so

2637
02:09:00,859 --> 02:09:12,679
I've got a big friend 1 minus u T 0 0

2638
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:14,809
plus u 2 u 1 0 right and then I add

2639
02:09:12,679 --> 02:09:23,029
again now we've got a V multiplying in

2640
02:09:14,810 --> 02:09:26,929
here big paren 1 minus u T 0 1 plus u T

2641
02:09:23,029 --> 02:09:27,859
1 1 right so if I see now what I get my

2642
02:09:26,929 --> 02:09:29,090
terms to be you can

2643
02:09:27,859 --> 02:09:31,039
see that they're all lined up nicely

2644
02:09:29,090 --> 02:09:32,810
like they each have just a distinct

2645
02:09:31,039 --> 02:09:34,850
location I'd have to combine any terms

2646
02:09:32,810 --> 02:09:36,440
here so if I want to know what

2647
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:38,000
multiplies t00

2648
02:09:36,439 --> 02:09:44,479
well all I have to do is just finish the

2649
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:52,579
distribution 1 minus V 1 minus u t 0 0 1

2650
02:09:44,479 --> 02:09:54,649
minus V u T 1 0 V 1 minus u T 0 1 v u T

2651
02:09:52,579 --> 02:09:58,640
1 1 and hey that's exactly what I wrote

2652
02:09:54,649 --> 02:10:02,210
down right so T's 0 0 in this case is 1

2653
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:06,410
minus u 1 minus V exactly what I have 1

2654
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:10,460
0 in this case is u times 1 minus V

2655
02:10:06,409 --> 02:10:13,309
exactly what I've got T 0 1 in this case

2656
02:10:10,460 --> 02:10:15,770
which is this 1 1 minus u times V that's

2657
02:10:13,310 --> 02:10:16,960
what I've got and then UV which is what

2658
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:22,100
I've got

2659
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:24,380
so again just making sure nothing funny

2660
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:27,800
is going on there this is what I respect

2661
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:30,949
the result to be and so now if I enter

2662
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:33,739
this path in what I need to produce is

2663
02:10:30,949 --> 02:10:36,649
the actual input values right so I'm

2664
02:10:33,739 --> 02:10:38,929
going to need my T value I need that to

2665
02:10:36,649 --> 02:10:43,159
be equal to something right and then I

2666
02:10:38,930 --> 02:10:46,010
need and then I need my s my integer

2667
02:10:43,159 --> 02:10:49,309
version of that to be produced somehow

2668
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:51,530
right so this is my actual Texel index

2669
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:53,750
which it you know involves actually

2670
02:10:51,529 --> 02:10:55,189
knowing the size of the map and

2671
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:58,609
fortunately I think I can get that

2672
02:10:55,189 --> 02:11:00,979
without actually having to know what it

2673
02:10:58,609 --> 02:11:02,869
is although I think this actually tells

2674
02:11:00,979 --> 02:11:04,849
me some of that information right

2675
02:11:02,869 --> 02:11:05,960
because I could actually compute the

2676
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:07,520
total size of the map so I guess I don't

2677
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:13,060
need to look it up but hey it actually

2678
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:16,610
it happens to be in here anyway but yeah

2679
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:20,270
um so anyway if I want to actually

2680
02:11:16,609 --> 02:11:22,309
produce these these values here if I'm

2681
02:11:20,270 --> 02:11:24,710
trying to look at where I was going to

2682
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:26,900
look up you can see that this here was

2683
02:11:24,710 --> 02:11:29,270
the UV that I actually was going to use

2684
02:11:26,899 --> 02:11:32,929
so in theory I should be able to really

2685
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:35,270
just do see UV x this exercise should

2686
02:11:32,930 --> 02:11:38,360
give me that right so actually I could

2687
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:40,750
just use this directly and produce that

2688
02:11:38,359 --> 02:11:40,750
value

2689
02:11:40,979 --> 02:11:45,779
out of hand right so I should be able to

2690
02:11:43,170 --> 02:11:50,550
say look it's the v2 of the texture size

2691
02:11:45,779 --> 02:11:52,229
of the light color sampler right and the

2692
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:53,940
LOD level of level zero

2693
02:11:52,229 --> 02:11:55,349
that should just give me what I want

2694
02:11:53,939 --> 02:11:58,639
also these textile fetchers I guess need

2695
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:58,640
law at level zero in there as well right

2696
02:12:00,569 --> 02:12:05,460
so if I just produce that that should in

2697
02:12:03,210 --> 02:12:07,170
theory be my T value and then this would

2698
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:09,510
just presumably believe the floor of T

2699
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:11,190
right because I'm assuming that's what

2700
02:12:09,510 --> 02:12:12,810
the graphics card is going to do I mean

2701
02:12:11,189 --> 02:12:14,909
right it's just going to multiply out by

2702
02:12:12,810 --> 02:12:16,200
the size then it's going to floor it and

2703
02:12:14,909 --> 02:12:18,779
it's going to use that as its

2704
02:12:16,199 --> 02:12:20,399
interpolator so let's debug that and we

2705
02:12:18,779 --> 02:12:23,069
may have some errors in the shader now

2706
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:24,779
so we may have to feel that yeah we may

2707
02:12:23,069 --> 02:12:26,009
have to field filled some fragment

2708
02:12:24,779 --> 02:12:28,920
errors you can see we've got some

2709
02:12:26,010 --> 02:12:33,780
implicit cast errors here from vector to

2710
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:36,300
avec - right and so I'm not sure what

2711
02:12:33,779 --> 02:12:38,639
exactly we're getting as a problem there

2712
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:39,949
so it could be the floor function is

2713
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:42,750
creating a problem for us they're

2714
02:12:39,949 --> 02:12:44,849
looking at the texture size here I'm

2715
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:47,369
assuming that's okay the sample - like

2716
02:12:44,850 --> 02:12:49,230
these are all continuous so I guess we

2717
02:12:47,369 --> 02:12:51,238
at the very least this is probably not

2718
02:12:49,229 --> 02:12:53,699
good so when we do this floor function

2719
02:12:51,238 --> 02:12:58,829
we probably have to then convert it to a

2720
02:12:53,699 --> 02:13:00,809
v2s I'm guessing but I'm not sure then

2721
02:12:58,829 --> 02:13:03,569
also you know what these are all

2722
02:13:00,810 --> 02:13:04,950
incorrect as well I guess so that's

2723
02:13:03,569 --> 02:13:07,859
probably where that's coming from -

2724
02:13:04,949 --> 02:13:09,750
these are producing for wide and I only

2725
02:13:07,859 --> 02:13:13,109
want three wide so that's also an issue

2726
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:16,109
so let's go ahead and and stop the

2727
02:13:13,109 --> 02:13:18,059
program here for a second do a quick

2728
02:13:16,109 --> 02:13:21,750
recompile and see where we're at now for

2729
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:23,130
errors so we have sample RGB s and C 11

2730
02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:28,800
so it looks like I just accidentally

2731
02:13:23,130 --> 02:13:31,710
capitalized the C value there so fix

2732
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,420
that and then the sample RGB we don't

2733
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:36,810
really need that that was a waste of

2734
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:38,239
everyone's time off we go so now I think

2735
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:43,620
we're okay here

2736
02:13:38,238 --> 02:13:47,909
not 100% sure let's let's let's see if

2737
02:13:43,619 --> 02:13:51,930
this has any any love for us

2738
02:13:47,909 --> 02:13:53,220
it does so if I hop over to the same

2739
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:58,409
area that we were in before which is

2740
02:13:53,220 --> 02:14:01,110
which is up here in the large room just

2741
02:13:58,409 --> 02:14:02,220
we can see a little bit better and I

2742
02:14:01,109 --> 02:14:04,859
think I was kind of hanging out in the

2743
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:06,930
middle of the large room so if we look

2744
02:14:04,859 --> 02:14:08,789
at that interpolation you know is it

2745
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:10,770
exactly the same as open jails I'm not

2746
02:14:08,789 --> 02:14:12,989
sure let's take it let's let's flip it

2747
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:16,200
but it looks it looks closed right like

2748
02:14:12,989 --> 02:14:18,750
we're not totally screwed so let's see

2749
02:14:16,199 --> 02:14:20,639
what open jail does so it looks like

2750
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:21,960
we're sampling like it looks like we're

2751
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:24,300
just sampling a little bit slightly

2752
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:26,640
wrong like it looks like maybe we've got

2753
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:28,350
a 0.5 somewhere we shouldn't so maybe

2754
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:31,230
maybe we're just a little bit off in

2755
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:42,420
terms of how we're interpreting these

2756
02:14:31,229 --> 02:14:48,479
values here I'm not sure trying to think

2757
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:51,510
of what would be causing that problem so

2758
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:54,389
if it's going to do a floor function on

2759
02:14:51,510 --> 02:14:56,430
the value it probably does have a point

2760
02:14:54,390 --> 02:15:00,360
5 offset in it because it's going to

2761
02:14:56,430 --> 02:15:04,280
need to take for the edge so at 0 0 it

2762
02:15:00,359 --> 02:15:06,839
needs to actually be sampling to that

2763
02:15:04,279 --> 02:15:10,590
value for the entire way so I think it

2764
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:13,250
probably wants to actually look like

2765
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:13,250
points

2766
02:15:19,479 --> 02:15:24,799
let me just throw this out I think it

2767
02:15:23,149 --> 02:15:26,960
wants to look point five back let me

2768
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:30,650
explain what I mean by that so if you

2769
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:33,800
take a look at the grid right oops

2770
02:15:30,649 --> 02:15:36,859
so let's suppose this was our texels you

2771
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:39,500
know what I mean so if this is actually

2772
02:15:36,859 --> 02:15:40,698
Texel zero zero or you know what let's

2773
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:44,420
make sure we're the right way around if

2774
02:15:40,698 --> 02:15:47,868
this is Texel zero 0 so u goes v goes

2775
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:50,118
that way u goes that way so if this

2776
02:15:47,868 --> 02:15:52,158
right here we're Texel zero zero then

2777
02:15:50,118 --> 02:15:54,170
actually the bilinear wants to start

2778
02:15:52,158 --> 02:15:58,339
here right because it's actually i

2779
02:15:54,170 --> 02:16:00,980
believe it it does centers OpenGL x'

2780
02:15:58,340 --> 02:16:03,679
Texel ideas are not my favorite

2781
02:16:00,979 --> 02:16:05,419
sometimes so i'll say that but i believe

2782
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:07,520
this is how it does it so right or wrong

2783
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:09,319
this is how it's gonna do it and that

2784
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:11,270
means that if you were sampling like

2785
02:16:09,319 --> 02:16:13,729
right here you want to start with this

2786
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:15,469
one but also if even if you're sampling

2787
02:16:13,729 --> 02:16:16,729
all the way up here but we would start

2788
02:16:15,469 --> 02:16:18,889
with that one so I think what we

2789
02:16:16,729 --> 02:16:22,819
actually want to do is subtract that

2790
02:16:18,889 --> 02:16:25,639
point five point five to drop us down to

2791
02:16:22,819 --> 02:16:27,828
the previous one so I think we actually

2792
02:16:25,639 --> 02:16:31,819
want here where we do this I think we

2793
02:16:27,828 --> 02:16:37,218
want a drop here so that we actually

2794
02:16:31,819 --> 02:16:45,049
move back by a half a pixel and well I

2795
02:16:37,218 --> 02:16:46,909
guess no that's correct and I guess this

2796
02:16:45,049 --> 02:16:49,218
wants to be in there right it's it's not

2797
02:16:46,909 --> 02:16:53,269
part of the other branch so if we take a

2798
02:16:49,218 --> 02:16:55,159
look now back at the game let's see what

2799
02:16:53,269 --> 02:16:58,880
the difference is now with that half

2800
02:16:55,159 --> 02:17:02,090
pixel sample so looking at it here this

2801
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:04,098
is the OpenGL when we're looking at now

2802
02:17:02,090 --> 02:17:08,179
we're gonna switch to ours and see what

2803
02:17:04,099 --> 02:17:12,228
the difference is there and that looks

2804
02:17:08,179 --> 02:17:16,030
exactly the same to me right like I

2805
02:17:12,228 --> 02:17:16,029
don't see a difference there so

2806
02:17:16,489 --> 02:17:23,299
I mean it doesn't I can't even tell when

2807
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:25,969
it changes

2808
02:17:23,299 --> 02:17:28,340
that's how exact that appears to be so

2809
02:17:25,968 --> 02:17:32,829
I'm going to call that good enough for

2810
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:36,170
government work or stripe debugging and

2811
02:17:32,829 --> 02:17:37,670
we're just going to like now see what

2812
02:17:36,170 --> 02:17:39,500
happens if we change those interpolation

2813
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:41,388
parameters so here is us playing with

2814
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:44,510
the interpolation parameters just really

2815
02:17:41,388 --> 02:17:47,598
nilly right and now we got to change

2816
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:55,420
what's this oh right

2817
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:58,389
sorry about that no stop

2818
02:17:55,420 --> 02:18:01,069
all right so in here we've got these

2819
02:17:58,388 --> 02:18:02,509
duplicative depth we've got these

2820
02:18:01,069 --> 02:18:04,039
duplicated declarations because this was

2821
02:18:02,510 --> 02:18:05,659
supposed to be an else and we didn't

2822
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:09,010
actually put an else in there so we

2823
02:18:05,659 --> 02:18:09,010
actually need that right

2824
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:24,179
all right and so what you can see is it

2825
02:18:22,318 --> 02:18:31,648
did exactly exactly what I wanted right

2826
02:18:24,179 --> 02:18:33,840
um excuse me so I was looking for a

2827
02:18:31,648 --> 02:18:34,670
radial I wanted a puffy fallout right

2828
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:38,010
that's what I said

2829
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:39,719
puffy fall-off and that's what I did

2830
02:18:38,010 --> 02:18:42,478
like I put in a radial fall-off and I

2831
02:18:39,718 --> 02:18:44,068
got a radial fall-off right so you can

2832
02:18:42,478 --> 02:18:46,318
see the difference very clearly like

2833
02:18:44,068 --> 02:18:48,568
right now you it looks more like a light

2834
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:51,750
kind of a fall-off and if I go in here

2835
02:18:48,568 --> 02:18:55,500
and I change it back to using the OpenGL

2836
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:58,488
default version which is this you can

2837
02:18:55,500 --> 02:19:02,189
see that it gets that line again right

2838
02:18:58,488 --> 02:19:04,019
so there's the line now I don't know

2839
02:19:02,189 --> 02:19:05,908
which one of those is better like I said

2840
02:19:04,019 --> 02:19:08,728
but it was an experiment I wanted to run

2841
02:19:05,908 --> 02:19:11,118
so what I want to do now is go back to

2842
02:19:08,728 --> 02:19:13,260
the previous way we were sampling these

2843
02:19:11,119 --> 02:19:15,269
just to see and you could see like

2844
02:19:13,260 --> 02:19:17,639
actually I guess I don't like that right

2845
02:19:15,269 --> 02:19:21,029
because that still looks nasty in there

2846
02:19:17,638 --> 02:19:22,679
right as those things overlap so when I

2847
02:19:21,029 --> 02:19:24,359
actually put real lighting values in

2848
02:19:22,679 --> 02:19:26,638
here quote-unquote real lighting values

2849
02:19:24,359 --> 02:19:28,738
I don't know what I'm going to find but

2850
02:19:26,638 --> 02:19:33,868
I want to know so I'm gonna try turning

2851
02:19:28,738 --> 02:19:36,148
off the sort of structured art that I

2852
02:19:33,869 --> 02:19:38,250
put in there just to see what happens if

2853
02:19:36,148 --> 02:19:42,090
we take a look at the the interpolation

2854
02:19:38,250 --> 02:19:46,189
here so if I now go back to the original

2855
02:19:42,090 --> 02:19:50,068
and I just turn off the structured art

2856
02:19:46,189 --> 02:19:52,619
in the textile sampling so now it's

2857
02:19:50,068 --> 02:19:55,648
actually filling in real values so here

2858
02:19:52,619 --> 02:19:58,250
are those lights what you can see is

2859
02:19:55,648 --> 02:20:02,939
that you know you still perceive them

2860
02:19:58,250 --> 02:20:04,799
but I guess I might say I do already

2861
02:20:02,939 --> 02:20:08,250
kind of like that interpolation a little

2862
02:20:04,799 --> 02:20:10,318
bit better right we might be able to do

2863
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:12,658
better than that even better than that

2864
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:15,148
by thinking about that interpolation a

2865
02:20:12,658 --> 02:20:16,978
little bit more but if I now go in and

2866
02:20:15,148 --> 02:20:20,818
change my OpenGL

2867
02:20:16,978 --> 02:20:25,408
side of things back to linear right so

2868
02:20:20,818 --> 02:20:28,789
in here where we were doing our light I

2869
02:20:25,408 --> 02:20:28,789
don't remember what we called that

2870
02:20:29,729 --> 02:20:34,159
it's like light filtering or something

2871
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:45,420
where did that filter go oh it's already

2872
02:20:43,681 --> 02:20:48,149
set to linear never mind what I mean is

2873
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:51,090
in the shader I should stop clamping the

2874
02:20:48,149 --> 02:20:54,149
thing so I was in the right place I

2875
02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:56,250
don't know why I left so in the shader

2876
02:20:54,149 --> 02:20:57,719
if I stop clamping so if I turn this off

2877
02:20:56,250 --> 02:21:02,129
here so we're actually interpolating

2878
02:20:57,719 --> 02:21:06,060
mm-hmm across the voxels now this is

2879
02:21:02,129 --> 02:21:08,399
what we would get right and yeah like

2880
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:11,789
again I don't know I think I would

2881
02:21:08,399 --> 02:21:13,260
probably say two things one I'm really

2882
02:21:11,790 --> 02:21:15,780
glad we spent the time to look into it

2883
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:17,670
because now we know exactly what's going

2884
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:22,260
on there it's the interpolation between

2885
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:25,860
neighboring octahedral samples that's

2886
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:27,479
producing that result and so we just

2887
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:29,851
need to be aware that there's a cost

2888
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:33,000
there and there's a quality issue there

2889
02:21:29,851 --> 02:21:34,950
potentially I do honestly think the

2890
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:38,549
puffy one makes it look more light like

2891
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:39,780
more like lighting so it may be that we

2892
02:21:38,549 --> 02:21:41,759
want something like that in there I'm

2893
02:21:39,780 --> 02:21:44,730
not willing to call it one way or the

2894
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:47,370
other just yet but I would say you know

2895
02:21:44,729 --> 02:21:49,680
it's something to consider so let's go

2896
02:21:47,370 --> 02:21:52,771
ahead and add in the full lighting now

2897
02:21:49,681 --> 02:21:57,630
so rather than just doing a direct let's

2898
02:21:52,771 --> 02:22:00,120
do the mod and I would say you know

2899
02:21:57,629 --> 02:22:01,739
we're in pretty good shape like we're

2900
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:03,840
starting to really have something here

2901
02:22:01,739 --> 02:22:05,069
right now we have a lot of work to do

2902
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:07,950
because now we got to put in our bounce

2903
02:22:05,069 --> 02:22:09,810
lighting right but I don't know I'm

2904
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:11,700
feeling pretty good about it there's a

2905
02:22:09,810 --> 02:22:14,219
few things I want to look at but I mean

2906
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:16,409
it's it's looking sweet right I mean I'm

2907
02:22:14,219 --> 02:22:19,549
pretty happy with where we're at all

2908
02:22:16,409 --> 02:22:19,549
right so let's go to a brief QA

2909
02:22:23,069 --> 02:22:29,760
how do I make that happen there we go so

2910
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:31,909
let's go to a brief Q&amp;A I'm pretty happy

2911
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:31,909
with that

2912
02:22:49,409 --> 02:22:54,750
ah so deaf signer wants to know why is

2913
02:22:53,189 --> 02:22:57,239
the lighting behind the character so

2914
02:22:54,750 --> 02:23:00,120
dark so the reason for that is because

2915
02:22:57,239 --> 02:23:01,799
right now and this is somewhat

2916
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:06,540
intentional because we're trying to test

2917
02:23:01,799 --> 02:23:09,779
right now we are doing specular only so

2918
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:12,270
actually what you're seeing here is only

2919
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:15,479
light that bounces and then hits the

2920
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:18,030
light source right now we can do a

2921
02:23:15,478 --> 02:23:20,909
diffuse lighting sample as well and we

2922
02:23:18,030 --> 02:23:23,220
probably will want to going forwards but

2923
02:23:20,909 --> 02:23:24,780
at the moment we're only sampling in

2924
02:23:23,219 --> 02:23:26,429
just that one direction and that's

2925
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:29,189
intentional because I want to be able to

2926
02:23:26,430 --> 02:23:31,530
see how this lighting is getting sampled

2927
02:23:29,189 --> 02:23:33,329
specifically if we were just doing the

2928
02:23:31,530 --> 02:23:35,550
diffuse sample it would be much harder

2929
02:23:33,329 --> 02:23:38,459
for us to kind of debug these octahedral

2930
02:23:35,549 --> 02:23:40,590
Maps because we'd be taking a sample a

2931
02:23:38,459 --> 02:23:43,079
very blurry sample from kind of a much

2932
02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:45,329
wider part of the map you know what I

2933
02:23:43,079 --> 02:23:48,680
mean and we would be hard to find bugs

2934
02:23:45,329 --> 02:23:48,680
does that make sense

2935
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:11,990
for a look at des most decimals

2936
02:24:06,829 --> 02:24:27,590
calculator okay we can take it we can

2937
02:24:11,989 --> 02:24:39,860
take a look at that huh second so / - ye

2938
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:41,389
x Oh y ZD k 5 so someone has built an

2939
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:41,989
instructional one for us which thank you

2940
02:24:41,389 --> 02:24:43,219
very much

2941
02:24:41,989 --> 02:24:44,659
you can assign and use functions

2942
02:24:43,219 --> 02:24:46,849
throughout the graph the clamp function

2943
02:24:44,659 --> 02:24:51,260
uses conditional true/false okay so

2944
02:24:46,850 --> 02:24:54,229
basically curly braces are a way of

2945
02:24:51,260 --> 02:24:57,020
producing two different things depending

2946
02:24:54,229 --> 02:24:59,420
on a condition I guess so if it's less

2947
02:24:57,020 --> 02:25:02,630
than zero but zero if it's greater than

2948
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:04,670
one put one if it's if it's neither of

2949
02:25:02,629 --> 02:25:07,670
those two things I guess put you right

2950
02:25:04,670 --> 02:25:11,379
so it's if if if if and then the final

2951
02:25:07,670 --> 02:25:11,379
one is just the catch-all I'm guessing

2952
02:25:11,559 --> 02:25:21,850
so as far as oh yeah that's great yeah

2953
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,180
that's cool

2954
02:25:28,049 --> 02:25:35,739
yeah that's great so perfect I mean

2955
02:25:32,610 --> 02:25:37,780
right exactly what we wanted to see so

2956
02:25:35,739 --> 02:25:39,789
okay so I get it now I'll do that and

2957
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:43,920
then once I define that function I guess

2958
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:48,250
I can use it anywhere I want is the idea

2959
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:51,879
yeah so that's pretty cool okay so I'm

2960
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:53,079
gonna leave I'm gonna put this here so

2961
02:25:51,879 --> 02:25:55,859
the next time I try to do this I'll

2962
02:25:53,079 --> 02:26:13,299
refer back to this I can I rename this

2963
02:25:55,860 --> 02:26:15,010
probably so that way I can just click on

2964
02:26:13,299 --> 02:26:16,869
this and look at this again and remind

2965
02:26:15,010 --> 02:26:18,069
myself so I can create those functions a

2966
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:20,431
little more easily so thanks for sending

2967
02:26:18,069 --> 02:26:20,431
that in

2968
02:26:27,979 --> 02:26:32,719
Cynthia sass how fast this lighting

2969
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:35,190
method was if we compiled in debug mode

2970
02:26:32,719 --> 02:26:39,299
probably not very fast but you have to

2971
02:26:35,190 --> 02:26:41,579
remember that we the code is really bad

2972
02:26:39,299 --> 02:26:43,859
right now we're doing a lot of things we

2973
02:26:41,579 --> 02:26:45,989
don't need to do so actually I don't

2974
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:49,230
think this code is gonna be that bad

2975
02:26:45,989 --> 02:26:50,819
once we actually streamline it so I

2976
02:26:49,229 --> 02:26:52,289
think it will be fairly fast in debug

2977
02:26:50,819 --> 02:26:54,529
mode but at the moment it's not going to

2978
02:26:52,290 --> 02:26:54,530
be great

2979
02:26:55,459 --> 02:26:59,009
Jesse Mayer says I have to say that your

2980
02:26:57,569 --> 02:27:00,389
debug videos are often more educational

2981
02:26:59,010 --> 02:27:01,979
than implementation heavy ones very

2982
02:27:00,389 --> 02:27:04,949
insightful into your process Thanks

2983
02:27:01,979 --> 02:27:07,170
yes well I'm really glad that it comes

2984
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:12,030
across because again I think the primary

2985
02:27:07,170 --> 02:27:16,379
thing that that you need to learn about

2986
02:27:12,030 --> 02:27:18,480
debugging is that tenacious miss what's

2987
02:27:16,379 --> 02:27:22,259
actually going on right and and it's so

2988
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:25,770
rare right now and and I'm kind of like

2989
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:28,680
I would say I'm fairly light on that

2990
02:27:25,771 --> 02:27:30,480
side of things actually like I'm about

2991
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:33,960
the minimum you would want to be in

2992
02:27:30,479 --> 02:27:37,170
terms of that tenacious Ness so like if

2993
02:27:33,959 --> 02:27:39,509
anything you should be more like what

2994
02:27:37,170 --> 02:27:43,469
you see on stream is the minimum you

2995
02:27:39,510 --> 02:27:45,510
should ever do right so if you're

2996
02:27:43,469 --> 02:27:46,770
actually a diligent programmer you

2997
02:27:45,510 --> 02:27:48,899
should actually probably going further

2998
02:27:46,771 --> 02:27:50,550
than I'm going most the time and that's

2999
02:27:48,899 --> 02:27:52,859
both because I'm more of a broad

3000
02:27:50,549 --> 02:27:54,779
spectrum programmer I don't actually

3001
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:56,880
tend to rathole on things for years

3002
02:27:54,780 --> 02:27:58,050
which you know some people might do like

3003
02:27:56,879 --> 02:28:00,119
they might be like I'm gonna work on

3004
02:27:58,049 --> 02:28:01,889
compression for five years right and

3005
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:04,220
that's great because they will come up

3006
02:28:01,889 --> 02:28:07,199
with really cool compression stuff right

3007
02:28:04,219 --> 02:28:11,099
but I tend to be more broad I I do more

3008
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:13,230
things less deep so there's that and

3009
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:15,479
also on stream it's limited I can't

3010
02:28:13,229 --> 02:28:16,920
spend 16 hours looking at something in a

3011
02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:18,779
row which is what I would normally do

3012
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:20,100
right like two days in a row 8 hours a

3013
02:28:18,780 --> 02:28:22,021
day or something looking at something I

3014
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:24,630
would do that I can't do that on stream

3015
02:28:22,021 --> 02:28:25,860
so I would say the minimum you know what

3016
02:28:24,629 --> 02:28:29,270
I'm doing a series a minimum of

3017
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:29,271
tenacious Ness I think you should apply

3018
02:28:37,209 --> 02:28:42,618
it's octahedral lighting the only way to

3019
02:28:39,738 --> 02:28:44,389
go for what you want I don't think it's

3020
02:28:42,619 --> 02:28:47,359
the only way to go it just seemed like

3021
02:28:44,389 --> 02:28:49,849
the best one I liked it a lot better

3022
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:53,029
than spherical harmonics as an option

3023
02:28:49,850 --> 02:28:54,408
for us we didn't really look at

3024
02:28:53,029 --> 02:28:55,790
spherical gaussians but I'm assuming I

3025
02:28:54,408 --> 02:28:59,658
would have similar complaints to

3026
02:28:55,790 --> 02:29:02,449
harmonics so no it's not the only way to

3027
02:28:59,658 --> 02:29:07,100
store lighting diffuse lighting over

3028
02:29:02,449 --> 02:29:09,859
time or in I shouldn't say diffuse only

3029
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:12,488
but inbound lighting lote there it's not

3030
02:29:09,859 --> 02:29:16,300
the only way to store low resolution

3031
02:29:12,488 --> 02:29:16,299
inbound lighting over time

3032
02:29:31,611 --> 02:29:35,940
once you take depth samples could you do

3033
02:29:34,140 --> 02:29:37,890
bounce lighting by fetching the depth

3034
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:39,331
sample and then moving that far down

3035
02:29:37,890 --> 02:29:44,040
than normal to speak directly to the

3036
02:29:39,331 --> 02:29:46,890
next voxel you certainly could do

3037
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:49,831
something with that if you wanted to but

3038
02:29:46,890 --> 02:29:51,990
in our case I don't think you ever need

3039
02:29:49,831 --> 02:29:56,091
to because the whole point is the bounce

3040
02:29:51,990 --> 02:30:01,229
lighting is getting rolled into an

3041
02:29:56,091 --> 02:30:03,511
actual into the actual probes right the

3042
02:30:01,229 --> 02:30:06,360
bounce lighting is going to happen in

3043
02:30:03,511 --> 02:30:08,161
the distribution phase the whole point

3044
02:30:06,361 --> 02:30:10,081
is we don't want to spend the time to do

3045
02:30:08,161 --> 02:30:12,931
bounce lighting inside the pixel shader

3046
02:30:10,081 --> 02:30:15,630
right because it's too expensive so

3047
02:30:12,931 --> 02:30:18,181
instead what we want to do is just have

3048
02:30:15,630 --> 02:30:20,070
the probes over time send the light

3049
02:30:18,181 --> 02:30:27,149
themselves around so that we get the

3050
02:30:20,070 --> 02:30:29,280
bounces that way right wait there's

3051
02:30:27,149 --> 02:30:31,850
something wrong with this no this still

3052
02:30:29,281 --> 02:30:31,851
looks right to me

3053
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:48,560
you're saying this is no longer this

3054
02:30:41,031 --> 02:30:50,091
isn't the right one I'm so confused

3055
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:51,831
it looks like the right one to me you're

3056
02:30:50,091 --> 02:30:54,820
saying it's not the right one so we

3057
02:30:51,831 --> 02:30:54,820
actually have to edit this bookmark

3058
02:30:55,421 --> 02:31:22,970
what should the bookmark actually be qm

3059
02:31:00,351 --> 02:31:25,361
e ph g c1 p5 that looks the same I think

3060
02:31:22,970 --> 02:31:25,360
it's fine

3061
02:31:27,780 --> 02:31:30,918
[Music]

3062
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,810
could you do a stream on wrasse

3063
02:31:37,101 --> 02:31:39,861
telemetry one day showing all the things

3064
02:31:38,810 --> 02:31:41,780
you can do with it I'm really interested

3065
02:31:39,861 --> 02:31:43,311
in the tool but the only good video

3066
02:31:41,781 --> 02:31:47,961
source on it is John blow but his dreams

3067
02:31:43,310 --> 02:31:50,240
aren't very twirly by nature yeah I mean

3068
02:31:47,960 --> 02:31:51,439
I guess the way to think about telemetry

3069
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:55,271
though is you don't really need me to do

3070
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:58,011
a demo it's just you know our profiler

3071
02:31:55,271 --> 02:31:59,271
where you can see all the threads and

3072
02:31:58,011 --> 02:32:00,711
you can click on the threads and see

3073
02:31:59,271 --> 02:32:02,230
what each threads doing and drill down

3074
02:32:00,710 --> 02:32:04,460
and do it and all that stuff

3075
02:32:02,229 --> 02:32:08,780
telemetry is just a professional version

3076
02:32:04,460 --> 02:32:14,680
of that I mean that's that's what it is

3077
02:32:08,781 --> 02:32:16,521
so basically like it's a standalone tool

3078
02:32:14,681 --> 02:32:18,351
so you don't have to integrate it into

3079
02:32:16,521 --> 02:32:21,501
your game like we are write it like we

3080
02:32:18,351 --> 02:32:24,081
did and then all you do is in your game

3081
02:32:21,501 --> 02:32:27,140
just like we have blocks you put in

3082
02:32:24,081 --> 02:32:28,729
blocks for telemetry and it will just

3083
02:32:27,140 --> 02:32:30,740
send them off to the tool and the tool

3084
02:32:28,729 --> 02:32:33,439
records them and saves them to a file

3085
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:34,911
and you can scrub around in them just

3086
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:39,471
like you can in our tool only with

3087
02:32:34,911 --> 02:32:40,851
better UI right and you can do a bunch

3088
02:32:39,470 --> 02:32:43,100
of things you would normally do on there

3089
02:32:40,851 --> 02:32:45,201
so like they've got more they'll capture

3090
02:32:43,101 --> 02:32:47,781
more inherent stuff like kernel thread

3091
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:50,330
switches or like they'll use event

3092
02:32:47,781 --> 02:32:53,351
profiling on Windows to like capture

3093
02:32:50,331 --> 02:32:55,960
extra stuff like GPU information

3094
02:32:53,351 --> 02:32:58,360
so just imagine like the professional

3095
02:32:55,959 --> 02:33:00,969
version of what we did that's what it is

3096
02:32:58,360 --> 02:33:03,790
so you know if you want to be able to

3097
02:33:00,969 --> 02:33:05,670
inspect the performance of your game or

3098
02:33:03,790 --> 02:33:07,990
whatever it doesn't have to be a game

3099
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:11,040
that it's just you just buy it and then

3100
02:33:07,989 --> 02:33:11,039
you're done right

3101
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:27,229
so Philip judo asks with the octahedral

3102
02:33:25,340 --> 02:33:29,180
map with the bilinear filtering and the

3103
02:33:27,228 --> 02:33:31,340
puffy filtering seem to have a pretty

3104
02:33:29,180 --> 02:33:32,630
quick fall-off between samples would you

3105
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:38,409
consider doing something like bicubic

3106
02:33:32,629 --> 02:33:42,139
filtering for a smoother blend um yes

3107
02:33:38,409 --> 02:33:44,779
the reason I wanted to not do a cubic

3108
02:33:42,139 --> 02:33:56,239
blend is because that involves taking

3109
02:33:44,779 --> 02:34:05,029
more samples right so what we could

3110
02:33:56,239 --> 02:34:07,329
probably do is take a like we could

3111
02:34:05,029 --> 02:34:14,060
probably try taking just three samples

3112
02:34:07,329 --> 02:34:17,239
you know what I mean so one way is to

3113
02:34:14,059 --> 02:34:21,590
expand it to five samples which would be

3114
02:34:17,239 --> 02:34:26,029
a lot that would be a 25 tap to the

3115
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:28,010
texture which seems nuts like I don't

3116
02:34:26,029 --> 02:34:33,620
think we're gonna get away with that per

3117
02:34:28,010 --> 02:34:34,700
pixel I mean maybe I don't know but

3118
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:36,380
another way we just need to expand it

3119
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:38,899
just a three so instead of a bilinear

3120
02:34:36,379 --> 02:34:41,059
filter there's just one more so we just

3121
02:34:38,898 --> 02:34:45,920
look on the opposite side as well and

3122
02:34:41,059 --> 02:34:50,439
fit the curve through those three that

3123
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:50,439
might work right

3124
02:34:52,771 --> 02:35:05,820
and I don't know but yeah look I said

3125
02:34:57,940 --> 02:35:05,819
what I wanted to know was what's the

3126
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:10,921
like basically I wanted to know what the

3127
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:17,261
what the artifact we were seeing was and

3128
02:35:13,831 --> 02:35:20,050
now I'm like 100% certain I know what it

3129
02:35:17,261 --> 02:35:20,381
is and that's good enough for me right

3130
02:35:20,050 --> 02:35:23,680
now

3131
02:35:20,380 --> 02:35:26,350
I do think we might want to spend more

3132
02:35:23,681 --> 02:35:29,591
time thinking about what we should do

3133
02:35:26,351 --> 02:35:31,569
about it right because that I'm not sure

3134
02:35:29,591 --> 02:35:33,310
about but now that I've played with it

3135
02:35:31,569 --> 02:35:35,949
and I tried putting in a replacement and

3136
02:35:33,310 --> 02:35:38,229
I saw it change as I expected it I'm

3137
02:35:35,950 --> 02:35:40,631
fairly confident that I'm not like

3138
02:35:38,229 --> 02:35:43,029
totally clueless about what's going on

3139
02:35:40,630 --> 02:35:45,581
whereas when we started today I was I

3140
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:47,320
just didn't you heard me say it I did

3141
02:35:45,581 --> 02:35:50,530
not feel like I understood what's going

3142
02:35:47,319 --> 02:35:53,110
on and I don't like that right I want to

3143
02:35:50,530 --> 02:35:55,780
know what the artifact is do we have a

3144
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:58,511
bug if we have a bug how bad is it if

3145
02:35:55,780 --> 02:36:01,931
it's not a bug is it something we could

3146
02:35:58,511 --> 02:36:04,030
improve anyway because maybe like in

3147
02:36:01,931 --> 02:36:06,131
this case it wasn't really a bug as far

3148
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:08,801
as I can tell right it was actually

3149
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:10,751
operating properly but it's still not

3150
02:36:08,800 --> 02:36:12,581
great and now that we know what it is we

3151
02:36:10,751 --> 02:36:13,331
can ameliorate it I think we did some

3152
02:36:12,581 --> 02:36:15,431
amelioration I think it's actually

3153
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:17,290
better now that it was and it might we

3154
02:36:15,431 --> 02:36:19,360
might be able to do even better but at

3155
02:36:17,290 --> 02:36:21,819
the moment I'm satisfied just knowing

3156
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:23,891
what that is and so as we work through

3157
02:36:21,819 --> 02:36:25,479
the lighting and finish up on the

3158
02:36:23,890 --> 02:36:26,949
lighting I'm not gonna have to

3159
02:36:25,479 --> 02:36:28,989
constantly wonder what the heck that

3160
02:36:26,950 --> 02:36:31,211
thing is I'll always know and I'll know

3161
02:36:28,989 --> 02:36:33,310
how it should behave so it won't be

3162
02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:36,310
affecting my ability to judge the

3163
02:36:33,310 --> 02:36:38,290
quality of the light solution because

3164
02:36:36,310 --> 02:36:40,511
now I just know what that artifact is

3165
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:42,040
and I can always just mentally account

3166
02:36:40,511 --> 02:36:43,271
for it whereas before I knew it was I

3167
02:36:42,040 --> 02:36:45,069
don't know what's going on in there

3168
02:36:43,271 --> 02:36:48,489
right it kunos what we're you know

3169
02:36:45,069 --> 02:36:49,630
what's why that's happening right so

3170
02:36:48,489 --> 02:36:50,979
it's really important to get that

3171
02:36:49,630 --> 02:36:53,260
understanding because now I can move

3172
02:36:50,979 --> 02:36:57,220
forward without even fixing it anymore

3173
02:36:53,261 --> 02:36:59,140
so and it won't negatively impact what

3174
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:01,390
we're doing and at any time we can

3175
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:02,350
choose if we have a good idea or we want

3176
02:37:01,390 --> 02:37:03,550
to start displaying around them or we

3177
02:37:02,351 --> 02:37:06,391
could always go back to it at our

3178
02:37:03,550 --> 02:37:06,390
leisure right

3179
02:37:07,978 --> 02:37:14,798
to use an equation for the light density

3180
02:37:11,369 --> 02:37:17,168
attenuation um I guess I don't know what

3181
02:37:14,799 --> 02:37:19,929
a light density attenuation is do you

3182
02:37:17,168 --> 02:37:24,488
just mean the light getting dimmer as it

3183
02:37:19,929 --> 02:37:29,100
gets further away or like density is

3184
02:37:24,488 --> 02:37:31,568
throwing me off in that in that sentence

3185
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:34,838
do you know if rat has discounts for

3186
02:37:31,568 --> 02:37:38,398
students no I don't think they do I do

3187
02:37:34,838 --> 02:37:42,068
think they negotiate license prices

3188
02:37:38,398 --> 02:37:44,679
based on the customers usually and how

3189
02:37:42,068 --> 02:37:46,359
many things they're buying or you know

3190
02:37:44,679 --> 02:37:48,009
stuff like that but I think it pretty

3191
02:37:46,359 --> 02:37:50,859
much the price is the price more or less

3192
02:37:48,009 --> 02:37:54,119
I mean it gets cheaper if you're slight

3193
02:37:50,859 --> 02:37:54,119
licensing and stuff but

3194
02:38:35,290 --> 02:38:45,080
hmm so synthesis yes there is a distance

3195
02:38:40,370 --> 02:38:48,280
attenuation so you can see that we've

3196
02:38:45,079 --> 02:38:51,379
got a radial fall-off on the light here

3197
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:53,900
this is not the real lighting this is

3198
02:38:51,379 --> 02:38:55,399
just a specular bounce with radial

3199
02:38:53,899 --> 02:38:58,629
fall-off that we added in there and

3200
02:38:55,399 --> 02:39:00,649
that's all it is right for testing so

3201
02:38:58,629 --> 02:39:02,239
because all we're trying to do is

3202
02:39:00,649 --> 02:39:04,039
capture light into these probes and make

3203
02:39:02,239 --> 02:39:07,340
sure it's working properly and later

3204
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:09,380
will actually do the work of putting in

3205
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:13,069
the lights equation we want because

3206
02:39:09,379 --> 02:39:16,789
that's totally separate right the actual

3207
02:39:13,069 --> 02:39:19,129
capture and persistence of the lighting

3208
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:21,950
is a separate problem from what you

3209
02:39:19,129 --> 02:39:23,329
actually want to do with it and so I'm

3210
02:39:21,950 --> 02:39:29,750
not even really considering those at the

3211
02:39:23,329 --> 02:39:32,959
moment would you ever go back to red

3212
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:38,239
yeah I love rad game tools I mean if I

3213
02:39:32,959 --> 02:39:40,879
can't support Molly rocket from sales of

3214
02:39:38,239 --> 02:39:42,440
our stuff it's where I would first look

3215
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:45,649
for a job I mean it's it's the best

3216
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:48,530
place I've ever worked it's also where I

3217
02:39:45,649 --> 02:39:51,109
send everyone like everyone I find who's

3218
02:39:48,530 --> 02:39:53,900
like a good programmer that I see like

3219
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:56,659
on stream or whatever I send them to

3220
02:39:53,899 --> 02:39:59,299
John or to Jeff like pretty much period

3221
02:39:56,659 --> 02:40:00,709
so they either go to I know that John

3222
02:39:59,299 --> 02:40:05,259
looks for people sometimes so I'll send

3223
02:40:00,709 --> 02:40:05,259
him someone or I'll send him to read

3224
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:10,640
just the paper from Nvidia about oxygen

3225
02:40:08,450 --> 02:40:11,840
sampling cover the sampling filter or do

3226
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:13,279
they just use linear and bump up the

3227
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:18,920
size of the bitmap to have more samples

3228
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:21,190
so it's funny you should ask that

3229
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:25,540
because I was wondering that myself I

3230
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:28,090
would like to look here's the thing I

3231
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:32,050
remember when we were reading through it

3232
02:40:28,090 --> 02:40:35,319
they definitely definitely definitely

3233
02:40:32,049 --> 02:40:37,369
did complex filtering on the voxels and

3234
02:40:35,319 --> 02:40:39,770
the reason for that is because they

3235
02:40:37,370 --> 02:40:41,420
wanted high quality results with sparse

3236
02:40:39,771 --> 02:40:43,700
voxels so they wanted to do stuff like

3237
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:48,219
handle like voxel - voxel occlusion and

3238
02:40:43,700 --> 02:40:49,630
all this stuff so the voxel blend they

3239
02:40:48,219 --> 02:40:52,269
a bunch of stuff I remember seeing that

3240
02:40:49,629 --> 02:40:54,309
I don't remember seeing anything about

3241
02:40:52,270 --> 02:40:59,409
how the octahedral map gets blended

3242
02:40:54,309 --> 02:41:00,728
together and what you have to recall you

3243
02:40:59,409 --> 02:41:04,289
have to keep in mind throughout all of

3244
02:41:00,728 --> 02:41:07,238
this is they're only trying to solve

3245
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:10,210
secondary bounce distribution because

3246
02:41:07,238 --> 02:41:14,260
they are actually counting on you doing

3247
02:41:10,209 --> 02:41:19,659
a light map pass first to do direct

3248
02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:22,710
illumination right so either actually

3249
02:41:19,659 --> 02:41:24,909
ray tracing or doing a light map pass

3250
02:41:22,709 --> 02:41:27,969
they expect you to do one or the other

3251
02:41:24,909 --> 02:41:30,939
to compute the direct illumination so

3252
02:41:27,969 --> 02:41:35,199
they're only concerned about secondary

3253
02:41:30,939 --> 02:41:38,609
bounce my assumption is they never would

3254
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:41,050
have seen this artifact because once you

3255
02:41:38,609 --> 02:41:42,159
take out the direct illumination and

3256
02:41:41,049 --> 02:41:46,509
you're only looking at the secondary

3257
02:41:42,159 --> 02:41:48,639
bounce I would kind of assume that this

3258
02:41:46,510 --> 02:41:51,068
gets swallowed up in the noise so my

3259
02:41:48,639 --> 02:41:51,488
guess is they never saw this that'd be

3260
02:41:51,068 --> 02:41:54,609
my guess

3261
02:41:51,488 --> 02:41:57,100
now I could be wrong I don't know and I

3262
02:41:54,609 --> 02:42:01,120
was very curious myself so I think I'm

3263
02:41:57,100 --> 02:42:04,960
happy to go look to see because I do I'm

3264
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:07,470
interested to see what the answer is to

3265
02:42:04,959 --> 02:42:07,469
that question

3266
02:42:35,420 --> 02:42:39,790
so you can see here like they use shadow

3267
02:42:38,299 --> 02:42:41,869
mapping for direct limits so the

3268
02:42:39,790 --> 02:42:44,109
illumination is just not in the mix

3269
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:44,109
right

3270
02:43:33,639 --> 02:43:39,129
so this is all just about the probes

3271
02:43:36,049 --> 02:43:39,129
themselves right

3272
02:44:12,739 --> 02:44:19,420
so I don't see any discussion of how

3273
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:19,420
they actually sample the octahedral map

3274
02:44:19,870 --> 02:44:34,760
right so I'm gonna go ahead and suggest

3275
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:37,750
that maybe they just leave it as it is

3276
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:37,750
right

3277
02:44:56,600 --> 02:45:05,609
so here's the actual sampler and I don't

3278
02:45:02,459 --> 02:45:15,858
know or at least might be the actual

3279
02:45:05,609 --> 02:45:15,859
sampler no that's not it

3280
02:45:16,879 --> 02:45:21,658
so actually no I guess we don't have the

3281
02:45:19,559 --> 02:45:22,889
shader here cuz this that's just for

3282
02:45:21,658 --> 02:45:25,340
updating the irradiance field right

3283
02:45:22,889 --> 02:45:25,340
isn't it

3284
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:40,618
you

3285
02:45:58,729 --> 02:46:03,799
so here's them pulling out of a G buffer

3286
02:46:01,340 --> 02:46:09,670
this is like a deferred renderer here's

3287
02:46:03,799 --> 02:46:09,670
the normal position ray origin

3288
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:24,560
here's the 8 probe cage

3289
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:56,190
so here's the actual sampling so there's

3290
02:46:44,729 --> 02:46:58,079
the direct texture lookup right so I

3291
02:46:56,190 --> 02:47:02,579
guess I'm not entirely certain it's only

3292
02:46:58,079 --> 02:47:08,750
taking red and green out of here oh you

3293
02:47:02,579 --> 02:47:08,750
know what this is the depth map maybe

3294
02:47:13,459 --> 02:47:25,169
okay so here's the actual color lookup

3295
02:47:15,690 --> 02:47:27,989
and that's a bilinear right so yeah

3296
02:47:25,170 --> 02:47:32,909
they're just just they're straight by

3297
02:47:27,989 --> 02:47:35,819
linear which by the way at when we're

3298
02:47:32,909 --> 02:47:37,170
done might be the same for us like I

3299
02:47:35,819 --> 02:47:38,789
said we might not need to do anything

3300
02:47:37,170 --> 02:47:48,239
about it I just wanted to make sure we

3301
02:47:38,790 --> 02:47:50,190
knew what was going on when doing game

3302
02:47:48,239 --> 02:47:52,770
logic do you think it's ever a good idea

3303
02:47:50,190 --> 02:47:56,270
to write in a sink a wait style and have

3304
02:47:52,770 --> 02:47:56,270
that transformed into a state machine

3305
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:07,170
not really I mean not exactly that way

3306
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:09,329
anyway so async waiting kinds of stuff I

3307
02:48:07,170 --> 02:48:12,540
don't think is the appropriate model for

3308
02:48:09,329 --> 02:48:14,190
game logic and the reason is because

3309
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:15,810
this same reason is you don't really

3310
02:48:14,190 --> 02:48:17,399
want to do it for the same for the way

3311
02:48:15,809 --> 02:48:19,409
that people do it in like JavaScript for

3312
02:48:17,399 --> 02:48:23,399
web pages what if that condition never

3313
02:48:19,409 --> 02:48:25,350
happens right so a lot of times when

3314
02:48:23,399 --> 02:48:28,139
people write code like that they go like

3315
02:48:25,350 --> 02:48:30,870
oh you know I want to write you know the

3316
02:48:28,139 --> 02:48:33,930
code for this AI or something and it's

3317
02:48:30,870 --> 02:48:36,060
gonna go like Oh chase the player and

3318
02:48:33,930 --> 02:48:37,950
when you reach the player then do this

3319
02:48:36,059 --> 02:48:41,299
thing and then it never reaches the

3320
02:48:37,950 --> 02:48:43,440
player right so just in this weird state

3321
02:48:41,299 --> 02:48:46,199
so I think usually what you want to do

3322
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:47,970
are things that can remember state so

3323
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:50,820
they can remember the fact that they are

3324
02:48:47,969 --> 02:48:53,129
trying to reach the hero but that every

3325
02:48:50,819 --> 02:48:54,931
frame reevaluate whether that's still a

3326
02:48:53,129 --> 02:48:56,699
good idea and this

3327
02:48:54,931 --> 02:48:58,950
is also why I think most webpages don't

3328
02:48:56,700 --> 02:49:01,190
work is there written to assume a very

3329
02:48:58,950 --> 02:49:03,150
specific set of things will happen and

3330
02:49:01,190 --> 02:49:06,390
invariably those things don't happen

3331
02:49:03,149 --> 02:49:08,190
because a packet gets lost or the user

3332
02:49:06,390 --> 02:49:10,921
clicks on something in the middle of it

3333
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:13,950
or who knows what or the browser blocks

3334
02:49:10,921 --> 02:49:16,771
a cookie and then the code just falls

3335
02:49:13,950 --> 02:49:18,150
apart because like six different async

3336
02:49:16,771 --> 02:49:19,530
things are all waiting on different

3337
02:49:18,149 --> 02:49:21,300
things and none of those things happen

3338
02:49:19,530 --> 02:49:23,610
or only two of them two out of the six

3339
02:49:21,300 --> 02:49:25,350
things need to happen happen right so I

3340
02:49:23,610 --> 02:49:26,671
think you want to be more defensive in

3341
02:49:25,351 --> 02:49:29,940
your programming I think you want to

3342
02:49:26,671 --> 02:49:31,979
generally assume that while you can

3343
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:33,541
write something that transforms things

3344
02:49:31,979 --> 02:49:35,939
into state machines if it makes it

3345
02:49:33,540 --> 02:49:37,890
easier for you to program them you want

3346
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:40,501
to program those state machines so that

3347
02:49:37,890 --> 02:49:43,081
they actually take into account all the

3348
02:49:40,501 --> 02:49:45,149
states that might occur and I think one

3349
02:49:43,081 --> 02:49:46,950
of the problems of writing async style

3350
02:49:45,149 --> 02:49:49,081
code like that is not so much that you

3351
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:51,171
couldn't write other obviously you can

3352
02:49:49,081 --> 02:49:55,200
write either piece of code either way

3353
02:49:51,171 --> 02:49:57,931
but you should not be assuming that

3354
02:49:55,200 --> 02:50:02,820
things happen in a series of steps that

3355
02:49:57,931 --> 02:50:04,501
cannot go wrong right so if you do want

3356
02:50:02,819 --> 02:50:07,501
to go the async programming route at

3357
02:50:04,501 --> 02:50:10,011
least make there be ways of which the

3358
02:50:07,501 --> 02:50:12,569
async thing will have sort of

3359
02:50:10,011 --> 02:50:15,181
exceptional things happen to jump you

3360
02:50:12,569 --> 02:50:18,029
back to a known good state after a

3361
02:50:15,181 --> 02:50:19,440
little while or don't just write it

3362
02:50:18,030 --> 02:50:21,801
assuming it will work because it never

3363
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:21,801
does

3364
02:50:26,341 --> 02:50:40,381
I don't have much thoughts on the m/l

3365
02:50:37,319 --> 02:50:41,399
family of languages I don't tend to like

3366
02:50:40,380 --> 02:50:44,040
pure functional

3367
02:50:41,399 --> 02:50:47,489
I think functional programming has its

3368
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:49,500
uses but those uses are limited and so I

3369
02:50:47,489 --> 02:50:52,761
think it's better to have a language

3370
02:50:49,501 --> 02:50:58,560
that supports both procedural and

3371
02:50:52,761 --> 02:51:02,041
functional as equal citizens rather than

3372
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:03,181
preferring functional and if you're

3373
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:04,680
gonna prefer something you should

3374
02:51:03,181 --> 02:51:06,120
probably prefer procedural over

3375
02:51:04,681 --> 02:51:08,301
functional because procedural is more

3376
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:15,030
flexible and it's how a computer works

3377
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:17,421
right computers aren't functional tagged

3378
02:51:15,030 --> 02:51:20,820
unions are great I use them all the time

3379
02:51:17,421 --> 02:51:22,079
do you know about the inverse distance

3380
02:51:20,819 --> 02:51:23,579
way into relation method you think can

3381
02:51:22,079 --> 02:51:25,470
be used for games I'm not sure exactly

3382
02:51:23,579 --> 02:51:27,239
what you're referring to obviously we

3383
02:51:25,470 --> 02:51:29,819
were doing inverse distance wait

3384
02:51:27,239 --> 02:51:34,261
interpolation but maybe you're talking

3385
02:51:29,819 --> 02:51:36,091
about a specific method what do you

3386
02:51:34,261 --> 02:51:37,051
think of C++ 20 modules and separately

3387
02:51:36,091 --> 02:51:38,521
of constants pressure

3388
02:51:37,050 --> 02:51:40,529
I don't follow supercilious anymore it's

3389
02:51:38,521 --> 02:51:42,450
a disaster it's a horrible language one

3390
02:51:40,530 --> 02:51:45,511
of the worst languages throw it out burn

3391
02:51:42,450 --> 02:51:48,841
it doesn't matter it'll never be good

3392
02:51:45,511 --> 02:51:49,921
ever don't it's jump the shark before it

3393
02:51:48,841 --> 02:51:52,610
even start before it even got in the

3394
02:51:49,921 --> 02:51:54,271
water it's it's over doesn't matter

3395
02:51:52,610 --> 02:51:57,541
haven't you looked at them sure they

3396
02:51:54,271 --> 02:51:59,221
suck I've only really focused much on

3397
02:51:57,540 --> 02:52:01,729
Python and I'm going to learn another

3398
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:05,100
language what do you think of golang

3399
02:52:01,729 --> 02:52:08,761
haven't really done anything with it in

3400
02:52:05,101 --> 02:52:11,601
particular so I couldn't tell you all

3401
02:52:08,761 --> 02:52:11,601
right I'm gonna wind it down

3402
02:52:18,439 --> 02:52:21,389
thank you everyone for joining me fit

3403
02:52:20,398 --> 02:52:23,010
ups on a hammer made here at Sona

3404
02:52:21,389 --> 02:52:24,059
pleasure coating with you as always if

3405
02:52:23,010 --> 02:52:25,050
you want to follow along the series at

3406
02:52:24,059 --> 02:52:27,148
home you could always peer to the game

3407
02:52:25,049 --> 02:52:28,858
on handmade here org and it comes to the

3408
02:52:27,148 --> 02:52:31,108
source code so you can follow along with

3409
02:52:28,859 --> 02:52:33,450
it at home I live back here tomorrow

3410
02:52:31,109 --> 02:52:36,568
when I think I will probably start

3411
02:52:33,450 --> 02:52:38,790
putting in the bounce lighting we also

3412
02:52:36,568 --> 02:52:41,159
may want to see what we're gonna do

3413
02:52:38,790 --> 02:52:45,300
about diffuse so we may want to start

3414
02:52:41,159 --> 02:52:47,760
producing a low res map as part of our

3415
02:52:45,299 --> 02:52:49,049
down sampling scheme so that we can get

3416
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:50,969
some diffuse lighting in there as well

3417
02:52:49,049 --> 02:52:52,409
we have to kind of think about how we're

3418
02:52:50,969 --> 02:52:54,719
gonna do that

3419
02:52:52,409 --> 02:52:56,219
and but we are gonna want to do that

3420
02:52:54,719 --> 02:52:57,750
eventually because we need to have our

3421
02:52:56,219 --> 02:52:59,429
services have to have diffuse and

3422
02:52:57,750 --> 02:53:01,859
specular component so we have to kind of

3423
02:52:59,430 --> 02:53:02,040
think about how that's gonna happen all

3424
02:53:01,859 --> 02:53:03,450
right

3425
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:04,920
hopes to get them back here for that

3426
02:53:03,450 --> 02:53:06,180
till then have fun partnering everyone

3427
02:53:04,920 --> 02:53:08,840
and I'll see you on the Internet

3428
02:53:06,180 --> 02:53:08,840
take it easy everybody
