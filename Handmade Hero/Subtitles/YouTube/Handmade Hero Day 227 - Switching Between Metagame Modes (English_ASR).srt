1
00:00:04,278 --> 00:00:10,919
all righty let's see hello everyone and

2
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,649
welcome to handmade Hero the show we

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,410
could complete game live on stream you

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,500
know I wanted these days have to get a

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,820
new I have to get a like a cord that's

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,219
long enough so I can actually sit up

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,560
straight when I do handmade hero because

8
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,329
I it's like this thing doesn't go far

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,059
enough and I'm constantly it's really

10
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:32,579
annoying I I wish I didn't have this

11
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,439
weird like tether to it's like I barely

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,590
can move my head at all what I'm doing

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,149
animate here and it really it I don't

14
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,070
like it let's put it that way it's

15
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,210
really really annoying

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,558
it's like the annoyingness of things but

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,329
yeah that's just the way it goes

18
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,859
sometimes so I should do that that's

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,399
what I should do for Christmas I should

20
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:55,409
get some way of actually having since I

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,399
do this every night for two hours I

22
00:00:55,409 --> 00:01:02,788
should have some way of like actually

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,070
not hating it the entire time it seems

24
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,519
like it should be pretty easy to do but

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,559
who knows maybe it's not of course it

26
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,658
would have been a lot easier if I could

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,650
have plugged it into the front

28
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,390
microphone for it but if you remember

29
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,240
way back in the original handmade hero

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,500
when I started I had it plugged into the

31
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,938
front microphone port and of course the

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,549
front microphone port for whatever

33
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:27,029
reason when captured through OBS has

34
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,490
like clicks in it how that's even

35
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,460
possible I don't know but that's just

36
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,500
how it was so welcome to Microsoft

37
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,228
Windows in the PC where everything is

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,478
unreliable it's always fantastic anyway

39
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:43,140
doesn't really matter point being we are

40
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:46,530
here today on day 227 we are going to do

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,540
some work on our attract mode basically

42
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,129
getting in and out of the game and some

43
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,470
other things like that that we kind of

44
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,239
wanted to you know just just clean up a

45
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,039
little bit I was sort of pulling things

46
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,170
out and and separating out different

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,368
pieces of the game code into places

48
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,739
where they were kind of logically

49
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:03,840
isolated from each other so that we

50
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:07,530
could sort of go like okay if I want to

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,899
I can start up you know I can start up a

52
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,419
cutscene and that's all self-contained I

53
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,949
can start up you know again

54
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:14,329
world and that's all self-contained and

55
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,839
I could switch between them and do stuff

56
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:20,180
like that all of those sorts of things

57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,848
that's really all I was interested in

58
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,530
doing and we did it mostly but we didn't

59
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,269
quite have time to finish yesterday and

60
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,620
so that's what I'm going to finish today

61
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,700
if you would like to follow along at

62
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,280
home and you pre-order the game at

63
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:32,780
hammer here org day 226 is the source

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,310
code you want to start with here on day

65
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:41,300
227 so that is what I am doing as well

66
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:45,979
alright so off we go let's take a look

67
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:48,290
at what we have left ourselves with and

68
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,699
I believe what we did is we we basically

69
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:51,439
had everything pulled out but we just

70
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:53,810
didn't have a chance to sort of finish

71
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,639
the last few things so we don't have any

72
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,549
way of actually starting the game now

73
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:01,369
because we pulled out that piece so we

74
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,230
come to the cutscene and that actually

75
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,390
works just fine and that starts playing

76
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:08,449
so that all got pulled out and is

77
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:10,159
reasonable but if I will on the face bar

78
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:13,548
which should be starting you know should

79
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,680
launch a hero into the game you know

80
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,689
nothing happens and I can't escape to

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,579
quit anymore right all of that stuff all

82
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:22,819
the interface that would have been

83
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:25,099
running is now gone and and so I gotta

84
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:27,620
fix that I also wonder why is this scene

85
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,659
not zooming at all do we know why that

86
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,219
is I noticed that yesterday and I was

87
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,909
wondering if we accidentally like

88
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:36,349
deleted the zoom from that one scene

89
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:38,659
right cuz you know we've got it here

90
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:40,608
where we got our intro shot and that's

91
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:42,859
this is shot too but it should be

92
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:46,909
zooming right I mean that's the zooming

93
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:48,829
right there it goes from 0 0 0 to 5

94
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:52,639
negative 5 negative 1 right that's

95
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:59,450
that's how that's set up to zoom but

96
00:03:52,639 --> 00:04:02,469
what's why do we not see anything it's a

97
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:04,759
little weird right just a little weird

98
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:06,680
so I don't really know what's going on

99
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,449
there but what I would like to do is I'd

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,430
like to figure out what happened to it

101
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,768
and if we take a look here we've got

102
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,139
hero and tree wall and window and

103
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,228
icicles they're all obviously very

104
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,519
different layers levels you know

105
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,339
whatever you want to call that they're

106
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,930
different very different Z depths so I

107
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,079
don't feel like it should be as

108
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,879
stationary as

109
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,478
is and what's weird about that is

110
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:33,090
basically all the other shots seem to

111
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:36,870
work exactly correctly right like nobody

112
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:38,158
else has that problem so I guess one

113
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,550
thing I could do is I could drastically

114
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:43,978
inflate what the actual DT was just to

115
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,658
just to verify that's not moving or at

116
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:47,668
least to exacerbate it a little bit and

117
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:50,610
just see if we can sort of tease it out

118
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:53,128
at all so there's the zoom in okay so

119
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,069
basically it is still zooming in I guess

120
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:58,139
it's just so subtle that you don't see

121
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,379
it so I wonder if maybe that's something

122
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,269
we should probably you know just just

123
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,939
exaggerate a little bit you know just

124
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,258
try to make that a little bit more

125
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,149
dramatic as it zooms in because it just

126
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,718
does seem like like maybe that's not

127
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:14,068
sufficient that's a little bit too slow

128
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:17,089
for whatever reason so I don't know

129
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:20,189
let's say I cranked that up to something

130
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:24,149
where I was actually just gonna double

131
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:26,129
that that rate for example and this is

132
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,138
probably not worth playing with at the

133
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,669
moment but I'm just curious to see if

134
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,199
that gives a little bit more motion

135
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,750
there and probably what we'll have to do

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,210
at some point is maybe you know what

137
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:40,250
what I'll do is when we actually go back

138
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:42,810
to sync via stuff up with voice over

139
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,088
with like a soundtrack that goes with

140
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,968
the cutscene when we do that I'll go

141
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:50,610
back to that second scene and I'll see

142
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:53,879
if I can make it a little more unjust

143
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,468
you know sort of a little more dramatic

144
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,289
and so you now you can sort of see it

145
00:05:55,468 --> 00:06:01,168
moving but it's still really pretty

146
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:04,079
pretty darn subtle so I feel like that

147
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:06,240
I'll probably have to be you know just

148
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,680
just made a little bit more a little bit

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,348
more pronounced even than what it is

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,310
there so I don't know something like

151
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:16,468
that not sure but anyway so yeah so

152
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,269
point being what we need to do at this

153
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:20,579
point

154
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:23,310
in order to get ourselves back to sort

155
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:26,158
of where I want us to be is we need to

156
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,788
think about how we're going to handle UI

157
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:33,028
during these various pieces and I think

158
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:36,689
what I probably will do is say that you

159
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:38,959
know I don't really want to handle much

160
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:42,350
UI during the cutscene

161
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,939
attract mode stuff yeah so it looks like

162
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:49,189
that's zooming you know K now but I feel

163
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:51,469
like maybe the boy is is is he's just a

164
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,449
little bit too he has too much motion he

165
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,250
should probably be set back a little bit

166
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,478
more sorry to keep jumping in now here I

167
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,970
don't know why we just bugging me I

168
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,459
don't like it when things are not just

169
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,020
so yeah so anyway I point being I wonder

170
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,930
if the here on the tree need to be a

171
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:08,389
little bit more pushed to the background

172
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,430
if that makes sense so I don't really

173
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,840
know exactly what the right way to do

174
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:20,030
that would be but you know something

175
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:23,899
like this I guess anyway sorry what I

176
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,638
was trying to say was like I don't think

177
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,829
I really want to handle much in the way

178
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,478
of UI during the cutscene attract mode

179
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,639
stuff because the only thing that really

180
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:33,620
needs to happen is if somebody tries to

181
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,199
start the game it needs to go into the

182
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:41,240
game mode right but that seems to be

183
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,470
just like the only real I I really don't

184
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,598
feel like there's anything else that has

185
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,820
to happen and once you're in the game

186
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:50,089
mode then that'll do its thing and it's

187
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:51,860
all fine okay so that's that's actually

188
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:53,649
looking better but I think even a little

189
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,270
bit further back than that would be good

190
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,129
but so you know I feel like that's

191
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:01,879
something that can just be handled

192
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,918
without it being too too much of a deal

193
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,449
where just anything that gets hit we

194
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,889
immediately switch over to the game mode

195
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,478
and the game mode will handle like

196
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:11,360
player joining and stuff like that

197
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:15,468
because I want you know if we ever allow

198
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,750
multiple players for real in the shipped

199
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:19,430
game which I don't know if we will if

200
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,658
we're turned that off or not because

201
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,218
we'll have to see if it makes any sense

202
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:24,800
to have two players in the game at all

203
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:27,408
but so if we have two if you have two

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,050
different people than what I'd like to

205
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:34,038
do is I would kind of like to have it so

206
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,200
that you could join it anytime so I the

207
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:39,168
like fundamental concept that someone

208
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,860
could join the game that needs to like

209
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:44,958
be in there at all times it's not modal

210
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,269
like you know joining a game can't be

211
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:52,639
something that's dependent right on

212
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,699
you being in the cutscene it's gotta be

213
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,100
something that's always gonna work right

214
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,200
and so that's that's why I say you know

215
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:05,389
I really want to make sure that that

216
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,920
part is is handled in the game world so

217
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,629
I think what I want to do is leave all

218
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:14,029
the interface there and then the only

219
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:15,950
interface that I'll put inside this you

220
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,139
know the like the cutscene a track mode

221
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,680
is just if anybody hits their Start

222
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,449
button

223
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:22,629
it immediately pops to the game world

224
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,009
and it lets the game world probably

225
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:29,299
handle the the UI stuff that it's gonna

226
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:30,950
do at that point something like that all

227
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:32,809
right so that looks a lot better to me

228
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,140
by the way I feel like we're getting

229
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:38,029
much closer now to something usable so

230
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,069
again I don't need to deal with that now

231
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,539
it's fine as it is but now at least you

232
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,690
can kind of see the motion a little bit

233
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:51,079
better and and it's not you know totally

234
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:54,500
awful or anything so yeah let's see here

235
00:09:51,080 --> 00:10:01,460
also this needs to be a little bigger

236
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:04,220
and this might want him yeah sorry so

237
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,470
that's what I'm gonna do and after I

238
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,420
quit fixating on the fact that this is

239
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,920
wrong I probably should have if I wasn't

240
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,389
talking I would have gone and made it so

241
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,779
that we could just optimize that one

242
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:19,460
scene by itself really quickly but yeah

243
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:22,220
like I said I'm gonna stop fixating on

244
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,600
it immediately after I see if that made

245
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:29,149
the size of the dude right here and and

246
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,800
that's that's all that's all you know

247
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,299
just it just once I just want to see

248
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,870
that's all just a little you know I just

249
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:37,039
want to have a little looky loo at it

250
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,600
all right so he's kind of a little bit

251
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,750
off-center but other than that he's fine

252
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,750
so I'll just say let's just say that we

253
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,279
move him over a little bit like maybe

254
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,720
like that and we'll just leave it like

255
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,439
that okay

256
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,779
so now that we've got our cutscene

257
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,550
fixation out of the way for today let's

258
00:10:53,779 --> 00:11:03,610
suppose that I go ahead in here and I do

259
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:06,620
a track mode and OH

260
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,909
forgot about this we have a track mode

261
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,190
but we don't actually want it somebody

262
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:11,449
delete that file forget a track mode

263
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,300
pretend that wasn't there

264
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,030
well we actually want its cutscene here

265
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,309
we go which already in and so when we're

266
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,870
in here and we're doing update and

267
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,539
render cutscene or update and render

268
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,710
title screen really in here I guess the

269
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:26,509
other thing that we need to do is like

270
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,759
we need to have the title screen right

271
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:30,860
that's got to be there and we've got to

272
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,629
have the cutscene and the title screen

273
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,100
both when they do their updating check

274
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,419
for input and so I'm just gonna have a

275
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,980
thing since they're both the same I'm

276
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:40,519
just gonna do a thing that's like check

277
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,899
for start or something like that that's

278
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,059
it and all that's gonna do is it's gonna

279
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:48,470
do like you know at the end it's gonna

280
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:51,379
have this sort of thing where it goes

281
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,910
ahead and does the checking so I'm gonna

282
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:54,500
have a thing that's like check for start

283
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:57,019
so after it does that it's just gonna

284
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,440
look to see if it needs to do anything

285
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:03,710
with that so both of these guys would do

286
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,210
it and what that means is that okay we

287
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,150
just have to look for just the subset of

288
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:10,490
buttons that would do that and so if I

289
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:14,149
look at handmade I guess its world duct

290
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,519
CVP oops I think it's a world mode

291
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:19,189
rather if we look at handmade world mode

292
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,350
we we have this whole big block of stuff

293
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,830
right and we've got the part that

294
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,710
actually checks for that start for that

295
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:32,360
start condition and that's let's see

296
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:36,160
that is where is that there's a button

297
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:39,710
for it right or did we leave it in here

298
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:42,230
it we left in here so here's that code

299
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,610
and you can kind of see that that all

300
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,560
we're really doing is spinning over the

301
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,560
controllers and we're seeing whether or

302
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,750
not anyone push the start button and

303
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:54,259
there's also the quit button so I should

304
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,960
actually call this check for meta input

305
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:59,689
or something and that would essentially

306
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,280
just do this this part of it so all its

307
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,880
gonna do is say okay for each of these

308
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,919
guys I just want to know if you pressed

309
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:10,970
either of these two things whichever one

310
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,500
it was I am going to want to take some

311
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,840
action right I'm going to want to take

312
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,220
some action on that and depending on

313
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,570
what the action is I'm going to do

314
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,060
something

315
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,370
in the case of someone pressing the back

316
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:30,469
button on the controller we want to quit

317
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:33,709
we want to exit out and in the case of

318
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:39,860
somebody pressing start in fact I guess

319
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:42,319
I can do this as well in the case of

320
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,110
somebody pressing start I want to start

321
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,930
the game and that's really all we need

322
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,320
to do that would check all of the input

323
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:53,059
that is allowed during the metagame and

324
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,170
so now these two guys can do that so all

325
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,299
we really need to do is figure out what

326
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:59,659
action we're going to take if somebody

327
00:13:56,299 --> 00:14:01,789
presses the start button then what I'm

328
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:04,579
going to want to do is in hand-made

329
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:08,329
world I feel like we've got you know

330
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,940
this sort of like play play world

331
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,100
function what I want to do is do play

332
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,589
worlds so that we actually have a world

333
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,399
that gets started up and then once we do

334
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,620
play world I want to be able to add like

335
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,389
a player right I want to actually

336
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,509
initialize what whoever the player is

337
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:28,159
that started the game so in here we

338
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:30,889
would have something like okay you know

339
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,328
we've got play worlds so we'll call that

340
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:34,429
so it would just be like hey man play

341
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:38,000
play whatever you're gonna play like do

342
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:42,439
it and we're gonna need that game state

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,328
obviously so TM State game states that

344
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:50,620
will necessitate that sort of being

345
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:50,620
passed here like so game state

346
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:59,159
yeah yeah oops and that way when someone

347
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,120
presses that controller button you know

348
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,339
off you go now

349
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,080
quit requested I don't actually remember

350
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,480
how we were handling that but so I'm

351
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,460
gonna just check really quickly how that

352
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,620
happens so that access is the game

353
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,070
memory and says that you want to quit

354
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:18,960
the thing so in order to do that I don't

355
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:22,710
really know I don't really know if I

356
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:26,430
love that concept I want to see

357
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:29,940
something about that is quit requested

358
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:34,529
best put here or is it best put in game

359
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,940
input and I don't know right because we

360
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:38,789
don't really have a concept of where

361
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,890
that sort of thing should go but it does

362
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:43,889
kind of seem like might be more

363
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:47,279
appropriate in here I'm not sure I don't

364
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:49,230
really know but that way you wouldn't

365
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,509
pass them game memory around for no

366
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,070
reason like that because you know you

367
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:56,519
would have been dealing with the game

368
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,840
input presumably in order to do it so I

369
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,370
don't I don't know I don't know what I

370
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,269
think about that but I think I might

371
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,590
just just move it there for now and so

372
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:07,710
then I'm gonna say that quit requested

373
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:11,310
equals true if anyone tries to quit the

374
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:14,009
game and that's all we're really gonna

375
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:16,859
do now as soon as we do one of these

376
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:18,960
things we're gonna break out of this

377
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,509
loop because only we only want to

378
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,400
process the first piece of input because

379
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:25,019
that's gonna change the mode immediately

380
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,069
at that point and we don't want to

381
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:33,439
process any further input I think what

382
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:36,330
we'd rather do is let somebody else

383
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,970
process the input from there right so

384
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,100
one way to do it in - in fact you know

385
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,810
and I think I might do this I think I

386
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,159
might do it this way directly because

387
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:48,750
this time it sounds good to me

388
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:50,909
is hand-made world mode that's got

389
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:54,659
update and render world I may just go

390
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:56,969
ahead and say you know what let's just

391
00:16:54,659 --> 00:17:01,409
let you know in the case where this meta

392
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:04,329
input happens let's just let the other

393
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:08,829
mode handle the input right

394
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:10,419
so you know let's let it do one frame of

395
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,339
that or whatever it's gonna do now I

396
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,730
don't really know cuz we're gonna have

397
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,559
rendered the cutscene so what I could do

398
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,299
I don't even know like maybe what we

399
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:23,559
could do is something like this where we

400
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:27,730
do like check for a meta input like so

401
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:31,179
and you know maybe we even do something

402
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,430
where we're like okay we see if we get

403
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,930
anything and if we if we decide to

404
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,759
change the mode then we don't actually

405
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:42,490
we don't actually do any of our work

406
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,200
right so we check for a meta input and

407
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,730
if there was some meta input and we want

408
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,940
to change the mode we don't do like our

409
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,160
rendering instead maybe we punt and let

410
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,360
the next person render like whoever was

411
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:57,940
going to render gets to do that right

412
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,619
gets to do that separately so I'm not

413
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,309
sure but like imagine something like

414
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:05,259
that we're gonna happen so if something

415
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:08,500
like that we're gonna happen then what I

416
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,910
might say is like okay we want to do

417
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,680
something we're like you know we do play

418
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,450
world and then we would do update and

419
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,490
render world or something like that so

420
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,299
maybe we've got something maybe we even

421
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,819
make this somewhat systemic so it does

422
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:26,200
something like okay in hand made that

423
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:27,819
CPP but when we do our little dance here

424
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,789
where we look at what the game mode is

425
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:32,669
and we do whatever we're going to do

426
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:39,700
maybe I do something that's like

427
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:43,000
actually going to loop and it'll like it

428
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,539
can punt during a change in type it can

429
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,670
go ahead and rerun the thing a second

430
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:51,309
time or whatever so I don't know exactly

431
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:54,600
how I'd want to do that maybe you know

432
00:18:51,309 --> 00:19:00,490
what I could do is something like this I

433
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:03,250
could say rerun equals false and then I

434
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:06,910
could do like rerun you know ills

435
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,339
whatever and so anytime someone wants to

436
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,250
change the mode they can just go ahead

437
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:16,359
and do that and they don't have to worry

438
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,710
right so that would be like okay update

439
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:20,009
and

440
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:22,590
under cutscene update and render title

441
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:36,390
screen essentially it just says like you

442
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:41,369
know like this like so on so yeah if we

443
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:47,880
see that we got some input that would

444
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:52,788
cause us to change the mode then we let

445
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,789
people know that and off we go

446
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,519
so that should be good I think not sure

447
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:00,960
okay

448
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,579
and I'm quit requested I guess that

449
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,960
doesn't change the mode so we don't pass

450
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:08,220
result true in that particular case yes

451
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,169
so imagine if you did something like

452
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:18,028
this and you're just like okay you know

453
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:20,490
well rerun something like that seems

454
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:23,548
reasonable you know it's not the

455
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:26,399
weirdest thing in the world and so if I

456
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:29,668
go if I grab this stuff out now this

457
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:31,798
stuff could all go into handmade world

458
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:34,559
mode which is I think which is where I

459
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,658
would prefer that that it was I believe

460
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,548
I don't actually know where the best

461
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:41,159
place for it is but you know maybe it

462
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:47,460
belongs in here or something like that

463
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:50,250
and so here in controlled heroes like I

464
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,710
was saying I don't really know where

465
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,819
that should live just yet I don't know

466
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:59,220
if controlled heroes should only live in

467
00:20:55,819 --> 00:21:01,079
in the game world stuff I don't think so

468
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,880
I feel like controlled heroes should

469
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:05,519
probably stay in the game stay because

470
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,200
it might persist across different things

471
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,079
so I'm just gonna assume that that's

472
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,500
actually what we want and I want to pass

473
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:16,500
the game state to this so that it can

474
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,929
sort of play with that alright so let's

475
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,970
take a look here at what we've got do me

476
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:29,030
add player actually takes the world mode

477
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:31,610
now so that's how that goes these volume

478
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,410
is changed volume I don't know where

479
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:34,250
that stuff actually exists I assume

480
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,370
that's in here

481
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,519
I'm not sure let's take a look change

482
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:42,409
volume it is so if we're calling change

483
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,569
volume on the audio state stuff that

484
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,269
just looks like maybe we need to make

485
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,529
sure that that is included first so

486
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:51,410
that's just I think that's just an

487
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,730
include order thing the audio should

488
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,410
probably be much higher it should

489
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,670
probably be up with like the assets

490
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,009
because that's a pretty pretty core

491
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,210
function that everyone's gonna call I

492
00:21:58,009 --> 00:22:02,629
would assume

493
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:05,720
alright so let's keep it going so here

494
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:08,480
we are with play world play world is

495
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,170
something that we would have to sort of

496
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,910
expose I suspect for people to call so

497
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm just going to move that up into the

498
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,750
H file so that everyone can see it

499
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:23,120
anyone who wants to start a world

500
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:26,359
playthrough but apparently that's not

501
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:30,649
working and I don't know why oh I do

502
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:32,419
know why that is because I don't know

503
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,580
where handmade cutscene is actually

504
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,620
placed again this is the kind of thing

505
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:38,329
that's just so annoying you know this

506
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:41,259
this stuff should not actually be

507
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:45,199
something that anyone ever worries about

508
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:46,730
it's super annoying to have to manage

509
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,950
dependencies it's like because it's

510
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,299
there's it's literally just busywork

511
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,240
like it's something the compiler should

512
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:56,839
have always done for you it's really

513
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,910
just stupid anyway point being let me

514
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,730
see here why we can't get to that play

515
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:05,540
role so here say I made let me just take

516
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:07,400
a look here Sam a cutscene dot CPP so

517
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:09,289
hand make up scene dot CPP is right here

518
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,710
and of course that included ham a dot H

519
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:17,000
so it ham a dot H we know includes a

520
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,259
handmade world right or maybe it doesn't

521
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,720
maybe that's the problem

522
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:24,619
I mean handmade world meds right there

523
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,259
and isn't that where I put that that

524
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:29,869
play it's right there so why can't it

525
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:33,500
why can't it get that what am I missing

526
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:39,589
play world game state since they're

527
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:41,750
missing racket before semicolon ah ok so

528
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,939
that wasn't dependencies at all that was

529
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:48,700
just like closing

530
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:52,960
the parens alright good good let's see

531
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,940
what else we got here input we don't

532
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,269
actually get in this particular function

533
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,970
but we're gonna need it that makes sense

534
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:01,868
so let's put that in there and then we

535
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,669
just have to make sure we pass

536
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:06,608
everything that we actually said we were

537
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:11,950
going to pass to these guys so they can

538
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:16,720
run themselves which is always good okay

539
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:20,528
update and render world is in here date

540
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,889
and render world that takes to be 32 the

541
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:26,319
P 32 is like I don't really know what

542
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:29,769
this is gonna be like Rhys Rhys LUT

543
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:35,048
whatever that is so we gotta have a way

544
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:37,358
I guess of exiting out return salt it's

545
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:40,298
which before we were doing with like if

546
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:43,089
there were no heroes right so there was

547
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:44,710
like a hero's exist thing and so what we

548
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:48,249
could do now is say okay when we get

549
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:50,919
down to the end here you could do a

550
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:52,239
thing that's like if Heroes exists well

551
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:54,519
if you're just we don't do anything if

552
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:56,679
heroes don't exist then what we need to

553
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,739
do is switch back to the cutscene or

554
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:04,059
whatever so we'd want to do play intro

555
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:07,119
cutscene for example and we want to you

556
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:10,210
know we want to kind of switch what

557
00:25:07,118 --> 00:25:12,788
state were in and so in that case the

558
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,190
results well we don't really need to

559
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:17,679
rerun it for any particular reason

560
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:20,019
so we should be fine there so play into

561
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,869
a cutscene identify are not found that

562
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,249
again is because we don't now have this

563
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:25,449
is the dependency thing that I was

564
00:25:24,249 --> 00:25:26,950
actually talking about before but that

565
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,200
turned out not actually the problem is

566
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,359
now actually the problem so we've kind

567
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,609
of got the intro cutscene thing that

568
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:37,658
we've got a now loft up to the to the

569
00:25:33,608 --> 00:25:42,098
outside which is fine let's go ahead and

570
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:43,869
find all the things it needs yeah update

571
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:44,348
and render title screen must return a

572
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:48,730
value

573
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:54,460
right you are there is that value

574
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:57,480
so must you and check for meta input as

575
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,480
well so there we go

576
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,960
mmm quit requested is not a member of

577
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:15,480
game memory that is true and that is

578
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:15,480
because I went ahead and moved all right

579
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:24,689
so now we just got to get this stuff

580
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:28,428
actually working which of course will

581
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:32,610
take a bit so let's see where are we at

582
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:34,798
we are currently kicking off something

583
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:37,918
with a totally bogus pointer to a world

584
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,349
mode which is not great yeah as you

585
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,429
would expect so when we do feel ground

586
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,369
trunk for some reason it looks like

587
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,650
we're passing a boat passing a bogus

588
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:51,329
world mode there at least that appears

589
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:55,080
to be the case so what exactly you know

590
00:26:51,329 --> 00:27:00,079
what I just realized what exactly is

591
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:03,839
that even who who actually does that

592
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:06,210
stuff I don't know to be honest with you

593
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:12,839
don't really know who's in charge of

594
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:15,029
those those things yeah to be honest the

595
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:20,730
ground chunk stuff I realized as I was

596
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:24,450
working on a bunch of design stuff to

597
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:27,000
send art things to yangshin I realized

598
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,610
that the ground chunk stuff I don't know

599
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,410
if we ever actually need it because

600
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:33,000
there were some reasons why I don't know

601
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:37,230
that that's actually ever gonna be used

602
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,269
but we should debug it anyway even

603
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,450
though I may yank it because I don't

604
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:46,349
know that we actually ever want to do it

605
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:47,819
so there is that anyway so yeah one of

606
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:52,769
the one of the things that's a little

607
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:54,750
bit annoying about about that is we're

608
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:57,058
gonna have to when we do the mode

609
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,589
switching we're going to have to take

610
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,539
into account the fact that there can be

611
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:03,359
people using the world mode when we like

612
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:06,178
exit out right like when you exit world

613
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:10,798
mode or when you close down a world any

614
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:13,679
like thread any threaded work that's

615
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:16,230
still going on on behalf of that world

616
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,048
specifically would have to get shut down

617
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:23,460
right because you can't delete all of

618
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:26,490
the memory that's being used to render

619
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:29,490
the world into the ground chunks you

620
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,900
can't you know that that if those things

621
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,009
are still accessing that memory when you

622
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,790
get rid of it

623
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:36,720
they will go nuts right I don't know

624
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,809
that that's what we're looking at here

625
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,670
per se because we didn't actually try to

626
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:45,450
close down a world but it's just

627
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,370
something worth noting right alright so

628
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,950
let's take a look here let me turn off

629
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:50,939
let's let's start with one thing in time

630
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,600
since we've made a bunch of changes

631
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,140
let's just start by not doing any ground

632
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,119
chunks

633
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,060
well we won't kick off any ground chunk

634
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,099
work at all so instead here when we do

635
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,250
like thrill ground fill ground chunk I'm

636
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,539
just gonna go ahead and get rid of that

637
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:09,299
right so now we're not doing any of that

638
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:12,359
at all and so now if I go ahead and run

639
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:17,099
we can just see like where we're at with

640
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,659
everything else okay so this is a little

641
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:20,099
bit better because now I can see what's

642
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,100
actually happening which is what I would

643
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:24,990
I would like okay so this is this is

644
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:28,469
easy right we've never actually done the

645
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:31,440
initialization of the World Arena and so

646
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,730
that's obviously got to happen we can't

647
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,880
push this truck before we call

648
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,259
initialized world that's kind of obvious

649
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,530
so yeah so we got to take care of that

650
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:48,299
so let's go ahead and and and reorganize

651
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:50,369
that part so yeah world node world that

652
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:55,379
should actually probably be on the mode

653
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:58,769
arena right game state so allocates the

654
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,860
world thing and then it initializes it

655
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:04,740
all right and in some sense it does seem

656
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:07,139
like maybe that should just be a thing

657
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:12,029
that does its allocation meaning you

658
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,470
know when we do initialize world instead

659
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:15,509
of passing it in a world at that point

660
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,390
it seems like maybe since it's going to

661
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:20,879
have to do a sub arena thing here anyway

662
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:24,960
it seems like you probably would just do

663
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,960
the actual like you just do the actual

664
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:35,329
allocation so you know we just call

665
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:41,759
create worlds like this that seems like

666
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:43,109
maybe a saner thing to do so then you

667
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,539
would just say oh okay

668
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:48,929
you know we push struct on the parent

669
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:54,720
arena to get the new worlds you know we

670
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:56,940
return it and we initialize its arena as

671
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,350
part of that process obviously so then

672
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,809
that goes away and this is a little bit

673
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:04,139
more straightforward now that seems a

674
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:07,369
little bit more sane to me honestly that

675
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,230
that you know that's just a saner thing

676
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:12,689
all right so let's see create world

677
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,049
identifier not found that is true

678
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,410
because I actually forgot to rename it

679
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,849
from initialize world to create worlds

680
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:23,009
so now we have a way to create a world

681
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:24,809
then that's great everyone's happy and

682
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:28,170
it's fine all right so let's keep going

683
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:32,849
with the debugging process here so let's

684
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:37,769
see when we do create worlds we call

685
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:41,849
Sabrina Sabrina asks for some stuff and

686
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:44,490
we then say that we can't fit it it was

687
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:46,529
basically what happened that could be

688
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,079
due to the alignment but I'm not

689
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:52,559
actually sure so let's take a quick look

690
00:31:49,079 --> 00:32:01,279
and see if that is true let's see if we

691
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:06,960
have handmade get oops get size

692
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:09,420
remaining yeah so that's a problem that

693
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,980
was basically a case of us not using our

694
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,620
define everywhere probably because we

695
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,660
added the defined a little bit too late

696
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:17,969
but yeah we would obviously want to make

697
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:25,259
it so that they always look for the

698
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:26,610
correct default alignment there and the

699
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:30,539
other thing was that looked like it was

700
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:32,639
set to 16 though so did somebody ask did

701
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,680
handmade world ask for a different

702
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,520
alignment than the normal alignment when

703
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,440
it does it Sabrina like why did that

704
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,000
happen

705
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,000
it looked like it said 16 to me

706
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,190
am I wrong let's try that I'm gonna I

707
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:54,659
want to see that again

708
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:56,298
I felt like that said 16 maybe I'm wrong

709
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:00,240
about that

710
00:32:56,298 --> 00:33:08,480
yeah the alignment 16 so how is the

711
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:13,859
alignment 16 I don't get it so sub arena

712
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:21,808
takes a default parameter I must be

713
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:24,990
going blind didn't I just ah

714
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:26,210
no okay so I missed one more that's the

715
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,548
problem right there

716
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:34,019
all right that's what should have

717
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:37,109
happened didn't happen but should have

718
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:40,440
happened and so if we want to do a sub

719
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:43,229
arena of size 16 which you know maybe we

720
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:47,330
do maybe we don't but if we did want to

721
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:49,470
do that we would have to ask for its

722
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:50,970
justice if eclis which is what we want

723
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,700
because we need to ask for that when we

724
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:56,960
ask the sizes so let me make sure that

725
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,759
that nobody actually really wanted that

726
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,890
specifically that certainly doesn't

727
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:09,690
matter I don't think neither does that

728
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:12,929
and I don't think these guys care too

729
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,250
much about this at all yes I'm pretty

730
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,500
sure that nobody actually cares about

731
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,210
that alignment being 16 we could change

732
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,358
the default alignment to 16 if we wanted

733
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,800
to but yeah all right so we're getting a

734
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,628
little further here but you can see that

735
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,000
we're still totally messed up like for

736
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:28,618
example what happened there I don't know

737
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,898
if you saw it but you know this is the

738
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,460
game I hit the spacebar and we're got

739
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:34,769
nothing on the screen

740
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,769
in fact it's it restarted the cutscene

741
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:38,878
which doesn't make any sense so we kind

742
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:40,980
of want to figure out what's going on

743
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,628
there oh well actually you know what I

744
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,909
know what's going on there

745
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:49,858
but anyway so what we want to have

746
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:52,590
happen is we want to when we call update

747
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:55,349
and render on the world node we want to

748
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,079
create a hero so we need to make sure

749
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:59,699
that that code path is working properly

750
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,079
and then we can kind of get back to to

751
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:02,279
whatever we were doing and in fact we

752
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,730
could also see if the ground chunk

753
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:11,640
updating is actually working now as well

754
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:16,199
let's just take a look here okay

755
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:18,809
so that is still busted the world mode

756
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:22,549
world thing it's still kind of busted

757
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:27,150
let's see here so the world mode is is

758
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:29,340
just looks garbage to me so basically

759
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:32,970
whatever whenever this fill ground chunk

760
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:34,559
thing gets called so I'm guessing that

761
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:38,639
what happens is we actually do just

762
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,469
straight-up exit out of the we exit as

763
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,358
soon as we enter which means all of

764
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:44,009
those field ground chunks do exactly

765
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:45,960
what I said they would do they crash

766
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:49,500
because they're accessing memory that's

767
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,940
been freed by the call to play in intro

768
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:56,070
cutscene right so you can see that

769
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,590
hero's exist is set to zero now I don't

770
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,460
actually know why it's set to zero

771
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,950
because I would have thought that it

772
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,769
would have been set to one so that's a

773
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:08,250
little confusing to me and I would

774
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:08,429
probably need to look to see oh there it

775
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:12,000
is

776
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:16,500
that's why so what has to actually

777
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,480
happen is this guy has to match right

778
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,880
this has to be was pressed because what

779
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,369
was happening there

780
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,900
was that it would come in here and it

781
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:26,818
would not have ended down it would ended

782
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,430
up because what was pressed starts

783
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:32,608
checks for ended up so the check in the

784
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:35,248
cutscene code was different than the

785
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:44,578
check in this code and therefore there

786
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:48,058
was a mismatch right so yeah all right

787
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:50,039
so still not quite there yet so let's

788
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:51,420
try looking through what happens during

789
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:54,239
the controller thing so we can now

790
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,588
actually debug that and figure out why

791
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,358
we're not getting any of this

792
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,588
it looks like cos hero's exist only

793
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,480
happens in this path

794
00:36:58,588 --> 00:37:02,518
that's probably why so this was pressed

795
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,739
adds a player but nobody actually looks

796
00:37:02,518 --> 00:37:08,909
for it yet and so the way we could fix

797
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:11,269
that is actually pretty easy that is is

798
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:28,018
really just a matter of saying like okay

799
00:37:11,268 --> 00:37:31,979
just do this again like so yeah so okay

800
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:34,338
so now at least we're back to something

801
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:38,278
sensible we could start the game right

802
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:40,318
and yeah we could exit the game as well

803
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:43,108
and go back to our intro cutscene which

804
00:37:40,318 --> 00:37:44,579
is what we wanted start again and and so

805
00:37:43,108 --> 00:37:45,748
on hopefully I don't actually know if

806
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,940
that's true looks like we still got bug

807
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:51,509
here and I also notice that we do have

808
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:56,369
another bug which is that when I start

809
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:57,929
the game I I can't move right I can tell

810
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,519
that time is advancing because like the

811
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:02,548
shadows are bobbing and stuff like that

812
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:06,268
but I can't actually move my dude around

813
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:09,509
so that's obviously busted right so I'd

814
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:11,038
like to see what's wrong there but we're

815
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:13,108
pretty close now to having things

816
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:17,220
separated out which means we can sort of

817
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:21,659
proceed a little bit further so what I

818
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:23,848
want to do is I want to figure out why

819
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:27,568
when I'm pushing a button I'm not moving

820
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:29,460
my dude and it I don't really this may

821
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:30,659
have been something that again normally

822
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,849
if I was going to make all these changes

823
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:33,509
I'd make them all in one day where it's

824
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:35,489
easier to keep

825
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:37,079
in my head and so it's possible that I

826
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:39,389
just forgot something that I was like oh

827
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:44,429
I'm just going to comment this out or

828
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:46,159
something like this right it's possible

829
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:48,209
that we just did something like that and

830
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,999
now I'm just forgetting that it needs to

831
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:52,588
be commented back in again right and so

832
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:55,648
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna look

833
00:38:52,588 --> 00:38:58,528
for if zero and see in world mode what

834
00:38:55,648 --> 00:39:01,228
we got rid of wall is not particularly

835
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:03,630
saying why the hero this this looks like

836
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:05,129
an obvious thing right it looks like we

837
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,959
just commented out the code for

838
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:10,169
controlling people which okay is exactly

839
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:12,688
what I said we might have done we did so

840
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:15,108
here this game state let's put that back

841
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:18,388
in there and see what happens

842
00:39:15,108 --> 00:39:20,759
all right hey look so that was all it

843
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:23,818
was and now we can move her a little

844
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:26,789
here around and that's all good let's

845
00:39:23,818 --> 00:39:28,768
see here so we also though don't seem to

846
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:30,329
be tracking the camera meaning the

847
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,088
camera does not actually seem to be

848
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:37,189
updating and so I do also wonder if we

849
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:40,318
if we nuked that code which you may have

850
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:42,688
or the code which sets the camera follow

851
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:44,398
right who would sets who's getting

852
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:52,978
getting followed by the camera that

853
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:56,418
makes sense and I believe the person

854
00:39:52,978 --> 00:40:00,688
who's getting followed by the camera is

855
00:39:56,418 --> 00:40:03,208
handling here I think I can't quite

856
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:08,068
remember might not be let's see

857
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:11,278
camera follow ad player can follow two

858
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:13,858
equals Lindsey low index camera

859
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:18,358
following entity index is the thing that

860
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:19,798
I care about and hey there it is so when

861
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:22,168
we look through these guys and we find

862
00:40:19,798 --> 00:40:25,380
one of them we do our camera stuff here

863
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:27,929
and we set up the camera so that's seems

864
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,119
like that should all be working so I'm

865
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:32,189
not sure why it wouldn't be unless

866
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,189
camera following entity index is set

867
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:37,288
incorrectly and so what I suspect you

868
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:38,638
know could have happened there for all I

869
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:40,319
know we could have a situation where

870
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:43,979
like we never initialized any of those

871
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,898
things in fact now that I think about it

872
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:47,279
that's another thing we will have to do

873
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:49,829
because now we

874
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,330
to clear our stuff to zero when we start

875
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:52,159
up because that's our definition of how

876
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,090
everything is supposed to work

877
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,309
everything is supposed to be cleared to

878
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,019
zero and right now we're not actually

879
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:59,460
doing that right we're not actually

880
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:01,590
clearing the stuff to zero when we

881
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,309
allocate it for the first time and it's

882
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:08,400
expected to be right so what I would

883
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:11,279
probably suggest here and the way that I

884
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,380
would normally do this is I would

885
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,280
probably say our push truck should just

886
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:19,140
clear to zero when we do it right so

887
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,170
meaning like as we like as we push

888
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:25,529
things on those things should be should

889
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:28,190
be cleared and so in handmade H right

890
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:31,470
when I do push strecht

891
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:34,829
what I would do normally is say okay

892
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:36,449
whenever we do push size we would have

893
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:38,789
some kind of flag here that says whether

894
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:43,259
you should clear it to zero or not and

895
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:47,789
you know the default behavior is that it

896
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:49,950
does get cleared to zero so let's think

897
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:52,079
about this for a second how I might want

898
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:55,529
to do this I'm gonna grip for push

899
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,019
struct and just take a quick check and

900
00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,870
how often it's used so it's not really

901
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:03,420
that common you know we don't do very

902
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:05,909
much allocation as you can see in

903
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,730
general so it's pretty easy to take a

904
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:10,739
look at the places that we use it and

905
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,750
decide which ones of these we want to do

906
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:16,199
clear and which ones of these we don't

907
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:18,690
right so that's not a particularly

908
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,589
difficult thing to and and not really

909
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:26,809
something we probably have to worry

910
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:30,630
about too much okay

911
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:31,619
so this would be pretty straightforward

912
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,019
right

913
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,730
all we would have to do is after we do

914
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:39,869
our precise if we want to clear things

915
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:42,119
out we would just say after we get the

916
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:44,759
memory clear from the place where we did

917
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,569
the allocation through to its size and I

918
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,570
feel like we actually have a zero thing

919
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:54,120
somewhere maybe yes so we have the

920
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:57,240
concept of a zero size so really all we

921
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,868
have to do when we do a push size is we

922
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:04,409
just call a zero size after it

923
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:06,298
sit so right here when we do like okay

924
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:09,598
let's figure out what we're returning we

925
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:13,980
just do a zero size of the result and

926
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,200
however big that we said that it was you

927
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,759
know and we don't have to clear the

928
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:19,498
whole thing we only have to clear the

929
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:21,748
park that it actually that they actually

930
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:25,439
asked for so we could really just clear

931
00:43:21,748 --> 00:43:28,828
the size in it and off we go

932
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,039
so again the only reason not to just

933
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:33,990
literally do nothing with that and I'm

934
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:39,778
gonna have to grab that from down below

935
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:42,508
and bring it up here right the only

936
00:43:39,778 --> 00:43:49,409
reason not to do that literally exactly

937
00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:51,690
that is because I don't actually know if

938
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:53,338
there's somebody who does an allocation

939
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,858
of a big block of memory who doesn't

940
00:43:53,338 --> 00:44:00,358
really want to clear it I suspect that

941
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:03,298
for example the world when it allocates

942
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:05,190
its you know some of its space for

943
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:08,248
storage may not ever want to actually

944
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:11,818
clear it so that could be a performance

945
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:13,679
problem right and something that we

946
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:17,400
might want to address so that's that's

947
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:19,858
all just pointed that out right but yeah

948
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,420
so okay so as you can see that was

949
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:22,768
exactly the case because we expected

950
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,108
that stuff to be cleared to zero and it

951
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:28,108
wasn't now we have it clearing to zero

952
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:30,778
we're back to where we wanted to be and

953
00:44:28,108 --> 00:44:32,670
we can sort of do exactly what we would

954
00:44:30,778 --> 00:44:35,998
hope for which is you know switching

955
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:39,358
around between different modes of the

956
00:44:35,998 --> 00:44:42,179
game creating worlds and playing in them

957
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:45,498
and then going back to our meta game and

958
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:51,379
that all is is nice and happy and fun

959
00:44:45,498 --> 00:44:54,838
now we do have one problem to address

960
00:44:51,380 --> 00:45:00,989
like I said we have the the fact that

961
00:44:54,838 --> 00:45:02,338
the ground chunks are sort of like in

962
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:05,099
theory I should be able to get the

963
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:08,139
ground chunks to crash here if I if I

964
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:14,019
just you know if I

965
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:17,259
if I just like start things up and I I

966
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:19,179
like run to get the ground chunks going

967
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,540
and then clear it you know oh well

968
00:45:19,179 --> 00:45:22,989
alright so it's you just have to trust

969
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:28,360
me

970
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:31,149
I believe it it is it is I believe it is

971
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,410
possible to crash because the fill

972
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:34,090
ground chunks are running on a separate

973
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:34,929
thread they're accessing a world state

974
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,059
that can go away

975
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:38,889
they won't crash immediately necessarily

976
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:40,449
but they'll start accessing bogus memory

977
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:44,679
like memory that's being reused for

978
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:46,179
something else in theory it might be it

979
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:47,829
probably isn't getting reused for

980
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:48,819
something else right now and so that's

981
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,559
why it's still working

982
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:54,910
because it's just using the old memory

983
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:58,090
that's there but trust me it's a bug so

984
00:45:54,909 --> 00:46:02,409
we do also want the concept at some

985
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:05,050
point that whatever our whatever our

986
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:06,940
modes are if we do decide that we want

987
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,950
these sort of like background tasks key

988
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:12,039
things like if we want the ground chunks

989
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:14,799
there we would have to make sure that

990
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:16,599
when we shut down a mode we don't shut

991
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:26,410
it down until we can close down all of

992
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:27,969
its tasks you know that's all we just

993
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:32,259
need to make sure that multi-threading

994
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:35,589
stuff is is is shut down right you can

995
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,840
kind of think of it as like you know

996
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:40,180
like task based garbage collection if

997
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,750
you will right so instead of thinking of

998
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:45,549
things like like memory we're just

999
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,199
thinking of like actual tasks so this

1000
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,570
thing has spawned a bunch of tasks and

1001
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,549
we can't actually consider it shut down

1002
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:55,090
until all of those tasks have finished

1003
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,170
right it's sort of like reference

1004
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,430
counting is probably the right words

1005
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,659
that it's not really garbage collection

1006
00:46:57,429 --> 00:47:00,190
because garbage collection like searches

1007
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:02,949
through things so sound like that but

1008
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:04,570
like like a reference count right so you

1009
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:05,980
imagine like a reference counted pointer

1010
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,480
for memories like that it's sort of like

1011
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,860
that sort of thing but with tasks so

1012
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,260
we're like okay this thing has started

1013
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:16,960
end tasks and it has to wait for those

1014
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:19,420
end tasks to finish before it can be

1015
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,889
considered shut down so you would want

1016
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,369
to do that I don't know that we need to

1017
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:24,170
do that yet because

1018
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:29,089
it's I mean it's not really necessarily

1019
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:31,190
the best time to do it we could or we

1020
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,930
could we could leave it so I'm not sure

1021
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,730
but if we got Phil Gramm chunk here I'm

1022
00:47:32,929 --> 00:47:37,009
gonna go ahead and jump over there to

1023
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,750
note it because at the very least we got

1024
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:48,590
to make sure that we know so this is

1025
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:50,599
like to do AC important right something

1026
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:55,640
like this I don't know how I want that

1027
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:59,630
maybe like this it's probably fill

1028
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:04,900
ground chunk work will cause a crash if

1029
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:10,550
the mode goes away for the task finishes

1030
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:14,720
this must be shut down properly if we

1031
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:16,070
ship it okay so yeah like I said it's

1032
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:19,489
probably pretty hard to get it to crash

1033
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:21,920
but trust me it could crash if you'd if

1034
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:26,509
you did the stuff correctly if you did

1035
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:32,030
the right set of things I think it could

1036
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:36,050
crash all right uh so yeah I guess what

1037
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:39,920
I would say now is I kind of want that

1038
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:44,210
title screen to happen so what I would

1039
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,400
like to do is maybe start to figure out

1040
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:49,880
how that's gonna work I don't really

1041
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:53,630
know how that's going to work but you

1042
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,980
know like we just need something where

1043
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,250
it's going to show like a title screen

1044
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,809
some kind of a track MODY thing right

1045
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:02,210
and I probably should have asked

1046
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:08,179
yangshin to draw one but I haven't

1047
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:11,119
thought of it yet so I didn't but point

1048
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:13,669
being when we have the cutscene when we

1049
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,319
do update and render cutscene we're

1050
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:19,909
gonna get to a point where the cutscene

1051
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:22,789
is complete right and that's this thing

1052
00:49:19,909 --> 00:49:27,409
right here so if the cutscene is

1053
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:30,469
complete why that was set to if not

1054
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:32,859
cutscene complete render cutscene that

1055
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,859
time

1056
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:40,780
this is actually the wrong thing it's

1057
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:45,190
not cutscene complete its cutscene still

1058
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:49,269
running it's it's cutscene incomplete

1059
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:52,139
right because it's set to false and then

1060
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:55,000
it becomes true if we found something

1061
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:56,529
so yeah that's things still running

1062
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,750
maybe is the best phrase so that's just

1063
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:01,300
wrong terminology that was the exact

1064
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:04,719
opposite of what it actually was all

1065
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:07,990
right so we've got cutscene still

1066
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:10,029
running and so what we want to do is say

1067
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:13,598
like alright if the cutscene is not

1068
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:18,390
still running then what I'd like to do

1069
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:21,580
is switch to play title screen you know

1070
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:23,230
so at the end of the of the title screen

1071
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:27,519
I'm at the end of the cutscene it'll

1072
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:30,579
switch to the title screen and it'll do

1073
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:33,670
its thing and I'd like to do the same

1074
00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:35,170
thing with the title screen which is to

1075
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,990
say that the title screen will stay up

1076
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:39,608
for like 10 seconds or something and

1077
00:50:37,989 --> 00:50:41,979
then it will go back to the intro

1078
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:46,000
cutscene or something like that right

1079
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:47,769
and so yeah let's say that you know we

1080
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,349
go through here we check for meta input

1081
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:54,250
we do some thing where we're like I

1082
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:57,970
don't know what's happening something is

1083
00:50:54,250 --> 00:51:01,659
happening and so then we say like okay

1084
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:03,489
you know render cutting the time this

1085
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:06,159
this sort of exact thing happens right

1086
00:51:03,489 --> 00:51:09,250
so it basically says like okay

1087
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:14,949
title screen t + equals input DT for

1088
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:17,139
frame so we accumulate time and of

1089
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:19,750
course we will just always check when

1090
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:23,969
we're doing that we'll say if the title

1091
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:27,838
screen T is greater than the 10 second

1092
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:32,799
time that we said that we want it to be

1093
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:37,829
then we'll go and and switch to the

1094
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,830
intro cutscene right

1095
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:47,829
something like that so yeah starting to

1096
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:50,259
get a roughly where I want but there's

1097
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:53,590
still one more big change and in fact I

1098
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:55,930
could sort of show you why there's a big

1099
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:57,789
problem that we still have to sort of

1100
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:59,199
address and maybe I'll do that in the

1101
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:01,119
last couple seconds servers got about

1102
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,779
five minutes left so let me just do this

1103
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,119
part first and then we can we I can show

1104
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,670
you the thing that I think we still want

1105
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,920
to do before we consider this part of

1106
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:14,680
the game sort of you know in a

1107
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:18,010
reasonable state what I would like to do

1108
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:21,279
first is I'd like to verify that we're

1109
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:22,960
actually making our update and render

1110
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,150
tunnel screen thing but that's actually

1111
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,608
working so I'm gonna put it clear in

1112
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:29,920
here so that when we are doing this this

1113
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:32,469
thing we just we can see like a Reds a

1114
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:36,940
red screen or something right so we

1115
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:40,118
clear it out and that's all good okay

1116
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,980
it's still running so what I'm gonna do

1117
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:43,510
just to make sure that that so we can

1118
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:48,608
kind of test that is I'm gonna go ahead

1119
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:51,550
and and run it and I'm gonna run it in

1120
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:53,559
the reverse order so when we initialize

1121
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:55,030
this first instead of playing intro

1122
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,009
cutscene I'm going to do play title

1123
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:59,830
screen so I can see that part of it

1124
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,700
working and then we'll kind of go from

1125
00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:04,719
there

1126
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:06,489
alright so we fade out and now we've got

1127
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:09,639
this this is our title screen

1128
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:14,618
quote-unquote right and after it's up

1129
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:19,389
for ten seconds it should switch to the

1130
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:21,039
in crow cutscene which it does and so

1131
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:23,319
now we've got both modes going and

1132
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,550
hopefully you know we can also we could

1133
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:30,519
speed this up a little bit just to make

1134
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:37,660
sure where's our DT at let's see let's

1135
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:39,280
see right here we could go ahead and

1136
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:41,069
speed that up so it doesn't take so long

1137
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:46,080
if that makes sense

1138
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:56,250
whoa what happened there

1139
00:53:46,079 --> 00:54:03,869
I don't know cutscene still running

1140
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:06,809
we're cutting that time I don't know why

1141
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:11,460
that why changing that would have had

1142
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:13,670
that effect oh yes I do so the thing

1143
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,539
that I said I would show you in a couple

1144
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,940
after are thrown with this I actually

1145
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:19,650
showed you just now so the thing that I

1146
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:22,230
was trying to say that I think is busted

1147
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:23,599
that we want to fix is if you think

1148
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,760
about what's happening here

1149
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,619
right now because of the way that we

1150
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:31,020
happen to be doing our modes only one

1151
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:34,679
mode exists at any time which means that

1152
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:36,630
inside a particular mode once you switch

1153
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:39,569
to a new mode you can't ever do anything

1154
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:42,920
else right because the instant I try to

1155
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:46,769
access like this cutscene T for example

1156
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:49,559
it's actually wrong there is no more

1157
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:51,630
cutscene right because I might have

1158
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:54,750
gotten rid of the whole cutscene

1159
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:57,780
structure right here that make sense and

1160
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:59,789
so what I would like to do as one more

1161
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,740
step in the process is make it so we can

1162
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:03,239
have multiple these existing at once so

1163
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:05,699
that when we create a new one that we're

1164
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:07,709
going to switch to we don't switch to it

1165
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:09,299
immediately we delay until we're done

1166
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:10,829
processing this whole thing so we don't

1167
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:16,320
have to make sure that we only ever do

1168
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:18,900
it at the end right that's what I would

1169
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,030
prefer now you know you can still always

1170
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,260
structure the code this way and you

1171
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,000
wouldn't probably have to worry too much

1172
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:30,720
about it but it's still you know like I

1173
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:33,329
said it's not right that way anyways so

1174
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,489
let's see how this goes see if we let's

1175
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,840
see if we got more bugs here I don't

1176
00:55:35,489 --> 00:55:38,849
actually know that was the bug I was

1177
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,380
just noticing the fact I was like up we

1178
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:43,860
have the bug I said I was gonna put in

1179
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:45,300
we actually had it already sorry so

1180
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:48,960
we're exhuming through the cutscene at

1181
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:52,460
10 times 10x speed here which is you

1182
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,590
know a nice fast forward way to watch

1183
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:02,119
there we go

1184
00:55:54,590 --> 00:56:04,519
there we go and back to the title screen

1185
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:07,219
so good so now we just need a title

1186
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:08,900
screen but once we actually have a title

1187
00:56:07,219 --> 00:56:10,819
screen which we'll do I don't know we'll

1188
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,039
do something then we're going to go we

1189
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,210
can go into the game presumably there it

1190
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,559
is

1191
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:17,449
and we can get out of the game

1192
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,159
presumably there that is and we can quit

1193
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:21,259
so now we're getting a little further

1194
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:22,719
getting a little further we're not there

1195
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,340
yet but we're getting a little further

1196
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:27,469
so that's good so I'm gonna go ahead and

1197
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:30,740
call that for today because now we've

1198
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:33,259
got got sort of more of a a little bit

1199
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:40,399
of a game experience going and so that's

1200
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:43,540
something we can build upon all right so

1201
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,539
let's go ahead and go to the Q&amp;A

1202
00:56:57,019 --> 00:57:01,650
soy sauce the kid could you leverage

1203
00:56:59,909 --> 00:57:03,569
your debug code when trying to find the

1204
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,490
right values you want for inter cutscene

1205
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:07,920
and real time instead of recompiling yes

1206
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:10,079
we could although we didn't quite get to

1207
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,780
the point where the debug code was all

1208
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,880
finished right so that's why I'm not

1209
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,320
using it is because we still have more

1210
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,789
work to do there before we can actually

1211
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:22,140
start employing it for any real purpose

1212
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:23,369
Carlino Bleu has some credits and boom

1213
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:27,509
we're done yeah we could just be like

1214
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:28,889
look that's it you know you know we said

1215
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,390
there was going to be a game and what we

1216
00:57:28,889 --> 00:57:33,420
meant by that was that there's like an

1217
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:38,849
intro cutscene and some credits it's

1218
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:44,030
fine Danny guac how do you terminate or

1219
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:47,789
end each thread at the end at the end of

1220
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:49,710
at the end of what at the end of the

1221
00:57:47,789 --> 00:57:56,099
whole executable do you mean when when

1222
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:57,720
like the game closes this is Atticus

1223
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:01,860
what are your thoughts on twitch asking

1224
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:04,199
you to switch labels to creative do I do

1225
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,000
not care it's their service and wherever

1226
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:10,259
they want to put us as it's pretty much

1227
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,730
fine with me you know I most people who

1228
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,980
come to handmade hero come because they

1229
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:16,530
heard about it from like me on Twitter

1230
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,179
or somebody else telling them about if

1231
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:22,830
they don't they don't find it through

1232
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:25,139
twitch so I don't super care where they

1233
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:27,509
put us and so if they think that more

1234
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:29,549
people will find it under creative and

1235
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:31,110
that's what they would prefer that's you

1236
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:32,280
know that's fine with me because they

1237
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:34,940
would know better than I would and

1238
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,940
honestly I don't care

1239
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,880
will we be re-implemented the profiler

1240
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:44,639
yeah I mean when we when we get to the

1241
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,349
point where I want that heads up stuff

1242
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:48,389
which is not probably that far away I

1243
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:51,710
want to go finish the debug code thing

1244
00:58:48,389 --> 00:58:51,710
that we have so we could see it

1245
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:03,670
Danny Gregg the end of disputable so

1246
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:06,429
when the executable exits we don't need

1247
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:09,430
to close the threads when the executable

1248
00:59:06,429 --> 00:59:10,389
exits we can just immediately close and

1249
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:11,679
we don't really have to do anything

1250
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:16,029
right

1251
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:19,449
so what I believe happens when we do

1252
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:21,930
quick requested right so when we fall

1253
00:59:19,449 --> 00:59:24,250
out of this loop the global running loop

1254
00:59:21,929 --> 00:59:26,139
what's going to happen is when we come

1255
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:30,820
out through here and we do this return

1256
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:33,639
zero we're gonna dump into the C runtime

1257
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:35,410
library external code and it's gonna

1258
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:38,559
call exit process which will just kill

1259
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:40,329
every threat including ours so we don't

1260
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:44,730
have to do anything to shut down threads

1261
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:44,730
they're just gonna die and that's it

1262
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:01,639
all right so food could you read explain

1263
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:04,880
why you couldn't move the hero after

1264
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:06,650
cutscenes for a while do you mean just

1265
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,059
because we had the code commented out I

1266
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,440
mean the only reason was just cuz we had

1267
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:10,969
the code commented out because we hadn't

1268
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,858
quite ported it over yet was the only

1269
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:17,598
reason that was happening in this

1270
01:00:12,858 --> 01:00:19,250
episode no VIN if someone wants to run

1271
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,070
your game in full-screen but at a

1272
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:24,050
different resolution than native how

1273
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:26,269
would they change it you said before you

1274
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,580
don't like menus so would you use a

1275
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:32,420
launcher instead or something for those

1276
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:35,239
options so I'm not sure I would probably

1277
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:39,108
prefer it if it could be in like the

1278
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:40,879
steam launcher on Steam so that when you

1279
01:00:39,108 --> 01:00:42,259
like play the game it has a thing that

1280
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,500
just says how do you want to run it and

1281
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:47,359
part of the reason for that is because I

1282
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,608
don't really like the I don't really

1283
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:54,289
like switching resolutions in the game

1284
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:56,059
because you might if the game starts up

1285
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:58,849
in a resolution that's actually broken

1286
01:00:56,059 --> 01:01:00,920
you can't get to the option menu to

1287
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:04,970
change it because you can't see anything

1288
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:07,579
right and so I usually prefer it if you

1289
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:11,358
can set if there's a setting like that

1290
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:15,230
that could potentially break and click a

1291
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:18,019
completely break then my preference is

1292
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:19,519
to have that be settable outside so that

1293
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:22,159
if the user gets themselves into a

1294
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:27,858
circumstance where they like cannot

1295
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:29,659
recover right then then they can they

1296
01:01:27,858 --> 01:01:31,639
can fix it so my preference would be

1297
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:33,440
that would be in like the steam in when

1298
01:01:31,639 --> 01:01:34,789
you hit like launch on Steam or you

1299
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,900
could right click on it and steam and

1300
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:37,519
you know how steam has those little

1301
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,900
things it's like parameters my

1302
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:40,009
preference would be that's in there so

1303
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,789
if someone wants to change it they

1304
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:46,359
change it but in general I would like it

1305
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:49,190
to always just run meaning Michael

1306
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:50,420
people like a lot of settings II sort of

1307
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:53,960
stuff and I hate that because I just

1308
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:56,150
want the thing to run and I expect users

1309
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,220
to not have to care about things like

1310
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,500
the resolution so I want my the game to

1311
01:01:58,219 --> 01:02:04,789
like choose the right thing and the only

1312
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:06,440
time that someone the only time that

1313
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:07,940
someone should ever even be thinking

1314
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,619
about that stuff is if they're like a

1315
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,179
very technical person and want to fuss

1316
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:12,680
with things so like it

1317
01:02:11,179 --> 01:02:14,598
my opinion like command line parameter

1318
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:15,889
or like things like that is where that

1319
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:17,568
chef should live that should not be

1320
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:19,608
something that the average person who

1321
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:22,550
doesn't know or care what a resolution

1322
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:24,199
even is should never be seeing that they

1323
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:26,839
should not be seeing those things in a

1324
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:29,539
game in the same way that when you go to

1325
01:02:26,838 --> 01:02:32,029
like watch a movie you know on Netflix

1326
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:34,009
you're not you don't see these things

1327
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:35,869
they're not there right you just push

1328
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:37,490
play and it put pics the highest

1329
01:02:35,869 --> 01:02:39,318
resolution your stream can handle and

1330
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:41,088
then if you're somebody who really cares

1331
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:42,619
maybe you can go in and tweak some

1332
01:02:41,088 --> 01:02:45,409
settings and tell like oh don't do that

1333
01:02:42,619 --> 01:02:47,180
or whatever right but but I don't like

1334
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:51,710
that like I think things should just

1335
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:53,808
work and always and then if you are

1336
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:56,838
somebody who is very technical and and

1337
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:59,119
you know wants to tweak things then I'm

1338
01:02:56,838 --> 01:03:01,730
all for having tweakable parameters but

1339
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,619
they should be completely they should be

1340
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:06,139
in like a very specific technical place

1341
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:08,780
that has nothing to do with what the

1342
01:03:06,139 --> 01:03:16,519
normal person will ever see when they

1343
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:18,019
launch the game insofar as could you do

1344
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:20,500
some resolution detection at startup to

1345
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:23,809
avoid starting at a brick resolution no

1346
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:25,789
you can you have no idea why your

1347
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:27,250
resolution might be broken like windows

1348
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:29,900
may be up and running just fine

1349
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,670
it may report the monitor is supporting

1350
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,559
the resolution you're at but in actually

1351
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:36,680
either monitor doesn't and the user is

1352
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:38,798
seeing nothing right now right so

1353
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:41,179
there's really nothing you can do but

1354
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:43,280
what we're doing on here right now is

1355
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:45,409
obviously the safest thing to do which

1356
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,910
is always launch in the desktop

1357
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:49,068
resolution because you know whoever

1358
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:50,808
launched you was looking at a screen

1359
01:03:49,068 --> 01:03:52,759
that worked because they had to be here

1360
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:57,440
they couldn't have launched you so

1361
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:59,480
that's why I usually prefer always

1362
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,548
launching at that resident whatever the

1363
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,750
resolution is that the users running at

1364
01:04:01,548 --> 01:04:04,548
you just stay there

1365
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:10,159
don't change it leave it what it is and

1366
01:04:04,548 --> 01:04:12,259
then if there's a user who wants you

1367
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:17,179
know to have all this extra extra

1368
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:19,819
control right then that person should go

1369
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:22,250
edit you know what some kind of config

1370
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:23,989
file that is like okay just so you know

1371
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,949
if you're touching this file we just

1372
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:26,598
expect you know

1373
01:04:24,949 --> 01:04:29,299
doing and we're just going to obey

1374
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:31,160
whatever you put in there so go nuts but

1375
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,240
we're not responsible what happens

1376
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:34,239
I prefer that sort of thing

1377
01:04:45,269 --> 01:04:51,119
and when even let's see says you say

1378
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:53,309
normal person as if tech-savvy people is

1379
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,500
something awful no not really they're

1380
01:04:53,309 --> 01:04:58,860
just not the average case maybe I should

1381
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,750
say average person meaning the person

1382
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:03,360
who knows what a resolution is is not

1383
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:05,070
the average person anymore like it used

1384
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,780
to be that if you were someone who

1385
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:08,130
played games on a computer you

1386
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,440
absolutely knew what a resolution was

1387
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:12,720
right I mean like in 1980 it's probably

1388
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:15,030
no one playing a game on a computer that

1389
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,409
could switch resolutions that didn't

1390
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,790
know what that was maybe but nowadays

1391
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:19,440
people might have absolutely no idea

1392
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,070
what resolution they're even running and

1393
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,840
you're asking like what's your

1394
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:23,100
resolution that you're running in right

1395
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,180
now and they might like I have no idea

1396
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:28,829
right and so that's the average case

1397
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:30,239
like you know if someone's playing on

1398
01:05:28,829 --> 01:05:31,289
their phone or whatever it's like what's

1399
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:32,699
the resolution that phone they're like I

1400
01:05:31,289 --> 01:05:33,869
don't know maybe they knew when they

1401
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:35,639
picked out the phone cuz they looked in

1402
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:36,839
one unlike the sticker it said like this

1403
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:40,650
is higher resolution than that or

1404
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:42,180
something but you know so yeah so when I

1405
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:46,289
say normal person what I really mean is

1406
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:48,089
average person or person who doesn't

1407
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:49,800
care about technology I mean maybe

1408
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:52,860
they're not maybe they are not actually

1409
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:55,070
average but yeah so the common case

1410
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:57,840
should be person doesn't know or care

1411
01:05:55,070 --> 01:06:00,390
what their thing is running in they

1412
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:03,210
forgot what a resolution was after they

1413
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:05,129
went to Best Buy and bought a TV or

1414
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,840
whatever happened that was the last time

1415
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:10,079
they thought about resolution and so it

1416
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:12,390
doesn't matter right so that's the goal

1417
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:16,469
is it just works as much as possible it

1418
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:17,969
always just works but you know it would

1419
01:06:16,469 --> 01:06:19,469
be nice like I said to have like the

1420
01:06:17,969 --> 01:06:21,750
ability to create a start up file or

1421
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:24,029
pass parameters so that people who want

1422
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:25,440
to play around with something like

1423
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:27,330
people who want to force this was every

1424
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,700
framerate want to force the specific

1425
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:33,299
resolution want to force whatever you

1426
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:35,549
know we can allow them to have that

1427
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:37,860
ability to tweak but that's not going to

1428
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:41,840
be in a menu that like people would

1429
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,840
normally see right

1430
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:06,540
and yeah I would agree that I don't

1431
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:08,670
think people really know much about

1432
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:10,769
resolution other than like oh I should

1433
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:13,108
get 1080p or is that a 1080p thing or

1434
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:17,130
whatever and the fact that like it's

1435
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:19,318
gonna get worse because 4k now like what

1436
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:22,050
does that mean 4k isn't even a

1437
01:07:19,318 --> 01:07:24,989
resolution as far as I can tell 4k is

1438
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:28,710
like a family of resolutions that are at

1439
01:07:24,989 --> 01:07:30,659
least double 1080p but like I've seen

1440
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:33,059
different things described at described

1441
01:07:30,659 --> 01:07:36,960
as 4k that each have a different

1442
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:39,990
resolution right so people say like oh

1443
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:45,088
that's a 4k monitor it's like okay is it

1444
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:47,189
you know is it 1920 times 1920 by 1080

1445
01:07:45,088 --> 01:07:50,849
times 4 right so is it like is it for

1446
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:53,010
1920 by 1080 screens or is it one of

1447
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:57,210
these like 5000 by something that's

1448
01:07:53,010 --> 01:08:00,349
actually more than then for 1920 by 1080

1449
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,349
screens right

1450
01:08:30,009 --> 01:08:38,600
so looks like there's no more queue

1451
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:45,650
colons so I think I am done in sohbat is

1452
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:47,029
going nuts by the way steel golem do you

1453
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:48,559
generally do cutscene code before

1454
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:58,880
gameplay code when you're working on a

1455
01:08:48,560 --> 01:09:01,548
game so I guess what I would say is I

1456
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:05,980
don't consider cutscene code or game

1457
01:09:01,548 --> 01:09:05,979
code to necessarily have any particular

1458
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:14,420
place in the development timeline I

1459
01:09:11,048 --> 01:09:17,179
usually try to sort them by what I think

1460
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:21,440
is most appropriate for that project so

1461
01:09:17,179 --> 01:09:23,899
for example let's say that the cutscene

1462
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:25,460
art is very labor-intensive and needs to

1463
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:28,250
get overlapped with the development of

1464
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:30,798
the game to a large extent then I may do

1465
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:33,259
the cutscene code very early to make

1466
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:34,399
sure that the cutscene artists know what

1467
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:39,170
they're dealing with and there are no

1468
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:41,929
surprises right but if that was not the

1469
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:46,039
case I may just leave the cutscene code

1470
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:47,390
to the very last because if I don't it

1471
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:48,948
because it doesn't affect the gameplay

1472
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,750
and doesn't need to be prototyped or

1473
01:09:48,948 --> 01:09:52,338
anything like that then there's no point

1474
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:58,969
in doing it early it doesn't matter

1475
01:09:52,338 --> 01:10:00,769
right so I feel like in general as a

1476
01:09:58,969 --> 01:10:03,529
programmer when you're thinking about

1477
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:05,270
what to do when you need to make sure

1478
01:10:03,529 --> 01:10:06,969
that for whatever projects are working

1479
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:11,120
on you make the best decision for

1480
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:14,029
putting the technology development get

1481
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:16,550
it getting it out of the way of the art

1482
01:10:14,029 --> 01:10:18,769
team as much as possible and that may be

1483
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,029
doing cutscenes first and maybe doing

1484
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:23,469
cutscenes the middle it may be doing

1485
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:28,309
cutscenes last you know who knows right

1486
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:29,810
and so that's that's really what the way

1487
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:31,760
you should think about it not like do I

1488
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:33,199
not like what's the rule do you know

1489
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,250
cutscene code for its gameplay code for

1490
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:35,419
its like that's the wrong way think

1491
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,979
about the right way to think about it is

1492
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:39,800
what are the dependencies in this

1493
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:43,279
project and how do I make sure that I

1494
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:45,038
schedule my dev time too

1495
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:47,658
line up as much as possible with with

1496
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:50,090
illuminating those dependencies in the

1497
01:10:47,658 --> 01:10:54,948
in the order that benefits the game and

1498
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:57,590
so for handmade hero the reason we did

1499
01:10:54,948 --> 01:10:59,569
the cutscene code now was actually

1500
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:01,400
exacts a mentality I was just thinking

1501
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:05,658
to myself well what's the thing we could

1502
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:07,189
do that's like gonna use our renderer

1503
01:11:05,658 --> 01:11:08,808
and that we could play with here and

1504
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:11,479
that yangshin could do the art for that

1505
01:11:08,809 --> 01:11:13,070
doesn't rely too much on the gameplay so

1506
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:15,678
that she can be working on are

1507
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:17,750
productively before we necessarily know

1508
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,550
certain things about our gameplay that

1509
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:21,319
maybe require us to implement them and

1510
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:23,179
so on so forth right because handmade

1511
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:24,590
here is a very odd project because you

1512
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:26,480
know at an hour and night the

1513
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:28,099
programming goes way slower than the art

1514
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:30,019
goes whereas normally like the

1515
01:11:28,099 --> 01:11:33,650
programming could go way faster than the

1516
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:34,909
art not a per click on handmade hero it

1517
01:11:33,649 --> 01:11:37,988
would it should really be the other way

1518
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:42,500
around probably and so you know I just

1519
01:11:37,988 --> 01:11:44,569
sort things more by like what works out

1520
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,939
well for the streaming nature of the

1521
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:48,439
show as opposed to how I would sort it

1522
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:49,578
if I knew that I was gonna like okay I'm

1523
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:53,058
gonna do four months of programming and

1524
01:11:49,578 --> 01:11:55,340
do all the code for am a hero you know

1525
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,788
just by myself how am I gonna stretch

1526
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:58,010
turret

1527
01:11:55,788 --> 01:11:59,538
I wouldn't did you know the order in

1528
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:01,789
which I do things might be very

1529
01:11:59,538 --> 01:12:04,130
different because I might go like oh

1530
01:12:01,788 --> 01:12:05,359
okay like I'm gonna blitz this part of

1531
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:07,239
it out and then do this but like you

1532
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,618
know I I really try to make sure that

1533
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:11,750
that we do things in the order that will

1534
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:14,658
make it easiest to learn on the stream

1535
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:16,578
which affects you know some of the

1536
01:12:14,658 --> 01:12:18,288
decisions about major components right

1537
01:12:16,578 --> 01:12:20,769
and what order they we do or don't do

1538
01:12:18,288 --> 01:12:20,769
things in

1539
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:34,989
was there any other cues I missed are we

1540
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:38,889
in a point where we're close to have to

1541
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:40,239
need to implement mix-ins it depends

1542
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:43,480
whether we just push on through to the

1543
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:46,510
gameplay code now which we might and if

1544
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:47,889
we do that then yes if I decide to go

1545
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:54,039
back and finish up a few other things

1546
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:56,230
then possibly not so I don't know primer

1547
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:59,140
script will C++ 17 modules solve the

1548
01:12:56,229 --> 01:13:02,919
include dependency problem I just always

1549
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:04,570
assumed that no c++ Committee additions

1550
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,560
to the language will solve any problem

1551
01:13:04,569 --> 01:13:10,619
because they never do

1552
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:14,530
in fact you witnessed that you witnessed

1553
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:16,720
exactly what I think of the C++

1554
01:13:14,529 --> 01:13:19,059
committee happening on the stream quite

1555
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:21,850
literally the one time we tried to use a

1556
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:23,560
new feature which was deckle type it

1557
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:25,690
didn't work and it didn't work because

1558
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:28,120
they expect it so poorly that the case

1559
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:32,169
we want to use it for it can't be used

1560
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:35,260
for right and that's like that's my

1561
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:37,239
entire thing about the C++ therapy all

1562
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:40,420
they ever do is introduce features that

1563
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:43,149
don't actually work right and so I don't

1564
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:45,640
even bother anymore so I don't know

1565
01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:46,929
whether the C++ modules solve the

1566
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:49,420
include dependence problem because I

1567
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:53,320
haven't looked at them but I also know

1568
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:56,170
that no they won't because somehow they

1569
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:58,750
will do something that makes it so that

1570
01:13:56,170 --> 01:14:03,210
the average case that a smart programmer

1571
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:06,939
would want to use them for it won't work

1572
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:09,670
they will I guarantee you that is what

1573
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:11,379
they'll do because every time they've

1574
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:14,409
ever added a feature to the language

1575
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:16,170
they have managed to do it no matter how

1576
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:22,479
simple that feature should have been

1577
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:28,140
they do it so yes I will be shocked to

1578
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:30,669
find that is not the case for modules

1579
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:32,829
pleasantly shocked I supposed I would

1580
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:34,840
would be what I'd find but basically the

1581
01:14:32,829 --> 01:14:40,729
chance of that I think is you know zero

1582
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:42,110
so and with that let's go ahead and yeah

1583
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:44,359
and that deco type thing was hilarious

1584
01:14:42,109 --> 01:14:46,699
cuz Italy I'm so glad that that was

1585
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:50,779
captured on stream because it's like I

1586
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:51,739
always say that but you know is maybe

1587
01:14:50,779 --> 01:14:53,149
I'm just being

1588
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:55,099
maybe I'm just a dream it's like no it's

1589
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:59,029
like you actually saw it we only tried

1590
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:01,880
to use one C++ feature up from the new

1591
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:04,189
thing on the stream and it didn't work

1592
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:06,409
for this super simple case like all we

1593
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:07,699
wanted to do was get the type of

1594
01:15:06,409 --> 01:15:09,229
something so we could find out how big

1595
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:11,119
it was it's like it can't do that

1596
01:15:09,229 --> 01:15:12,379
it's like it turns out if you want to

1597
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,869
use it for that you have to create like

1598
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:16,369
a template to like force it to map it

1599
01:15:14,869 --> 01:15:19,789
right it was like and you're like yep

1600
01:15:16,369 --> 01:15:22,760
that's that's the C++ center Committee

1601
01:15:19,789 --> 01:15:24,260
don't know how to program and always

1602
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:26,420
create things that that a real

1603
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:30,500
programmer can't actually use without

1604
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:32,149
this huge like you know gigantic

1605
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,739
investment in doing something that

1606
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:35,599
should have been like one simple

1607
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:38,719
function that worked right it's

1608
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:41,480
hilarious I mean it it's hilarious

1609
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:43,130
because if you don't laugh at it you'll

1610
01:15:41,479 --> 01:15:46,159
cry because it's the language you have

1611
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:50,239
to use and it's you know it's

1612
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:51,979
incompetently managed so anyway enough

1613
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:53,899

1647
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:05,420

for the last time in awhile tomorrow

1652
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:19,519
Friday 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time

1653
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:22,550
unfortunately I will be away over

1654
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,989
Christmas break so I will not have

1655
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:27,650
access to the machine and can't stream

1656
01:17:23,988 --> 01:17:29,618
so there will be at least a week of

1657
01:17:27,649 --> 01:17:32,448
downtime probably a little bit more

1658
01:17:29,618 --> 01:17:36,109
until I get back to Seattle and can

1659
01:17:32,448 --> 01:17:38,868
actually stream this series so for our

1660
01:17:36,109 --> 01:17:40,308
final stream for awhile tomorrow I hope

1661
01:17:38,868 --> 01:17:42,469
to see you guys back here for that we

1662
01:17:40,309 --> 01:17:43,849
can finish up some of our mood stuff and

1663
01:17:42,469 --> 01:17:44,750
then we'll have Christmas break to think

1664
01:17:43,849 --> 01:17:47,000
about what it is that we're gonna

1665
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:49,099
implement we come back because I guess

1666
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,328
we'll have to sort of think about that a

1667
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:55,819
little bit more anyway that's it for for

1668
01:17:53,328 --> 01:17:57,380
this episode and of course I can't

1669
01:17:55,819 --> 01:17:59,859
actually ask there we go I got a exit

1670
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:02,059

01:17:59,859 --> 01:18:04,868

1672
01:18:02,059 --> 01:18:04,869
