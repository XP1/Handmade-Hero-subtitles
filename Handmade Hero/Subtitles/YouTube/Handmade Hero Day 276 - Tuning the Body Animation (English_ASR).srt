1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,278
start recurring hello everyone and

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:08,279
welcome to handmade here are the show we

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:11,339
could complete game live on stream we

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,320
are well you know we're at an

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:15,269
interesting place because we've been

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,320
doing some animation code and we're

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,109
gonna have to start making some hard

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,269
decisions about how we're gonna do some

9
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:22,920
not not hard code decisions but hard

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:25,469
like essentially aesthetic decisions

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,539
which is not really our job because

12
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:30,570
we're the game programmer not the

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,949
designer and not the artist but what are

14
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,090
you gonna do in a situation where you're

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,100
doing a game mostly on your own as we do

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,280
on animate here oh here you don't really

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,590
have the ability to say hey someone else

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,910
should tell me so we have to make some

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,289
decisions and we'll go ahead and make

20
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,759
those decisions today or at least our

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,230
first pass at them this is day 276 so if

22
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,939
you would like to follow along at home

23
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,819
you're gonna want to unpack day 275

24
00:00:53,939 --> 00:01:00,659
source code let's jump in here and take

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,308
a little bit of a look at where we where

26
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,179
we were so I'm going to open up for read

27
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,879
here

28
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:09,478
and I'm gonna open up my handmade

29
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:12,658
project and then I am going to run it

30
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:16,438
and show you what the problem is that we

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,750
will need to solve it's a little bit of

32
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,919
a tricky problem alright so here is our

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,290
little handmade hero fellow and he's

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,060
working actually kind of really great in

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,159
terms of what I actually wanted to see

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,109
happen in the game and as I've explained

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,030
before the game design calls for the

38
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,159
fact that the essentially the head moves

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,978
separately from the body the body is

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
always on a square and the head can move

41
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,459
around freely and that's what we've

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,548
implemented here you can kind of see it

43
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,199
happening and so actually everything is

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,360
is totally fine

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm totally happy with exactly what

46
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,078
we've got going on here except for the

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,210
fact that if you look at what ends up

48
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:00,868
happening if we just do a standard sort

49
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,849
of like a blind stretch of the body to

50
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:05,250
reach the head and we haven't accounted

51
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,239
for the bobbing yet so we have to

52
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,038
stretch it even a little more you can

53
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,659
see that it kind of comes separated so

54
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,189
we have to stretch the head out even

55
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,209
more than I mean stretch the body out

56
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,348
even more than we're currently

57
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,878
stretching it

58
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:17,729
basically what I'm concerned about is

59
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,108
just the fact that that is I don't know

60
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,908
if I'm gonna be able to make that look

61
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:22,379
good enough I mean certainly like you

62
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,998
can see when we're moving straight up

63
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,759
and down here it's a little bit of a

64
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:27,989
problem and so the question is just can

65
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,638
we make this look good enough now

66
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,370
there's a few things that I think will

67
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:34,139
help one is that the final artwork which

68
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,218
we will probably start switching to at

69
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:41,669
some point here is more top-down than

70
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:43,318
this is so we're maybe potentially I

71
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,209
don't know but we're maybe in the worst

72
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,798
case for what I want to do here because

73
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,128
the hero is sort of drawn straight up

74
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:52,109
and down and I told young-shin for the

75
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,729
final versions of everything that we're

76
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:55,019
doing is that that we're gonna be more

77
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,548
top-down we're not going to be

78
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,218
completely top-down so it won't just be

79
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,680
a head but like a top of a head that

80
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:04,739
you're seeing but we're gonna be more

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,049
top-down right and so what that means is

82
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,599
that you know contrary to the way that

83
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:12,989
it looks on the screen now I'll draw out

84
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,459
quickly here you know right now we've

85
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,099
got a sort of a situation looks like

86
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,438
this so obviously any motion of the head

87
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,959
needs to have a corresponding motion of

88
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:27,000
the neck because otherwise you're gonna

89
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,590
end up with it detaching obviously in a

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,169
situation where it looks a little bit

91
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,878
more like this where you know it's sort

92
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:38,009
of more this way so you've kind of got a

93
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,948
top-down where the the the body and I'm

94
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:45,958
not drawing a very good job drawing this

95
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:48,180
but you know something more like this so

96
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,370
it's a lot more top-down in the top of

97
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,620
the head you know is here whatever maybe

98
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,229
I'll draw the nose in so it's like this

99
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:01,680
kind of a thing right in that sense that

100
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:04,379
the head can move around a lot more

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,090
without appearing to be that the two

102
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,938
bowels appear to be detached in the body

103
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,259
because the body is actually right it's

104
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:14,188
like a thing that looks like this and

105
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:16,680
the head is like quite a bit over it so

106
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:19,048
it can move around and not maybe look as

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,668
bad especially not in our sort of iconic

108
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:22,709
art style right we're not trying to

109
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:24,839
render something that looks real

110
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:26,729
we've got a sort of cartoony playful

111
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,439
style so you know people are

112
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,270
expecting it to even a thought Call of

113
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,279
Duty the head doesn't have to attach to

114
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:35,009
the body in a anatomically correct way

115
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,039
or anything like this so I think it's

116
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,480
not quite as bad as it appears here but

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,000
it still is a little bit of a problem

118
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,090
like I think even after that we're still

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,850
gonna have situations where you know we

120
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:50,009
just have issues with how the body ends

121
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,960
up being you know in like in situations

122
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,370
like this if we want to still remain

123
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,029
connected I think we're gonna have to

124
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,459
work on

125
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:59,489
we can't just sheer it arbitrarily and

126
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:01,649
expect that to be you know a viable

127
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,990
solution so I think what we want to do

128
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:06,029
now is kind of see if we can play with

129
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,259
these routines and like I said figure

130
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:09,239
out a way to make it so that in

131
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,980
situations where it's you know it's iffy

132
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,139
like that you know when I'm right on the

133
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,060
line there like that situation there see

134
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,879
what we can do to kind of make it

135
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,610
we got a I want to know by the way why

136
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,670
we don't have any collision happening on

137
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,650
the on that on this wall because you

138
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:29,340
ever notice like if you collide with

139
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:31,709
these you actually hit them but if you

140
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,489
collide with the sides you don't I don't

141
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:36,269
know why that is

142
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,620
I literally have no idea I'm sure it's a

143
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,919
very simple explanation but since we

144
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,160
never looked at it right like I can't I

145
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,350
cannot go past these trees up or down

146
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,900
but I can go past the ones on the left

147
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,960
and the right which I have like no

148
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:54,359
reason I don't know why at all and so

149
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,680
it's kind of crazy so anyway but that's

150
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,139
okay that's not what we're looking at

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
now anyway and we did eliminate the

152
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,469
collision detection for our guys in a

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,970
couple ways so you know maybe it makes

154
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,000
sense I don't know does not matter to me

155
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,530
point being it may be that we're not

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,540
doing collision detection at all and we

157
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:11,039
we're doing some kind of weird look up

158
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,000
with points we'll get to that when we

159
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,590
get to it

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,209
point being that's what we kind of want

161
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,339
to do today so I want to just get that

162
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:19,289
see what we can do to to minimize that a

163
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,389
little bit and then when we put the

164
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,610
final artwork in there we can hope that

165
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,560
that'll if anything just make things a

166
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,900
little bit better and we won't have to

167
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:32,790
worry too much about anything beyond

168
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:35,009
that so let's start with let's start

169
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,260
with a few things here so what I'd like

170
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:38,560
to do first is I'd like to move the head

171
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,659
down

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,050
I think the head at the moment is too

173
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,300
high because it doesn't need to be up

174
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,949
like that I'd like it to be like lower

175
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:54,400
down anyway and I think that will

176
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:56,800
approximate more what we have in our in

177
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,629
in the artwork that's coming later right

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,550
I think that'll be a little closer to

179
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:02,829
that and the other thing we should

180
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,439
probably do that we haven't done yet as

181
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:08,139
well is it would it might be nice to

182
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,279
more closely approximate sort of the way

183
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,870
these things will be constructed later

184
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,809
with by actually having them be

185
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,550
displaced rather than having them cut

186
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,228
out in the artwork but that may it may

187
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,840
be premature to do that so maybe we'll

188
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,550
leave that for now anyway so if I wanted

189
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,560
to move the head down a little bit what

190
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,689
I can do is I can just offset it when I

191
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,780
draw it I can offset it down a little

192
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:31,870
bit just to see what's happening in the

193
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:34,569
code there so I'm gonna go into world

194
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,530
mode here and when I draw a hero head

195
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:41,379
which is in here I can just sort of

196
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:44,259
arbitrarily decide to move it in why a

197
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,759
little bit further down so you can see

198
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,579
in here I guess we've got this push-fit

199
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,589
map i believe this v3 here is sort of my

200
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,990
ability to displace things so if I

201
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:55,538
wanted to I could go ahead and displace

202
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,030
it downward and I guess I can also you

203
00:07:55,538 --> 00:08:06,370
know since we are working on animation I

204
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:08,978
can take the the Liberty here of abusing

205
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,840
the lot of code editing so I can just go

206
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:14,139
ahead and take a look at it edit on here

207
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,659
alright so first things first like if I

208
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,990
draw this thing displaced I need a way

209
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:26,110
of making sure that the head shows up on

210
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:28,949
top of of the other stuff right and the

211
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,389
problem that we have right now is that

212
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:34,179
the only reason that things aren't

213
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:36,519
sorting properly just automatically is

214
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,958
because of the again the fact that we we

215
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,120
don't have our artists that's really

216
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,088
prop processed properly these are still

217
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,360
assets oops these are still assets that

218
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,130
are exactly the way they were when we

219
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,100
first started building the game and

220
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:52,389
really didn't do any sort of testing or

221
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,159
any due diligence with how

222
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:58,799
we wanted the pact they're still

223
00:08:54,159 --> 00:09:05,799
essentially like this sort of thing

224
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:08,769
right that's what the assets look like

225
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:11,019
so even though if our head actually was

226
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:14,470
up here and here was the actual point

227
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:16,299
position point for the head that would

228
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,790
just totally work because it would sort

229
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:20,319
properly as compared to this potentially

230
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:22,089
you know or we at least be in a position

231
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,010
to make sure it's sorted properly right

232
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,259
now we don't have a lot of options for

233
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:28,899
doing that because unfortunately we've

234
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:31,659
got this situation where the the bottom

235
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:32,860
of these is is actual where it is so we

236
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:37,809
don't actually know where these things

237
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,759
actually are now what we do know is that

238
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,619
we can still control the sorting with

239
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,850
sort of hack so at the moment we should

240
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,620
be able to come for something clear and

241
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,300
the other thing is I feel like we may

242
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,679
have some kind of a bug in what we're

243
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:50,620
doing right now because possibly

244
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,419
involving like Z or who knows what but

245
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,879
if we take a look at what's going on

246
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:57,250
with the head if we are to move the head

247
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,830
downwards then if we move it downwards

248
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,470
an actual lie you would expect it to

249
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,509
sort in front of this because we're we

250
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,889
sort Y as it gets closer to the screen

251
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:09,370
is how it should go

252
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:14,590
right and I'll just double check that

253
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:17,259
but you know if I go into render group

254
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,730
and I look at entity basis P when we

255
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,220
come down here and take a look at what

256
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,409
happens to Y you can see that we

257
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,379
subtract whatever the transformed Y is

258
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:29,139
from our sorting information right and

259
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:32,740
so what we would expect to see in that

260
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:36,189
case is that as that Y comes down those

261
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,250
should be lower sorting values and hence

262
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,750
sort closer to the screen unless I've

263
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,909
forgotten and we actually saw it the

264
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,710
other way I don't actually remember but

265
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,419
I'm pretty sure we sort with things

266
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,710
being less and in fact you can kind of

267
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:52,149
see that we sort with things being less

268
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:57,009
because here with our oh wait a minute

269
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:59,139
maybe we don't actually I think this is

270
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:01,809
just maybe we just have this busted here

271
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:05,249
it looks like we're sorting yeah this is

272
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:07,528
just this is just wrong right

273
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:10,360
no no is it's correct it's correct

274
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:12,639
because we're subtracting why and as you

275
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,678
go lower on the screen your Y will

276
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,039
decrease right because Y is positive

277
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:19,328
going upwards at the moment so as you go

278
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,998
lower on the screen you'll subtract

279
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:25,868
which will increase that value right and

280
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:28,360
so I would assume that we would always

281
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:30,160
see that something that we move lower on

282
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,470
the screen should sort in front of

283
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:35,110
things that we have not moved lower on

284
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,689
the screen so what I'd like to do now is

285
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,419
just go wait a minute sanity check here

286
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:42,698
why are these things drawing in the

287
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:45,729
opposite order let's look at what their

288
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:48,219
sort key actually is and that way we can

289
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,470
just make sure that nothing particularly

290
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,720
unusual is going on because it seems

291
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,839
like there's a bug there or at least

292
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,209
like maybe a misunderstanding and how

293
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,970
the call is happening and looking at it

294
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:05,469
here I guess I could double check to you

295
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:06,879
know you can kind of see you can kind of

296
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,339
see in here how things are getting

297
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,339
called as well so anyway we'll just

298
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,899
we'll just make a breakpoint and I'll

299
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,939
make a breakpoint at each of these

300
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,039
things so we can take a look at what all

301
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:19,328
of their sort keys actually are and I

302
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:22,360
guess we'll just look at the cape and

303
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:25,988
the head for now so here is that push

304
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:32,048
bit map call for the head and somebody

305
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:35,079
told me that I could step into there to

306
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:36,458
step into specific I never knew this was

307
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,988
there by the way I don't know when they

308
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:40,988
added that but I did not know it was

309
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:42,278
there it's pretty handy I even set it on

310
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:45,850
the debugging phim I was like I wish

311
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:47,289
they had some like that but they do you

312
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,639
just can't apparently get it from the

313
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:51,698
keyboard or something but you can get it

314
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,629
with the mouse so I come in to push

315
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:57,188
bitmap and I'm gonna thunk through to

316
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,589
another call now that I I know that I've

317
00:12:57,188 --> 00:13:01,118
gotten an actual bitmap and that's going

318
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,119
to call through and generate one of

319
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:05,678
these sort keys right so presumably when

320
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:08,949
I come through here

321
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:12,009
my entry will now have a sort key that

322
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:14,198
it can that can be used with it or

323
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,369
actually I guess I that gets stored in

324
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:15,909
the other things so I'm gonna have to

325
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:18,149
look in

326
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:21,159
the dim that comes back for it right

327
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:23,529
should be in here so there's the sort

328
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,329
key this is the sort key for the head so

329
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:28,389
there's this four thousand ninety five

330
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:31,960
point three two zero zero seven that is

331
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:34,539
the sort key for the head and let's go

332
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,240
ahead and run forward to the sort key

333
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:39,779
for the body and see what that is

334
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,259
oops forgot to do my step into specific

335
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:47,709
come here there it is

336
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:49,330
so inside here I'm just going to do the

337
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,400
same thing follow the push bit map call

338
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,690
through until we actually have a valid

339
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,149
entry and then I'm just gonna look at

340
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,620
what its doom is so there's it's sort

341
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,769
key and this is the sort key for the

342
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,600
body so it's pretty clear that the sort

343
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,460
keys for these two things are different

344
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,009
by a dramatic amount so that's not a

345
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,280
wise sorting issue that's going to be a

346
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:13,360
Z sorting issue and so what you can see

347
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:17,169
if you take a look here in the in the

348
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,440
render group calls is that the 4096 is

349
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:23,439
based on the Z situation so you've got

350
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,170
the object transform upright thing going

351
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,850
on and you've got the original P Z stuff

352
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:30,610
you've got all of these things happening

353
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:35,320
here and that's that's doing that

354
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:38,289
sorting now I guess my first question is

355
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,680
who actually is setting the upright

356
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:43,870
stuff and or is it getting set for both

357
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:47,049
of these because I don't actually know

358
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,269
if it is or if it isn't in the object

359
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,729
transform so I'm going to take a look to

360
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:54,850
just see who gets set to upright and who

361
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,450
doesn't because I don't actually know so

362
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,490
we've got a default upright transform

363
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,980
that's getting set here for the objects

364
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,700
edit eat transform and then I don't know

365
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:10,659
if it ever gets unset let's see

366
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:14,290
push bitmap so so everyone is going to

367
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:16,539
have that everyone's going to have that

368
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,250
set so I assume it can't be that we

369
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:23,379
could double check we then have the

370
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:26,230
original PZ and the PZ right the PZ is

371
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:27,460
the transform Z so let me just take a

372
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,989
quick look and follow that through just

373
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,850
to make sure we have a handle on

374
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:35,278
so we don't use the original Z in here

375
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:40,439
anywhere we have the objects transform

376
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:43,438
offset P and I don't actually know why

377
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:45,899
we don't include the Z in there but we

378
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:47,998
don't so we don't have the Z in there

379
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,749
but we do have the object transforms

380
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:54,058
offset Z whatever that is that does come

381
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:56,850
in here and then we've got the original

382
00:15:54,058 --> 00:16:01,499
PZ so we use both of those Z's we use

383
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:04,678
the transform Z and we use the the Z

384
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:07,709
that comes in both of those things are

385
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:09,869
added together to produce the final Z so

386
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:12,659
my first question would just be is there

387
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:14,548
actually a Z value getting passed here

388
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,860
and it looks like actually there is in

389
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:18,989
fact there it is so it looks like all we

390
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,759
did is we actually put in a Z value that

391
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:23,939
that we're actually using here I don't

392
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,459
want that to happen right that is not a

393
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:27,748
good thing and so that was how we were I

394
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,508
guess that was just because I hacked

395
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:31,829
that in to sort the cape on top which

396
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:33,869
again is not really something we

397
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:36,539
probably should have been doing but

398
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:38,610
there you go and so as you can see how

399
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:41,759
the Cape the the on top s of the Cape

400
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,688
there is like is a problem right so what

401
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,970
I can do there is I can address this

402
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:50,998
slightly differently I suppose I can

403
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,809
make it so that the torso is always

404
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:56,459
slightly up in Y or rather the Cape is

405
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:58,499
slightly up in wire the torso is

406
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:01,018
slightly down and Y I can try to do

407
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:02,670
something like that again a little bit

408
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,409
of a hack but it's it's less of a hack

409
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:06,509
we're probably gonna have to confront

410
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:07,829
the Z sorting stuff at some point here

411
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:09,119
because again it's gotten a little bit

412
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:10,438
out of control and we're gonna need

413
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,558
something a little bit better than what

414
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,750
we have so let's take a look here what I

415
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:17,578
could what I could do so if I was to

416
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,648
displace it downward oh wait that's

417
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:23,188
gonna do the opposite sorry if I was to

418
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:25,678
just place it upward I think we still

419
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,778
have a problem of when yeah you can kind

420
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,769
of see that when we get bobbing action

421
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:32,579
happening we're still going to

422
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:34,470
occasionally be in there so again we

423
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:36,689
really kind of need some way of just

424
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,788
because it's 2d and we have to hack

425
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,750
these things we need to clean up that Z

426
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:41,519
a little bit because we've had

427
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,069
consistent problems where we just don't

428
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,859
have

429
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:47,589
a handle on where all the Z values are

430
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:49,089
going to be exactly so we don't have a

431
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:50,559
great way of knowing like this is how

432
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:52,119
we're hacking this or this is how we're

433
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,399
actually sorting this and that thing so

434
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:55,539
we have one more pass to do over that to

435
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,190
actually nail things down I think

436
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,559
because it's very frustrating to not

437
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,570
have that solid it's one of the things

438
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,339
that's really annoying about programming

439
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:05,230
on stream is because there's such a

440
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:07,389
limited time I never have those times

441
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,799
that I can just spend eight hours going

442
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,570
through things and like working them out

443
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,279
which are pretty crucial sometimes

444
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:13,899
you're kind of always in the state of

445
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,519
well we never quite got to the end of

446
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,220
that because it would take too much to

447
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,960
actually do but you know that's just

448
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,360
that's just something you got to live

449
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,630
with the nature Avant's of doing

450
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,529
programming in this fashion so anyway

451
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,510
you know that's a little bit of a

452
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:30,940
problem there there is probably more we

453
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:34,680
could do about it we could also say that

454
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:37,390
we are gonna pesum eyes the torso

455
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,620
instead right we could say that that's

456
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:43,210
going to have some very slight Z offset

457
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,039
and that's another way that we could go

458
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,529
about that and if we just make that be

459
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,659
some kind of ludicrously small value

460
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:52,779
then it would always stay sort of behind

461
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,850
I think and that's probably fine right

462
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,410
so that's probably something we can do

463
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:59,619
for now but again like I think we want

464
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:04,570
to clean those ease up so here's you

465
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:06,009
know me walking around and I can also do

466
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,769
that for the Cape so that it never

467
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:10,480
appears above the head you know I could

468
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:13,569
say like I want these to be at very

469
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,579
small Z offsets relative to each other

470
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:19,179
and then you know they're kind of

471
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:21,549
wouldn't have that sorting problem so at

472
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,620
you know here's here's the dude hopping

473
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,899
around I feel like there's probably

474
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:31,209
going to be a problem here where this is

475
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,500
gonna be wrong but yeah well no it looks

476
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,120
yes you'd like right there

477
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,220
see how that's wrong that's the

478
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:37,629
consequence of doing that which is why I

479
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,140
say we'd have to do we're gonna have to

480
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:44,560
do it correctly when we sort of get get

481
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,900
down to it but anyway so the problem at

482
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,339
the moment that I want to address now

483
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,710
that we've sort of been able to shrink

484
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:52,929
the guy down a little bit compared to

485
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,490
where you would be and I can do that

486
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,660
even a little bit more I think I want

487
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,650
him to be shrunk leaving a little

488
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,900
than that because like I said I wanted

489
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,670
to be pretty compact because it's gonna

490
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,670
be more of a top-down sort of a thing

491
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:09,670
there we go and I think that the Cape

492
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:11,859
also will be a little bit like that as

493
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,779
well I think the Cape will also be kind

494
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:15,549
of down further so I think this is a

495
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,220
little more representative of what it

496
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:21,159
will look like you know what I'm saying

497
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,319
so as we're hopping along here I think

498
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,170
what I want to do is just really limit

499
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,960
the degree to which I do that shear so

500
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:30,880
this shear will not be as exaggerated as

501
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,670
it is because now it doesn't have to to

502
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,710
avoid that offset and then again the

503
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,630
part of the art the final art assets

504
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,210
will job will be to make sure that that

505
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,550
is an okay looking thing to have it sort

506
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,920
of nicely compact like that from a more

507
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:47,019
top-down perspective so if we wanted to

508
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,880
do that all I really need to do here is

509
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:52,150
go into where we're actually computing

510
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,460
that sort of displacement code and try

511
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:56,230
to limit what's actually happening now

512
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,509
you can see here and in fact I guess

513
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,819
I'll go ahead and maybe record a loop

514
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:02,710
here of him doing some particularly bad

515
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:06,009
stuff so I feel like going around like

516
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:08,380
this is a pretty good example of that so

517
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:11,680
we'll just go ahead and do a loop of him

518
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,630
sort of coming around like that and so

519
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,549
there you can kind of see some really

520
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,890
it's really bad you know the really bad

521
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,119
case is there so as that's looping

522
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,610
around and it's gonna take a look at

523
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:26,019
what happens if first of all I'm gonna

524
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:28,179
just go ahead and I'm gonna go ahead and

525
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,829
turn off the shear entirely so that's

526
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,810
what it would look like if we weren't

527
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:33,819
shearing and you can see that obviously

528
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:38,200
we do get quite a bit of separation

529
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:39,669
there so there's that and so there's one

530
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,069
of the things we can do is make it so

531
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,410
that hop baby follows the head more

532
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:45,759
quickly or something like that you know

533
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,220
we can we can certainly do some things

534
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,140
there to potentially help ourselves but

535
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,450
what I'm gonna do here is see what I can

536
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,920
get away with in terms of shear before

537
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,400
we look bad right

538
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,320
so like that probably doesn't look bad

539
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,140
enough to be too concerned about like

540
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:05,049
I'm okay with that amount of shearing on

541
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,150
the thing that doesn't seem to be too

542
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:09,058
bad to me and similarly the other thing

543
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,860
we could do is we could consider

544
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:13,079
sort of normalizing some of this a

545
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:14,788
little bit more so it was more of a

546
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,308
rotation and less of a shear in certain

547
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:19,230
circumstances as well and I'm not sure

548
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:21,538
whether you know to what degree I want

549
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,009
that or not but point being that's a

550
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:26,148
little bit more so now the question is

551
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:29,970
could I make it so that it doesn't

552
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:31,979
detach as much in the first place you

553
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:36,269
know maybe it follows the head along a

554
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,919
little bit more more quickly and so I'm

555
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:40,679
going to take a look at that so in this

556
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,179
case when I've got the when I decide

557
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:47,278
that I need to hop to the next square

558
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:53,960
you know I'm going to go into into the

559
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:53,960
this hopping code here and I guess I

560
00:22:56,089 --> 00:23:01,769
guess there is a little bit of a delay

561
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:05,028
on the jump which is probably okay but

562
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:07,259
what I want to do is I just want to I

563
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:09,058
want to see what happens if I increase

564
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:16,319
this back up to a really instantaneous

565
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:17,668
hop which isn't great but so you can see

566
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,470
we still have some problems with

567
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:21,090
separation there I'm gonna also you know

568
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,200
what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna go into

569
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:25,378
the config I'm going to slow this down

570
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:32,730
so we can see it better so I'm gonna

571
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:36,209
slow it down to a quarter speed so now

572
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:39,450
we can really see up I always forget

573
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:41,700
when we do a quarter speed we're not

574
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:48,019
playing back the input at a quarter

575
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:51,600
speed so loops don't work that's okay

576
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:59,929
I'll I'll just do my own real loop

577
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:59,928
basically so here we go looping

578
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,430
so there's the loop and you can kind of

579
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,250
see that the problem is that you know

580
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:22,870
even right off the bat there I sort of

581
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,430
get into the situation where you know

582
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:27,279
just stretching the head around by

583
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,960
itself doesn't really attach to the head

584
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,700
as you would expect because I'm only

585
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,019
going ten percent of the way there and

586
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,940
so I guess you know and the other thing

587
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:40,000
too is I kind of need that stretch to

588
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,950
happen so maybe that going down is just

589
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,640
not gonna work and you know that sort of

590
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,759
the jumping the springiness thing is not

591
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,009
really gonna be useful and I don't know

592
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,720
to what extent I can really change that

593
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:55,869
but let's play around with it a little

594
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,120
bit and see what I can do to mitigate at

595
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:02,949
least to a certain amount that sort of

596
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:06,609
that sort of bumped that downward

597
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,710
bobbing right so let's say that let's

598
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:12,219
say for instance that I was to get rid

599
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:15,279
of that downward motion of the head so

600
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:24,370
now as I stretch out I'm gonna see how

601
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:27,119
close I am typically to to the head and

602
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,119
it's not bad

603
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:41,259
so here's a question I've got my

604
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:43,509
movement the other thing that might be

605
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:44,829
kind of bad here is when I'm doing a

606
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,170
movement to hop

607
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:50,109
I never update it after the hop begins

608
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,330
and maybe what I would like to do is is

609
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:59,379
be able to change movement to at any

610
00:25:52,329 --> 00:26:01,470
time right so that that might be that

611
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:05,770
might be a good thing to do as well

612
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:11,350
which would be difficult it could create

613
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:12,609
very odd behavior yeah I don't really

614
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,259
think I don't know I don't think I can

615
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:16,149
really do that to be honest with you I

616
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:20,140
think that's that's probably too much of

617
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,200
a problem I wish I could I don't think I

618
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,200
can

619
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:51,000
mm-hmm so I guess the other thing too is

620
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:54,740
what if the hero was bigger right like

621
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,789
in here you know I'm I'm passing the

622
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:07,170
let's go here I've got here Oh sighs see

623
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:10,259
and hear us I see well you know I'm

624
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:15,900
gonna put that out here and here a sigh

625
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:18,390
see does control how big the Kuro is and

626
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,150
so when if the hero was closer to the

627
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:29,100
size of one of the squares right like

628
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:31,440
what if the hero was big like so that's

629
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,329
because that creates even less of a

630
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,190
problem right because the bigger the

631
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:41,519
hero is the more the more room that body

632
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:45,029
takes up you know in terms of the space

633
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:50,549
of the square similarly like if you look

634
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:52,109
at yeah if you look at now how how far

635
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:57,419
are you is let me let me break out of

636
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:58,679
the loop here there we go similarly if

637
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,240
you look at how he's constructed now I

638
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,000
could move them even further down and

639
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,960
again the art could work there so if I

640
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,759
come into the hero head here and I just

641
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:16,340
continue to push that here a head down

642
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:16,339
right like so

643
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,780
now we're now we're getting somewhere

644
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:28,849
right now we are getting somewhere and

645
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:31,879
and that's a good thing so I'm gonna see

646
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:35,119
if I what happens if I increase now that

647
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,620
head Delta amount twice what it was in

648
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:46,039
terms of how much I'm allowing it to

649
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:48,109
shear and also I'm gonna let it do its

650
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:50,349
I'm gonna let it do its bouncy thing as

651
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:50,349
well

652
00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:03,219
so this is getting much better right

653
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:04,720
that's getting much better and again

654
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,519
we've got a bunch of things that you

655
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,288
know it's hard to tell without having

656
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,569
the actual art in there but that's

657
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:17,890
starting to not be so concerning to me

658
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:21,308
right because if this was a fatter sort

659
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:25,270
of wider you know if that's more what

660
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:28,089
the hero looks like art wise then you

661
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:31,329
know most of these are starting to look

662
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:33,009
okay and you have to imagine the

663
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:34,210
perspective is different right so it

664
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:37,419
would look better than it looks right

665
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:41,819
now so I'll go ahead and I'm gonna take

666
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:41,820
off the the time step here

667
00:29:44,869 --> 00:30:01,009
I think this will be okay I think what

668
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:02,450
we will want to do potentially because

669
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,700
there's some squirrel eNOS when I'm

670
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:07,580
moving right if I'm moving diagonally

671
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:15,409
and I happen to get well

672
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:18,408
besides that if we don't find a thing to

673
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:22,840
stand on why are we even we should just

674
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:22,840
that case shouldn't even be happening

675
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:40,640
why am I even letting that happen right

676
00:30:28,548 --> 00:30:43,009
because if I don't find one of the one

677
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,200
of the new locations right if the

678
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:48,740
closest traversable isn't actually a

679
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,950
thing then we shouldn't actually allow

680
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:55,370
the player to go any further like that

681
00:30:51,950 --> 00:31:00,919
should just stop them so you know in

682
00:30:55,369 --> 00:31:04,369
this case people ii ii found or

683
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:10,990
something i should say if you know found

684
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:10,989
and right

685
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:15,829
because you shouldn't ever get to it

686
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,089
something that's not reversible and so

687
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:19,399
I'm interested to know like how do I

688
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:29,539
actually get there something bad is

689
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:33,590
happening but I'm not sure what oh you

690
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:35,720
know what I know what's happening what's

691
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:38,359
happening is the camera is transitioning

692
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:47,140
and we're storing these as raw positions

693
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:47,139
which we can't do right

694
00:31:56,788 --> 00:32:04,839
where do we store like our P and our DP

695
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,590
these are our totally bogus in that

696
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,470
sense right

697
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:10,389
like we can't store we can't store

698
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,610
things like movement from and movement

699
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:17,950
to because they'll change at when the

700
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:20,668
camera moves if that makes sense so

701
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,140
that's why that's actually the problem

702
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:25,030
so that'll get fixed actually I suppose

703
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,590
we'll fix that when we update the entity

704
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:35,529
stuff so I guess I'm less concerned

705
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:38,139
about that now so anyway yeah I think

706
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:40,839
this is reasonable but like I said the

707
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,179
problem with that the diagonals where it

708
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:48,699
kind of does that hop between the two of

709
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:51,340
them sort of a thing I'm not sure how I

710
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,069
feel about that one way we could do this

711
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:55,779
is just not allow diagonal motion like

712
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:57,250
we could say that diagonal motion is not

713
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:59,230
something you're actually allowed to do

714
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,808
in this game and I'm not sure how I feel

715
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,730
about that I don't know if I if I think

716
00:33:01,808 --> 00:33:05,349
that gives something up I know that

717
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,329
you're only allowed to attack in the

718
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:08,889
four cardinal directions again this is

719
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:11,288
very much like Zelda or Binding of Isaac

720
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,360
and now that I think about it in Zelda

721
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:17,109
in body of Isaac you can definitely move

722
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,949
diagonally but in Zelda you cannot am i

723
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:23,139
right like you are not allowed to move

724
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:25,298
diagonally upwards in Legend of Zelda so

725
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:29,559
it's possible that I could just say you

726
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:31,569
can't do that which you know I don't

727
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:33,609
necessarily want to do strictly from

728
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:36,308
because I'm not sure that how to make

729
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:38,109
the artwork well but it would be

730
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:39,879
potentially useful from a game design

731
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:41,829
standpoint to say that the motion is

732
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,570
always rectilinear given that it's

733
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:49,980
important that we have this tile based

734
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:49,980
sort of motion right so yeah like

735
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:06,888
hmm so yes so what would that feel like

736
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:08,568
let me just see what that would feel

737
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:10,730
like because that will at least give me

738
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:14,690
something to go on in terms of whether I

739
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:17,179
like that idea as a you know I

740
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,528
if it feels immediately wrong to me then

741
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:20,119
I would know that that should just be

742
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:30,619
discounted you know that's not gonna be

743
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:36,318
a thing but yeah so basically what we'd

744
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:38,480
say is you know in here we're checking

745
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:41,028
to see whether or not buttons are down

746
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,329
and if the buttons are down we set these

747
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:46,128
movement values and so what I'm gonna do

748
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:49,539
instead I think is look at the half

749
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:53,628
transition counts and say you know and

750
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:56,359
the half transition count is is

751
00:34:53,628 --> 00:34:58,909
something that way will will will sort

752
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:03,710
of leave it as something that's repeated

753
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:05,058
so we won't clear that we won't clear

754
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:09,019
the con hero oops

755
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:11,660
we won't clear the con hero DDP will let

756
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:14,528
that be set and that DDP will be set

757
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:17,929
only when the controller move up code

758
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:22,190
half transition count is greater than

759
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:26,389
one so only when you've actually pushed

760
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:28,450
it will we go and set it if that makes

761
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:28,449
sense

762
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:48,060
and is that do we already have that is

763
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:51,519
that just went down button went down I

764
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:53,199
feel like we had a thing for this

765
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,639
particular case I'm gonna go ahead and

766
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,368
expand this window out so we can see a

767
00:35:54,639 --> 00:36:01,170
little more code I feel like we had a

768
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:01,170
case for this somewhere in here

769
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,509
maybe is down I feel like there were

770
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:34,500
some button things but where they are

771
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:38,509
now nobody knows hmm yeah I thought we

772
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,380
just had some utility functions but

773
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:41,699
again one of the things that suffers

774
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,400
with brief programming times they don't

775
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:47,548
have a lot of time to organize things

776
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,710
all that much so I feel like we do have

777
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:51,900
some sort of button pushing stuff in

778
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,920
here that's you know it was pretty

779
00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:00,509
primitive but I thought we had some

780
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,619
stuff about half transition counts there

781
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:06,659
it is

782
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:10,700
was pressed that's what I wanted so I

783
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:10,699
just want to was press for each of these

784
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:28,889
so yeah this is way down I believe this

785
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:30,539
is was pressed was pressed so when we're

786
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:32,400
pressed we're gonna do this but what I'm

787
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:39,720
gonna do in addition to this is I'm

788
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:42,269
going to clear out the X or rather

789
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:46,679
whatever the corresponding other pair

790
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:49,199
was I'm gonna clear it so this way

791
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:52,048
you're only allowed to move in one

792
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:54,179
direction or will along one axis at a

793
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:56,369
time if that makes sense

794
00:37:54,179 --> 00:38:02,909
and the other axis will just get zeroed

795
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:06,599
will get cleared out yeah I guess the

796
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:07,768
other thing that I have to do is I got

797
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,278
to make it so there's some way that you

798
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:13,758
can get it so that nothing is down so

799
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:19,460
basically like if you release everything

800
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:19,460
so if not and do we have it is down

801
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:31,048
apparently we don't it's just that so I

802
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:53,548
suppose it's kind of stupid to even have

803
00:38:31,048 --> 00:38:57,929
but what do you do so in the case where

804
00:38:53,548 --> 00:39:07,469
we don't have anything happening we

805
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:10,250
clear it so now I can only do one

806
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:10,250
direction of motion

807
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:39,929
well to be honest it really doesn't feel

808
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:41,068
like a too much of a problem and you

809
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,690
know what I should also do that's not

810
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:44,279
quite the right controller code what I

811
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,170
really want to say is that if neither of

812
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,060
the controllers are down for one of the

813
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:54,079
axes you clear it right not the fat

814
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:54,078
really matters all that much

815
00:39:54,469 --> 00:40:05,598
so if move up or move down as are both

816
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:05,599
off same here

817
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:42,589
so I feel like that wouldn't be a

818
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:48,170
problem I'm not sure exactly how I feel

819
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:51,800
about it yet like I don't know that it's

820
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:55,250
exactly what I want but it's certainly

821
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:58,730
not bad and I guess it's closer to the

822
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:02,059
Zelda ish style of the original Zelda

823
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:06,320
which was the game that I was interested

824
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:07,880
in sort of exploring because in that

825
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,530
game if I remember correctly you could

826
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,660
not move in arbitrary you could not move

827
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,810
diagonally you could only move up and

828
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:16,809
down

829
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:43,349
all right I'm relatively happy with that

830
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,350
I'm relatively happy with that

831
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:04,279
all right so I have a little bit more

832
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:09,309
time left because we didn't start till

833
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:12,950
really really late I believe so

834
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:16,039
so it's probably still about 10 to 20

835
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:20,569
minutes left so the other thing that I

836
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:22,009
want to do here right is I feel like so

837
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,809
I feel like most of this will take care

838
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,600
of itself when the art when when newer

839
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:32,509
art is pushed in so I feel like that'll

840
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:34,069
be okay and yeah so I'm relatively happy

841
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,080
with that I don't I don't think I need

842
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,820
to worry too much more about that I'll

843
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,940
we'll worry about it more when when we

844
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:45,980
have the final art in there I think

845
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:49,909
that's probably okay and so what I want

846
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:51,559
to do now is I want to put it in I want

847
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:54,649
to maybe make the detection a little bit

848
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,230
better for what's going on keyboard wise

849
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:59,030
we see to occasionally get some things

850
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,579
where you're kind of in between - I

851
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:05,330
wonder if I I wonder to what degree I

852
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:07,610
want to again suck you into the lane if

853
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:09,319
that makes sense I had it in there so

854
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:14,170
that you would you that you would get

855
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,170
sucked into the lane but

856
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,670
but I never quite felt right and I don't

857
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:27,430
know to what degree I want to do that to

858
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,430
keep you from being in between to write

859
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:32,840
and I don't know I don't know what I

860
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:34,219
want to do about that it didn't seem

861
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,108
that like a good idea when I tried it

862
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:38,989
before one thing I do want to do is

863
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:42,230
right now if you push down both buttons

864
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:44,179
and then let go of one of them only if

865
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:45,949
you keep held down the second one you

866
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:48,829
push will you keep moving so I feel like

867
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:50,419
that's not a great solution to how to do

868
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:51,650
that input anyway so I'd rather make

869
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,090
that a little closer to what the final

870
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,769
thing would be if we were gonna go with

871
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,090
this which is that if you do push to

872
00:43:54,769 --> 00:44:00,108
down then you let go of one it should

873
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:04,460
really just be whichever one got pushed

874
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:06,980
down last is the is the direction you go

875
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,139
but if you let go of one and you're

876
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:14,750
still pushing down in another then it

877
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:16,699
will pick that one up right so I think

878
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,789
what we want to do here is something

879
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:21,949
like okay when something gets pressed it

880
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:26,088
takes precedence and that's sort of what

881
00:44:21,949 --> 00:44:30,889
we're doing here but if you were to make

882
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:34,489
it so that so that something went went

883
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:35,960
all the way off right but there might

884
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:38,329
have been a different button that is

885
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,608
down I think I want to do something more

886
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:42,710
like this where I say like okay in the

887
00:44:40,608 --> 00:44:45,769
in the case where we released all the

888
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:49,099
ups is there something down that's not

889
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:51,949
you know that's that's in the Y right so

890
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:53,838
like I'm sorry I released left or right

891
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:55,639
and so we're not moving after anymore is

892
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:59,299
one of the other directions held down

893
00:44:55,639 --> 00:45:04,239
for example if move up is being held

894
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:04,240
down then let's do that and similarly if

895
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:14,180
if moved down is there let's put that

896
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:20,900
back in right and I'll do the exact same

897
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:22,969
thing over here so if you release the up

898
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,829
or down motion and there happens to

899
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:25,730
still be a left or right motion

900
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:29,230
happening

901
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:29,230
let's reap it that up

902
00:45:45,090 --> 00:46:00,789
yeah so now that's working okay - and

903
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,170
that's kind of nice that's important

904
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:02,710
because otherwise it would not have

905
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,470
worked

906
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,690
- just tap the up button like in that

907
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:11,759
sense and leave the right button held

908
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,760
down and I want to make sure that works

909
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,099
so let's take a look at and I'll just

910
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:26,589
now that I've sort of re-centered on

911
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,940
that a little bit let's just take a

912
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:31,279
double check to see what's going on here

913
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,190
I'm gonna re I'm gonna switch this

914
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,109
around right we had put in the code for

915
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:41,990
doing that sort of sucking you back in

916
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:45,578
and I'll just see if maybe now that

917
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:45,578
makes any more sense than it used to

918
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:12,969
well

919
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:19,750
I mean it feels fine when you're close

920
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,119
the problem is when you're right in the

921
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:24,929
middle and you kind of end up going

922
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:32,230
diagonally it just feels a little weird

923
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:35,048
maybe I could set it on a timer you know

924
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,789
like when we're moving sort of when

925
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:39,849
we're when we're doing this sort of

926
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:43,589
thing right what we could do there is

927
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:43,588
say like well

928
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:56,539
you know if this is named improperly by

929
00:47:53,119 --> 00:48:07,460
the way this is actually if no push

930
00:47:56,539 --> 00:48:10,909
right there is any pushers so that's

931
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:13,159
actually not any push it's no push so if

932
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:15,109
we look at what's happening here one of

933
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:17,899
the things that I'm just thinking is

934
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:19,730
like hey what if I only apply the Riesz

935
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,130
entering after a certain amount of time

936
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,110
so for example in the case where we're

937
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,900
in a no push scenario so like we're

938
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:31,519
doing you know we're doing we know we're

939
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:34,130
not doing no push right so I'd say like

940
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:37,849
okay if if it's no push definitely do it

941
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:39,950
or if like the timer is up and the

942
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:42,110
square right and then I could introduce

943
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:44,599
a thing where it's like I don't start

944
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:47,390
sucking you back in until a certain time

945
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:53,089
er collapses or something so like timer

946
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:57,349
is up you know equals you know whatever

947
00:48:53,090 --> 00:49:00,769
the entity the energy like recenter

948
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:03,880
timer or something is greater than or is

949
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:03,880
equal to zero right

950
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:09,589
so I can do something like that and then

951
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,210
every time through here when I'm doing

952
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:14,390
these controls I could do something like

953
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:16,639
okay whatever the entities recenter

954
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:18,710
timer is I'm going to take that vCenter

955
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:21,618
timer and I'm going to subtract from it

956
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:24,108
whatever the DT is and I want to do a

957
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:32,269
clamp here like I want to do like a

958
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:34,099
clamp 2 to 0 or a clamp clamp above 0 or

959
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:37,909
something like that where I have this

960
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:43,519
recenter timer and I want to take that

961
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:46,039
recenter timer and I want to subtract

962
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,530
whatever the DT is right so whatever the

963
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:49,670
time is it's going to count down and I

964
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:53,150
want to make a math function in the

965
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:55,039
clamps so if that clamp 0 1 and all

966
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:57,400
right I got this sort of stuff here and

967
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,659
I just want to do a thing that's gonna

968
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,829
auto plant for me so I'm just going to

969
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:02,829
do a clamp above 0

970
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:10,359
here's my value and the result is just

971
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:15,369
going to equal to the value if the value

972
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:16,509
is less than zero that's going to be

973
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,690
zero otherwise it's going to do the

974
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:21,818
value so all it's doing is making sure

975
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,229
it doesn't go below zero so that's like

976
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:25,748
a little clamped update there so we'll

977
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:27,788
do a clamp above zero off we go

978
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:31,528
we need in the sim region we need to

979
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:38,469
have one of these little doodads right

980
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:41,369
so let's see here that can just be the

981
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:46,809
central timer and this receptor timer

982
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:49,660
will be zero normally so if I just do it

983
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:51,190
without making a changes here then what

984
00:50:49,659 --> 00:50:52,808
I should do is I should always have the

985
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,608
resent ring happen and I can feel it

986
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:57,190
happening you know it's it's definitely

987
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:59,949
happening now and but then what I can do

988
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:05,170
is I can make it so that anytime I push

989
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:07,028
down one of these buttons so anytime I

990
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:14,920
get one of these these edge triggers

991
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:19,869
essentially I can go ahead and say take

992
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,759
whatever the hero is in this case and to

993
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:24,519
actually have the entity do I know what

994
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:27,009
the entity actually is don't have the

995
00:51:24,518 --> 00:51:28,538
entity in here I want the env in here oh

996
00:51:27,009 --> 00:51:30,219
you know what I guess that probably

997
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:32,410
should just be in here now think about

998
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:36,400
it because this is where the actual

999
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:38,348
timer is but it's fine I'm going to set

1000
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,858
the vCenter timer to whatever the

1001
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:43,298
recenter amount is so basically I'm it's

1002
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:45,248
gonna have a timer that counts down so

1003
00:51:43,298 --> 00:51:47,710
that when you move you'll get a reprieve

1004
00:51:45,248 --> 00:51:51,129
from the resent ring for a like a half a

1005
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,650
second or something we don't know what

1006
00:51:51,130 --> 00:52:01,450
that value is going to be and then the

1007
00:51:53,650 --> 00:52:04,798
con hero controlled zero I know where

1008
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:04,798
that is that in the world mode

1009
00:52:06,179 --> 00:52:13,478
there's that in handmade it's in

1010
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:15,190
handmade so yeah inside handmade I'm

1011
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:17,218
just gonna have that recenter timer is

1012
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:20,170
gonna be in here so I'm not gonna put it

1013
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,909
in the sim region because I guess it's

1014
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:26,229
really a property of the control not of

1015
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:32,219
it of the entity per se so we'll put the

1016
00:52:26,228 --> 00:52:32,218
entity entities recenter timer in here

1017
00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:42,910
like so and we'll test it in here so

1018
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:50,019
yeah

1019
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:52,659
moving on let's run that guy and so now

1020
00:52:50,018 --> 00:52:54,338
you kind of get that floatiness and it

1021
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:57,038
kind of it sucks it back in sort of

1022
00:52:54,338 --> 00:53:02,528
later so you can see it doing its thing

1023
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:04,509
right and I don't know how I feel about

1024
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:07,268
it let's let's play with it a little I'm

1025
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:10,989
gonna up the coefficient so that it

1026
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:12,488
sucks in relatively quickly so basically

1027
00:53:10,989 --> 00:53:14,999
your hop along and it just kind of sucks

1028
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,999
you over

1029
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:26,100
and that feels even worse I will loosen

1030
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:28,309
it up a bit try it with a really faint

1031
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:28,309
one

1032
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:42,440
so with it that faint I don't really

1033
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:45,589
notice it so if nothing else I suppose

1034
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:48,260
that's probably good in the sense that

1035
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:51,680
it slowly restores you over time without

1036
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:56,210
it being too noticeable so maybe we can

1037
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:58,269
leave that one in at least for now all

1038
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,269
right

1039
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:18,478
so you can still kind of get a few

1040
00:54:16,528 --> 00:54:19,949
outside edge cases where you hop along

1041
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:25,919
in weird ways but I still think they're

1042
00:54:19,949 --> 00:54:28,798
probably gonna be okay because most of

1043
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,749
the time the player is going to want to

1044
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,699
control what squares they're stepping on

1045
00:54:30,748 --> 00:54:36,509
anyway so they don't really have an

1046
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:39,958
incentive to move wildly differently

1047
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:43,978
from the lines anyway if that makes

1048
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:45,179
sense most of the time like they don't

1049
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:46,588
really want to put themselves in a

1050
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:48,929
position where it's unclear what they're

1051
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:50,219
gonna be stepping on so it's not like

1052
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:56,098
they're gonna be going out of their way

1053
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:58,889
to try that mmm in a normal playthrough

1054
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:02,430
anyway at least I don't think but you

1055
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:05,400
know you never really know yeah all

1056
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:10,489
right so let's uh let's leave it there

1057
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:10,489
for now we'll go to the Q&amp;A

1058
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:36,590
do you think like a sort of rhythmic

1059
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:40,849
based movement where the hero would have

1060
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:43,730
to wait a bit before being able to move

1061
00:55:40,849 --> 00:55:45,559
again let's say he's getting ready for a

1062
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:47,059
jump instead of stamina lessly jumping

1063
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:49,039
around non-stop could perhaps help in

1064
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:50,150
this situation realize it's a design

1065
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:51,349
decision it might not be what you're

1066
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:54,829
looking for perhaps you have entertained

1067
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:57,019
the idea I think it yeah it wouldn't be

1068
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:59,449
particularly useful in the way this game

1069
00:55:57,019 --> 00:56:02,509
works necessarily that certainly would

1070
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:04,399
be a reasonable thing to do if if that

1071
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:06,260
wasn't you know gonna conflict with

1072
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,309
other parts in the design but I don't

1073
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,360
feel like that would really be the feel

1074
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:16,659
you want in this game you really want to

1075
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:16,660
you know to move when you move I think

1076
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:27,769
do you think rotating the torso would

1077
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:33,620
help you no not really and the reason

1078
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:38,900
for that at the moment is that like if I

1079
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:42,079
go and look at what the bad cases are

1080
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,820
they don't tend to be ones where I'm

1081
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,710
moving sideways where rotation would

1082
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,870
make sense they seem to be ones where

1083
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:52,250
I'm moving up and down is really the bad

1084
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:53,239
parts right so I feel like mostly what

1085
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,159
we're gonna want to do is just make sure

1086
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:57,639
the art is from a more top-down

1087
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:59,989
perspective and then just try to

1088
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:01,909
minimize the degree to which we share it

1089
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:03,349
like right there you know you can kind

1090
00:57:01,909 --> 00:57:07,940
of see you see how it gets really far

1091
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:12,529
behind like that and so that that I

1092
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:14,210
think is mostly the problem for the

1093
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:19,450
Kuban and you have the hero walk around

1094
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:19,449
on a live loop yes I can

1095
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,219
Shawn McGrath says try wrapping the body

1096
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:56,730
around bezzie a rather than just linear

1097
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:58,619
stretching um I mean I don't think you

1098
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:00,420
know if the problem was just that we

1099
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:02,489
want we want to let's just stretch out

1100
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,840
his neck and not the body or something

1101
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:05,909
that I could see that maybe be any case

1102
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,740
but I don't in this case we don't really

1103
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:09,569
have a part that's like good to stretch

1104
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:11,489
but another part that's not so the

1105
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:13,970
Bezier I don't know that would really do

1106
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,969
much for us

1107
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:29,840
for the for the up-down motion couldn't

1108
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:36,170
you forego the stretch and have a jump

1109
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:37,570
of each part I don't know what that

1110
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:40,970
means

1111
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:44,750
beer chug why wouldn't you shear the top

1112
00:58:40,969 --> 00:58:50,269
of the feet to stay under the moving

1113
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:53,510
body the top of the feet first of all

1114
00:58:50,269 --> 00:58:58,849
there are no feet because this is a

1115
00:58:53,510 --> 00:59:00,080
limbless character so I'm not sure doing

1116
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:01,819
my feet if you mean the bottom of the

1117
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,949
torso well they've got to be planted

1118
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,809
where they were right so I'm not sure

1119
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:12,379
what you mean by shear them to stay

1120
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:13,940
under the body commandercool what about

1121
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,280
a small transition of the body before

1122
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:19,960
and after the jump say 10 to 20 percent

1123
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,960
of the distance between Jason dots I

1124
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:26,889
that's an interesting idea

1125
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:37,949
that's an interesting idea I don't know

1126
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:40,469
about that I don't want it to feel non

1127
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:42,959
grounded but you know there might be

1128
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:45,088
some value that's small enough that it

1129
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:47,998
helps but not big enough that it feels

1130
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:53,969
ungrounded so we could certainly try it

1131
00:59:47,998 --> 00:59:58,528
if we took a displacement if we just had

1132
00:59:53,969 --> 01:00:05,190
a displacement in here that could work

1133
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:06,958
so let me see that's the hero head let's

1134
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:12,420
see if we had we would test this so if

1135
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:16,038
we were standing on the ground then

1136
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:19,619
we've got the head Delta which is here

1137
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:23,579
and I could just multiply I could make a

1138
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:26,209
displacement based on the head Delta so

1139
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:29,209
I could do something like entity P

1140
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:29,208
equals

1141
01:00:43,989 --> 01:00:48,409
hmm I guess what I could say is like

1142
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,550
there's there's an easy way to do this

1143
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:50,629
just adds a thing I don't want everyone

1144
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,490
to do it right now so I'm just going to

1145
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:55,550
I was going to try to hack it so if I

1146
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:57,709
was in here I could say well if I you

1147
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:00,590
know if I didn't find a place to jump to

1148
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:04,429
then we'll just say that enemy P equals

1149
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:08,210
you know whatever the closest P was plus

1150
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:12,039
you know some coefficient times the head

1151
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:12,039
Delta right

1152
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,690
seems like it's doing something a little

1153
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:29,079
bit weird compared to what I would have

1154
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:32,409
expected it's doing an extra bounce

1155
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:34,000
which I'm not sure why it would its head

1156
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:37,960
Delta going in some weird direction that

1157
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:45,219
I don't anticipate let me stop the loop

1158
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:50,199
ah you know what the problem is with

1159
01:01:45,219 --> 01:01:52,449
changing that is it will change the way

1160
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:54,909
that we were doing the jump Delta yeah

1161
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:56,559
so this this body distance thing why are

1162
01:01:54,909 --> 01:02:04,299
we doing it that way I don't actually

1163
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:05,829
know why we were doing it that way it

1164
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,350
seems like a weird way to do it but

1165
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:10,119
anyway I'll go ahead and do the actual

1166
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,589
way just to see cuz I am curious about

1167
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:15,190
that it's an interesting idea that you

1168
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:21,789
had There so let's double check it so

1169
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:27,639
here in the sim region if I just do some

1170
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:29,800
random thing that's just a cloth floor

1171
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:42,190
displace for now if I come in here and

1172
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:46,750
say like there right so you know the

1173
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:48,639
entity floor displace would not would

1174
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,969
get reset here of course there's a

1175
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,869
there's a discontinuity so we'd have to

1176
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:53,500
well I guess you know what I know how I

1177
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,239
can fix that

1178
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,219
so in here we'll just say okay the

1179
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:59,259
entity floor displace is just going to

1180
01:02:57,219 --> 01:03:02,049
be some percentage of the head Delta as

1181
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:05,860
you move the head around if we're not in

1182
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:07,900
that mode or really probably at any time

1183
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,789
the floor displacement will always decay

1184
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,849
downward so we'll just say that the

1185
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:17,980
floor displacement you know whatever

1186
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:20,920
they are will always do a clamp above 0

1187
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:23,199
or will we'd clamp how would we do this

1188
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,079
I guess I I have to always just decay

1189
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,279
them in the opposite direction so yeah

1190
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,429
this is one of those things that we

1191
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,120
would not want to do the way that I'm

1192
01:03:30,429 --> 01:03:34,969
about to do it

1193
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:37,880
but if we wanted to just to displace it

1194
01:03:34,969 --> 01:03:44,480
back to zero then I would do something

1195
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:47,930
like I guess you know what I'll just

1196
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:51,849
leave it for now we'll just say that

1197
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:51,849
this is always going to be the case so

1198
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,239
it's always gonna be that the floor

1199
01:03:57,769 --> 01:04:01,340
displace is set to that and then when we

1200
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:03,589
go to actually draw this this dude here

1201
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:09,940
right oops

1202
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:13,600
euro body when we actually draw the sky

1203
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:17,139
and we're passing in the transform here

1204
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:20,929
I'm gonna want to give it an offset so

1205
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:28,129
we'll just say the offset is the end of

1206
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:29,569
these floor displace and then in here

1207
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,099
whenever we're doing this we'll just say

1208
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:34,030
like okay it's actually there's an

1209
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:34,029
actual offset now

1210
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:59,858
yeah so that's oh right

1211
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:01,118
I always forget this - we do have a

1212
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:07,539
convenient way of doing this we can just

1213
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:13,329
say we want the XY of that so in theory

1214
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:21,940
that would do it so you can kind of see

1215
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:23,889
it happening there right and that I

1216
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,740
don't know if that actually helps enough

1217
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:30,118
but it's not that noticeable now could

1218
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:30,118
we crank it up I don't know

1219
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:39,399
it seems possible that maybe we could

1220
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:44,769
apply the floor displacement only to the

1221
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:48,160
Cape though you know what I'm saying to

1222
01:05:44,769 --> 01:05:54,519
you so maybe we don't apply the offset

1223
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:59,618
to these at all but we do apply it to

1224
01:05:54,519 --> 01:06:01,599
the Cape and if you imagine to the Cape

1225
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:03,430
being wider so that you didn't get that

1226
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:12,390
torso showing through look at the torso

1227
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:12,389
was smaller that that seems useful right

1228
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:21,568
potentially I don't know I think it's

1229
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:24,809
where a stick sticking in there probably

1230
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:24,808
my guess

1231
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,940
beauty in games the more I see the more

1232
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,320
I like this I wonder whether a subtle

1233
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,720
head Bob me add a feeling believe it

1234
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,850
really just a thought so

1235
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,469
the problem of that is the heads like

1236
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:48,029
really important in the game and I don't

1237
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:49,769
want to move it if the player doesn't

1238
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:51,420
move it that's also why I was a little

1239
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:54,659
bit worried about the sucking in there

1240
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:56,940
so I feel like that needs to stay it

1241
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:59,339
would I 100 said agree with you that it

1242
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,079
would look better if you bobbed it but I

1243
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:04,320
want the head to be exactly where the

1244
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:06,509
user places it basically so for the

1245
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:08,970
moment anyway I would like to not do

1246
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:11,700
that but you know when the games like

1247
01:07:08,969 --> 01:07:15,029
more completed in terms of playing

1248
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:17,159
through it and at that point we could

1249
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:20,640
revisit that issue and see like hey does

1250
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:22,379
it does it feel wrong but for the for

1251
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:24,089
starting the gameplay stuff I want to

1252
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:28,430
not have the head be moved by the game

1253
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:28,430
at all except when the user lets go

1254
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:53,289
and long boolean it seems like you got

1255
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,800
to the same conclusion I got to earlier

1256
01:07:53,289 --> 01:07:55,800
on the chat

1257
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:18,509
all right so I think we're good on

1258
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:18,509
questions related to what we were doing

1259
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:27,790
so I think mostly what we need here is

1260
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:29,019
just to see what would happen if and

1261
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:31,389
maybe I'll ask

1262
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:37,080
young-shin to give us some art that just

1263
01:08:31,389 --> 01:08:41,020
like most closely approximates this

1264
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:43,269
right so something that's like kind of

1265
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:46,210
really stacked and very top-down II and

1266
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:49,650
see like how that looks if we put it in

1267
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:56,439
here and the torso would be kind of like

1268
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:59,068
you know pretty minimal in terms of its

1269
01:08:56,439 --> 01:09:02,068
angle be it would be fat but but very

1270
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:02,069
top-down

1271
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:15,729
and we'll see what we'll see what that

1272
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:15,730
looks like I guess

1273
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:44,859
so yeah so I think that's good I think

1274
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:44,859
that's all reasonable all right

1275
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:51,550
and thus Isaac suggested perhaps a

1276
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,990
minimum stretch length so you don't get

1277
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:59,199
disappearing bitmaps while moving down

1278
01:09:52,989 --> 01:10:00,279
yeah I agree but let's let's wait till

1279
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,109
we get the actual art in there and we'll

1280
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,869
see what happens but I think that's a

1281
01:10:02,109 --> 01:10:12,069
good idea yeah all right I'm gonna go

1282
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:13,210
ahead and close up okay thank you

01:10:12,069 --> 01:10:14,259

1298
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:48,250
this morning

1299
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:52,450
if you've type handmade con dot org into

1300
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:56,470
your browser you should hopefully if it

1301
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:59,349
works yes get redirected our conference

1302
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:03,760
for 2016 has been announced and the

1303
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:06,430
dates are confirmed I verified just this

1304
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:11,070
weekend in fact that everything has been

1305
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:14,170
successfully rented and locked down so

1306
01:11:11,069 --> 01:11:15,969
it is okay to start planning trips and

1307
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:19,060
whatnot if you would like to come to

1308
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:20,829
handmade con 2016 again that's on the

1309
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:23,020
Molly Rocket blog but if you want you

1310
01:11:20,829 --> 01:11:25,269
can always just type handmade con org

1311
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:27,970
and it'll go to whatever the latest con

1312
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:30,370
is so if there's 2017 one it would go to

1313
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:32,140
that one and so on so if you come here

1314
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:34,539
you can get tickets through brown paper

1315
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:38,200
tickets as it's exactly the same as last

1316
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:40,689
year if you came to VidCon 2015 the only

1317
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:43,090
difference between last year and this

1318
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:45,159
year is we upgraded like just about

1319
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:49,270
everything we could based on the

1320
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:51,189
feedback from last year which was

1321
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:53,230
essentially that the con was great but

1322
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:56,079
our venue was not and I kind of agree

1323
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:58,029
with that it was basically like it was

1324
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,809
planned to be a pretty low cost event

1325
01:11:58,029 --> 01:11:59,899
because they didn't know how people are

1326
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:02,110
going to come I didn't know we

1327
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:05,479
gonna get 250 people or whatever it was

1328
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:08,509
so you know we were using a really

1329
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:11,209
low-cost space so this year since I know

1330
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:13,369
that the turnout is pretty high we've

1331
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:15,109
got a much better space and so what we

1332
01:12:13,369 --> 01:12:16,970
did is we booked a really nice place

1333
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:19,549
it's got great seats and it's really

1334
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:22,909
beautiful and it's a really great area

1335
01:12:19,550 --> 01:12:24,470
as well and we have our own for the

1336
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:27,680
second day we also have our own like

1337
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:28,970
hangout area too so we can hang out

1338
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:31,100
after the conference which is another

1339
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,659
big thing about it and we've got it for

1340
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:34,730
two days now so that because a lot of

1341
01:12:32,659 --> 01:12:36,260
people you know I was thinking would be

1342
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:37,489
mostly a thing for local people but we

1343
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,440
had a tremendous number of people who

1344
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:41,059
travel to go to the conference and they

1345
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,919
really wanted to be longer because if

1346
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:45,410
they're gonna you know Trek all this way

1347
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:47,239
having adding more days obviously makes

1348
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:50,210
it a lot nicer for them so they have you

1349
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:51,710
know more stuff to do so it's it's both

1350
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:54,399
Saturday and Sunday now instead of just

1351
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:56,720
Saturday so there's a lot more

1352
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:59,569
conference if that makes sense

1353
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:03,289
so basically everything we wanted we got

1354
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:05,420
and so hopefully that will pretty much

1355
01:13:03,289 --> 01:13:08,090
solve all any problems that we had last

1356
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:09,949
year because I think pretty much

1357
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:12,140
everything last year was always like

1358
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:17,989
like the conference didn't like the

1359
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:21,110
venue that's not true people were always

1360
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:23,420
very positive but you know if I looked

1361
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:25,039
at the list of things that people asked

1362
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:26,779
for last year they were never like

1363
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:30,409
really content related they were almost

1364
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:32,359
always venue related we like nice

1365
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:34,970
receipts we'd like more breaktime that

1366
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:36,319
sort of thing more days and so it was

1367
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:37,699
really just a question if could be rent

1368
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:39,590
a nicer venue and could we rent it for

1369
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:42,349
longer and I wasn't been eventually able

1370
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:45,409
to do that so if you like can make

1371
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:48,710
content e15 2016 should be exactly the

1372
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:51,500
same but better and and so check out

1373
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:53,239
those and and see if you can make it to

1374
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:56,899
this one if you can you can get tickets

1375
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:59,389
here and this actually is a shot of the

1376
01:13:56,899 --> 01:14:00,949
entrance area of the place where we're

1377
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:02,180
holding it it's pretty cool it's really

1378
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:03,800
nice looking at night they have a pretty

1379
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:07,220
cool lighting scheme and actually these

1380
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:09,680
lights are actually on like a hue

1381
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:12,470
rotation so they kind of like subtly

1382
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,789
change over time it's kind of freaky so

1383
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:14,869
somebody's they'll be like deep

1384
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:16,729
bullying other times they'll be like

1385
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,658
light blue it's kind of weird it's cool

1386
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:19,819
though

1387
01:14:17,658 --> 01:14:21,379
and this actually is also running water

1388
01:14:19,819 --> 01:14:26,179
here which is kind of neat has this like

1389
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:27,349
shimmery effect to it it's not on here

1390
01:14:26,179 --> 01:14:29,569
because I'm here tonight when they were

1391
01:14:27,349 --> 01:14:33,559
off as you can see there's nobody in

1392
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:36,018
there but yeah so it's pretty cool so

1393
01:14:33,559 --> 01:14:38,239
yeah all of that stuff should be great

1394
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:42,710
definitely check it out and again that's

1395
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:44,569
just handmade con organ your browser as

1396
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:47,170
with the previous year I tried to keep

1397
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:50,000
it basically as cheap as possible

1398
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:51,440
because I I computed out like how much

1399
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,118
we would need to pay like speaker travel

1400
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,669
expenses and renting the venue and I

1401
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:57,319
basically just set the price at what it

1402
01:14:55,670 --> 01:15:01,429
would take to cover that if we sold how

1403
01:14:57,319 --> 01:15:04,880
many tickets I roughly think we will so

1404
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:08,899
it's it's not quite as cheap as last

1405
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:11,029
year because last year was $35 and it's

1406
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:13,368
$60 this year but last year was only one

1407
01:15:11,029 --> 01:15:16,250
day so actually the per day price has

1408
01:15:13,368 --> 01:15:20,359
gone down the per day price went down

1409
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:21,618
five dollars from year-over-year and so

1410
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:23,868
I think that's pretty good

1411
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:25,848
considering the fact that we will get

1412
01:15:23,868 --> 01:15:30,018
everything basically upgraded and it's

1413
01:15:25,849 --> 01:15:32,210
you know in in a nicer place a nicer

1414
01:15:30,019 --> 01:15:34,159
location in the city the other thing too

1415
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:36,948
is I think I can get that down even

1416
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:39,859
further so you know as we sort of scale

1417
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:41,839
upward depending on how many people if

1418
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:43,250
we have a good turnout this year and you

1419
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,920
know we grow a little bit every year

1420
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:47,960
then that allows me to rent like nicer

1421
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,368
venues without increasing the cost right

1422
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,319
because every additional person you put

1423
01:15:49,368 --> 01:15:53,149
in a venue is they flee giving you more

1424
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:55,969
money to work with to rent the venue

1425
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:58,250
without actually creating there's no per

1426
01:15:55,969 --> 01:16:00,288
person cost you know the venue cost what

1427
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:03,380
it costs so if you can bump up you know

1428
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:05,090
if you can get to a 2,000 person thing

1429
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:06,650
at some point and you're you know you're

1430
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:07,849
selling tickets to a thousand people or

1431
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:09,948
something like this

1432
01:16:07,849 --> 01:16:11,449
then the price can just can go down

1433
01:16:09,948 --> 01:16:12,888
dramatically because at that point

1434
01:16:11,448 --> 01:16:14,569
you've got so many people paying for

1435
01:16:12,889 --> 01:16:17,239
space even though the spaces get more

1436
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:20,090
expensive you can sort of reduce the

1437
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:21,618
ticket price so you know I think it's

1438
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:22,760
entirely likely that we'll be able to

1439
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:25,759
get maybe get the ticket price down to

1440
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:28,430
$50 next year which is where pretty much

1441
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,539
I think is a good place for it to be

1442
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:32,760
just like I said keeping it affordable I

1443
01:16:30,539 --> 01:16:34,050
don't want it to like creep up so I was

1444
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:39,270
okay with it getting a little higher

1445
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:40,829
this year just because like we're

1446
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:42,630
expanding the conference so dramatically

1447
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:44,699
and it's like a lot more time I'm okay

1448
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:46,319
with it going up but I don't want to see

1449
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:48,869
that being like a trend I don't want the

1450
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:51,869
ticket price to like creep up until it's

1451
01:16:48,869 --> 01:16:53,939
you know $100 or $200 I really don't

1452
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:55,649
want that to happen so pretty much every

1453
01:16:53,939 --> 01:16:57,389
year I will be trying to like figure out

1454
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:59,639
like what can we do in terms of scale

1455
01:16:57,390 --> 01:17:01,289
and can we keep the ticket prices low I

1456
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,329
realized that the ticket prices aren't

1457
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:05,550
high compared to anyone else this

1458
01:17:03,329 --> 01:17:07,470
conference but at the same time it's

1459
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:08,369
like that's not really reason not to try

1460
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:09,990
to figure out how to keep it as

1461
01:17:08,369 --> 01:17:11,519
affordable as possible and it is true

1462
01:17:09,989 --> 01:17:15,630
that there are students from who are

1463
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,860
local and you know students who are or

1464
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,440
fans the serious who are coming from

1465
01:17:16,859 --> 01:17:20,939
further away the $60 is not an important

1466
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:22,109
part of the cost because it cost so much

1467
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:26,009
to get a plane ticket and everything

1468
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:27,869
else and hotel but for people who are

1469
01:17:26,010 --> 01:17:29,220
coming locally you know it does make a

1470
01:17:27,869 --> 01:17:31,739
difference right i if you can get it

1471
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:33,539
down to $30 again for two days or

1472
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:35,069
something then that definitely makes it

1473
01:17:33,539 --> 01:17:36,960
a little bit easier on everyone who's

1474
01:17:35,069 --> 01:17:38,969
coming locally so so that's stuff that

1475
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,800
I'll be working on again that's super

1476
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:43,230
relevant but that's just I'd like to be

1477
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,090
upfront about the pricing because again

1478
01:17:43,229 --> 01:17:47,009
you know if you've heard me talk about

1479
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:49,050
GDC one of my biggest complaints there

1480
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:50,699
is they just absolutely milk it for as

1481
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:52,650
much money as they can and you see these

1482
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:55,439
ticket prices that are like you know

1483
01:17:52,649 --> 01:17:56,729
thousand dollars it's you know I think

1484
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:02,029
regular registration is something like

1485
01:17:56,729 --> 01:18:05,849
it's like $1,800 or $1,900 it's crazy

1486
01:18:02,029 --> 01:18:07,710
how much they charge and I just don't

1487
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:09,060
think it's ethical because they don't

1488
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:10,920
even really provide the content right

1489
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:13,080
like people come and speak for free at

1490
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,640
the thing and so it's kind of crazy like

1491
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:16,109
I just can't even see how you can

1492
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,100
justify that to yourself I don't know

1493
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:19,859
how you sleep at night when you do that

1494
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,780
kind of thing to people so like that's

1495
01:18:19,859 --> 01:18:23,759
like a very hard priority for me is that

1496
01:18:21,779 --> 01:18:25,319
I always want to keep the prices really

1497
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,300
low on the conference and and that's

1498
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:29,309
basically where we've been at on it this

1499
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:32,640
year and we'll see if I can do better

1500
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:34,680
next year if we weren't paying speaker

1501
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,900
travel expenses these prices could be

1502
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:39,030
way lower already right

1503
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:41,189
so in terms of like figuring how to do

1504
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:42,420
like venue negotiate venue negotiations

1505
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:43,769
like that I think I've gotten that

1506
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:47,730
pretty well under control actually

1507
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:49,260
because most of the money this year will

1508
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:51,119
not be going towards the venue rental

1509
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:52,440
necessarily most of the money will

1510
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,119
probably going towards paying spiegel

1511
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:58,979
travel and stuff like that

1512
01:18:54,119 --> 01:19:00,180
so you know again it's like it's all

1513
01:18:58,979 --> 01:19:02,009
just kind of a toss up you know I could

1514
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:04,140
reduce the price but again speakers are

1515
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:06,030
donating their time to come and speak

1516
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,770
they should not have to pay out of

1517
01:19:06,029 --> 01:19:09,269
pocket things that's like another really

1518
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:10,830
crazy thing about like something like

1519
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:13,680
the GDC which I don't approve of right

1520
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:15,630
and so I try to keep it all as balanced

1521
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:17,520
as possible so that the speakers and the

1522
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:19,289
attendees are getting absolutely as fair

1523
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,140
a deal as I can possibly put forward for

1524
01:19:19,289 --> 01:19:23,969
them and I spend a ton of time working

1525
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,430
that out and so this was I think the

1526
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:29,460
best go around this time but well we can

1527
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:31,500
probably get it even better next year so

1528
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:32,939
that's the complete thing about hammock

1529
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,609
contravene the speaker list is not

1530
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:37,259
announced yet it will be similar to last

1531
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:38,399
year in the sense that I will be trying

1532
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,579
to get people who I think are very

1533
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:43,920
distinguished in either game development

1534
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:46,979
or field that are extremely relevant to

1535
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:49,829
game development and it will be a very

1536
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:51,569
similar format to last year where a lot

1537
01:19:49,829 --> 01:19:53,430
of the content will be basically me sort

1538
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:56,639
of interviewing people and drilling down

1539
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:59,579
into various aspects of what they do and

1540
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,140
how they do it and why as well as a

1541
01:19:59,579 --> 01:20:02,159
little bit of backstory in history which

1542
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,239
i think is always interesting too I

1543
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:05,460
think it's important for people to know

1544
01:20:03,238 --> 01:20:07,049
about you know if you've got a great

1545
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:08,460
programmer up there how did they get

1546
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:09,869
started what sort of things are you

1547
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,399
because you don't always get a chance to

1548
01:20:09,869 --> 01:20:12,930
hear some of those things especially

1549
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:15,960
from some programmers who maybe aren't

1550
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:18,750
famous in some other sense but are you

1551
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,069
know basically you know sort of pseudo

1552
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:21,750
legendary in the sense of like what

1553
01:20:20,069 --> 01:20:23,369
they've accomplished it's kind of

1554
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,420
interesting to see like the back stories

1555
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:26,609
of some of those people and kind of get

1556
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,859
a little more information about where

1557
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:31,409
they come from so we'll be keeping the

1558
01:20:28,859 --> 01:20:32,250
format basically saying but what'll be a

1559
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:34,349
little bit different this year is

1560
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:36,090
because we have more time we can do a

1561
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:38,489
few more things like we can probably do

1562
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:39,930
questions at the event this year because

1563
01:20:38,488 --> 01:20:41,519
questions didn't really work last year I

1564
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:43,170
asked people to send them in after and I

1565
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,780
just didn't get very many so it really

1566
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,100
wasn't worth I think doing that and so

1567
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:49,050
we will probably make the conference

1568
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:51,120
more interactive this year also will

1569
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:53,159
have longer breaks so during the breaks

1570
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,960
you can interact with other attendees or

1571
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:57,180
the speakers as

1572
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,649
you know as possible so that you know

1573
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:01,020
you can get a little more of that sort

1574
01:20:58,649 --> 01:21:02,579
of organic stuff happening so we'll be

1575
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,900
able to do much longer breaks this year

1576
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:07,170
which you know I think should be a

1577
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:08,549
pretty excellent addition as well as

1578
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:10,170
having one dedicated Meetup

1579
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:12,029
because people who weren't aware of some

1580
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:13,770
of the meetups missed out on some of

1581
01:21:12,029 --> 01:21:15,300
that and those were pretty great so this

1582
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:16,920
year we'll at least have one where

1583
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,869
everyone knows okay for these three

1584
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,270
hours you can come and go and this kind

1585
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:22,260
of in this area you know go get your

1586
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:23,850
dinner or whatever but then come back

1587
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:26,730
after you're done and if you want to

1588
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:28,289
hang out and that'll be on Sunday so

1589
01:21:26,729 --> 01:21:31,889
that everyone can kind of have a chance

1590
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:33,149
to to hang out and talk and meet each

1591
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:35,340
other and then you know say goodbye

1592
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:39,000
before they head back to their

1593
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:41,279
respective places so that'll I think be

1594
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,680
pretty great as well now one thing that

1595
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:47,189
wasn't great

1596
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:49,680
is that this year we could have probably

1597
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:52,349
afforded to have that hangout space

1598
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,780
available the entire time which would

1599
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:57,390
have been my preference but one of the

1600
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:59,250
problems of basically like doing the

1601
01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:02,670
startup process of getting this con

1602
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:04,529
rolling is that you know in 2015 it was

1603
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:06,329
just like hey I did whatever I could I

1604
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:07,889
did a simple thing low cost just because

1605
01:22:06,329 --> 01:22:09,180
to see what would happen and of course

1606
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:11,520
it went way better than I ever could

1607
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,659
have expected so 2016 I was way more

1608
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,340
serious about it like I know what we're

1609
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:16,880
dealing with here what can we do but

1610
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:19,110
there's a because of the pipeline

1611
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,969
there's a little bit of a problem in

1612
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:23,189
getting what we want even if we can

1613
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,430
afford it and fight find it and afford

1614
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:26,729
it

1615
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:29,369
and so there simply wasn't any schedule

1616
01:22:26,729 --> 01:22:33,599
availability to get a hangout space for

1617
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:35,760
both days so I anticipate you know

1618
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,860
well it'll kind of be a test in 2016

1619
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:39,480
what we'll do is we'll see how that

1620
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:42,059
hangout space works I think it'll

1621
01:22:39,479 --> 01:22:44,609
probably be really good and assuming

1622
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,860
that it is for 2017 I've already kind of

1623
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:50,219
got things slotted and I'm trying to

1624
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:52,889
kind of keep things reserved will for

1625
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:55,560
2017 will probably go ahead and get that

1626
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:57,719
space for both days because that way

1627
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:59,489
will always for the entire length of the

1628
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:01,289
conference they'll always be a place you

1629
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:02,809
can meet up with people even if you're

1630
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:04,890
gonna go somewhere else and hang out

1631
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:07,590
they'll always be a place that you know

1632
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:08,820
you can meet up with people and where

1633
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:10,440
you know people will sort of be

1634
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:11,609
when they don't have anything else

1635
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:13,649
they're doing at the conference and I

1636
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:14,908
think that'll be really great so I wish

1637
01:23:13,649 --> 01:23:16,649
I could have got it this year we

1638
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:18,029
couldn't not because of the money I

1639
01:23:16,649 --> 01:23:19,078
think we probably could have made the

1640
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:20,609
money or you know I could have raised

1641
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:22,139
the ticket price by five bucks and got

1642
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:24,779
or whatever right I could have made that

1643
01:23:22,139 --> 01:23:27,480
happen but it just simply wasn't

1644
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:30,750
available and this venue was by far the

1645
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:33,718
best one in terms of what we needed and

1646
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:35,340
the price and what we could what they

1647
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:37,560
required didn't require us to do all of

1648
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:40,230
those things it was definitely the best

1649
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:42,510
so it was a very very clear choice there

1650
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:44,129
wasn't really any other option and there

1651
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:47,670
just wasn't an ability to make that

1652
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:49,800
happen so for 2017 I think we can

1653
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:54,090
improve on that even a little bit more

1654
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:56,670
but we'll use 2016 as as sort of a test

1655
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:58,078
and if it turns out that that space

1656
01:23:56,670 --> 01:24:00,149
really isn't that useful then we'll know

1657
01:23:58,078 --> 01:24:02,670
and we won't do it but I feel like it

1658
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:04,920
probably will be in and so sunday will

1659
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:08,190
be the test day to see how we like it

1660
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:12,090
and and then we'll go from there so I

1661
01:24:08,189 --> 01:24:13,888
think that is just about it for a

1662
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:16,020
handmade con if you do have questions

1663
01:24:13,889 --> 01:24:19,349
about it or want to talk about certain

1664
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:26,869
aspects of it obviously on handmade

1665
01:24:19,349 --> 01:24:28,500
network we can kind of go like go on to

1666
01:24:26,868 --> 01:24:32,219
handmade oops

1667
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:37,649
he wrote handmade Wow spelling that

1668
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:39,359
Network and you can go into like one of

1669
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:40,979
the code forum serious and like this may

1670
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:43,589
be at some point we should make a forum

1671
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:45,689
for the conference and I don't know if

1672
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:47,699
anyone out there is listening who is

1673
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:49,828
when the mods there are no administrator

1674
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:52,769
options at the moment on these forums

1675
01:24:49,828 --> 01:24:55,439
for me so I can't do it but we may want

1676
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:57,179
to make a forum for handmade con because

1677
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,710
that way people could post in there if

1678
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:01,408
they have questions or you know and each

1679
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:02,880
con could have you know as we go so if

1680
01:25:01,408 --> 01:25:04,948
you do have stuff that you are

1681
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,969
interested in knowing you can post it on

1682
01:25:04,948 --> 01:25:07,649
there and then I could take care of it

1683
01:25:05,969 --> 01:25:10,920
in a blog post or whatever coming

1684
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:14,189
forward so so I think that's basically

1685
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,989
it let me double check the chat to see

1686
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:17,609
if anyone has already posted anything

1687
01:25:15,988 --> 01:25:20,388
that I should respond to you but I think

1688
01:25:17,609 --> 01:25:20,389
we're pretty much

1689
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:25,480
pretty much good

1690
01:25:40,248 --> 01:25:45,559
all right so I think we're good so

1691
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:50,928
that's about it thank you very much for

1692
01:25:45,559 --> 01:25:53,510
joining me as always and I will catch

1693
01:25:50,929 --> 01:25:57,590
you guys on the internet tomorrow I am

1694
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:59,900
off but the day after we will be back

1695
01:25:57,590 --> 01:26:02,420
here at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time

1696
01:25:59,899 --> 01:26:04,279
and we'll probably move on now that I'm

1697
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,229
like relatively sure that the hero

1698
01:26:04,279 --> 01:26:08,748
movement is going to work the way I

1699
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:10,190
wanted it to you know we can well I'm

1700
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:12,170
sure we'll we'll be tuning it and tuning

1701
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:13,698
it and tuning it over time but I'm

1702
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:16,010
relatively okay with that

1703
01:26:13,698 --> 01:26:18,738
we'll probably start working on some

1704
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:23,420
more entity system stuff just sort of

1705
01:26:18,738 --> 01:26:26,569
like get that stuff under control so

1706
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,940
we'll take care of that and so if you're

1707
01:26:26,569 --> 01:26:31,429
interested in that come back Wednesday

1708
01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:33,589
until then have fun programming and I

1709
01:26:31,429 --> 01:26:36,158
will see you folks on the Internet take

1710
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:36,159
it easy everyone
