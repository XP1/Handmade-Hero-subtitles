00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,490
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,069
Hero the show where we code a complete

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,039
game live on Twitch no library's no

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,070
engine it's just you know the old

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,559
fashioned elbow grease style of game

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,480
development right before your very eyes

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,890
of course we've already kind of gotten

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,050
past a lot of the stuff that's the elbow

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,880
grease we've we've already sort of done

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,830
a lot of the work on like rendering and

11
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:28,890
and entities storage and all that sort

12
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:32,399
of stuff we're kind of getting to the

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,710
point where this might start start to be

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,730
some semblance of an engine we're at the

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,950
point now where we're even thinking

16
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,799
about maybe in a week or two here

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,899
starting optimizations on the renderer

18
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,179
so you know it's getting down to it I

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,460
think originally I had a ballpark that

20
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,128
we'd spend about 200 days which is

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,230
roughly 200 hours so that breaks down to

22
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:53,820
like you know five weeks of programming

23
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,709
time basically five weeks of full-time

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,020
programming time and five weeks of

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,609
programming time is like nothing right

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,670
like five weeks of programming time is

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,558
is nothing and so I was thinking well

28
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,948
five weeks to make an engine sure why

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,329
not

30
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:08,849
right seems a little ambitious but it

31
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,069
should work and so far it looks like we

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:12,929
might actually make that like we were

33
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:14,849
only halfway through our time budget for

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,618
stuff that I was thinking you know we'd

35
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,048
want to do and there's just not a lot of

36
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:21,359
stuff left to go we've got you know some

37
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,270
renderer work to do probably do 20 30

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,400
more days of render stuff I'm guessing

39
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,408
something like this and then we're back

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,390
to just kind of a little bit of list of

41
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,130
features that really aren't I don't

42
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,099
think that heavyweight there's stuff

43
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:37,709
like just um you know Titan doing a real

44
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:39,750
collision detector and you know maybe

45
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,250
doing some debug code that sort of stuff

46
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,868
but they're really just wasn't that much

47
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,828
on our list so I don't know I'm feeling

48
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:46,170
pretty good about it

49
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:47,699
I think the 200-400 breakdown is

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,219
actually not going to be too far off

51
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,500
potentially which is 200 hours of coding

52
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,239
on the engine and 400 hours of coding on

53
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,319
the game which roughly breaks down again

54
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:01,769
to you know something like five weeks of

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,169
programming time to build the engine and

56
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:06,899
then something like ten weeks to build

57
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,379
the game right so it's like a three

58
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,759
month for a month kind of

59
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,379
so we'll see we don't know where we're

60
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,879
gonna be but that's roughly the thinking

61
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,799
and it seems like it's going okay so far

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,719
if you would like to follow along at

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,270
home today

64
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:22,620
today is day 106 so go ahead if you

65
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,040
pre-ordered the source code you should

66
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,930
have a zip file unzip 105's source code

67
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,609
a 105 source code from the zip file and

68
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,000
that is what you want to start with

69
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,880
right here right now so that you can

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,219
code along with me and it'll be like you

71
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,090
know it's like riding up a tandem bike

72
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:45,090
yeah I'm saying but you're on the back

73
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,280
bro I'm in the front all right so we

74
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,590
left off don't ask me why this happened

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,239
yesterday in the Q&amp;A people were asking

76
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,979
if we could reflect actual images

77
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,719
instead of checker boards and I'm

78
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,459
assuming there were people who weren't

79
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,109
here when we implemented this stuff and

80
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,229
explained how these were just images and

81
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:05,220
we put checker boards in them explicitly

82
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:08,099
for the purpose of having something we

83
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:11,370
could see the lines in and so we ended

84
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,349
up bleeding some ground into our bottom

85
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,030
bitmap here and that's why our bitmap is

86
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,159
no longer reflecting a red checkerboard

87
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,799
it's reflecting this patch of ground

88
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,120
that we grabbed but that's just totally

89
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,260
that was not at all what we were

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,230
supposed to be doing that's just some

91
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,519
stuff that people asked in the QA and so

92
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:28,828
what we were supposed to be doing I

93
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,170
think I might actually turn off that

94
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,180
little that that stuff for right now

95
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,738
actually I think I might just go in here

96
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,680
real quickly just well we're talking

97
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,170
about it and turn off the coordinate

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,969
system test stuff that we still have in

99
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,449
there so in here I'm just going to go

100
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:47,519
ahead and put that back to any of 0 just

101
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:50,699
to get that out of the way there for us

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,829
and so now we're back to just having the

103
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,280
actual game graphics which is what we've

104
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,810
wanted and today what I want had said

105
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,669
that I want to do and what I think that

106
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,909
we probably should do is to start

107
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,589
getting our z situation straightened out

108
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,909
because you know that's kind of the

109
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,140
whole reason that we dove into the

110
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,209
renderer is we were kind of like well

111
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,679
you know what we have to start nailing

112
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,849
down our Z because that was one of the

113
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,189
last things in our engine architecture

114
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,989
that wasn't quite there so I don't want

115
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:18,719
to do now is I want to start changing

116
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,370
over I think what I want to do is just

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,569
flat-out change over the render

118
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,019
so that we're going through the

119
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:28,300
coordinate system draw instead of their

120
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,529
main draw now this would probably tank

121
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,360
our frame wait quite a bit I don't

122
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:32,559
really care about that right now because

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,569
like I said we're gonna optimize the

124
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,918
renderer so I don't care about that but

125
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:38,348
what I'd like to do is get it so that

126
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:42,068
we're drawing the world through

127
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:43,779
something that can scale it and the

128
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:45,848
reason that I'd like to do that is

129
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:48,098
because once we can scale the world we

130
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:49,750
can kind of see how things stack up on

131
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:52,569
each other and zoom and that sort of

132
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,709
stuff and so I want to see how bad it

133
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,060
would be if we just started going

134
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:57,579
through the coordinate system drawing

135
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,819
call to draw everything so let's go

136
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:03,278
ahead and try that out right so if you

137
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:08,528
take a look in handmade render group

138
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:10,810
right we have our draw rectangles slowly

139
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:13,509
call there's really no reason we can't

140
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,930
call the draw rectangle slowly call with

141
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:18,669
our bitmaps right because we've got you

142
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,639
know essentially what we have here is

143
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:22,598
our push buffer processing stuff is you

144
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,490
know it's basically like a stream

145
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:26,620
processor right it reads out of the

146
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,319
stream it sees what's coming into the

147
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,329
stream and it says it translates those

148
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,009
into actual code you know it basically

149
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,079
says I'm reading this buffer and I'm

150
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,088
gonna do operations on it so it's pretty

151
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,698
free for us to just say okay we used to

152
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:41,228
render a bitmap like this but maybe you

153
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,060
know we actually want to render a bitmap

154
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:44,649
in a different way and there's nothing

155
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,240
wrong with that right we can just go

156
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:48,310
ahead and call a different function here

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,740
draw a rectangle slowly for example we

158
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,050
can go ahead and call that instead so we

159
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,788
can pass the output target and then we

160
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,879
just have to fabricate these other

161
00:05:54,788 --> 00:06:01,300
things that we actually want to have

162
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,639
right so we know what some of the stuff

163
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,079
is right we know what the the bitmap is

164
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,088
that we're doing we know that we don't

165
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:10,478
have a normal map or any of these other

166
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:13,240
maps at all right pixels two meters I

167
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,878
believe is something that we were just

168
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,598
sort of computing here right because we

169
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:20,800
didn't actually have that so there we go

170
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:23,139
although what I might do is just let's

171
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,490
just get that out into a variable so

172
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,699
it's not getting spammed everywhere

173
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,960
pixels two meters there we go

174
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,970
and

175
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,318
go ahead and put that up at the top

176
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,400
there we are

177
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,740
so pixels two meters yeah

178
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,179
pixels two meters is now precomputed

179
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,030
which is what I wanted and that's just

180
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,009
the inverse of our meters two pixels and

181
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,348
so now we've got mostly everything we

182
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,509
need we just need the placement of this

183
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:50,639
thing right we just need to know where

184
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:54,689
it's going to be now the origin we've

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,550
got it's that px py bit so if I just

186
00:06:54,689 --> 00:07:01,079
pull that outside in fact these can all

187
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,939
be outside if I just use that P that X Y

188
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,159
there would tell me and I know that the

189
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,629
x axis and the y axis are just the

190
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,330
standard axes right

191
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:11,879
I know exactly what those are for now

192
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:14,219
and then the color value obviously is

193
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,009
something that that's been passed in and

194
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,639
so if I want to its close to me address

195
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:22,848
there we go

196
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:32,360
I can now in theory I think call through

197
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:32,360
call through the slow path and go or not

198
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:38,520
that was awesome

199
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:41,189
so just realize something this has to be

200
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:43,859
the entire size of the thing in pixels

201
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:45,329
which I just remembered so if this is

202
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,158
the entire size thing in pixels that

203
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:48,810
will draw everything as one pixel and

204
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:51,658
you can actually see the little pixel

205
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,918
dots in there we could make it a little

206
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:55,500
bit better by making them a little

207
00:07:52,918 --> 00:08:04,468
larger there you go you can see

208
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:06,449
everybody's little tiny okay sometimes

209
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:09,269
the bugs are more fun

210
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:11,069
you know then sometimes the bugs are the

211
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:14,639
most fun thing I guess is what I would

212
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,870
say all right sorry I lost my train of

213
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,250
thought there what I was trying to say

214
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,329
was that these the x axis and the y axis

215
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,250
currently we passed those in with the

216
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:25,439
entirety of the scale of the thing that

217
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,598
we're drawing baked in and so what that

218
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,139
means is we would have to use the bitmap

219
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:33,718
itself to to sort of get that with in

220
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,719
that height that we need right that we

221
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,490
need to specify so I believe we can just

222
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,250
pass that along I don't think we have to

223
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,038
do anything special

224
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,568
for that what's the problem here sorry

225
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,269
there we go

226
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:49,370
so I pretty sure that's actually not

227
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,528
really a big deal there you go and you

228
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,778
can see that our frame rate is super

229
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:56,480
slow now right

230
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:58,669
that can just give you some idea of how

231
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,829
expensive that calculation really is

232
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:03,649
it's fairly expensive right because

233
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:07,008
right now that routine is so in totally

234
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:11,149
unbiased it's just yeah it's pretty

235
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:14,240
rough but at the same time what is kind

236
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:18,438
of interesting about it is even so

237
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,198
looking at this currently this is still

238
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:23,419
not that bad like for how ridiculous

239
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:25,099
that function is with what it's doing

240
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:27,979
right now in terms of how inefficient it

241
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,420
is this is actually pretty good and

242
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,009
again this is why I say I'm kind of

243
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:34,448
surprised and this is a five year old

244
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:37,220
computer right I'm kind of surprised by

245
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:40,849
how fast it really is without having to

246
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,009
do any real work it's kind of crazy so

247
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,720
at the end of the day this I think bodes

248
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:48,470
pretty well for us in terms of our

249
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,509
optimization because really like getting

250
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,089
it from here to be something that's

251
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:56,899
real-time I just isn't I don't think

252
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,879
that bad and you have to remember also

253
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,429
we're doing some really stupid stuff

254
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,050
right now even if you don't even talk

255
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:06,919
about how unoptimized the code is

256
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:09,438
there's also another part to it which is

257
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:11,539
that right now we're Matt we're not even

258
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:16,129
like bothering to pre clip our sprites

259
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:18,860
so for example you know this head is

260
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,959
actually running over all the pixels

261
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,360
that are in this entire giant rectangle

262
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:26,268
right because we're not even we're not

263
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,110
even clipping our sprites to just be the

264
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:32,149
region that's actually filled with valid

265
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,430
pixel data right so we could actually

266
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:36,679
improve things quite a bit probably by

267
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:39,198
fixing that as well but at the moment

268
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,028
like I said not a super concern to me

269
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:43,219
because I'm really only concerned about

270
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:45,350
what things look like not how fast they

271
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,410
run I'm I'm fairly confident that we'll

272
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,970
be fine with that so what I like about

273
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:52,789
this now is now that we're going through

274
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,930
this path what that means for us is

275
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:56,659
we'll be able to

276
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:59,359
scale things up and down which i think

277
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:03,490
is a pretty important thing for us to do

278
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,870
actually I feel like that's good hmm

279
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:10,269
as I spilled water all over myself

280
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:14,990
I feel like the scaling is a good thing

281
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:16,789
but I do have one sort of I do have one

282
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,620
thing that I'm not entirely certain

283
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,509
about in terms of how you want to deal

284
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,389
with the scaling or whether we even want

285
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:26,778
the scaling or not and what that is is

286
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:29,120
I'm not currently certain when I do the

287
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:32,360
scaling I don't actually know whether I

288
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,330
want to scale each individual sprite all

289
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,669
the time or whether instead I would

290
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,700
rather do it so that we draw into a

291
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:43,129
buffer and then scale that right and

292
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,080
just to sort of give a little bit of a

293
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:49,070
perspective on on how that's working

294
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,160
this is what I'm sort of thinking

295
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,990
through so the thing that I'm not sure

296
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,879
about is let's take for example the

297
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,950
ground tiles right so the way that we're

298
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:01,309
doing the ground tiles right now is we

299
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:04,209
essentially have round tiles that you

300
00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:06,349
know we fill in with ground data right

301
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,250
and and by the way when I'm saying

302
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,950
ground tiles

303
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:17,299
I mean ground like like floor right not

304
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:19,070
like beef so we're not talking about

305
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,269
ground beef here when we say ground beef

306
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,070
tiles that would be a very different

307
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:26,778
thing we're talking about things that

308
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:29,060
are on like the ground okay so when we

309
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:31,129
do these you can imagine that if we

310
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,229
wanted to make it appear like we have

311
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:35,600
multiple height levels right so looking

312
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,089
from the side we're doing this if we

313
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,709
wanted to make it appear like the things

314
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:41,300
that were higher closer to the camera

315
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:43,159
right like here's the camera looking

316
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:44,778
down things that are closer to the

317
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:47,149
camera if we wanted to make them appear

318
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:49,578
as if they were scaled upward there's

319
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,769
two ways we could do that one is that we

320
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:53,509
could render the ground tiles into a

321
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,689
buffer first that is basically the

322
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:59,990
ground buffer right and then scale that

323
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,510
up right the other way we could do it is

324
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,990
scale each individual ground tile to

325
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:07,220
make just a bigger set of ground tiles

326
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,830
right

327
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,740
and there's good and bad aspects of

328
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,190
doing these two things first of all as

329
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:19,039
you've seen scaling is more expensive

330
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,450
like something that allows scaling is a

331
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,129
little more expensive than something

332
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,740
that just does a direct rectangle copy

333
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:27,259
so one reason that we might want to go

334
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,460
with this method is for speed because if

335
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:30,139
we just did

336
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,019
blitz directly into this buffer and then

337
00:13:30,139 --> 00:13:35,419
did one split that scales up we might be

338
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:37,309
able to make things faster however on

339
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:40,699
the other hand we have to remember that

340
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:42,169
it would incur one whole extra copy from

341
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,129
the but you know from one buffer to the

342
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:47,990
other right which if we were able to

343
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,659
make this version fairly efficient might

344
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,730
actually end up being a lose right and

345
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:54,469
especially since memory bandwidth tends

346
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,870
to be a real big problem and maybe

347
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,850
computation is not such a big deal in

348
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,610
certain circumstances we don't really

349
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,769
know where that trade-off lies and so

350
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,300
the other thing that I think a little

351
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,909
bit better about going this way with it

352
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:11,959
is we don't incur any problems with

353
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:13,490
scope so if we were to say scale down so

354
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,530
let's say we were doing we were making a

355
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,240
small thing so here's the screen right

356
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,789
and there's a floor that's off in the

357
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,799
distance that we're trying to render

358
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:24,110
this becomes problematic if we actually

359
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:26,719
wanted it to fill the whole screen right

360
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,279
and the reason it becomes problematic is

361
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,279
because if we wanted to fill the whole

362
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,049
screen like so right that would mean

363
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,629
that our starting buffer would have to

364
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:37,519
be huge it would have to be like 9 times

365
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:39,439
the size of the screen in order to scale

366
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,879
down to something like I've drawn here

367
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,560
right because it has to be this big

368
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,019
right it has to be the size of the

369
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,449
screen when scaled down and so if it was

370
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:53,120
you know if this is actually how big a

371
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,589
screen size thing is you know then that

372
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,970
means that you'd have to do something

373
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:58,700
way way bigger than the screen as the

374
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:02,480
original buffer to shrink down so I

375
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,540
think it argues for not doing that sort

376
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,029
of post pass kind of thing it argues for

377
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:09,769
for actually rendering things the size

378
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,329
that they're supposed to be directly and

379
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:16,220
not going into an intermediate buffer

380
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:18,710
now that said I do think we may need to

381
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,910
do some stuff with intermediate

382
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,970
buffering and I'll talk

383
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:27,120
what that is in a second here so let's

384
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,519
say that we're going to allow some

385
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,820
number of ground levels right so let's

386
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,470
say that we do something right that

387
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,580
looks like I don't know that looks like

388
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,290
this and the way that this works is in

389
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:48,810
fact I'm gonna going to draw it a little

390
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:51,240
bit differently so let's say that we do

391
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,979
something looks like this and the way

392
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,200
that this works is this is the level

393
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,340
that we're actually looking at right so

394
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,160
this is what we're looking at and this

395
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:06,480
is the next level down right and this is

396
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:09,839
the next level down from that and so

397
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,110
what we want to do here right is we want

398
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,550
some way of as we move as the character

399
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,440
moves like lift there's a stairwell in

400
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:17,969
here and they move up the stairwell

401
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,930
right remember we're looking down from

402
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:24,779
the top on this if they move upwards

403
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:26,489
what we want to do is we want to make it

404
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,000
so that oh I guess I drew that in the

405
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,440
wrong place

406
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,759
sorry if they move upwards so that this

407
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,830
will become the new level that we're

408
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,909
looking at right so we're going to move

409
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,910
our camera view up we need some way of

410
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:44,370
of having that new level come in right

411
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:47,490
so we want to do something there like an

412
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,659
alpha fade or something like this where

413
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:55,470
we can actually fade it in on top of of

414
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,839
the underlying geometry right and maybe

415
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,730
you know what I think instead of trying

416
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,950
to explain to you what the problems are

417
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,840
with doing that I think maybe I'll just

418
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,660
implement it we can just implement it

419
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,430
right now the stupid way and I can show

420
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,279
you why the stupid way is a problem

421
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:15,539
before we talk about ways to fix the

422
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:18,119
stupid way so let's do that really I do

423
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:20,609
need to at some point remember to ask

424
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,159
yangshin to draw us a stairwell so I can

425
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,750
just put a stairwell in here instead of

426
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,150
having to constantly pretend that we

427
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,390
have a stairwell which we we currently

428
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:34,200
don't have so anyway what I'm going to

429
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,790
do for temporary purpose is is I would

430
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,670
like to

431
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:44,509
make it so that we have instead of

432
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:47,269
moving the hero in Y with the with the W

433
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:48,859
and s keys or you know what I'll do I'll

434
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:52,220
just make it so that when you hit the

435
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:54,439
spacebar instead of that being a jump

436
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,910
which we don't actually need what I

437
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,110
might do is oh wait you know what I

438
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,550
don't even need any of that I'll just

439
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,289
use the arrow keys because we've got

440
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,210
those bound as well I'll just use the

441
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:05,029
arrow keys to basically give me a way to

442
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,819
move the hero in Z just up and down

443
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:09,740
right or not even the hero just the

444
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:11,389
camera even right I don't even care

445
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,740
about the hero where the hero is I just

446
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,630
want to be able to move the camera up

447
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,970
and down so that we can see what happens

448
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,400
when it zooms kind of in and out if that

449
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,480
makes sense so what I'm going to do here

450
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,710
is we have that that sort of action

451
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,569
button thing right we've got these

452
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,870
action buttons and what I'm gonna do

453
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:31,970
right now is I'm just gonna kind of take

454
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:34,399
out that code that was sort of when we

455
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,610
were in there testing sort of ability to

456
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,220
fire things and that sort of stuff and

457
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:42,409
I'm gonna go ahead and make some code

458
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,990
here that just looks at whether that

459
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,610
that initial button is up or down and

460
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm just gonna make a little a simple

461
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:51,979
little thing that allows me to move the

462
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,769
camera up and down because we've got a

463
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,529
camera we've got the camera P right and

464
00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,980
I don't even remember exactly how we're

465
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:02,960
doing it I think right now we just we

466
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,120
actually just have the camera track the

467
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,200
player right but I don't actually

468
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:12,799
remember what we really did for that it

469
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,539
looks like that's not it it looks like

470
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,980
that's handled entirely in the sim

471
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:23,990
region so let's take a look there sim

472
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,589
region PPP yeah and so basically the

473
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,269
camera

474
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:29,480
we just got an entity that the camera

475
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:31,369
follows and so all I'm gonna do is when

476
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,279
we do the drawing here I'm just going to

477
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:36,409
introduce a synthetic offset to the Z

478
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:39,079
value that I can control so I can move

479
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,870
things up and down basically and that'll

480
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,549
be you know that'll be it so you know

481
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:45,379
look right here when we do basically get

482
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,649
entity ground point I'm just gonna add

483
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,530
in a Z offset

484
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:53,860
which basically you know literally it's

485
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:57,250
just gonna be for our testing how the

486
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:59,319
zooming works right so we'll go ahead

487
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:02,230
and make that just some temporarily a

488
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:07,149
variable that's in here so in game state

489
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:11,920
there we go got Z offset and I would

490
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:15,700
like to make that controllable by these

491
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,430
keys so I'm just gonna go ahead and do

492
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,170
something like Z offset plus equals I

493
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:23,860
don't even remember what our time value

494
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:26,620
is here I think it's DT for frame or did

495
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:32,399
we actually bake that out into a DT we

496
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:35,109
don't still right here what's grab that

497
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:40,210
and so I'm just gonna take whatever the

498
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:42,009
rate is of the zoom and I'm gonna

499
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,019
multiply it by however many seconds have

500
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:46,750
elapsed and so we're gonna put those in

501
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,490
here like so and in fact you know what I

502
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:57,819
might do I might just make it work like

503
00:20:48,490 --> 00:21:01,960
this so we'll do this rate and we could

504
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:04,349
set the zoom right for in and out and I

505
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,450
don't really know let's say we go up a

506
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:09,969
mirror per second and then when it ends

507
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,069
when we're doing action down we'll go

508
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:17,140
down a meter per second something like

509
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:21,939
this and I feel like that should allow

510
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:27,570
me to go what happened here

511
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,570
oh is this

512
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,519
just cuz I added oh that's cuz I added

513
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:36,889
something again sorry I'm a little

514
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,599
little out of it today I forget every

515
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,110
time that if you add something to game

516
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:43,599
state you have to restart because we

517
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:48,919
don't handle that another live update

518
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:50,389
all right so in theory we should have

519
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,220
something that goes a little too quickly

520
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:55,370
there but now we've got something that

521
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,230
zooms us in and out right and so we've

522
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:58,429
got two things that we want to do one is

523
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,079
I want to change the scale of these

524
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,480
things as we zoom in and out obviously

525
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,460
but the other one is then I want to talk

526
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,690
about that alpha situation since that

527
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,059
was kind of what I've done to on the

528
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:11,509
blackboard right so as we zoom these

529
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:12,799
things in and out we need to start to

530
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,990
think about this I also want come on

531
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,889
make this rate a little slower there

532
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:20,630
let's go ahead and that's lower although

533
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:26,990
you know what that might just be because

534
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:30,380
our coefficient is too huge right if you

535
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,509
remember we never really did we said

536
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,000
we'd postpone it till today but we never

537
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:38,779
because we never quite got to the get

538
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,630
entity basis P stuff right where is that

539
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:46,519
get render and basis this thing is still

540
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:49,520
translating the meters to pixels this

541
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,450
this factor here we have not really

542
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,230
thought through at all

543
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:56,120
and so really one one meter per second

544
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,710
is probably fine actually now that I

545
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:59,869
think about it it's probably this value

546
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,130
that needs to be smaller and we'll have

547
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:02,809
to think about what we actually want

548
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,660
that value to be that's the value that

549
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:09,019
controls how much sort of scaling we do

550
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,790
based on Zemo motion and so I feel like

551
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:12,619
that's probably gonna be something

552
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:15,500
closer to what we want for the time

553
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:17,479
being right so as you can see the

554
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,329
positions of the things are being scaled

555
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,279
the sizes of the things however are not

556
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,569
being scaled and that's pretty

557
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,359
straightforward really what we've done

558
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:28,460
here is we've created our Z fudge value

559
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,439
says how much we're going to scale the

560
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,110
positions of things but we've never

561
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,720
scaled the size and so that's actually

562
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:39,409
pretty easy for us to handle you know

563
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,640
when we sort of go through this after we

564
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,920
sort of figure out exactly what we want

565
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,350
to do with these tests and then we kind

566
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,300
of come back

567
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:47,429
we can do it potentially in a little

568
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,980
more clean way but for the moment it's

569
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:53,100
actually pretty easy we just have a

570
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,569
scale that we could have here or since

571
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,279
we don't we know that we're always

572
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:59,009
scaling uniformly for the zooming

573
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:01,799
basically this Z fudge is just our scale

574
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:03,539
value so if we were to scale the size of

575
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,589
the sprites by that same thing the same

576
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,799
thing that we're scanning the positions

577
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:09,059
by it would line up right so this Z

578
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:14,159
fudge here I'm just gonna go ahead and

579
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:16,919
say that when we do Oh what's up with

580
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,930
that mark place when we do get render

581
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,600
entity basis what we really want to do

582
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,840
is have that return us a scale as well

583
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:27,389
as a placement right so there's a

584
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:30,599
there's a like an entity basis P or

585
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:34,530
something right something like this here

586
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:39,269
or a result which is going to have the

587
00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:42,329
position and the scale right and that's

588
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:43,980
that's really all I want to do so I'm

589
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:46,559
gonna return that instead here here we

590
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,259
go there's our results so what we want

591
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,299
to do is is put the center in there and

592
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:55,410
then put the scale in there and the

593
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:57,059
scale is just the Z fudge there we go so

594
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,370
that when I get render render entity

595
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:02,609
basis P that's actually going to be the

596
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:04,169
entity basis P result there we go and

597
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:06,929
that's the I don't know we'll call that

598
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,900
basis or something and so then when I do

599
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:11,340
my drawing we have its basis dot P is

600
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,170
the actual place that I'm drawing that

601
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:16,169
at right and I need to fix the other one

602
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:20,519
here too right well actually I don't

603
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:22,050
even have to it's just that although

604
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,730
technically we should fix this one for

605
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:25,829
scaling as well so we'll do that in a

606
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,000
second anyway so you can see that

607
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,679
nothing's changed when I've done that

608
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,269
everything's the same but now if I

609
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,400
actually take that scale value and say

610
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,379
well now we kind of know these are our

611
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
two basis vectors right here's x and y

612
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,940
what i want to do is go ahead and take

613
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,829
that scale right and I just want to

614
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,380
multiply that the width and the height

615
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:46,289
so that it changes with the scale as

616
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,510
well right and now you can kind of see

617
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:50,509
as I shrink the things down we're

618
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:53,220
actually getting a real shrinking

619
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:54,879
instead of a fake shrinking there right

620
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,490
like so

621
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,929
now we still have obviously more stuff

622
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,829
we got to do to make that work right and

623
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:05,559
also our ground chunks are not are not

624
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:08,678
playing along but we're you can see how

625
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:10,750
that's kind of putting to good use the

626
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,759
code that we wrote over the past few

627
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,470
weeks where we can do our scaling now it

628
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:16,000
makes it nice so that our trees you know

629
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,220
our trees have kind of a nice little

630
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,230
less killing effect I can see however

631
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,000
that there is a bug we thought that

632
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,548
there probably was one we were going to

633
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,220
go through it with a fine-tooth comb you

634
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:31,000
can see that we're getting a problem

635
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:33,039
with with sort of when we when we zoom

636
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,289
in you can see that the the actual

637
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,500
popping at the very top of that tree

638
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:40,058
right and I don't actually know that may

639
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,369
not actually be a bug that may just be

640
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:43,569
the way the sprite is constructed one of

641
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:45,159
the things that I talked about but we

642
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:48,490
haven't quite covered yet was that we

643
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,259
always need one pixel of emptiness

644
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,400
around everything in order to make it

645
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:52,569
work properly and we'll talk a little

646
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,850
bit more about why that needs to be

647
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:56,139
later on but I just wanted to call that

648
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:57,308
two attention I know if you can see that

649
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,220
it might be too hard for you to see

650
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:01,960
because of the way you know video

651
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:07,450
compression is or whatever but it's

652
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:10,600
there all right so why our ground isn't

653
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,789
scaling I suspect is because we're not

654
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:18,849
actually giving it a proper Z value

655
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:22,149
would be my thought and so I think right

656
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:25,240
our Z offset which we kind of added in

657
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,769
here we need to add that to the ground

658
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,269
chunks as well when we render them

659
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,329
otherwise they're not going to scale

660
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:33,220
right and so if we go into the ground

661
00:27:31,329 --> 00:27:35,558
buffers when we're actually doing that

662
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,480
thing and we do our push pit bitmap we

663
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:40,119
do the push back with the Delta we need

664
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,690
to be able to to put in that camera

665
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:46,119
offset there as well right and so now I

666
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,990
think with that in there we should get

667
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:51,279
them we should get them scaling although

668
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:56,609
for some reason

669
00:27:51,279 --> 00:28:00,160
no we don't oh because that's actually

670
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:01,209
not the way that we have our base of

671
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,759
stuff working this was the thing we

672
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,559
talked about yesterday so we said that

673
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:11,529
our Z fudge is only based on the base P

674
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:15,339
never on the offset P I know if you guys

675
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:18,849
remember that right there is this whole

676
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:20,609
situation with because we're in 2d we

677
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:24,309
talked about this literally yesterday

678
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:26,349
because we're in 2d we wanted to make it

679
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:28,569
so that the position and scale of things

680
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:29,980
would change but they wouldn't lean if

681
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:31,389
they're stacked on top of each other so

682
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,849
if you basically have like you imagine a

683
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:37,150
snowman made of three of three pieces

684
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:40,000
right his ground point will scale his

685
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:42,400
things will scale but the placement of

686
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,460
these guys on top of him will not change

687
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,650
so he remains perfectly vertical even

688
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,200
though the perspective would have

689
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,500
potentially have actually made him look

690
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,840
like that right we decided to keep that

691
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,670
sort of straight up-and-down scaling and

692
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,399
so what that means is I can't pass a

693
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:04,810
cure I have to actually go ahead and

694
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:06,700
make it be in the basis itself which is

695
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:10,839
again not a particularly big deal it

696
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:14,259
just means that we have to do our our

697
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:15,609
bases push here right so basically every

698
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:22,450
time we do one of these we've got to do

699
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:25,240
that push the zooming the basis is going

700
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,269
to have a placement which is I guess the

701
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,069
Delta now that I think about it there

702
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:32,529
really isn't any offset for this thing

703
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:35,559
so the offset for the bitmap is actually

704
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:37,539
always going to be zero in our basis is

705
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,799
going to capture all the information

706
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:41,559
about where we want a place that's

707
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:44,349
actually how the renderer is supposed to

708
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:46,359
work at the moment right and so this

709
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:49,539
this p-value is actually supposed to be

710
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:53,459
the Delta so that's going to be Delta

711
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:53,460
Plus again that that Z offset

712
00:29:55,638 --> 00:30:08,478
here we go oops guess I need to pass a

713
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:10,578
non offset here there we go and now

714
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:13,048
we're closed

715
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:16,168
we're closed but we've still got

716
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:23,398
something odd happening which is that

717
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:26,940
our our scaling of positions doesn't

718
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:31,258
seem to quite properly line up right you

719
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:34,078
can kind of see as we scale our stuff is

720
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:38,548
not where I would have expected it to be

721
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:40,558
right as we zoom in things scale kind of

722
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:42,929
counter to each other and you can see

723
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,088
this happening with everybody right

724
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:49,319
there they're not scaling about the

725
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:51,058
right coordinates and so we need to kind

726
00:30:49,318 --> 00:30:53,249
of go take a look at how we're doing our

727
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:55,259
bitmap alignment and stuff like that to

728
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:57,538
figure out what's going on there right

729
00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:01,409
and I suspect that part of that has to

730
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:03,388
do with the fact that we translate we do

731
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:06,539
translation and alignment in this you

732
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:09,058
know kind of ad hoc way that happens at

733
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:10,828
the head of the rendering stuff so let's

734
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:12,449
go let's go take a look at that and get

735
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,558
that straightened out this is good I'm

736
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:15,269
really glad we're doing this this is

737
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:16,499
basically like this is one of those

738
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:17,818
weeks that I'm just happy about

739
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,469
everything because we're taking a bunch

740
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:21,118
of stuff that we haven't done properly

741
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:24,440
it haven't thought about very carefully

742
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:28,439
and we're you know fixing it basically

743
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,028
so okay so let's go in and take a look

744
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,479
at how our coordinate system stuff works

745
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:35,909
in terms of when this that scaling

746
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:38,369
occurs and who it is applied to just so

747
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:40,409
we can figure out exactly why it's it's

748
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:43,048
not quite doing what we think it should

749
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:45,449
do and just again I hopefully people can

750
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:47,219
see that in fact you know what I'll do

751
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:49,619
right now I'll turn off the ground

752
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:51,088
chunks entirely because they're not

753
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:53,519
actually necessary and the other thing I

754
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:59,038
could do too is let me let me quickly

755
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:01,769
just fix those those rectangles as well

756
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,919
because those need to be changed so the

757
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:07,890
rectangles need to be scaled obviously

758
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,649
so we can get the basis P here like so

759
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:13,679
and that's going to be applying the

760
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:27,658
scale to the dimension of the rectangle

761
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:29,788
right like that oops okay so as you can

762
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:31,289
see like when we scale stuff in fact you

763
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:32,429
know maybe I'll just even turn off these

764
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:33,898
for a second so we don't have to fix

765
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:35,610
everything at once I just want you to be

766
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:39,599
able to focus on the stuff that I'm

767
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:42,500
talking about so you can see this

768
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,418
scaling here right as we scale and

769
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,480
what's particularly strange about this

770
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:51,538
right as we do it is you can kind of see

771
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:56,880
that for some reason we get a lateral

772
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:59,970
motion on on the characters right you

773
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,950
can see that like as I as I move around

774
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,319
here everything's still the same as it

775
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:08,038
was for the most part but when I do the

776
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,388
scaling I move to the side right it

777
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:12,679
doesn't make any sense right like that

778
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:15,000
should not that's visually totally

779
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:19,590
nonsensical right oh you know what's

780
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,099
kind of cool about this this is kind of

781
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:22,199
awesome

782
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,599
I totally forgot but now that we have

783
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,788
the ability to scale out we can see our

784
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:31,888
sim region pulling stuff in from the

785
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:33,210
worlds as we move around right these are

786
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:37,528
the things that are in the simulation

787
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:41,038
set remember and so that's kind of cool

788
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:44,398
right that's that's pretty neat all

789
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:47,638
right anyway sorry I got a little head

790
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:49,168
of ourselves there so what I want to do

791
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:51,199
is I want to go figure out why we're

792
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:54,380
getting that lateral translation and

793
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,269
it's hard to say who is at fault there

794
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,830
because you know we don't really know

795
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,569
who's scaling properly it might be

796
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:03,058
probably the case is no one's scaling

797
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:05,849
properly and they're just kind of the

798
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:07,470
trees are at a particular Z level and

799
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,809
the guys at another Z level and whatever

800
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:13,260
and so it ends up looking a particular

801
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:16,588
way but really I think what's you know

802
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,050
the scale is not happening in the in

803
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:21,539
sort of a coherent way we want the scale

804
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:24,120
to scale around the center of the screen

805
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,650
and neither of these two things seems to

806
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,029
be scaling around the center of the

807
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:30,510
screen to me I guess is the way I would

808
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:32,280
say it and so what I want to get to is

809
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,900
when we zoom in and out like this I

810
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,250
would like to see the center of the

811
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,160
screen be the point that things shrink

812
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,409
around and everything should appear to

813
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,178
be stable relative to each other just

814
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:46,469
scaling so off we go okay hopefully that

815
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,630
all makes sense nothing particularly

816
00:34:46,469 --> 00:35:05,309
weird going on there so let's take a

817
00:34:51,630 --> 00:35:07,890
look when we are doing our scaling we're

818
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:10,440
already centering everything about the

819
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:11,879
screen Center right because we're

820
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,820
starting at the screen Center and we're

821
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:20,220
moving by whatever the entity XY is ah

822
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:22,110
and then there's the offset X Y which is

823
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,149
obviously a constant that's you know

824
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:26,640
apply it on top of that I'm interested

825
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:33,619
to know also what happens if we turn

826
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:38,219
that off by the way right yes so that's

827
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:39,779
that's actually our problem as well if

828
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,250
you take a look at it in terms of why

829
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,950
these things are sliding relative to

830
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:49,170
each other is that that offset right

831
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:57,299
there so what were we trying to capture

832
00:35:49,170 --> 00:36:00,119
with that the offset X Y it's kind of a

833
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,800
little bit odd because my understanding

834
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:09,089
was that the offset X Y should have been

835
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:15,930
the thing that the entity that was

836
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:17,610
allowing things like ah okay I see so

837
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:20,460
the offset X Y is the thing that's

838
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:23,730
supposed to allow different parts of say

839
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:27,090
the hero to be you know at different

840
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,500
levels right so for example if his head

841
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,850
was supposed to be higher than his body

842
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,429
that was the thing that we would use for

843
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:34,849
that but what I forgot is actually our

844
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:36,919
current state of the hero

845
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:40,250
is that he's actually all on the same

846
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,440
level these sprites are not clipped yet

847
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:44,869
so they're not actually offset from that

848
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,990
ground point so the reason that doesn't

849
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:50,509
actually do anything in terms of thing

850
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:54,259
is because the actual values of the

851
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:56,440
sprite were all the same right so I can

852
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,660
turn it off and he still looks okay but

853
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,190
if I go ahead and rebuild this here you

854
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:04,309
can see that that actually does change

855
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:12,400
things I believe that's because the

856
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:12,400
offset XY of the entity basis excuse me

857
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:20,360
he is still getting set right it's

858
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:27,739
actually still a value let's take a look

859
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:29,420
here who is setting that value now that

860
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:32,289
I think about it who's setting that

861
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:36,980
offset so when we render like the head

862
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:39,199
these offsets are all set to zero so I

863
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,690
guess the only thing that we're actually

864
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:45,349
using this offset for right now is the

865
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:47,150
bitmap alignment that's it right the

866
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:50,299
bitmap alignments actually the only

867
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:52,970
thing that that's getting that's that's

868
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,950
going in there and so since that bitmap

869
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:59,659
alignment is in there I'm trying to

870
00:37:54,949 --> 00:38:02,389
think of why okay so that bitmap

871
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:03,920
alignment here's what's going on this

872
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:05,389
actually makes sense if I wasn't having

873
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,700
such a slow day I don't think this would

874
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:11,210
be really that big of a deal but here

875
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:14,359
you go so what's happening here is that

876
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,309
we've got you know a bitmap and we've

877
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,980
got a point that we're using to place it

878
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:22,699
and we have the offset that says where

879
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:24,110
that is right and so actually the way

880
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:25,759
that this works we actually do it in the

881
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,960
reverse order if you think about it what

882
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,900
we're doing is we've kind of got a

883
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,519
displacement that says well I want to

884
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,490
say that the guy is here I want to say

885
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,380
the tree is here but the bitmap is

886
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:39,529
actually a rectangle so I need to move

887
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,349
to a new place so that when I draw it

888
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:46,390
right it will it will still line up you

889
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:48,589
know I'm saying and so this value here

890
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:52,309
actually definitely does

891
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:56,120
need to be multiplied by that that Z

892
00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:58,460
fudge value so this definitely wants to

893
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,549
be in here because as the dimensions of

894
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,119
this change we would move less far out

895
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,100
right

896
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:06,259
if this rectangle gets twice as large

897
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:10,130
this displacement has to get twice as

898
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:13,970
large and so on so this is the thing

899
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:15,950
here not using the offsets Z value is

900
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:17,389
correct because we wanted to keep things

901
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:20,210
straight up and down like that's like

902
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:22,429
the Snowman example but we do need to

903
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,990
scale the offset because as we change

904
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:26,539
the size of the bitmap that offsets

905
00:39:23,989 --> 00:39:30,559
going to differ so I believe that that

906
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:33,139
was just a mistake that we made that we

907
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,539
didn't want to make and hey now you can

908
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:37,759
actually see when we scale it looks

909
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:41,449
properly right it looks like what we

910
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:45,490
expect and I can go ahead and turn that

911
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:50,419
ground back on now

912
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:54,799
let's take a look where that one hello

913
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:56,780
mister ground pushed back so you turn

914
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,789
that crown back on and there is the

915
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,400
ground again and again this is kind of

916
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:02,539
fun I don't know this is one of those

917
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,970
things I don't know it's just kind of

918
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:07,880
fun if you take a look you can see now

919
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:10,099
sort of our world stuff happening as you

920
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,650
kind of move in you can see it filling

921
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:13,969
the ground chunks as necessary and that

922
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,950
sort of stuff which is kind of cool

923
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:20,089
right that's that's like I know it's

924
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,349
just kind of nice be able to zoom out so

925
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,570
you can kind of see what's going on in

926
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:27,170
the world so when we zoom in here

927
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:31,070
right I think everything is now

928
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:33,280
relatively stable looks pretty good to

929
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,280
me

930
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:43,720
yeah I feel like we may be - oh that's

931
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,880
kind of hilarious

932
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:48,369
so our jump is still active and as you

933
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,599
can see our hero gets bigger as he jumps

934
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:51,599
which is pretty hilarious

935
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:58,659
yeah that's pretty hilarious I feel like

936
00:40:56,019 --> 00:41:00,429
we want to make that jump probably into

937
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:02,559
some kind of an offset although I don't

938
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:05,259
know it's kind of funny to see that

939
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,690
happen I don't know I don't know how we

940
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,740
feel about that maybe we do want him to

941
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:14,200
get bigger that's pretty hysterical dude

942
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:19,299
yeah as he jumps he gets large that's

943
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:20,710
funny um so yeah so back to what I was

944
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,570
saying originally it's been a pretty

945
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:26,849
scatterbrained day here I apologize for

946
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:30,220
being so so out of it um so basically

947
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:32,739
what I wanted to show was some problems

948
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:36,069
with alpha feeding right we talked about

949
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:37,089
this and kind of you know curse early at

950
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,890
the beginning episode and I wanted to

951
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,600
say well what happens if we need to

952
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:42,639
start having a level above this one

953
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:43,599
that's gonna fade in and out so what I'm

954
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,879
gonna do is I'm just gonna take the

955
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,889
level that we have right now and I'm

956
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,019
gonna show you what happens if we do the

957
00:41:47,889 --> 00:41:52,269
stupid way of doing alpha which is to

958
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:54,550
just draw the sprites and you'll you see

959
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:56,170
this actually this drives me nuts you

960
00:41:54,550 --> 00:42:01,420
see this in indie games sometimes and

961
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:03,039
I'm always like oh don't do that when

962
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,289
you have a situation where you're trying

963
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,909
to fade out something um off what's what

964
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,139
times sometimes what people will do is

965
00:42:06,909 --> 00:42:10,329
they'll actually just set the Alpha

966
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:12,579
value of the various components right

967
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:14,769
and so you can imagine what that would

968
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:17,079
look like here if we went into the

969
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:19,440
renderer right and let's say that inside

970
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,150
this this entity basically thing right

971
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,920
we had some kind of a thing oh sorry

972
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,579
that's the basic key result that's not

973
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,740
what I actually wanted I meant inside a

974
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:31,090
render basis thing suppose we had you

975
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:35,139
know we were to introduce something like

976
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:36,880
an alpha fade value right or or maybe

977
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:38,859
even do it in a slightly different way

978
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,050
maybe we just have a thing where we can

979
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,940
sort of as we're pushing things we can

980
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:45,130
set kind of a you know

981
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:49,389
a global alpha value or something like

982
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:53,260
that right and so at the outset that

983
00:42:49,389 --> 00:42:56,679
global value that global alpha value is

984
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:00,060
is gonna be one right and and I'm

985
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:03,159
actually remember right here there we go

986
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:05,858
so that global we've got 15 minutes on

987
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:08,230
the on the bonus clock right so I'm

988
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:11,318
gonna go ahead and take those so our

989
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:13,420
global alpha value is 1 and then every

990
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:15,279
time we get an alpha push on one of

991
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,030
these bitmaps I'm just gonna take the

992
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,260
Alpha and I'm gonna multiply it I'm

993
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,300
gonna go ahead and multiply it by the

994
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,130
global alpha right so I'm just gonna I'm

995
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:27,280
just gonna flat out have this global

996
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:29,829
modulation that I can do to make the

997
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,900
alpha value be there right and so now

998
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:35,140
what I'll do is I'll just say oh okay

999
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,930
you know as i as i zoom in and out i

1000
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:40,210
want to be able to make that that sort

1001
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:42,489
of global alpha I'm going to set that to

1002
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:45,280
be something proportional to the Z

1003
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:47,559
offset right so when we do the render

1004
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,690
group you know I'm just gonna say render

1005
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:54,400
group global alpha that's going to be

1006
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:58,720
equal to game state Z offset and I'll

1007
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,420
clamp it from 0 to 1 like so and I want

1008
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,909
to basically do like let's say 1 minus 2

1009
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:07,690
Z offset so you know it starts out

1010
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:12,250
everything's full alpha and then as I as

1011
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:15,130
I as I change it I want it to to differ

1012
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:18,730
and so here's what happens as i zoom in

1013
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:22,599
right do you see what's happening there

1014
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:26,019
now what I'd like you to look at most

1015
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,700
importantly right is take a look for

1016
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:30,670
example I'll put the hero in a

1017
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:34,868
particular position maybe right about

1018
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:37,659
there okay and as i zoom in on him watch

1019
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:42,579
what happens as he disappears okay you

1020
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:45,190
can see through his sprite now into the

1021
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:47,349
background and same is with like the

1022
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:50,710
trees and stuff and so instead of a

1023
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:52,568
fading out effect you get sort of an

1024
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,818
effect as if everything turns to mist

1025
00:44:52,568 --> 00:44:56,889
but it doesn't actually feel like I'm

1026
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:58,659
fading out this layer it feels

1027
00:44:56,889 --> 00:45:01,000
like everything's turning into like a

1028
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:03,639
weird ghost version of itself right

1029
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,440
now you know maybe that's fine if that's

1030
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:07,539
what you're going for but usually that

1031
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,130
just looks amateur hour especially if

1032
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,630
there's stuff like you know you

1033
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,430
shouldn't be seeing stuff

1034
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,630
perhaps behind some of these things you

1035
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,429
know it might be that the art there

1036
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:17,289
wasn't set up for what that's supposed

1037
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:20,980
to show or whatever and you just it's

1038
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:28,539
just not good right so in order to fix

1039
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:30,699
this particular scenario right we want

1040
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:33,150
to be a little more conscientious with

1041
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:35,859
how we do our Z layer stacking I'm

1042
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:38,500
guessing that probably what we will want

1043
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,900
to do is do an off-screen composite

1044
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:44,260
first of each slice of our world that

1045
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:46,800
might be fading right and so essentially

1046
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,720
if you know we go back to this diagram

1047
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,600
what I probably want to do is have a

1048
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:55,329
render buffer that's going to render

1049
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:58,960
that top part that might be fading out

1050
00:45:55,329 --> 00:46:00,849
or fading in right this part so you know

1051
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,610
if you actually think about maybe how we

1052
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:05,829
bucket this let me go ahead and say

1053
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:08,079
something like this there's a render

1054
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:10,569
buffer a that will take whatever's in

1055
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,009
here then there's a render buffer B that

1056
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,720
will take everything that's in here and

1057
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,040
then a render buffer C that will take

1058
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:17,529
everything that's in here which is

1059
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,360
things that are fading in now a and C

1060
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,220
are actually mutually exclusive because

1061
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,500
either we're going up or we're going

1062
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:25,899
down and so we don't need both the fade

1063
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,599
in and the fade out layers right because

1064
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,430
this later is fade fading out if we're

1065
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,130
going up and this layer is fading in and

1066
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:34,839
and same if we were going down we'd have

1067
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:37,990
the opposite this one would be fading in

1068
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:40,809
and this would be fading out so we only

1069
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:42,669
really need two buffers right at any

1070
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:44,889
given time we need the main buffer and

1071
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,960
then one of the fade buffers right

1072
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:49,389
whichever way whichever one we're in

1073
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,039
between we need to run there but what I

1074
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:53,559
think I'd like to do is actually have

1075
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,130
those two buffers so that we can do the

1076
00:46:53,559 --> 00:47:00,759
fade in and the fade out properly right

1077
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:03,640
and so I don't actually remember where

1078
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,270
we left it if I if I turn off our ground

1079
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:08,769
buffers for a second let me let me see

1080
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:10,480
where we're at here if I turn off the

1081
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:15,699
ground buffers for a second

1082
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:19,329
and I I just have this if I want to get

1083
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:22,169
a second layer in here I feel like we

1084
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:24,969
have the ability to do that I feel like

1085
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,440
if I switch between these I feel like I

1086
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:31,299
should probably make this official at

1087
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:33,550
some point huh we go if we if we do that

1088
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,430
that gives us the ability to have

1089
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,740
multiple world layers right if I

1090
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:43,449
remember correctly let's see if that's

1091
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:47,639
actually true I don't know if it is hmm

1092
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:50,319
so here's my guy so yeah if i if i zoom

1093
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:57,069
wow those things are really high up

1094
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:58,870
there though my goodness what exactly is

1095
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:03,580
the Z value on those things hold on a

1096
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:05,289
second that would suggest that our Z

1097
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:06,219
multiplying this is really far off so

1098
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:08,230
that's something we're gonna have to

1099
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:09,339
take a look at in a second that's again

1100
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,130
this coefficient here which is

1101
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:14,740
controlling how much of that sort of Z

1102
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:22,750
happens right so that looks a little

1103
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:24,459
more more sane there right yeah so part

1104
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,639
of the problem too of course

1105
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:30,849
when we're looking at this is we don't

1106
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:32,949
really have much oh hey there's our

1107
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:36,880
secret stairwell right about that so we

1108
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:38,289
can actually go up to the next level we

1109
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,610
got to turn off the ground buffer

1110
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:41,079
rendering as well because the ground

1111
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,670
buffers take a long time to render now

1112
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:45,250
since they're going through the scaling

1113
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:48,250
paths as well which we really probably

1114
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:51,789
don't want to do but yeah

1115
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,380
so things are a little wonky now I'm

1116
00:48:51,789 --> 00:49:01,449
going to go ahead and and turn the

1117
00:48:53,380 --> 00:49:03,010
ground buffers off entirely and really I

1118
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:04,509
just don't want to spend the time I

1119
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,220
don't want to spend the computational

1120
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,260
cost to generate them it's basically

1121
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:10,480
what it boils down to because until we

1122
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,610
do again the renderer optimization I

1123
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,920
really just don't want them taking up

1124
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:16,150
any any time at all really so I'm just

1125
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,420
going to turn off our ground buffers

1126
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:22,780
entirely like so right

1127
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,760
and then you know we should be good to

1128
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,450
go so now when we're rendering this

1129
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,730
stuff again it's a little bit weird for

1130
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:35,049
me to work with because it still got

1131
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:37,980
that this notion right of a it's look

1132
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:42,550
out this weird notion of Y displacement

1133
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:45,280
for Z as well as Z displacement for Z

1134
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:47,140
which I don't actually know if that's

1135
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,820
such a good idea it's a little bit it's

1136
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:51,098
just been very confusing for me as

1137
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:54,670
someone who comes from a place where

1138
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:57,220
they normally only use 3d coordinates

1139
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,970
it's kind of hard to always wrap your

1140
00:49:57,219 --> 00:50:04,629
head around what's happening there right

1141
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:07,868
and so like you can kind of see what's

1142
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:09,550
going on here with the with me playing

1143
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:13,410
with these Z values you can basically

1144
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:17,019
see that that that value changes how

1145
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:19,329
spread out our stuff is based on the Z

1146
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:21,369
difference from wherever the player is

1147
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:23,230
right now there's some stuff that we

1148
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:24,970
probably want to fix about that and

1149
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:27,099
maybe now is as good a time as any to

1150
00:50:24,969 --> 00:50:28,329
talk about it but I'm just kind of

1151
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:31,830
playing around this here because I want

1152
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:34,779
to see sort of how it how it feels right

1153
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:37,420
and so it's still that's yeah that's

1154
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:40,690
just that's just very strange so I feel

1155
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,789
like this wants to be a different value

1156
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:47,349
and I think we may want to put in

1157
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:49,869
something which which does a little bit

1158
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:52,480
more of a real perspective transform

1159
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:53,619
there so let's let's think about this

1160
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,329
how much time I got left I got about

1161
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:57,760
five minutes left all right so all I'm

1162
00:50:55,329 --> 00:51:00,670
gonna do right now is I'm gonna go ahead

1163
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:06,010
and and take that alpha value thing out

1164
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:10,710
right the global alpha I'm gonna go

1165
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:10,710
ahead and set that to zero like so

1166
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:18,289
and I want to take a little look at this

1167
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:23,539
right and I'm trying to decide what I

1168
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:26,989
want to do in terms of the Z offsetting

1169
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:28,460
2y right because the Z offsetting 2y if

1170
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:31,369
you remember this is what does that

1171
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,889
right this this term right here is what

1172
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:35,150
does that so if you could imagine you

1173
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:38,028
know if we turn that off

1174
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,858
then we would have only Z offsets right

1175
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:42,650
so this is what the world looks like

1176
00:51:39,858 --> 00:51:46,159
with only with Z just being treated as Z

1177
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:49,369
know Y at all and so you know when we

1178
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,649
come if we come in and out of that or if

1179
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:54,259
you know if I walk my guy up the secret

1180
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,690
phantom stairwell you can kind of see

1181
00:51:54,259 --> 00:52:01,998
what that ends up looking like in terms

1182
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:06,528
of just raw Z offset values and it kind

1183
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:09,618
of feels to me like like it's another

1184
00:52:06,528 --> 00:52:12,978
situation where really because of the

1185
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:15,559
way the 2d 3d stuff interacts it's

1186
00:52:12,978 --> 00:52:19,189
almost like we want there to be scaling

1187
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:22,039
for the guy for the world based solely

1188
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:25,429
on like the Z layer that you're in but

1189
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:30,109
not on fine-grained Z motion that

1190
00:52:25,429 --> 00:52:31,940
happens like inside inside that frame

1191
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:33,558
right so if you're jumping or whatever I

1192
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,259
don't think we want your guy to get

1193
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:40,400
bigger right we want him to just do a Y

1194
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:43,329
jump not a Z jump right but when he

1195
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,219
walks upstairs between two worlds that

1196
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:48,798
two Z layers that's where things should

1197
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:51,588
probably scale that's just my feeling

1198
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,608
about it I don't know but just looking

1199
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:55,489
at how things are going

1200
00:52:52,608 --> 00:52:58,940
that kind of is what I feel intuitively

1201
00:52:55,489 --> 00:53:00,849
like what I want to see happen if that

1202
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:04,369
makes sense

1203
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:12,099
go ahead and change this down a little

1204
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:12,099
bit so that that looks about right to me

1205
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:17,940
so if I walk down these stairs to the

1206
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:20,430
next level I mean that looks like about

1207
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,950
the amount of parallax that I would

1208
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:24,868
probably want from stairwell you know

1209
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:27,659
from from an upper layer and a lower

1210
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:31,200
layer right I mean that looks kind of

1211
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:33,239
like what I might might want to see so I

1212
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,500
don't know we'll have to percolate on it

1213
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,239
what to think about it a little bit but

1214
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:43,338
it's starting to get more towards what I

1215
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:47,308
actually want to see happen right yeah

1216
00:53:43,338 --> 00:53:49,409
yeah so that feels that feels kind of

1217
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:52,710
more correct to me that feels like what

1218
00:53:49,409 --> 00:53:55,379
I would expect and so I don't know

1219
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:58,289
it just it seems to me it feels like if

1220
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:01,829
I had to guess what I'm leaning towards

1221
00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:06,119
saying here is we basically want

1222
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:09,660
everything to be about a Z slice and the

1223
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:11,550
Z slices get scaled but inside a Z slice

1224
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:13,049
things don't generally scale I mean if

1225
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,059
we want like a special effect sometime

1226
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,039
to make it look like something's coming

1227
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:22,619
up towards you or something you know we

1228
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:25,289
do that but on the whole we wouldn't we

1229
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:28,890
wouldn't generally have that happen

1230
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:29,608
right and that seems that seems like a

1231
00:54:28,889 --> 00:54:31,318
good thing to me

1232
00:54:29,608 --> 00:54:33,150
so I'm gonna go ahead and say that

1233
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:35,548
that's where we'll that's where we'll go

1234
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:37,710
tomorrow that's I think that's what I'd

1235
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:39,650
like to say tomorrow in terms of

1236
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:47,659
starting to clean this stuff up further

1237
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:49,710
I'm gonna put that in here so let's see

1238
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:51,808
discrete slices and the render action

1239
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:54,240
understand Z slices and so we're gonna

1240
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:57,210
say that that's definitely true and what

1241
00:54:54,239 --> 00:55:03,989
I'm going to say about that is I'm going

1242
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:11,369
to say that computing Z slices are what

1243
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:14,789
control the scaling of things whereas Z

1244
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:18,920
offsets inside a slice are what control

1245
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:21,980
Y offsetting right

1246
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:25,070
and I think that's really gonna be the

1247
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,679
way to make things work with the kind of

1248
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:30,920
weird mixed 2d perspective that we

1249
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:32,899
expect to have in a game here right and

1250
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,909
we're it's slightly uncharted territory

1251
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:38,000
right cuz most games just don't do this

1252
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:40,399
stuff like most 2d games just don't have

1253
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,750
parallax stuff that you can walk between

1254
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,670
it's very unusual to have that right and

1255
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,960
so we're kind of in a place where we're

1256
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,789
having to make sort of an artistic

1257
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,349
decision about what we want to have

1258
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:52,730
there it's not it doesn't really have

1259
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:55,099
anything to do with technology and

1260
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:57,079
that's a little tough but you know I

1261
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:58,610
think this is a pretty good compromise I

1262
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:00,289
feel like this would look kind of neat

1263
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:02,090
you know if you're in a world and you

1264
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:03,349
look down you saw like a you know we

1265
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:05,539
have like a pit and you could look down

1266
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:09,529
into it I feel like that's gonna add a

1267
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:11,269
little bit of niceness to the game and

1268
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,760
so I think that's what I'd like to go

1269
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:15,710
with and so we'll just assume that we'll

1270
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,300
do that with the fading and that'll sort

1271
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,220
of be how we'll start working on the

1272
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,510
renderer tomorrow how we'll start

1273
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:24,349
working on it something that basically

1274
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:25,520
does exactly that levering so yeah I

1275
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:26,989
think that's good

1276
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,369
I'm happy to leave it with that for now

1277
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:30,979
and tomorrow I guess we'll start on that

1278
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:32,630
slicing and we'll put in the fading so

1279
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,969
that we can kind of fade layers in and

1280
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:38,000
out and we'll and we'll maybe try to

1281
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:40,039
make that Z slice stuff maybe we'll try

1282
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,050
to make that a little more explicit like

1283
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:43,699
maybe we'll try to force the game to

1284
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:46,340
basically say to the renderer here's

1285
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:48,289
these slices 0 1 2 3 4 or something

1286
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:50,480
right like instead of just passing an

1287
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:52,130
arbitrary Z values so that we can sort

1288
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,170
of start to think about them discreetly

1289
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:57,050
because we're probably going to want to

1290
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:59,119
do that for in terms of bucketing things

1291
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:07,480
and sorting and stuff as well all right

1292
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:10,809
so I think we are going to go to the QA

1293
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,809
let's do that

1294
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:18,740
there you go and so anyone who wants to

1295
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,570
ask a question please put Q colon in

1296
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:25,819
front of it so I will see it and yeah

1297
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:30,940
let's do some QA got probably about 15

1298
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:30,940
minutes left yeah yeah ended on time

1299
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,460
pseudonyms every 3d did I see that

1300
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,730
correctly that the ground shadow jumps

1301
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:49,349
along with the hero yes did you I don't

1302
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:51,389
know you might have missed yesterday we

1303
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:53,460
turned off that the stuff with the

1304
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:55,588
ground shadow jumping along with the

1305
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:58,949
hero because staying on the ground

1306
00:57:55,588 --> 00:57:59,578
because we we want to do that a

1307
00:57:58,949 --> 00:58:01,679
different way

1308
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:03,240
basically it was being done in this

1309
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,500
really hacked way before that we had

1310
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:06,479
just hacked in there and it still got

1311
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:09,269
propagated out to the renderer and so

1312
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,059
that's like gone that's gonna be done in

1313
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:14,159
the future when we do our shadow stuff

1314
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:17,450
we're gonna handle that in the actual

1315
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:19,889
game code was that we decided to do that

1316
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:21,629
so the off topic but can you quickly go

1317
00:58:19,889 --> 00:58:23,068
over the concept behind move speck why

1318
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:25,230
not have every entity have their own

1319
00:58:23,068 --> 00:58:28,650
velocity drag etcetera values instead

1320
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:32,309
just for organization well it's also

1321
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:36,720
it's not just organization it's it's

1322
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:38,220
really more just because right now we

1323
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:39,959
didn't actually need to put it in the

1324
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:42,358
entity so we hadn't done that yet so

1325
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,460
having it as a move speck just allows us

1326
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:46,318
to do whichever one we want so right now

1327
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,119
they can shave share those move specks

1328
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:49,920
but in the future we could just move the

1329
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:51,358
moves back into the entity if we wanted

1330
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,900
to have every entity have a unique one

1331
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:56,460
right and so I suspect actually in the

1332
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,900
end we probably will have n if every

1333
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,730
entity have a unique one but we haven't

1334
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,900
really focused on that stuff yet because

1335
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:02,099
that's really more of the game code

1336
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:07,650
stuff that we're gonna do after the

1337
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:09,059
engine's done is the jump a real

1338
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:12,240
mechanic or just for making the system

1339
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:13,559
robust it's just it's naughty it's not

1340
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,389
even for making their system robust it

1341
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:17,548
was cuz somebody asked about it in a

1342
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:19,500
stream someone had said can you make the

1343
00:59:17,548 --> 00:59:22,048
guy jump in a QA so we just threw it in

1344
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,250
there it should just be removed it like

1345
00:59:22,048 --> 00:59:25,079
we should just get rid of it at this

1346
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,349
point because it's not gonna be in there

1347
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,349
eventually

1348
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:33,209
why don't you pre compose hero bitmaps

1349
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:34,409
into a single bitmap at initialization

1350
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:38,608
so there would not be fussing with

1351
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:42,058
pushing pieces because well so we're

1352
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:43,500
gonna do animation probably not too long

1353
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:47,700
after we get the render stuff working

1354
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:50,099
and we want all of those pieces to move

1355
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:51,118
separately a big part of animation is

1356
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:52,360
having the pieces kind of move

1357
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,030
separately so they get some

1358
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,740
and they get some feel in there and so

1359
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:59,560
we really don't want them to be baked

1360
00:59:56,739 --> 01:00:01,389
that's why I specifically asked yangshin

1361
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:03,610
to draw them as separate composable

1362
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:07,569
pieces and there's a number of other

1363
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:13,510
reasons to do that too but that's the

1364
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:14,710
big one is for the animation when you

1365
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,810
are walking up a staircase with a

1366
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,519
character suddenly snap back on why when

1367
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:20,980
you transition to the next D slice

1368
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:22,690
so I don't think so so I think we'll

1369
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:26,590
just move him smoothly up Z like we are

1370
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:29,409
now so that'll be basically the his Z

1371
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:31,780
slice position because all the Z slice

1372
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:34,539
positions will be still floating point

1373
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:36,940
they'll be like between 0 &amp; 1 1 &amp; 2 2 &amp;

1374
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:38,860
3 right so when you give your Z position

1375
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,619
coordinate it's going to be in terms of

1376
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:42,670
slices or something like this right

1377
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:46,319
we'll figure out exactly how we want to

1378
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:46,320
do that in the next in the next few days

1379
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:59,338
if I'm not mistaken with your way of Z

1380
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:02,490
scaling it's going to be hard to support

1381
01:00:59,338 --> 01:01:04,920
large in Z structures such as tall walls

1382
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:06,229
that should be aligned across different

1383
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:14,070
Z levels

1384
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:18,510
imagine a multi-story house or so so I

1385
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:24,720
agree with that because since we don't

1386
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:25,920
currently shear things right you

1387
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:30,419
wouldn't be able to have those things

1388
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:33,480
line up however I'm not sure how much we

1389
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:38,389
care about that because a multi-story

1390
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:41,579
house you're only seeing the levels at

1391
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:43,618
you know when they fade in so I'm not

1392
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:51,000
sure how much we care about that as a

1393
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:52,680
bug right you know essentially there's

1394
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,300
no way without doing actual 3d mapping

1395
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:55,710
to have those things line up and still

1396
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,230
have things get bigger when in the

1397
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:59,670
foreground and further in the distance

1398
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:02,358
so we can't have to make a trade-off do

1399
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:04,920
we want to do the scaling and break

1400
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:07,199
continuous vertical walls so that they

1401
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,670
don't line up properly or whatever or do

1402
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,078
we just not want to have the scaling and

1403
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:13,380
I think the scaling is gonna be a bigger

1404
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,970
win then the bug is of never be of never

1405
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,608
being able to make sure that vertical

1406
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:24,480
walls will line up if that makes sense

1407
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:25,920
so that's my hunch if they're going to

1408
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,900
be pits ledges in the game how are you

1409
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,389
going to render those well we already

1410
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:32,338
are basically rendering those right so

1411
01:02:30,389 --> 01:02:34,529
if there's a pit here all you know the

1412
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:36,088
ground we turned off the ground buffer

1413
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:38,069
but if there was a ground here we just

1414
01:02:36,088 --> 01:02:41,009
not render the ground where the pit is

1415
01:02:38,068 --> 01:02:43,579
that's it right so there's really hardly

1416
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,579
anything to it

1417
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:53,970
I wonder how the ball would work with

1418
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:57,539
the zoom in so if you want the ball to

1419
01:02:53,969 --> 01:03:00,750
if you want to do the ball zoom really

1420
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:02,849
zooming and the ball don't I mean we

1421
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,820
already had control over however big we

1422
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:07,289
wanted the ball to be right so the only

1423
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,510
thing zoom is doing is changing that

1424
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:14,400
scale so you can see what it would look

1425
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:17,310
like to to scale the ball up just by

1426
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,769
scaling the ball up right like all you

1427
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:22,608
have to do is come in here turn this guy

1428
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:26,159
back on so that we'd get the ball right

1429
01:03:22,608 --> 01:03:29,159
and if you want the ball bigger you just

1430
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:33,420
say okay you know give us give us the

1431
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:35,190
bigger ball right like so oops that's

1432
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:40,980
displacement not what I wanted

1433
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:42,599
try that one more time there we go so

1434
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:47,269
you can make the ball like as big as you

1435
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:47,269
want it to be but it doesn't necessarily

1436
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,980
you know I'm not it's not really gonna

1437
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:58,618
be any different that might be a little

1438
01:03:52,980 --> 01:04:00,570
too large right and so you know the

1439
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:03,150
other problem with it too is remember

1440
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:06,690
this it's actually moving the reflection

1441
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:11,369
location so a super large ball also has

1442
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:15,150
the problem of out sampling our map for

1443
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:17,160
it so you know we've got we've got some

1444
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:19,139
other stuff that we have to finish first

1445
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:21,358
of on the normal mapping code before we

1446
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:23,460
can make things arbitrarily large

1447
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,170
because we don't really have a plan at

1448
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,970
the moment for what would happen if you

1449
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:29,099
were trying to do reflections for stuff

1450
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:30,449
that's outside the map and we didn't

1451
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,490
really tune the parameters to make sure

1452
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:36,899
that wouldn't happen etcetera etcetera

1453
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:41,889
so I'm assuming that it's not quite

1454
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:44,680
perfect in that sense right but yeah

1455
01:04:41,889 --> 01:04:46,480
I will say that does look kind of

1456
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:50,349
strange I wonder if we still have a bug

1457
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:53,199
in there that we just weren't seeing

1458
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:54,880
because we didn't have I don't remember

1459
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:56,369
exactly where we left it but it

1460
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,240
definitely looks like the reflection

1461
01:04:56,369 --> 01:04:59,710
changes in a way that I wouldn't

1462
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:02,439
necessarily expect that I can't remember

1463
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:08,559
that may just be because it's traversing

1464
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:10,780
more of the space in Z right and so yeah

1465
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:16,469
so I don't know and that could also

1466
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:19,630
argue for not doing that translation but

1467
01:05:16,469 --> 01:05:23,109
but I don't know yeah so I have to look

1468
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:24,369
at that that guy more but really the

1469
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,900
zooming that has nothing to do with it

1470
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:31,750
it's just the same as when we were

1471
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:33,970
changing the size of it before what

1472
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:37,449
games do the bad fade out effect you

1473
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:40,089
mentioned uh I think the most recent one

1474
01:05:37,449 --> 01:05:43,109
I remember or I think this was was one

1475
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:46,480
that I was playing was hatoful boyfriend

1476
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:48,820
like and a lot of those sort of those

1477
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,500
like visual novel games for lack of a

1478
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:54,340
better term that's how they do the fade

1479
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:56,050
outs it's really super janky looking but

1480
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,059
I was trying to remember that may not be

1481
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:00,010
the one I apologized to the people who

1482
01:05:58,059 --> 01:06:01,360
made that if I'm saying it the wrong one

1483
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:04,200
but I think that was the one that I just

1484
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,200
saw just recently

1485
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:23,089
how will the staircase be scaled when

1486
01:06:16,548 --> 01:06:25,489
you are moving up and down it well I'm

1487
01:06:23,088 --> 01:06:27,588
not sure I understand I mean it'll just

1488
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:32,079
get it'll get scaled with probably the

1489
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:32,078
lower Z slice would be my guess

1490
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:38,239
and I mean presumably when we draw the

1491
01:06:36,289 --> 01:06:38,809
staircase you'll bake some perspective

1492
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:41,778
into it

1493
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:45,890
so the scarecase will look you know like

1494
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:47,929
this kind of a thing so as the hero

1495
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:50,538
moves up it it's already got that sort

1496
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:52,190
of scaling based in so it shrinks but by

1497
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:53,839
the time the hero get to the top the

1498
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,190
hero has grown in the staircase has

1499
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:57,318
shrunk so these the same relative size

1500
01:06:55,190 --> 01:07:00,798
kind of thing so I'm assuming that'd

1501
01:06:57,318 --> 01:07:03,579
just be fine I don't anticipate any kind

1502
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:03,579
of weirdness there really

1503
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:19,570
it's a first how could I not know how to

1504
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:21,189
fully fund everyone knows how to feel

1505
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:23,410
but in fact I just seed garland Oh bloom

1506
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:32,980
saying at the bottom everyone knows how

1507
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:36,338
to flow boyfriend friend it is it is I I

1508
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:38,829
have no idea why this happened and I

1509
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:41,980
don't pretend to know anything about it

1510
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:44,440
other than for some reason somebody

1511
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:47,079
decided to make a Japanese dating sim

1512
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:51,760
game where all of the people who you

1513
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:54,819
date are pigeons like that's not slang I

1514
01:07:51,760 --> 01:08:00,570
mean they're actual pigeons they are

1515
01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:00,570
birds for some reason I have no idea why

1516
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:30,870
slow seven have you seen heard of

1517
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:35,088
huniepop then uh I think I've seen it on

1518
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:37,979
the steam like best-selling page four

1519
01:08:35,088 --> 01:08:39,720
four like I don't really know what maybe

1520
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:41,969
maybe visual novels or something like

1521
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,230
that but I've never actually played it

1522
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:43,740
so I don't really know anything about

1523
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:45,750
that one

1524
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:48,689
I did play hatoful boyfriend I mean I

1525
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:50,880
played 15 minutes of had a full

1526
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:53,419
boyfriend but I did play I did like to

1527
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,420
watch the game

1528
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:15,059
however I think this is a wrap because I

1529
01:09:07,798 --> 01:09:28,278
don't actually see any more questions so

1530
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:28,279
I think that's about it right anyone no

1531
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:32,089
all right

1532
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:39,068
well thank you everyone for joining me

1533
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:40,449
for another episode of handmade hero

1534
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:42,940
it's been a pleasure coding with you as

1535
01:09:40,449 --> 01:09:44,798
always I was a little out of it today

1536
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:46,419
not sure why sometimes after coding all

1537
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,279
day and then handmade here I don't

1538
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:51,630
necessarily have my full coding brain on

1539
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:53,710
it depends on the circumstance but

1540
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:55,390
nonetheless we kind of did get some

1541
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:57,730
stuff straightened out I think we're

1542
01:09:55,390 --> 01:10:01,150
getting pretty close to to getting our Z

1543
01:09:57,729 --> 01:10:02,799
stuff kind of where we want to be and so

1544
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:04,479
I think tomorrow we can go ahead and

1545
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,130
start trying to work those slices in

1546
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,179
there and I feel like what we want to do

1547
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:10,329
with that is like start to get the

1548
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:12,400
ground buffers working on slices and

1549
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:14,649
then you know so that we can kind of

1550
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:16,629
have have ledges that look down into

1551
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:20,109
lower things and see those kind of

1552
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:22,270
clearly and then also start to use that

1553
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:24,130
to do sort of that reflection mapping

1554
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:26,320
picking properly so we know that like

1555
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:28,569
okay this ground is the ground buffer

1556
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:29,979
that we use for you know doing the

1557
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:33,729
reflection mapping or that kind of stuff

1558
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:35,679
right so you know I think we pretty much

1559
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,059
know what it is we got to do here we've

1560
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,470
got a couple more days of getting

1561
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:40,660
everything lined up properly but we're

1562
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:42,130
in pretty good shape so hopefully you

1563
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:43,119
come back tomorrow and join us for that

1564
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:45,130
when we go ahead and start the

1565
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:47,309
implementation of getting those slices

1566
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:49,750
kind of formalized and working properly

1567
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:52,120
it'll be the same time same place

1568
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:54,130
tomorrow 5:00 p.m. on right here on

1569
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:56,079
Twitch if you would like to follow along

1570
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:57,520
at home with the source code you can do

1571
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,960
so by pre-ordering the game it comes

1572
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,430
with a source code you can download it

1573
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,800
every night I uploaded after I finished

1574
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:04,090
coding we also have a patreon page if

1575
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,430
you want to support the video series

1576
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:09,699
that's a easy way to do that there's

1577
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:11,530
also a forum site that has anti episode

1578
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,849
guide and place to ask questions and

1579
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:14,529
porce to Mac and Linux good stuff like

1580
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:16,329
that and finally there's a tweet bot

1581
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:18,550
that tweets the schedule at you so if

1582
01:11:16,329 --> 01:11:20,350
you want to know when the streams gonna

1583
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:22,180
be live it sometimes we change the times

1584
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,650
and sometimes there's you know days off

1585
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:25,030
or something like that that's the best

1586
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:26,289
thing to do is just subscribe that tweet

1587
01:11:25,029 --> 01:11:27,909
pot cos it'll always tell you you could

1588
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:30,489
always go to its page if you want to

1589
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:32,979
check it out so that's about it I hope

1590
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:35,769
everyone has a good evening and I will

1591
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:39,329
see you guys back here tomorrow for some

1592
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:39,330
more handmade hero take it easy everyone
