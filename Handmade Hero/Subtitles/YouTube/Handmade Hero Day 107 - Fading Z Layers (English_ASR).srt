1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,209
start recording okay

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,290
hello everyone and welcome to handmade

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,580
Europe

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,230
we're coming in a little bit hot today

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,210
because I just got through ranting about

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,880
people who are sort of asking about

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,679
libraries and why you don't use them and

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,719
I just kind of totally dumped on

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,800
libraries for about ten minutes so you

10
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:21,269
know there's a little bit of furor in

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,210
there there's a little bit of like fire

12
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,489
in the belly it's true but we are going

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,990
to channel that into coding hopefully

14
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:33,238
we'll see how it goes anyway welcome on

15
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,679
that note welcome to handmade hero the

16
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,189
show where we code a complete game live

17
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,200
on Twitch no libraries which is kind of

18
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,519
the point of the free free stream no

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,660
libraries what so ever I think the only

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,129
thing we're linking with right now is

21
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,479
the C runtime library which which

22
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,479
honestly I think eventually we'll

23
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,299
probably want to remove as well because

24
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,648
well because why not once you once

25
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,000
you're not linking with any libraries

26
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,739
you might as well not let the one

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,359
default library stand in your way from

28
00:00:55,738 --> 00:01:00,509
actually be able to say you linked with

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,850
zero because it's not that much work to

30
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,219
remove it right but anyway

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,420
separate from that welcome to handmade

32
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:10,618
hero today we have to do some work on

33
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,349
something that's that's kind of the bane

34
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,780
of the existence of 2d games that want

35
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:18,059
to do some 3d effects which is handling

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,118
that extra Z layer and the reason for

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,040
that of course is because well the art

38
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,019
isn't 3d right the art is little bit

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,549
maps and you've constantly in this thing

40
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,259
of like how do I take little bit Maps

41
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,909
and turn them into something that sort

42
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,150
of faked some of the effects of 3d

43
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,420
without essentially fighting the fact

44
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,680
that it is bitmap art and again we could

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,390
just ignore this problem all together

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,400
and just have the game take place on a

47
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,009
flat plane where you can never see

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,689
anything above or below you and that is

49
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,609
what a lot of 2d games do but again

50
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,019
because this is a programming stream not

51
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,179
a stream about getting a game done as

52
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,039
soon as possible we have chosen to try

53
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,930
and handle Z in a number of ways just so

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,509
we can explore the complexities that

55
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,700
come with it and you know just so you

56
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,109
can watch me wrestle with them because

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,570
it's not a case where there's any

58
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,859
perfect solution and so I think again I

59
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,109
try to introduce things into the stream

60
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:09,598
that I'll have to struggle with and

61
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:11,008
weigh decisions and not just see an

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,598
immediate answer and go oh well we just

63
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,949
typed it in and it worked right which

64
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,169
you've kind of see happen like first

65
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,429
when we did texture mapping we just kind

66
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,348
of typed it in and just worked it was

67
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,700
like you know 15 minutes on the stream

68
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,829
after explaining it on the blackboard it

69
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,810
just works right known things like that

70
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,940
are pretty easy but they don't really

71
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,229
teach you about how to work through

72
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,520
difficult programming problems where

73
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:32,039
you're trying to do something that

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,959
doesn't have a necessarily right answer

75
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,189
and this is one of those things and so

76
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,110
we're in the middle of that process of

77
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:41,489
trying to work through it trying to look

78
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:46,739
at exactly what we can do to get some

79
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:49,620
amount of clean render design that still

80
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,750
brings out some of that z-depth to the

81
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,489
game so that's what we're doing today

82
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,049
we're gonna start some of that

83
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,939
exploration process because we've we

84
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,159
sort of set ourselves up to do that

85
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:01,259
based on what we did yesterday and today

86
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,669
is day 107 so if you'd like to follow

87
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,768
along at home and you preorder the game

88
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,329
on handmade hero org what you want to do

89
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,150
is take that source zip file you can

90
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,370
download and you want to unpack day 106

91
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,629
because that was yesterday's code that's

92
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,099
what we're starting with today to make

93
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:20,430
today's code alright so let's get going

94
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:22,680
let us get going here that is if I could

95
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,540
actually remember how to load some code

96
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,870
and compile it which is kind of what we

97
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:31,259
need to do so all right where we left

98
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,329
things off was we had sort of made just

99
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:35,789
we had like a little test world here we

100
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,040
were working with that actually had two

101
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,919
Z layers on it you can sort of see that

102
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,239
the way that they go here but at the

103
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,649
moment we have a number of things that

104
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
we're not really doing like first of all

105
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,609
we turned off rendering of our ground

106
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,030
chunks which I would like to turn back

107
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:53,100
on and what I'd like to do is start to

108
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,199
get a notion of those z slices in here

109
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,150
because we don't have that at the moment

110
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,889
either we can also kind of do something

111
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,329
where we pan up and down you can kind of

112
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,208
see what happens there if I move the

113
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:06,769
camera in and out a little bit but again

114
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:10,709
we haven't really done much in terms of

115
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:14,069
dealing with these these slices other

116
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,209
than just handling that offset right so

117
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,129
I think the first thing that we want to

118
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:20,009
do is is really kind of go in there and

119
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,269
take a look at how to get those Z slices

120
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,069
in there and you can see that the tree

121
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,750
is kind of moving at different rates

122
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:26,069
there's one ring of trees that's above

123
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,930
and one retreat is below but until we

124
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,219
put the ground

125
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,038
there it's gonna be hard to really

126
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,400
visually understand these things so

127
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:36,379
let's go ahead and do that and maybe

128
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:47,359
just start to try and get those ground

129
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:49,430
slices in place okay so what we decided

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,919
and this this change this may be a

131
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,379
fairly lengthy set of changes that we

132
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,060
want to make here because remember we've

133
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:58,038
got a lot of things in play now and

134
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,038
we're trying to solidify the z across

135
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,750
all of them right and so if you remember

136
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,029
we've got our sim region which is the

137
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,668
thing that handles basically computing

138
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,529
how entities update over time we have

139
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:11,629
our handmade world structure which

140
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:13,489
basically packs entities into their

141
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,589
locations where they are and that sort

142
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,840
of stuff and what I want to take a look

143
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:20,418
at here is previously we had this world

144
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:22,848
position stuff and we have the chunk Z

145
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:28,490
that's the sort of Z conceptualization

146
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:33,129
of where things are in Z and what I'd

147
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:36,139
like to do is I'd like to start getting

148
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:38,240
start talking about that Z in terms of

149
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,079
actual slices in the world that probably

150
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,699
coincide with the chunk Z so that we can

151
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,740
talk about them in terms of layers

152
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,900
because what we keep seeing when we work

153
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,829
through this is really we need this

154
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:53,929
concept of fixed chunks of Z because

155
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:57,529
since the bitmaps themselves can't

156
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,090
include really much 3d information we

157
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,339
need a way of sort of saying well

158
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:03,649
everything at this level we'll just

159
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:05,569
assume kind of works all together and

160
00:06:03,649 --> 00:06:08,569
everything at the next level up works

161
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:11,389
all together right and we we can't

162
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:13,969
really allow things to cross between

163
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,310
those two to exist in both of those at

164
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,289
the same time because the bitmaps would

165
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,699
have to like shear and stuff in order to

166
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:21,978
maintain the perspective and do all

167
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,520
sorts of things that we really can't do

168
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:27,529
with the art style that we have and so

169
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,569
in order to get around that what we were

170
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:31,758
trying to do here is we're trying to

171
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:33,759
make a world that essentially exists

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,199
coherently in terms of slices and

173
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,270
enemies can move between the slices just

174
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,819
fine but in general the slices of the

175
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:42,829
world in Z should be

176
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:44,509
separate they shouldn't be trying to

177
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:46,250
have art extend between them if there's

178
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,769
things that need to go between them

179
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,149
there's art on both of the levels and we

180
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:52,549
just accept the fact that there might be

181
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:54,049
some breakage there just as part of the

182
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,590
way the art style works that's just how

183
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,939
it's gonna work

184
00:06:54,589 --> 00:07:00,439
right that's what we're doing and if we

185
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:03,259
find that that breakage is too

186
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:06,019
off-putting what we'll do at the end is

187
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:08,149
instead of we can just turn off that

188
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:10,039
scaling and that will make all of our

189
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,009
levels line up and then we can have the

190
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,180
art kind of just line up with tops and

191
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,680
bottoms if that's what we want but I

192
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,540
suspect since the game is not really

193
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,519
about having these tall structures or

194
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,200
anything like that I suspect that we'll

195
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,319
be able to do is basically just treat

196
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,579
things like a series of shelves and we

197
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,839
really won't have any problem with it

198
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,699
and of course we can have lots of

199
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,679
entities that move between them without

200
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:35,060
really having any problems so that

201
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,970
should be totally fine so that's where

202
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,709
we're at and so I want to start thinking

203
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,300
about this in terms of where everything

204
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,099
is and try and start working through

205
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,610
that that chunk stuff so let's take a

206
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,189
look first of all how our sim region

207
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,020
stuff Candles unpacking entities I just

208
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:54,259
want to kind of go through this quickly

209
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:56,389
so basically what happens when we unpack

210
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:58,009
entities I don't really want to be a

211
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,879
move entity here I want to be in the

212
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:06,348
same region stuff that actually unpacks

213
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,870
which is begins Sam there it is so in

214
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:10,699
begins Sam what we do is we loop over

215
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,250
all of the chunks that are hit by the

216
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,709
camera right and we go ahead and pull

217
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,000
out all the entities and we add them to

218
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:20,060
our sim region and then we're we're done

219
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,579
right we stuff them all back in and that

220
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:27,199
is pretty agnostic about what's

221
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:31,538
happening with the chunk see and you can

222
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:35,718
see here that what generally happens is

223
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:39,168
we maintain the chunk C but we don't

224
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:43,028
become you to me we maintain the chunk C

225
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:46,370
for the camera but we never actually do

226
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:49,220
for the for the offset C we never

227
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,990
actually use that offset Z so you can

228
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,009
kind of see here we even do it we even

229
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,110
make sure that we preserve that

230
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:56,399
the so the camera doesn't move up and

231
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,009
down smoothly at the moment the camera

232
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,720
like hops between levels and I don't

233
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,519
know if that's the way we want it to do

234
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,220
probably that's not what we wanted to do

235
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:09,149
in the end we probably want it to kind

236
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,410
of move cleanly between them and so this

237
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:14,939
again also gets back to sort of the sort

238
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:16,169
of the concept of the ground and where

239
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,060
the ground should be but let's let's

240
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:19,349
hold off on that on that for a second so

241
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,209
what I want to do is I want to go back

242
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,220
in here and I'm going to take off out

243
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,570
that cam off that Z that we were playing

244
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,090
with a little bit there that I just kind

245
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,560
of threw in there for a second offset I

246
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,360
don't know if you remember this Z offset

247
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,899
I'm just gonna get rid of that real

248
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:38,100
quick so that's gone gonna get rid of

249
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:41,490
all this stuff there we go and see

250
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,930
offset here ground and a point with a

251
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:50,120
bat and we've got okay so I think that's

252
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:52,319
all of that so now if I run things here

253
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,750
we're just doing the same thing that we

254
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,850
were doing before everything's good and

255
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,529
remember we've got our sort of hidden I

256
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,570
guess this is because we haven't turned

257
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:01,799
our rectangle code back on so I should

258
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,750
probably go in here and see if I can get

259
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,059
our rectangle code back working because

260
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,529
we kind of forgot to ever re-enable that

261
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:09,269
when we were working on scaling and

262
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:13,019
stuff let's see if we can turn our

263
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:15,559
rectangle code back on as you can see

264
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,490
here we've got draw rectangle slowly

265
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,500
working in our coordinate system let's

266
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,629
see here draw rectangle oops there we go

267
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,460
draw a rectangle so if I turn that back

268
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:25,379
on I'm not sure where what the status is

269
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,480
of our erectile code it looks like our

270
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:29,220
rectangle code is all correct so we had

271
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,659
actually updated it properly we just

272
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,399
left it turned off and so that's fine

273
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,870
you can see there's room boundary is

274
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,299
still there in blue and that's all good

275
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,470
right so there's that imaginal stairwell

276
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,509
that we still don't have art forward you

277
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,379
can see as I walk up it we get to the

278
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:45,480
upper layer right and everything seems

279
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,659
perfectly kosher with that but we do

280
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,129
have that z chunk snapping right that's

281
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,779
a chunk snapping so what I want to do is

282
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:54,210
see if we can just turn off the zoo

283
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,519
chunk snapping and get us into a you

284
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,650
know sort of a continuous movement out

285
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:03,059
for the camera there so let's take a

286
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:04,799
look at ensign again and so here's why

287
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,208
that's happening right you can see that

288
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,549
we we take the chunk

289
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:11,159
see of the camera but we don't really

290
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:12,928
ever do anything with with the offset we

291
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,118
sort of preserve that offset so if we

292
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:17,909
wanted to we could probably do something

293
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:21,629
like this where we just go ahead and

294
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:23,730
leave that offset you know don't try to

295
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:27,058
restore that offset and let the offset

296
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,220
become set based on the camera Z and if

297
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:30,719
we do that I suspect we will have there

298
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,899
you go there's a continuous movement in

299
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,178
Z you can kind of see that working there

300
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,860
and that looks pretty good to me

301
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:39,509
I think that's the way we would want it

302
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,209
to work right where things kind of fade

303
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:46,199
in and out that top layer fades in as I

304
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:48,688
move up and down like so and so that's

305
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:50,308
all good but what we need to do now is

306
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,868
we need to sort of introduce that

307
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:53,278
coherent concept because what we'd like

308
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:55,439
to do again like I say is we want to

309
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,028
fade these I was saying this yesterday

310
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:58,678
we want to fade out that top level

311
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:00,509
because if you think about it there's

312
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:03,869
gonna be ground in here there's gonna be

313
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:06,178
like actual ground and stuff tiles so if

314
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:08,759
you know we were down here all the

315
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:10,139
ground would be obscuring our view we

316
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,119
wouldn't able to see anything right so

317
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,470
what we need to do is get rid of all of

318
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:15,089
these things that we're drawing up here

319
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,069
they we don't want any of those to draw

320
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:18,720
until we actually start to move up and

321
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:20,849
then when we move up they should sort of

322
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,350
fade in right we kind of all agree that

323
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,428
that's what's supposed to happen we've

324
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,509
talked about this on the stream you know

325
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:29,308
all the times everyone seems pretty

326
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:31,079
happy with that as a plan so the

327
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:32,308
question is how do we do that well the

328
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,469
first thing that we need to do is we

329
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:36,629
need to have some conception of

330
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,278
basically these Z slices because what I

331
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:40,709
need to do is I need to know where I am

332
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,568
relative to the slices and so what I

333
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,849
want to do is introduce that concept and

334
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:48,229
say that we have fixed Z slices in the

335
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,939
world and that world structure again

336
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,999
this this world structure here I want

337
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:56,009
this to be like a definitive reference

338
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,569
right I don't want everything in the

339
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,759
code to sort of have its willy-nilly

340
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,378
where's the ground what level is what

341
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,048
and all that sort of stuff we want to

342
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,399
get rid of that concept not necessarily

343
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,509
for collision detection like maybe we

344
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,860
want to have different heights of things

345
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:09,298
that you can hop on I don't know if we

346
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,649
want to do that or not I'm just saying

347
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:12,509
if that was sort of thing we want to do

348
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:15,240
that's a separate thing what I'm talking

349
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:18,298
about is the actual concept of where the

350
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,769
like ground base ground level is is

351
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,019
going to be in these slices

352
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:24,629
so what I want to do is have the world

353
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:28,589
structure be able to answer your

354
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:30,659
question for this point in space what is

355
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,540
the ground level that would be below it

356
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,368
or on it but if it's standing on it and

357
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:37,849
what would be the one above it and below

358
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:41,399
it right so you can kind of get this

359
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,739
opinion of where you are in that space

360
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,048
right and so I want this query that I

361
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:48,360
can basically say hey world here's what

362
00:13:46,048 --> 00:13:51,659
my guy is I need you to go ahead and

363
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,818
tell me kind of what that strata is

364
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:55,469
right and that way we're free to modify

365
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:57,178
the way that that's working in the

366
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,259
future we're even free to have different

367
00:13:57,178 --> 00:14:00,119
parts of the world think about it

368
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:01,678
differently if we really need to later I

369
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:03,389
don't really want to do that because I

370
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:05,850
feel like that's probably unnecessary

371
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,548
but if we had to like we had a special

372
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,649
area that needed to be treated in a sort

373
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:13,078
of a special way we could have the world

374
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,639
answer those queries using kind of some

375
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:17,219
kind of special stuff and everyone that

376
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,539
was asking would be able to still work

377
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,249
without having to know that there are

378
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,379
specials areas areas of the world that

379
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:28,499
have that sort of different stuff to

380
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:30,649
them all right by the way in case

381
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:34,350
everyone's wondering I'm drinking

382
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:36,509
strawberries Inagua fresca basically

383
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:41,009
like a strawberry agua fresca today it's

384
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:42,778
not soy milk all right let's do this so

385
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:44,548
here's my world struck and here's what I

386
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:46,350
want to do so we have that global alpha

387
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:48,298
value which I said was weak sauce but

388
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,278
we're going to use it just for now to

389
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:52,259
make sure that we kind of get things

390
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,399
working with the global alpha value and

391
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,278
then what we'll do is we'll pull out the

392
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,619
global alpha value and we'll put in a

393
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,688
render to to a render target thing that

394
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:03,178
will allow us to do it in in proper

395
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:05,129
fading slices like I said what we wanted

396
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:08,548
to do before okay

397
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:10,980
so what we want to do here is go all

398
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:12,058
right we've got this global alpha and so

399
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,188
what we want to do when we come through

400
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:16,649
here and we're rendering these entities

401
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:18,118
right what I want to do is I want to be

402
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,470
able to in fact I guess now that I think

403
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:22,739
about it I don't even really need the

404
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:25,110
global alpha to do this for the most

405
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:26,610
part do I because each individual entity

406
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,619
I'm just going to be able to see when I

407
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,909
when I go to render the entity I'm going

408
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:33,629
to set its alpha value to be something

409
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:36,208
sort of

410
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:39,778
- - whatsoever I'm looking for I can set

411
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:42,208
its alpha value to be based on where it

412
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:43,889
is right based on how high up it is and

413
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,899
in fact I guess this global alpha here

414
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,339
right what I could do is just move it

415
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:52,500
down so that every entity we can still

416
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,930
lean on that global alpha system and

417
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,089
what we'll do is every entity will use

418
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:59,219
its position here to kind of determine

419
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,509
that now we have a little bit of a Jake

420
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,040
eNOS and this probably gets into

421
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:03,568
something we want to talk about a little

422
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,028
later which is that we don't actually

423
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:07,860
know the final resting place of the

424
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:10,139
entity because we haven't simulated for

425
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,519
forwards yet and I think this is arguing

426
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,909
towards wanting to separate out the

427
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,440
render pass the sort of the render from

428
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,149
the update which was something I didn't

429
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,040
want to do prematurely but what kind of

430
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,970
we're gonna talk about that in a bit to

431
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:29,539
do Casey probably indicates we want to

432
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:33,959
separate update and render for entities

433
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:35,250
sometime soon and again so that was

434
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,129
something that we talked about before

435
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,708
and again like I said one of the reasons

436
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:44,490
that we put update and render together

437
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:46,919
as one pass architectural II speaking is

438
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,299
so that some things can update and

439
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,328
render together if it's more efficient

440
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:54,419
and other things don't have to right and

441
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:55,828
so I guess the this is sort of what your

442
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,759
you know what you will probably be

443
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,679
seeing here is I think will probably

444
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,339
break entities up so that they update

445
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,958
and render in separate stages and that's

446
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,730
the kind of flexibility you want to have

447
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,379
right so if we have other things like

448
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,548
particle systems maybe they update and

449
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,199
render together because it's more

450
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:11,490
efficient that way whereas enemies it's

451
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,689
because of the way that we're working

452
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,919
with them we need we want more

453
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:15,360
flexibility we can separate in two

454
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,250
passes and again that's a really

455
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,658
important thing I think it's good to

456
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,308
always have update and render be

457
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,900
together and then only break them apart

458
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:24,149
when you see that you have a clear

459
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,038
reason for doing so and then she'll get

460
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,548
some efficiency there or something in

461
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,048
return

462
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:29,579
whereas everything else you want to

463
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,230
leave updating and rendering together so

464
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,908
that you don't basically spend all this

465
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,250
time pulling things in in and out of the

466
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:37,230
cache for no reason just to operate on

467
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,569
them in two passes that didn't actually

468
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,950
need to happen right but anyway again

469
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:42,689
that's something we can take a look at a

470
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,960
little bit later on for now we don't

471
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,160
care we can just use one frame of lag in

472
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,779
terms of pinging the Alpha

473
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,220
doesn't matter we'll you know we can

474
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,129
deal with that

475
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,509
in a little bit so anyway we we've got

476
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,010
the global alpha and what I want to do

477
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:57,779
is I want to set the global alpha based

478
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,309
on that position so the first thing we

479
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:00,869
do is I'm just do this in line here and

480
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:03,960
then I'm gonna move it out into a query

481
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:05,309
in the world to get that that out so

482
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,190
that it has the properties that I was

483
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,269
saying we're desirable there so the way

484
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,590
that I'm going to do that is I'm first

485
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,589
gonna take a look at where the entity

486
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,119
actually is right and you can see that

487
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:18,480
this right here actually this this

488
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,799
global alpha stuff I should probably set

489
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,390
just just quickly in here although I

490
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,250
think global is automatically set to it

491
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,740
to 1 in there if I'm not very much

492
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,119
mistaken we just double check do we set

493
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,009
global for the 1 yes we do so we don't

494
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,679
need to do it up there so we want to do

495
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:34,109
is here in the sim region you can see

496
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,759
that we've we're gonna start off where

497
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:37,259
we're updating the entities now so what

498
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,539
we have is we have that entity position

499
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:42,450
what I'd like to do is figure out where

500
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:44,220
that entity is going to be right and you

501
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,200
can kind of see us doing it down here

502
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,029
where we do get get ground entity ground

503
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,250
point I'm gonna call that get ground

504
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:52,379
ground point function I'm gonna use that

505
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,839
entity ground point to determine what

506
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,600
the alpha value for this enemy should be

507
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:59,339
and set it here so when we call that get

508
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,659
him to ground point like so I'm also

509
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,339
gonna make sure we clear the global

510
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,509
alpha here you can see this little alpha

511
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,589
is annoying to work with so I say I

512
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,670
don't really want this as an actual

513
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:07,230
feature we're just kind of using it now

514
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,550
I don't like things that you set

515
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,900
globally and then after remember to

516
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,119
clear and all that's okay it gets a

517
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,769
little bit janky so you know that's kind

518
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,059
of why I say this is not a feature that

519
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:18,660
should stay in there we're just using it

520
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,919
for now so kind of keep that in the back

521
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,150
of your head anything you see me doing

522
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,950
in this mobile alpha this is just for

523
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,290
test code we don't want to keep this in

524
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,180
the render at long term I don't think

525
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,369
anyway so we get that ground entity

526
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,289
point out so we get that we'll just call

527
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,939
this ground P for now what I want to do

528
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:35,220
is I want to set that global alpha based

529
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,080
on the ground P so what I need to do is

530
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,630
I need to figure out how far away from

531
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:43,019
the camera it is right so when I have

532
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:44,340
that ground P and we should should know

533
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,500
kind of where the camera is as well

534
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:49,379
because we know that the camera is at

535
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,519
camera P right and so what I want to do

536
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,990
is I want to figure out what the

537
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,349
difference between those two things

538
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,299
actually is and I believe since the

539
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:59,759
camera is always at the center of the

540
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,869
sim region technically I think we can

541
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,119
always just assume

542
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:05,669
that right I mean is that am i am I

543
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,169
totally off here let me see if we've got

544
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,300
that or not it looks like we don't

545
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,590
really say where the cameras in here and

546
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,269
I wonder if that's a little bit of a

547
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:14,099
mistake because the sim oops sorry

548
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:15,150
that's the same entity I wonder if

549
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,308
that's a little bit mistaken I feel like

550
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:20,580
we should say where the camera should be

551
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:23,279
in case we want it to not be at the

552
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:25,470
origin you know you know what I mean it

553
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,200
seems like that's something we would

554
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,808
probably want to think about at least a

555
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,640
little bit right you see where I'm going

556
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:34,619
with that I feel like I'm gonna go ahead

557
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,650
and try to introduce that here I feel

558
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:40,558
like we want I'm just a camera position

559
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,640
like camera position relative or

560
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,200
something like that

561
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,820
that says where the camera is or

562
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,340
something like this right no this is the

563
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:55,259
camera position relative to the origin

564
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:57,449
of this region just so we can kind of

565
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,859
figure out where the camera is you know

566
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:01,620
where the camera is supposed to be

567
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:03,990
because you know maybe we've got the sim

568
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:06,839
region offset somehow from the camera in

569
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,390
some way we want to be able to still

570
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,299
know where the camera position is right

571
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,400
and so when we go to render we want that

572
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,740
camera position to be in the center

573
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,720
right and so what we want to do is

574
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,990
displace all the entities by whatever

575
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,220
it's negative is right so basically I'm

576
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,589
going to introduce this camera position

577
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,019
but we do begin sim right now we're

578
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:30,389
always assuming that the camera is at

579
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,730
the center but in the future maybe we'll

580
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,200
assume something else and so when we do

581
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,929
this here when we do all of our sim

582
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,549
stuff and then we go ahead and we add

583
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:41,130
entities in here right and we try to

584
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:44,369
compute their position we do get sim

585
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,960
space P and in here we have you know all

586
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,459
that stuff what I want to do is just

587
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,980
figure out where the camera should be

588
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,690
and in it for now I guess we'll just

589
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,220
assume that the camera is actually

590
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,690
nowhere right it's just I mean that is

591
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,839
actually just already at the center

592
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,519
right so the sim region oh and you know

593
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,169
what that'll already be done for us

594
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,119
actually but I'm gonna put it in here

595
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:08,220
just so we remember and I'll put it to

596
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:11,699
do KC some way of specifying what the

597
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,930
camera position right that should be or

598
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,830
something like that oh you know what

599
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:19,039
now I think about it that's actually

600
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:20,720
kind of dumb I don't know that we really

601
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,700
need that because only the render pass

602
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,769
is ever gonna care about where the

603
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,799
camera is probably so maybe we should

604
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:29,750
just have that happen in here right

605
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:32,809
we know that the camera position is

606
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,299
going to be relative to the sim region

607
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:38,179
that we opened we can just compute where

608
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,369
it is directly in fact we've got the

609
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,019
ability to do that right so we can go

610
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:44,389
ahead and say oh the camera position

611
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:48,379
that's just going to subtract wherever

612
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:51,290
the camera was from wherever the sim

613
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,210
region was right so it's really just

614
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:58,159
gonna be something like this world

615
00:22:53,210 --> 00:23:00,860
position sim Center P like that so there

616
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,320
we go sim Center P and then we'll always

617
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:07,549
just say well that's the the camera

618
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:08,359
position right something like this makes

619
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:11,539
sense

620
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,189
oops that's game state and that way now

621
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:15,079
we know that we're actually handling it

622
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,509
this is just gonna produce 0 because

623
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,519
gonna be camera P you know subtracted

624
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:23,390
from itself it's gonna produce 0 but at

625
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,000
least now we would always know we have

626
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,530
the world here yeah at least now we'll

627
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,660
always know that if we want to adjust

628
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:32,389
the location of the sim center we can

629
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,550
and nothing will break right so that's

630
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,220
what I wanted to do there so what we can

631
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:40,099
do is like say okay camera relative

632
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,079
what's the camera relative ground P of

633
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:45,409
this thing the camera relative ground P

634
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,179
of this thing is going to be whatever

635
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,490
the ground point is - where the camera

636
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:53,330
is and then we can get that global alpha

637
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:56,750
by taking the the Z value of this that's

638
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:59,599
how high right this is off of the camera

639
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,279
and what we can say is well we would

640
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,469
like to use some kind of a function

641
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,690
obviously we want to clamp it between 0

642
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,309
and 1 we want to use some kind of a

643
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,890
function that will produce that that

644
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,839
alpha fade right and so what we can do

645
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,940
is we can say we've got the relative

646
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,699
ground P we know that if it's 0 or

647
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,590
negative it's below us right so

648
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,150
basically that's you know we don't want

649
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:21,889
to do anything there so we'd probably do

650
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,450
something like saying okay you know if

651
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,450
it's zero or negative it gets

652
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:33,048
it's fine and then what we want to do is

653
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,179
sort of when we have that Z value we

654
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:37,579
want to pick some distance above which

655
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:39,200
it will sort of fade out over time so

656
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:41,569
I'll maybe do it something like that so

657
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,990
we'll say one point five meters above

658
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:47,139
the camera something like this let's

659
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,289
take a look and see how that goes so

660
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:54,710
here there we go so you can kind of see

661
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:57,529
how that fades in right you can see as

662
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,390
we move upwards we get that nice fade in

663
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:02,960
effect and it all kind of looks

664
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,179
relatively relatively solid right so I

665
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,370
walk down the stairs the fades out I

666
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:16,280
walk up the stairs it fades in right out

667
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:18,889
and out right and so that's you know

668
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,609
that's relatively what we're close to

669
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,799
what we're going for

670
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:23,659
right and what you can see here is that

671
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:24,980
I've done this in kind of an ad hoc way

672
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,230
and so what I want to do is I want to

673
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,849
make this a little more formal just so

674
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,860
we can start to base it off of real

675
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:32,089
values so the first value the thing way

676
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:38,149
that I'm going to do this is I'm gonna

677
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:41,449
say okay what is the you know the how

678
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,880
should I say this I I want to sort of

679
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,850
say we've got these Z slices and the Z

680
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,010
slices need to fade in so what I want to

681
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,109
do is say where do they start fading in

682
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,329
and where do they stop fading in right

683
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:59,479
and so what I want to do is like fade

684
00:25:53,329 --> 00:26:02,000
start Z and fade and Z right and so

685
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,120
obviously the fade end I want to say

686
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,319
mm-hmm and just to give you in fact you

687
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,539
know what let me do this on the on the

688
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,159
blackboard just so everyone's clear on

689
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:11,298
what I'm talking about here I don't want

690
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,110
to I don't want there to be any

691
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:15,379
confusion about what's going on what day

692
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:19,969
are we

693
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,610
we're day 107 so here we go day one zero

694
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,789
seven here we go

695
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:28,939
so what we want to do here is we want to

696
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:33,319
use me we want to parameterize this in

697
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:35,600
some way where we can go all right we've

698
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:40,388
got the camera

699
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:42,978
and at some level between the camera and

700
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:46,339
you know our magic hour fades start

701
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:47,450
let's call this everything is is fully

702
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:51,378
visible right

703
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:54,440
this is visible then at some level

704
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:57,128
between there in the range between that

705
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,609
start and the end this is going to fade

706
00:26:57,128 --> 00:27:07,908
right and then everything up here is

707
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:09,678
invisible right make sense that's what

708
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:12,609
we want to do and furthermore we

709
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,038
probably also want to do something

710
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:19,189
that's like okay we've got you know

711
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:21,378
another thing here so we probably want

712
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:26,859
like fade start you know this is like

713
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:34,428
the top one and this is like fade start

714
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:35,358
bottom and fade end bottom you know I'm

715
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,849
Sam

716
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:42,710
so that we've kind of got in here a fade

717
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:47,628
as well and then you know everything in

718
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:51,429
here is invisible so really this visible

719
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:55,488
region actually is is this whole range

720
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:57,830
right and so what we can do there is we

721
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:58,970
can actually we could if we knew that

722
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:00,470
they were going to be the same heights

723
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,089
we could take the absolute value of

724
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,429
whatever but I don't think we want them

725
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:06,348
to be because I suspect that this is

726
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,940
going to be smaller than this right and

727
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:09,048
the reason for that is we may want you

728
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,759
know when you're looking down on

729
00:28:09,048 --> 00:28:14,058
something the reason that we want to

730
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,858
fade out these guys is because we don't

731
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:18,348
want them to obscure your view so we

732
00:28:15,858 --> 00:28:20,778
need the very first level you know if we

733
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:22,460
looked here at what the levels were you

734
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:23,888
know here's the one you know here's the

735
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,499
current ground but you're standing on

736
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:29,569
that the fade out start in top this is

737
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:32,419
actually where the next level would be

738
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:34,249
right here's where upstairs is right

739
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,929
because it should be invisible most the

740
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:39,440
time until you start walking upstairs we

741
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:41,749
shouldn't see it but we actually want

742
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,528
several levels of ground visible here

743
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:47,720
probably right so we probably want this

744
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:49,339
to be very different values we want this

745
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,419
to encompass like say this guy

746
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:55,398
right so these are not going to be the

747
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:56,749
same ranges and I think we need to sort

748
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:58,758
of appreciate that so what we need to do

749
00:28:56,749 --> 00:29:01,069
is take wherever stuff is map it into

750
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,759
here and then produce the correct fade

751
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:07,450
values as a result right so what we want

752
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:11,120
to do is say that we've got sort of a

753
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,980
fade top start and a fade top end right

754
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,408
and I'll stack these in the way that

755
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:19,460
they actually stack so then the bottom

756
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:26,539
start Z and a fade bottom and Z like so

757
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:29,929
right that's what we want to see happen

758
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:32,990
and so what we can do here is say all

759
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:34,309
right it's gonna start fading in let's

760
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:37,190
say it's gonna start fading in a meter

761
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:40,490
above the guy or whatever and then it's

762
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,019
gonna stop fading at a meter and at 0.25

763
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,859
or something like that I don't know I'm

764
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:44,899
making this up

765
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:47,449
maybe 1.5 I don't know what did we even

766
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:49,579
say I don't even remember what we were

767
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,080
sort of saying is our world thing at

768
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:53,359
this point I don't even remember where

769
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:56,628
we landed on that we had set it when we

770
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:59,028
create the world when we create worlds

771
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,980
we had we had set the the like height

772
00:29:59,028 --> 00:30:02,298
value in here somewhere I don't even

773
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,298
know where it is

774
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:08,028
I don't even remember this code at all

775
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:10,128
there it is initialized world so chunk

776
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:13,128
diamond meters gets passed in and so

777
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:17,658
basically somewhere in here we were

778
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:20,449
specifying it been a long time so world

779
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:22,909
Chuck dim in meters is here so typical

780
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,288
gamestate typical floor height right so

781
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:27,639
what we probably want to do is say okay

782
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:32,599
the fade you know that that fade ends

783
00:30:27,638 --> 00:30:35,479
probably at that at that typical floor

784
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:37,219
height above right so like like the cell

785
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,579
right so anything that's at the floor

786
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:45,048
above us is gone you can't see it and

787
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:46,878
the fade top end is probably you know as

788
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:50,450
as it kind of starts to fade in I don't

789
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:51,678
know is some amount above that of the of

790
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,519
the typical floor height so it's

791
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,690
probably you know it's probably

792
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,839
something like the typical floor height

793
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,058
plus some percentage of the typical

794
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:03,119
floor height like a quarter of the floor

795
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:05,009
height is how long

796
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,029
takes to blend something in right and

797
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:11,069
then the fade bottom start you know

798
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:13,200
that's gonna be probably been negative

799
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:17,119
maybe it's two floors down something

800
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,880
like that everything becomes invisible

801
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,139
seems or starts to become invisible and

802
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,880
then similarly you know this would be

803
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,980
something and we could write this a

804
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,390
little you know we could accept the fact

805
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,210
that we're all comfortable math here and

806
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,450
just do that right and then down here

807
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:36,150
it's like something like this right and

808
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,330
so then I guess basically what we want

809
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:42,720
to do is we want to do it if here to

810
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:44,549
figure out if you're above top Z or or

811
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,690
below bottom Z right so we can say that

812
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:50,549
your alpha is going to be one point out

813
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:55,650
and then we'll just say all right if

814
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:58,859
your relative Z here right if your

815
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,110
relative Z is greater than fade top

816
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,659
start Z then you're fading out on the

817
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:07,259
top and otherwise if the camera relative

818
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:09,269
ground point Z is less than fade bottom

819
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:12,599
start Z then you're fading out on the

820
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:15,450
bottom okay and we're gonna set your

821
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,009
alpha accordingly and what I'd like to

822
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,450
do here is I'd like to just introduce a

823
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:21,329
function I don't think we've made one

824
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:23,039
yet right at least I don't know if we

825
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:24,839
have or not I'll be honest with you I

826
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,450
forget what we've done in math and what

827
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,459
we haven't done math this is the

828
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,890
consequence of doing handmade here as an

829
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,180
hour a day and having nothing to having

830
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:36,660
it have nothing to do with what I'm

831
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:38,519
doing at work all right so what I want

832
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,650
to do here is I want to introduce a

833
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,200
range function that we can use I want to

834
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,570
introduce something that's like you know

835
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,490
clamp map to range or something like

836
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:50,099
that and what I want to do is say

837
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,839
there's a min there's a T value and

838
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:56,299
there's a Max and I want you to

839
00:32:51,839 --> 00:33:00,149
basically produce a value a 0 to 1 value

840
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:01,680
that's going to tell me where T falls

841
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:07,530
between min and Max it's like a berry

842
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:09,210
centric to fire right and you can see

843
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:11,190
right now we got the clamp we just don't

844
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,230
have the divide so essentially all we

845
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,440
would need to do is call clamp and then

846
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,009
divide by the range right so we've got

847
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,840
the range

848
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:21,480
it's just a max minus the min that's how

849
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:23,819
you know big the thing is and really

850
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,829
then all we'd have to do is say that our

851
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:27,659
result is going you know we should

852
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:29,819
probably check for zero so assuming the

853
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:33,210
range is greater than zero we'll assume

854
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:34,559
that the result is zero otherwise if the

855
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,360
range is greater than zero then what

856
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,990
we'll do is we'll go ahead and do a

857
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,329
clamp zero to one of whatever that key

858
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,309
value is divided by the range right so

859
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:47,189
that's essentially going to normalize

860
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:50,490
the T value out to being in between the

861
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:52,320
max and the of them in there right oh

862
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,420
and I guess I got to subtract it in

863
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,939
front right so this bases me around the

864
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,279
min as I go from the min to the max I'll

865
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,200
keep reducing values between min and Max

866
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,730
right

867
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,620
I'm sorry between zero and range and

868
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:08,280
divide by the range changes it into a

869
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:10,769
zero one right there we go and so now

870
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,840
all I have to do is like do clamp 0 1

871
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:14,610
map to range and what that allows me to

872
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,260
do is just specify the min the T in the

873
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,880
Max and we know what those are right so

874
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,730
we just know that we've got the top

875
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,730
value we've got that camera relative

876
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:26,070
Brown P V and we've got the fade top end

877
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:29,780
Z there we go and here we do the same

878
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:35,850
thing it'll start at fade bottom start Z

879
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:38,519
and it will end at fade bottom and Z I

880
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:40,529
believe that should do it now this range

881
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:41,789
goes the other way but I think that

882
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,200
should be okay because it just means

883
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:46,199
that the range will be negative which

884
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,869
will invert the sense of this divide

885
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,668
which I think is fine and so I think

886
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:54,869
that that should give us you know

887
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:57,750
roughly what we want there mm-hmm well

888
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:59,940
we'll find out certainly so it looks

889
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,769
like we set our value perhaps a little

890
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,510
bit too high because those aren't faded

891
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:06,570
out yet either that or I've made some

892
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:09,240
egregious error let's see so if this if

893
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:12,660
fade start Z is a typical floor height

894
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:14,219
above does that actually mean that these

895
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:15,629
things are unaligned in some way it

896
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:19,230
looks like they are left I'd love to

897
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,970
work on that in a second and it looks

898
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:24,659
like our fade is going the wrong way why

899
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:27,329
is that the case top start Z is the min

900
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:32,129
and this is the

901
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:34,289
oh right so I forgot though this is the

902
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,820
alpha so we want it to basically be

903
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:38,550
higher as it gets

904
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,710
we want the inverted sense of this so I

905
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:44,280
could do one - which is a little bit

906
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:47,880
more easy to read right or I can flip

907
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,580
these two to basically give it the

908
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,280
inverse sense of the mapping right I

909
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:55,079
don't know which of those is like that's

910
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,820
just harder to read if you do it that

911
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,819
way so I don't know that that's great

912
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:02,639
you know what I mean I don't I don't

913
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:07,529
know if that's if that's that's really

914
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:12,420
what we want but yeah can school got a

915
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:19,019
bug in there though why do I have a bug

916
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:20,400
in there okay no I'm wrong I can't do

917
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:23,250
that because that will produce a

918
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,010
negative value right which we don't

919
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,599
actually want nevermind so we do want it

920
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,730
to be this sense we want it to produce

921
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,980
the clamped range and then we just want

922
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,619
to invert it because it's alpha and so

923
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,740
we we want to actually know that process

924
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,059
yeah I have to think about that there

925
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,609
might be a cleaner way to write that

926
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:44,099
though anyway so let's take a look here

927
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:45,840
let me see if I can push this back up

928
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,400
again now that we fixed our little bug

929
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,730
there or I guess we want them actually

930
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,590
to be lower I should say so those things

931
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,690
are they really that's how low they are

932
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:58,220
that seems odd to me I wonder if I've

933
00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:00,900
got a bug here or something like this

934
00:36:58,219 --> 00:37:04,969
because there's the fade top start Z

935
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,970
essentially we should we should always

936
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:15,259
ah duh the fade top NZ has to end at the

937
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:18,559
floor height because otherwise it'll be

938
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:21,130
partially visible yeah okay never mind

939
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:24,979
I'm just being stupid

940
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:26,749
so that's fine so let's take a look here

941
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:29,239
so there it goes it fades away as we

942
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:31,939
come up it comes back in so we may want

943
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:35,690
that to be a little bit further up where

944
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:37,778
it starts something like that so we may

945
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:41,059
actually want this to kind of clip out

946
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:43,458
something more like that I don't

947
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:45,499
actually know something like that

948
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:47,958
probably looks a little bit better I

949
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:49,639
don't understand why we're getting it so

950
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:51,318
early though I feel like our alignment

951
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,268
with the typical floor height is

952
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:56,028
currently not correct or something like

953
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:57,439
this so I feel like once we go now and

954
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:59,239
do this thing where we put this into the

955
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,708
world as a query call it'd be nice to

956
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,940
start to figure out what the Z values

957
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:04,399
are of some of these entities to figure

958
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:07,608
out why it's doing that the way that it

959
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,278
is what I would like to do here is I

960
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:13,489
would like to potentially allow us to go

961
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:17,208
up another level so we could kind of get

962
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:19,699
a few more in here but right now we

963
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:23,179
don't really have anything that would

964
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:25,639
allow us to do that because we only ever

965
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:27,198
allow you know two things stacked on

966
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:31,818
each other I wonder if there's some way

967
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:33,499
to quickly hack our little stupid world

968
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:35,449
making stuff here I wonder if there's

969
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:39,578
some way to quickly hack that to allow

970
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:42,469
us to do door up multiple times right

971
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:46,369
you know that kind of thing so it's got

972
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:49,729
random choice door up door down and so I

973
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:53,719
guess the thing here is door up through

974
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:56,689
door down true so the problem is we

975
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:59,389
don't allow it to freely pick whether it

976
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:02,568
does draw door up or door down so I

977
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:07,489
suppose if we did right if we were to do

978
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:09,369
that then what we could do is have you

979
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:12,259
know sort of up and down be chosen

980
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:16,099
separately which I feel like would be a

981
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:18,978
good thing to do something you know like

982
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:21,320
this does this make sense to everyone

983
00:39:18,978 --> 00:39:23,000
something that allows it to stack as

984
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,480
you know keep going up or keep going

985
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,940
down if you know as necessary I also

986
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,820
feel like at this point we should have

987
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:35,119
probably allowed it to make rooms that

988
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,730
kind of go that snake back on each other

989
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,719
but yeah so unfortunately at this point

990
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,789
I also don't really know we we're never

991
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,649
gonna necessarily get enough stacked on

992
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:48,500
each other here because it might never

993
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,740
create any such thing so we'd have to

994
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,119
kind of also do some stuff that would

995
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:54,439
would sort of create the case that we

996
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,130
want to test which at this point

997
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:00,650
unfortunately we're not doing so there's

998
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:05,090
a down that's good we can go down here

999
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:07,519
ooh what happened there I guess I've

1000
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:10,250
ended somewhere where we don't we didn't

1001
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,929
actually put a room on the bottom looks

1002
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,650
like we just walked down the stairwell

1003
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:19,699
into nothing that doesn't seem like a

1004
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,650
good idea is that because we're always

1005
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:24,409
assuming something about where the door

1006
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,970
is go either way this doesn't really

1007
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:28,670
help me what I need is a couple rooms

1008
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:32,139
stacked on top of each other not really

1009
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,139
sure how to do that quickly

1010
00:40:53,358 --> 00:41:06,380
so what happens when we create an up

1011
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:08,808
stair or a down stair right when we add

1012
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:12,289
a stair it does this ABS tile minus one

1013
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:13,609
or AB styles thing and what do we do

1014
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:17,269
here

1015
00:41:13,608 --> 00:41:19,068
if door direction okay so this is why we

1016
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:21,768
didn't actually update the door

1017
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:24,619
direction stuff right what we actually

1018
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:27,108
need to do is say all right which

1019
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:28,608
direction do we go in Z did we go down

1020
00:41:27,108 --> 00:41:31,429
or did we go up and then we need to

1021
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:39,528
actually subtract whichever one it is so

1022
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:43,669
if it's a door down right it's a door

1023
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:45,469
down that's three and if it's door up

1024
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:52,209
it's two so what we need to do is

1025
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:52,208
something more like this right I believe

1026
00:41:52,449 --> 00:42:00,348
and so doors down do that and doors up

1027
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:03,650
do this right this is some truly lousy

1028
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:04,969
code here but we're not supposed to be

1029
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,048
working on world building at the moment

1030
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:09,889
and so I feel like we kind of have to

1031
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:13,338
you know take the good with the bad

1032
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:15,798
there the other thing I could do is you

1033
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:17,478
know and I might do this the thing I

1034
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:23,798
might want to do is just just make less

1035
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:26,328
of these tiles right let's see here so

1036
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:28,458
instead of adding wall in fact you know

1037
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:35,059
what I'll do right now is I'll only add

1038
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:42,948
a wall if tile Y mod 2 and tile X come

1039
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:44,809
on let's take a look I want to cut down

1040
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:45,709
on the number of trees just because

1041
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,839
since we don't have an optimized

1042
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:50,328
renderer it kind of helps alright so if

1043
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:55,179
I walk up here of course it's hard to

1044
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:55,180
tell where the hex it is but yeah

1045
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:59,989
let's see here

1046
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:04,259
of course this doesn't this means you

1047
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:05,909
can kind of just walk through any where

1048
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,880
you want which I hadn't thought about

1049
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:12,059
beforehand but anyway all right so I can

1050
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,510
walk through here let's go ahead out

1051
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:17,159
here yeah so what I really need to do is

1052
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,680
I need to just bias this thing so it

1053
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:22,440
will build a few things on top of each

1054
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:26,219
other for us I'm not sure exactly how to

1055
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:29,099
do that because we need to test our are

1056
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:31,589
sort of lower or below

1057
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:33,179
sort of our code for things below us and

1058
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,650
we don't seem to be it doesn't seem to

1059
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:37,139
have randomly unfortunately generated

1060
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,869
anything that had a lot of things on the

1061
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:43,049
same on the same stack so let's take a

1062
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:45,920
look what can I do to force that to

1063
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:48,690
happen I guess what I could do is say

1064
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,460
okay we can bias it so it just keeps

1065
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,840
creating doors up and down or something

1066
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,250
like that and in order to do that we

1067
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,530
just have to have a way of adding a

1068
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,139
stairwell that doesn't overlap the same

1069
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,150
stairwell so that you can keep on using

1070
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,859
them although maybe you can just make

1071
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:06,300
them all be in the same place and maybe

1072
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,579
that just works because the Z handling I

1073
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,740
don't know let's try it it's hard to say

1074
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,389
what I could do is say door direction is

1075
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:13,859
always gonna be equal to three so it

1076
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:16,289
just always goes down there's nothing

1077
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,010
else that will ever happen that's all

1078
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:27,329
that's gonna oh my god what have I done

1079
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:32,370
all right well that's that's interesting

1080
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:36,539
to say the least I'm a little confused

1081
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,889
as to why there are so many levels and

1082
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,529
what's actually it looks like they're

1083
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:44,039
crossing over some threshold where we've

1084
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:45,660
got a flip bug there so this it looks

1085
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,599
like some fun something that would be

1086
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:52,049
good to debug although my first question

1087
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,719
is how are there so many entities do we

1088
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:57,480
take all the entities in Z I thought we

1089
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,769
were only doing a limited Z slice so how

1090
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,289
did all these entities get in there

1091
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:03,090
that's that's a bug like somebody's got

1092
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:05,639
to fix that and then the other problem

1093
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:08,820
is why are none of them fading out so

1094
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:13,679
something is is is not right

1095
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:16,640
all right so what's going on we've got

1096
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,409
if you're less than fade bottom start Z

1097
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,500
right which is which is two typical

1098
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:25,579
heights down then I want to map you in

1099
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:31,349
that range we're gonna be subtracted

1100
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:34,019
let's see so I feel like I feel like

1101
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:35,460
that should have worked so I don't

1102
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:38,400
understand why that alpha isn't getting

1103
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,840
set properly that said the more weird

1104
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,240
thing to me is just why we're getting

1105
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:46,740
such a such a strange amount we're

1106
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:48,569
getting so many that it actually goes

1107
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:51,989
down into nothing and and flips around

1108
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:53,940
right you can see how that goes so we

1109
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:56,939
only want like a couple levels here and

1110
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,070
I feel like the sim region should never

1111
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,730
have picked up those guys in the query

1112
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:06,059
right so if we come in here and you take

1113
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:07,829
a look at when it does the chunk Z min

1114
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:09,809
chunky you know it doesn't it'll loop

1115
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:12,150
serve the chunk Z's how are we getting

1116
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:14,250
all of these entities I don't get it how

1117
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,320
are they how are we ever finding

1118
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,369
entities that are that low and bringing

1119
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:23,210
them into the sim region so that they

1120
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:23,210
get rendered right I don't get it to me

1121
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:27,440
that makes no sense to me whatsoever

1122
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:35,719
so I want to see what's going on there

1123
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,720
because that's just bizarre

1124
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,870
that's just super super super bizarre

1125
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,369
so that's thing one to check let's let's

1126
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:48,029
just check that now let's take a look at

1127
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:52,469
begin sim when we come in here what does

1128
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:57,350
it think the Z range actually is am i

1129
00:46:52,469 --> 00:47:00,389
doing something that would suggest oh

1130
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:03,719
you know what else I got to do I hate to

1131
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:06,239
do this because this will be super slow

1132
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:09,449
because we run optimized at the moment

1133
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,259
but let's turn off that Oh to switch so

1134
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:13,528
that I can step through the code

1135
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:17,829
properly okay

1136
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:25,059
you made that super P all right so let's

1137
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:27,670
take a look at this here stepping

1138
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:30,430
through so let's take a look at our to

1139
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:31,749
our our our bounds here right our min

1140
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:36,460
chunk P I think we started 10 minutes

1141
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:46,028
late today so we'll go ahead and go up

1142
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:51,130
to them okay that's a pretty insane

1143
00:47:46,028 --> 00:47:55,719
range so I guess we actually did grab a

1144
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:58,539
huge number of chunks these Y is our sim

1145
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:01,989
region so huge is it cuz of the max

1146
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:04,239
entity radius I think it must be I think

1147
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:07,539
it must be so what's the end the max

1148
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:09,880
entity velocity so that's the thing is

1149
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:12,910
we're basically grabbing a huge chunk of

1150
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,829
Z because of that max entity velocity so

1151
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:16,719
I wonder if that's gonna have to do

1152
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:18,999
that's probably got to be something that

1153
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,829
we special case there well that was a

1154
00:48:18,998 --> 00:48:23,679
good thing to know cuz I did we had no

1155
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:26,829
idea that that was happening so yeah so

1156
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:29,108
this is a bit of a problem the updatable

1157
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:31,900
bounds thing and the safety margin Z

1158
00:48:29,108 --> 00:48:33,728
thing right of one I think we probably

1159
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:37,630
want to do a thing here where we're

1160
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:39,968
we're always doing just just nothing

1161
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:41,619
right there's no there's no entity

1162
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:43,929
radius stuff that's happening there for

1163
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:45,729
now at least we'll see if we can get

1164
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:49,899
away with that but that seems more

1165
00:48:45,728 --> 00:48:51,218
likely not to me all right so at least

1166
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,619
now there's a little bit less but

1167
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:55,059
there's still quite a bit and so I'm

1168
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:57,640
wondering if maybe something else here

1169
00:48:55,059 --> 00:49:00,249
is still too conservative so let's take

1170
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:03,068
a look we've got the bounds we've got

1171
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:07,118
the safety margin and Z which is adding

1172
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:10,170
up and down which is just I don't know

1173
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,369
if 1.0 it was a very same thing for it

1174
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:16,180
but let's see Oh

1175
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:18,430
update safety margin is still again yeah

1176
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:21,848
oh no but we're not using that we're not

1177
00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:23,289
using that for Z so if we don't add

1178
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:25,300
anything here and we all

1179
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:26,920
we add one here then I feel like our Z

1180
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,650
bound shouldn't be that big but let's

1181
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,200
find out what they actually are because

1182
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,420
maybe I'm wrong about that so what's our

1183
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:38,859
initial query size let's start with that

1184
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:41,079
right what is the initial size and so

1185
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:48,250
let's check the bounds let's see what it

1186
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:53,529
is min max right so the max Z is 15 and

1187
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:55,960
the min Z is negative 15 again that just

1188
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:58,900
seems crazy so what's going on here is

1189
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,000
that something from this who is who is

1190
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,800
making that decision sim bounds

1191
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,769
expansion yeah so this is just this is

1192
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,450
just totally bogus again so basically we

1193
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,519
just never were doing anything sensible

1194
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:11,949
a Z here at all like we clearly just

1195
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,409
threw that code in just completely

1196
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:16,809
ad-hoc without really thinking about

1197
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:18,579
what we want to do and in terms of

1198
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:20,739
symbols expansion I don't think we even

1199
00:50:18,579 --> 00:50:22,900
want any expansion in Z do we we just

1200
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:25,659
want the level that we're at and we want

1201
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,760
the safety margin expansions to handle

1202
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:29,589
we want the sim region to handle that

1203
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,570
expansion for us basically like we don't

1204
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:34,030
want to add any anything to that I don't

1205
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,970
think that would be my guess anyway

1206
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:38,530
right of course that didn't grab

1207
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:42,339
anything which is a little bit odd

1208
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:44,500
so symbols expansion camera bounds and

1209
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:47,680
mirrors

1210
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:49,809
which we also don't know what what that

1211
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,719
actually is just a lot of things that

1212
00:50:49,809 --> 00:50:55,210
were unspecified here okay so that's got

1213
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,579
no Z so then we have the symbols

1214
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:00,010
expansion which we don't really want to

1215
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:06,279
do anything with although later we may

1216
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:11,980
want to do do we want to simulate upper

1217
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:15,370
floors etc so then we come in here we

1218
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:18,159
won't add anything here we will add 1.0

1219
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:20,559
on either and for the safety margin but

1220
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,329
I don't actually know I'm just not sure

1221
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,539
why that wouldn't why that isn't picking

1222
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:26,799
anything up so I wonder if we are again

1223
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:28,900
we having some kind of a stratification

1224
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,900
problem in terms of what's included

1225
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:34,930
there so let me go ahead and and and and

1226
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:37,090
say that we do one the typical floor

1227
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:40,329
height in either direction but

1228
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:45,100
that's it right and let's see what that

1229
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:48,219
gets us so that's a little more sensible

1230
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:50,319
certainly right let me go ahead and we

1231
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:55,259
can we can switch back to to our

1232
00:51:50,320 --> 00:52:00,160
optimized build now our Oh to build

1233
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:03,190
still a completely unbiased compiler not

1234
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,619
doing crazy stuff so there we go in

1235
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:08,050
terms of that are fading out there is

1236
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:09,969
not working properly either I think I've

1237
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:11,530
got like a weird bug in my clamp map to

1238
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:15,549
range I think I just wrote it poorly or

1239
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:17,620
something like this I want to see I feel

1240
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:19,930
like that was a that didn't work the way

1241
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:23,170
I expect it to so let's take a look what

1242
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:25,359
I was doing here so in clamped map to

1243
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,519
range I figure out what the range is by

1244
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:30,130
taking the max and min and then I

1245
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:32,800
subtract them in from it and divide by

1246
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:35,320
it I feel like that ah that's the

1247
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,550
problem right there we can't check if

1248
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,800
it's greater than zero because we want

1249
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:40,690
to be able to support negatives so that

1250
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,450
was why I was having a problem right you

1251
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,460
saw how that worked right that was just

1252
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:47,019
that was just me being stupid cuz I was

1253
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,159
thinking like oh the range has to be

1254
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:49,150
greater than zero but doesn't have to be

1255
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:51,549
greater than zero because we want to be

1256
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,930
able to support negative ranges so that

1257
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,580
the set still works out right so that

1258
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:57,519
code that we'd written before was

1259
00:52:54,579 --> 00:53:01,559
actually probably correct and then and

1260
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:04,150
we were just stupid right so you

1261
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:08,889
remember I thought this should work and

1262
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:11,530
it didn't right always assume there's a

1263
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:13,960
bug me and Chris Tucker used to say that

1264
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:16,210
all the time especially we're working

1265
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,460
with physics so there's the fade-out

1266
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:20,230
working properly at the top level now

1267
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,340
using the correct code order angle that

1268
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,679
I thought should have worked and I

1269
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,450
should have stuck by my guns and then

1270
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:29,289
this guy wants to do starting at the

1271
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:30,879
start Z and fading at the end Z which i

1272
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:33,159
think is exactly what we do want him to

1273
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,710
do so let's see if we can get that

1274
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:38,109
working now properly it looks like that

1275
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:40,269
still just disappears now that could

1276
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:44,620
because the sim region isn't picking up

1277
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:47,920
someone far enough down right and so

1278
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:50,659
that I think is something we may again

1279
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,630
may want to sort of take a look at here

1280
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:56,809
so if we do that the camera but those

1281
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:59,630
camera bounds that we can write where's

1282
00:53:56,809 --> 00:54:01,690
the camera bounds and meters what we

1283
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:04,430
want to do here is say well okay

1284
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:06,409
actually the min we want to look kind of

1285
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:09,649
below where the camera is a little bit

1286
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:11,899
so we want to do like negative 2.0 times

1287
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:15,139
typical floor height right or something

1288
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,420
like that that's we want to look maybe

1289
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:18,769
two floors below possibly even three

1290
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,740
floors below I don't know what that

1291
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:26,000
number is going to be right and then we

1292
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:28,309
want to look you know maybe one one four

1293
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,059
above something like that and then we

1294
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:33,170
can get rid of that that expansion thing

1295
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:35,779
cuz cuz we don't really want to ever

1296
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:36,380
expand probably in Z any more than we

1297
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,500
have to

1298
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:43,460
right so let's take a look here

1299
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:47,719
that's oops that's gamestate and then

1300
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:52,099
we've got here so that's a little more

1301
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:55,219
sensible although does not look like I

1302
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:59,289
did that properly somehow somehow this

1303
00:54:55,219 --> 00:55:01,879
is correct right camber bounds oh no

1304
00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:06,860
rectangle Center dim it's not a min/max

1305
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:09,099
rectangle well in that case we have to

1306
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,840
do this a little bit more gently right

1307
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:13,909
but I guess I could just not do it janky

1308
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,829
I could still do it right by just doing

1309
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:17,839
it this way right I can just do it that

1310
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:20,360
way when the camera bounded meters comes

1311
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:24,650
back I'll just say I'll just set the

1312
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:26,059
Minzy and Mac Z myself here so that I

1313
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,880
can still set it to negative three

1314
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:31,429
floors down and one floor up something

1315
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,440
like that right and that way I don't

1316
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:36,319
have to worry about setting it gym wise

1317
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:41,269
so that seems fine I'm totally fine with

1318
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:50,000
that all right so now that we've got

1319
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:52,280
this we're fading the wrong way and so

1320
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,610
that is again the same problem that we

1321
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,610
had the first time I guess which is

1322
00:55:59,019 --> 00:56:03,710
which is again it's alpha so even though

1323
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:04,109
this is the way that we would want to

1324
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,269
write it

1325
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,920
going from the start to the end since we

1326
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:09,840
wanted inverted we would invert it this

1327
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,309
way right and again I'm not sure that

1328
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,809
that's the best way to braid it I feel

1329
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:15,269
like we want to write it with the 1.0

1330
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:17,009
but I don't know hard to say it does

1331
00:56:15,269 --> 00:56:18,630
introduce some extra stuff there that

1332
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:21,480
doesn't actually need to happen so it's

1333
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:23,579
unclear if that's what we want but

1334
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,740
anyway now we've kind of got it working

1335
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:28,710
the way that we we wanted it to work

1336
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:30,809
where we can kind of fade in on either

1337
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,610
side right but with the stairwell

1338
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:34,500
stacked on top of each other they're

1339
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,700
creating sort of that problem where the

1340
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,010
stairwells

1341
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:39,419
I'm colliding with one so I can't walk

1342
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:41,700
down the other one if that makes sense

1343
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:45,150
so I want to do a thing where we stagger

1344
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:46,469
the stairwell location it looks like

1345
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,570
we're just about out of time so I'm just

1346
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:51,089
going to do that I'm gonna stagger that

1347
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:59,120
stairwell location though here what I'm

1348
00:56:51,090 --> 00:57:04,470
gonna do is say if you know if AB style

1349
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:09,420
Z is you know is even or odd right if AB

1350
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:14,849
style is the mod 2 and this right put

1351
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:19,230
the stairwell there or if AB style Z if

1352
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:23,789
not AB salamati and M tile equals you

1353
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:27,510
know four or something don't try this at

1354
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:30,239
home kids so there you can see again

1355
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:32,160
more of the kind of getting more of that

1356
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,529
that's sort of back and forth in that we

1357
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,869
want of course these annoying fellows

1358
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:39,650
are blocking my region let's go through

1359
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:39,650
here there we go

1360
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:49,809
see here come down so what we can see

1361
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:51,970
too is there's kind of another thing

1362
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:53,969
that I haven't talked about we're not

1363
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:56,289
leaving the familiars on the correct

1364
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:57,819
levels either like we've got we've got a

1365
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:59,380
bunch of things now that this uncovers

1366
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,570
which is perfect because this is exactly

1367
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:04,630
where I wanted to get to but you can

1368
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:06,730
also see that our our scaling is not

1369
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:08,710
correct which is another place I wanted

1370
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,820
to get to and I wasn't sure when it was

1371
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:13,000
gonna happen but you can kind of see it

1372
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,370
happening now so you see how we kind of

1373
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,289
have a weird effect where things seem to

1374
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:19,210
move more quickly when they're in the

1375
00:58:17,289 --> 00:58:22,239
distance in terms of zooming in and out

1376
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:24,190
right and that's because we haven't

1377
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:27,519
actually talked about how to correctly

1378
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:29,769
handle perspective in any way right and

1379
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,619
so this uncovers a bunch of things we

1380
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:34,239
want to work on which is great because I

1381
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:35,559
feel like this is finally getting us

1382
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,750
into the point where we can really nail

1383
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:39,250
Z down which is something that was one

1384
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:41,019
of the probably the biggest things on

1385
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,599
our to-do list because it affects

1386
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:46,239
everything so yeah so I'm pretty excited

1387
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,769
about this this is quite good I think

1388
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,829
this will get us into a good place so

1389
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:52,809
yeah I feel like we're in good shape

1390
00:58:50,829 --> 00:58:55,929
here I feel like we're in good shape

1391
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:58,869
here and again so what's interesting

1392
00:58:55,929 --> 00:59:01,419
just to head off at the pass in case no

1393
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:03,609
one answers this question you notice the

1394
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,559
familiar and the guy move with us in Z

1395
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:07,390
that's because we don't do ground

1396
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:08,679
handling yet remember we don't we

1397
00:59:07,389 --> 00:59:10,000
haven't done our ground helicopter so I

1398
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:13,119
believe what's actually happening is as

1399
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,389
we move down because the camera Z level

1400
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:19,690
was considered where the ground was they

1401
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:23,949
fall and as we move the ground down they

1402
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:25,150
basically fall with it right so yeah but

1403
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:26,559
anyway so we're in a great place to

1404
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:28,059
start working on all this stuff this is

1405
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,130
exactly where I wanted to get to very

1406
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:31,989
happy about this because now we can sort

1407
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:34,059
of clean up all of the Z stuff properly

1408
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:35,500
I'm very very happy about that we'll get

1409
00:59:34,059 --> 00:59:37,539
the ground handling working this disc is

1410
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,250
this great stuff to work on this kind of

1411
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:40,779
opens up all of the problem areas we're

1412
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:43,300
finally in a place where we can solidify

1413
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,130
them out and that'll be great once we

1414
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,800
have Z checked off I think we're in such

1415
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:50,800
a great position in terms of like engine

1416
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,200
unknowns basically so so I'm gonna go

1417
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,420
ahead and say oh it's time for the QA

1418
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:55,949
and please go ahead and prefix your

1419
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,099
questions with

1420
00:59:55,949 --> 01:00:08,269
q : so I will see them and pry it please

1421
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:08,269
try to keep them on topic okay

1422
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:22,269
why were some of the trees upside down

1423
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,060
so the reason some of the trees were

1424
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:29,170
upside down is because we haven't really

1425
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:31,380
done perspective yet and I want to kind

1426
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:34,599
of avoid talking about it too much

1427
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,710
because like basically that like I said

1428
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:37,960
that's one of the things that I wanted

1429
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:40,599
to actually talk about for real is how

1430
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:43,510
to do that transform so we have this Z

1431
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:44,619
fudge value right and this is e fudge

1432
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:47,050
value which is the thing we were using

1433
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:49,000
to multiply the x and y positions of

1434
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:50,470
people on the screen so that they would

1435
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,090
appear to get bigger and smaller as they

1436
01:00:50,469 --> 01:00:54,609
moved closer and further from the camera

1437
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:56,620
but we didn't actually do any work to

1438
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:59,170
make sure that it was actually doing

1439
01:00:56,619 --> 01:01:01,269
proper perspective computation which

1440
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:04,900
means it's just basically a completely

1441
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:07,360
bogus hack right so what happens as you

1442
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:10,809
can see here whenever you get something

1443
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:14,550
whose Z value is high enough that's

1444
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:17,230
negatively high enough so like negative

1445
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:19,630
what's it's negative 1 over point zero

1446
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:21,550
zero one five this expression will

1447
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:23,800
become negative and once it's negative

1448
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:25,330
multiplying by a negative will flip

1449
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:29,200
everything around you'll basically

1450
01:01:25,329 --> 01:01:30,730
mirror it right and so well mirror it's

1451
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,789
the wrong word it mirrors it on two axis

1452
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:35,740
but it'll flip it around right and so

1453
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:37,929
basically what you're doing there is

1454
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:39,609
because this is not a real perspective

1455
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:40,779
if this is real perspective real

1456
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:44,050
perspective thing is actually divided

1457
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:45,400
right and so it can never flip because

1458
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,570
it just as things get further and

1459
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,990
further away this gets smaller and

1460
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:53,019
smaller and smaller right but we don't

1461
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:56,649
have that we have a multi multiply thing

1462
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:58,210
here and so they flip so this to do

1463
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:00,190
figure out exactly how Z base X Y is

1464
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:01,329
place which is our work to do that to do

1465
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,730
what we need to do is introduce a real

1466
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:05,349
perspective divide there which isn't

1467
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:06,579
hard to do but we have to talk about it

1468
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:09,250
on the blackboard first that everyone

1469
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:11,279
understands what I'm doing if that makes

1470
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,280
sense

1471
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:22,460
are the head and body entities off to

1472
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:25,550
the side supposed to scale with the main

1473
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:33,170
character so they are moving because the

1474
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:35,210
Z so if you remember right so if you

1475
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,800
remember how the ground stuff was we

1476
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,539
kind of left it it was the whole reason

1477
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,660
we went in to do the rendering stuff is

1478
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:44,960
to kind of get Z straightened out so do

1479
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:48,170
you see how this ground 0 nonsense is

1480
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,699
happening at the moment right and you

1481
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:51,740
kind of get this like thing where we

1482
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:53,989
take a spatial partition and get where

1483
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:56,059
the ground is and do this sort of other

1484
01:02:53,989 --> 01:02:57,799
nonsense where we try to figure out like

1485
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:59,179
whether or not things were Z's aborted I

1486
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,240
believe what's happening with those

1487
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:05,659
entities is that they are actually just

1488
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:08,629
being treated as you kind of move down I

1489
01:03:05,659 --> 01:03:14,420
believe they're being treated as if the

1490
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:17,960
I believe they're being treated as if

1491
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:19,220
that ground is like coming out from

1492
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,570
under them if that makes sense I don't

1493
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:24,379
actually know that that's true in fact

1494
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:25,910
we could actually test this code is just

1495
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,019
so janky and not finished that I'm not

1496
01:03:25,909 --> 01:03:28,069
actually sure exactly what's happening

1497
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:29,269
here but I can pretty much guarantee you

1498
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:35,330
it's a bug

1499
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:40,449
let me see PC equals ground GPAs equals

1500
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:40,449
0 do flag z supported

1501
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:51,409
can overlap so I also don't know I

1502
01:03:49,338 --> 01:03:57,858
suspect that it's entirely because of

1503
01:03:51,409 --> 01:03:59,838
this ground value and the can overlap if

1504
01:03:57,858 --> 01:04:01,730
the region if the mover is not a region

1505
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:06,469
of the reason the stairwell is true so

1506
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:11,539
I'm not a hundred percent certain why

1507
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:12,799
they are doing that yet but I believe

1508
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:15,920
it's because they're actually moving

1509
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,660
with the camera not which is you know

1510
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,400
obviously not correct but it's something

1511
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:21,079
that we haven't really start finish tan

1512
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:31,820
dling in here so I'm not sure exactly

1513
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:32,929
where that bug is per se right let's

1514
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:34,480
think about this for a second because

1515
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:39,829
it's kind of interesting

1516
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:43,159
okay ground plus equals empty PZ minus

1517
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:48,819
ground G point so that's wherever that

1518
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:51,980
ground is yeah is set to Z supported

1519
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:55,550
system ax equal to ground it's going to

1520
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:59,539
set them back to where the ground is so

1521
01:04:55,550 --> 01:05:02,930
I guess what I'd like to test first as a

1522
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:09,170
way of exactly what is broken in the

1523
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:14,118
same region thing is that where is

1524
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:18,349
ensign I want to see what happens when

1525
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:23,349
you do not update the camera Z so if we

1526
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:23,349
do you know this sort of thing

1527
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:35,019
so if we don't update the camera Z and

1528
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:38,650
instead we just move down right you can

1529
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:43,869
see that it they correctly stay up where

1530
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:45,220
they were right and so again the reason

1531
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:47,319
why I think that's happening is because

1532
01:05:45,219 --> 01:05:49,689
the ground is currently based on this

1533
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,680
weird we don't have a solid notion for

1534
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,820
what's supposed to be happening with the

1535
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:54,549
ground and I think they just basically

1536
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,890
fall down to wherever the camera is they

1537
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:58,450
land on the camera Z height except so

1538
01:05:56,889 --> 01:06:00,670
you could think of it as so we just need

1539
01:05:58,449 --> 01:06:02,639
to start we need to like button up the

1540
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:04,450
Z's stuff and then we'd be fine I think

1541
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,869
so I think that's really all that's

1542
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:06,869
happening

1543
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,050
what is Z fighting and is it something

1544
01:06:21,429 --> 01:06:28,059
that you have to worry about in a game

1545
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:35,680
like this I can I can show you what Z

1546
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:37,659
fighting is so Z fighting is a it's a

1547
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:42,190
bit of a large topic but I'll try to

1548
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:43,389
give you what the idea is and the short

1549
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:45,190
answer is no we don't have to worry

1550
01:06:43,389 --> 01:06:55,269
about it but I'll explain you what it is

1551
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:59,530
anyway okay so Z fighting is about depth

1552
01:06:55,269 --> 01:07:00,759
buffers if you don't have a depth buffer

1553
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:05,140
you're probably not going to have Z

1554
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:07,270
fighting you could have Z fighting in

1555
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:09,190
another way which I'll touch on briefly

1556
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:10,509
but I'll talk about this is the one that

1557
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:12,250
you're normally going to see so I'll

1558
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,200
talk about how you can have it without Z

1559
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:18,010
depth buffers I'll talk about it without

1560
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:20,019
depth buffers in a second after I give

1561
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:23,650
you what the idea is first so let's talk

1562
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:25,509
about with def buffers so normally if

1563
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:27,000
you're doing if you're not doing a 2-d

1564
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:29,260
game you're doing a 3d game and

1565
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,079
presumably you're doing any kind of

1566
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:35,020
typical 3d game which can't perfectly

1567
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:37,869
figure out a draw order then what

1568
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:40,059
happens is you rely on a thing called

1569
01:07:37,869 --> 01:07:42,010
the depth buffer to figure out what is

1570
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:44,320
called hidden surface removal right in

1571
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:47,020
the old days and what that means is you

1572
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:50,410
can imagine if I had something like a

1573
01:07:47,019 --> 01:07:52,570
very simple object I just have two cubes

1574
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:53,649
maybe there or you could think of them

1575
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:56,619
as something more complicated like two

1576
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:58,599
legs of a character right and one of

1577
01:07:56,619 --> 01:08:01,630
them is closer to the camera than the

1578
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:04,359
other right and so when I am to draw

1579
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:07,750
these cubes I always want to draw this

1580
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:09,909
cube last right I want to draw this cube

1581
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:12,039
first so that this region the place

1582
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:14,409
where they overlap is filled by the

1583
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:16,810
colors that come from this cube not this

1584
01:08:14,409 --> 01:08:21,568
cube right so if this is a and this is B

1585
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:24,279
the correct draw order is B then a right

1586
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:26,500
but the problem is in three dimensions

1587
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:28,150
it's hard to know that because these

1588
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,649
could be complex objects that you know

1589
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:30,789
don't have a necessary sort or like

1590
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:32,710
maybe part of this odd

1591
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:35,048
is behind this object it's a curved

1592
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:37,180
thing that also exists kind of behind

1593
01:08:35,048 --> 01:08:39,939
here so then there's no drawer it's like

1594
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:42,369
draw this part of a and then this part

1595
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:45,279
of a and B gum I mean I'm sorry draw

1596
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:46,779
this part of a then this part of B then

1597
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,159
this part of a or something like that to

1598
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:48,639
get the drawer to right you know what

1599
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,979
I'm saying

1600
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,569
it gets very complicated to give you a

1601
01:08:50,979 --> 01:08:57,699
better maybe a better illustration

1602
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:59,530
suppose that I had a doughnut right and

1603
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:01,659
then something a cube inside a doughnut

1604
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:03,608
right so that's the drawing thing and

1605
01:09:01,659 --> 01:09:05,199
we're looking at it from here so if

1606
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:08,140
we're doing that we've got sort of like

1607
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:10,179
a cube like shape in the middle we've

1608
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:12,400
got this sort of doughnut shape coming

1609
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,869
around it like so and then maybe the

1610
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,789
cube sticks out the bottom a little bit

1611
01:09:13,869 --> 01:09:17,559
as well right and so if you think about

1612
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:19,600
this the draw order if this is a and

1613
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,760
this is B there is no draw order because

1614
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:26,500
this bottom part there's re this back

1615
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:29,859
part this part right of a it needs to be

1616
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,960
this part first then this thing right

1617
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:34,210
this second and then this part third

1618
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,890
right in order to make sure that they

1619
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:37,569
occlude each other properly so that you

1620
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:38,369
don't see things that you shouldn't see

1621
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:40,539
right

1622
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:42,338
so hopefully that just gave you some

1623
01:09:40,539 --> 01:09:43,960
idea of it's like it's complicated if

1624
01:09:42,338 --> 01:09:45,818
you want to figure out a sorter so what

1625
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,260
you typically do in 3d graphics is you

1626
01:09:45,819 --> 01:09:49,450
don't try to solve this problem

1627
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:51,100
instead you instead of solving it per

1628
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:52,389
object which is kind of what we're

1629
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,190
talking about here which would require

1630
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:56,470
you to break objects up into pieces and

1631
01:09:54,189 --> 01:10:00,279
sort the pieces and stuff like that you

1632
01:09:56,470 --> 01:10:02,890
handle it per pixel right because you

1633
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:05,139
know that every pixel right for any

1634
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:06,970
individual pixel we know there is one

1635
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:10,329
sort order like a then B then whatever

1636
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:11,800
right and furthermore at each pixel we

1637
01:10:10,329 --> 01:10:13,119
can do something which makes it so that

1638
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,800
we don't have to draw them in order we

1639
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,619
just need to know when we when we come

1640
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,690
to a particular thing we just need to

1641
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:21,789
know which whether it should replace the

1642
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:23,139
thing that was there or not right and so

1643
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:26,739
if you think about it let's say that we

1644
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:29,500
have a draw order of B than a well if we

1645
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:31,210
look at it at a pixel basis right in

1646
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:33,430
fact let's go back to here so we've got

1647
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:38,439
you know we've got a as our as our tube

1648
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:41,289
and B is our cube thing right so we've

1649
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:44,149
got a draw order of a B right if we take

1650
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:45,500
a pixel that's right here right

1651
01:10:44,149 --> 01:10:47,539
then what's gonna happen is a is gonna

1652
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,090
draw and it's gonna fill it in right so

1653
01:10:47,539 --> 01:10:53,210
you know we have what's the pixel here

1654
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:55,610
right what's happening to pixel and this

1655
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:58,130
is in an a/b draw order and then we have

1656
01:10:55,609 --> 01:11:00,649
the pixel here in the be a draw order so

1657
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:02,390
whichever way the app submits them if it

1658
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:05,359
draws a then B what's gonna happen is a

1659
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:07,340
is gonna be there than it right then it

1660
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:08,059
draws B I shouldn't I shouldn't do this

1661
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:09,739
is face all right

1662
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:12,920
that's no I should do I should do this

1663
01:11:09,738 --> 01:11:15,289
first and then second right so the first

1664
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:18,500
thing this drawing is a so we look at a

1665
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:20,420
and we get an A right the second thing

1666
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:23,359
that's drawn is B and now what we want

1667
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:27,440
to do is know that we should not replace

1668
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:29,299
B we should not replace a with because B

1669
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,549
is behind a right we want to stay with a

1670
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:33,500
and then in the other draw order what we

1671
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:35,449
would do is we draw B first and then

1672
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:38,600
when a comes we do want to replace B

1673
01:11:35,448 --> 01:11:40,729
with a for this pixel right does that

1674
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,909
make sense and the way that we do that

1675
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:45,619
is with every pixel we we store a depth

1676
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:47,599
information that's what a depth buffer

1677
01:11:45,619 --> 01:11:52,698
is and the depth of information is

1678
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:59,780
basically saying how far away right was

1679
01:11:52,698 --> 01:12:02,809
the current occupant of the pixel right

1680
01:11:59,779 --> 01:12:05,869
so what we do is we draw a in here and

1681
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:08,270
we say oh a was you know 1.2 meters away

1682
01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:11,719
from the guy or whatever right then we

1683
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:13,190
draw B in here and we say well B is 3

1684
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:15,140
meters away from the guy and it's like

1685
01:12:13,189 --> 01:12:18,049
oh well you know what we don't actually

1686
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:20,210
want to do that because this is a closer

1687
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:22,489
value so we keep the one that we had

1688
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:24,649
whereas here we say oh it's 3 meters

1689
01:12:22,488 --> 01:12:28,488
away then we draw a and we go oh okay

1690
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:29,988
he's 1.2 meters away that's closer so a

1691
01:12:28,488 --> 01:12:33,349
depth buffer is basically a thing that

1692
01:12:29,988 --> 01:12:36,678
remembers how far away the thing was

1693
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:38,570
that filled the pixel we're on so that

1694
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:40,100
we know whether to replace it with a new

1695
01:12:38,569 --> 01:12:42,319
pixel when it comes in and you can see

1696
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:44,750
why this works now for a on top of

1697
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:47,929
itself as well right if I have you know

1698
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:50,260
a is a tube right but I'm looking at it

1699
01:12:47,929 --> 01:12:53,480
so obliquely that the tube kind of

1700
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:54,710
obscures itself right well it doesn't

1701
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:56,119
matter what's in here it's just it's

1702
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:57,269
whatever part of a you know if there's

1703
01:12:56,119 --> 01:12:58,649
polygons back here

1704
01:12:57,269 --> 01:13:00,418
polygons up here and there drawing on

1705
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:02,519
top of each other all we need to know is

1706
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:04,979
what the color value would be here and

1707
01:13:02,519 --> 01:13:06,628
what the depth value would be here we

1708
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:08,219
compare that with what exists and we

1709
01:13:06,628 --> 01:13:11,818
replace the color value if the depth

1710
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:14,489
value is is further away right that's

1711
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:15,899
all we have to do so hopefully does that

1712
01:13:14,488 --> 01:13:17,038
make some sense I hope that makes some

1713
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:18,539
sense of people it's a very simple

1714
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:19,948
scheme but just remember how far away

1715
01:13:18,538 --> 01:13:22,858
things are so we know whether replace it

1716
01:13:19,948 --> 01:13:26,219
with new things that come in okay what

1717
01:13:22,859 --> 01:13:29,159
z-fighting is is when this computation

1718
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:30,510
is imprecise okay because it would

1719
01:13:29,158 --> 01:13:32,158
always work what I just said would

1720
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:38,668
always work right there's no reason that

1721
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:42,418
would ever not work right in conceptual

1722
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:44,038
math but math is not done conceptually

1723
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:47,068
in a computer it's done with floating

1724
01:13:44,038 --> 01:13:49,528
point values and the problem is what

1725
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:53,699
happens when two surfaces are

1726
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:55,589
sufficiently far from the camera such

1727
01:13:53,698 --> 01:13:57,868
that the floating point precision that

1728
01:13:55,588 --> 01:14:00,179
is representing their distance is no

1729
01:13:57,868 --> 01:14:02,639
longer able to distinguish between the

1730
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:04,168
two right I remember we talked about

1731
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,538
floating-point precision we talked about

1732
01:14:04,168 --> 01:14:09,118
it many times on the stream so okay

1733
01:14:06,538 --> 01:14:10,768
we've got a Z value let's say right now

1734
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:14,608
we've got two things that are very close

1735
01:14:10,769 --> 01:14:16,409
together right they're so close together

1736
01:14:14,609 --> 01:14:18,479
right now but in fact there's just a

1737
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:20,578
small bit of mantissa right let's say

1738
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,499
there's like two bits or something of

1739
01:14:20,578 --> 01:14:23,849
mantissa that's that's actually

1740
01:14:22,498 --> 01:14:26,878
distinguishing between the two of these

1741
01:14:23,849 --> 01:14:28,949
as the camera moves further away so

1742
01:14:26,878 --> 01:14:31,979
these objects kind of move further back

1743
01:14:28,948 --> 01:14:33,538
right it becomes only one bit that's

1744
01:14:31,979 --> 01:14:36,749
distinguishing them and eventually it's

1745
01:14:33,538 --> 01:14:38,518
zero bits and when it becomes zero bits

1746
01:14:36,748 --> 01:14:40,618
these both these are both essentially

1747
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:43,199
mapping to the same z distance from the

1748
01:14:40,618 --> 01:14:45,568
camera in floating point right and to be

1749
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:47,098
fair does this really happen often in

1750
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:48,899
floating point not so much what's

1751
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:50,788
actually happening here often times is

1752
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:52,289
it's not a full 32-bit floating point

1753
01:14:50,788 --> 01:14:54,719
value when you get z-fighting it's

1754
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:57,618
oftentimes like a 16-bit approximated Z

1755
01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:00,739
value or something on the GPU right so

1756
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:03,268
again don't think I Triple E floating

1757
01:15:00,738 --> 01:15:06,118
whatever the GPU is using to represent

1758
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:08,099
depth which mate with which may be much

1759
01:15:06,118 --> 01:15:10,059
less precise than the 32-bit value for

1760
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:12,730
example

1761
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:15,190
okay so if that precision collapses to

1762
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:17,589
zero bits what happens is you no longer

1763
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:19,119
know the difference between a - between

1764
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:21,520
the pixels a and B that are coming in

1765
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:23,979
right and so what will happen is

1766
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,620
whichever one of them happen to be drawn

1767
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:30,099
first might actually be the one that

1768
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:32,079
stays there right and you get a random

1769
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:35,140
you sort of get whatever the draw order

1770
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:36,729
is we'll pick who draws right and what

1771
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:38,530
that would do is that would basically

1772
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:39,789
show you know if we were looking at two

1773
01:15:38,529 --> 01:15:43,359
plates that were right on top of each

1774
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:44,979
other a and B you'd basically see a if a

1775
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,539
were drawn first or you'd see B if we

1776
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:48,579
were drawn first or depending on

1777
01:15:46,539 --> 01:15:51,010
whatever the comparison scheme is that

1778
01:15:48,579 --> 01:15:53,769
if you actually lets you pick you'd see

1779
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:55,420
one of the other right so that's one

1780
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,490
form of z-fighting which is if a is

1781
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,829
actually supposed to be both behind B

1782
01:15:57,489 --> 01:16:02,050
but it's drawn first it'll now start

1783
01:15:59,829 --> 01:16:05,079
showing up in front of B just at the

1784
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:07,659
time when it moves behind right that's

1785
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:11,079
one for things get much worse however

1786
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:13,000
when it's slanty like this right when

1787
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:14,380
it's slanted like that then what happens

1788
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,229
is the floating-point precision may

1789
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:20,560
oscillate so that it can tell that a

1790
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:23,739
isn't behind B right here's a here's B

1791
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,060
as this gets these are different Z

1792
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:28,029
depths from the camera right because

1793
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:30,100
these are slanted as it steps these it

1794
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:32,319
may find that it can distinguish between

1795
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,390
them at certain places because the

1796
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:37,239
floating point math works out to have

1797
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:40,240
one bit difference between them but on

1798
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:42,250
another one it maps to 0 bits right just

1799
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:44,409
because of the way it collapses in out

1800
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:46,750
and out and then what you get is this

1801
01:16:44,409 --> 01:16:48,939
horrible stippling pattern depending on

1802
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:51,310
the angle of the things where B shows

1803
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:54,009
through shows in front as it should

1804
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:56,560
properly but then a peeks through in

1805
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:58,840
like up in a pixel e banded pattern

1806
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,940
depending on the the sort of angle and

1807
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,710
the iteration on the GPU right that's

1808
01:17:00,939 --> 01:17:08,619
the worst kind of z-fighting very bad

1809
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:12,670
right and you see this nasty pixely

1810
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:14,500
pattern right and so that's Z fighting

1811
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:15,579
it's when the precision breaks down so

1812
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,810
that it can no longer tell the

1813
01:17:15,579 --> 01:17:18,819
difference and there's a number of

1814
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:20,590
places that that can come from but

1815
01:17:18,819 --> 01:17:22,449
hopefully I've given you some examples

1816
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,930
of how it's kind of easy to understand

1817
01:17:22,449 --> 01:17:27,260
stream is over sauce

1818
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,610
one more thing without depth buffers and

1819
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:30,800
you're talking about the z-fighting

1820
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:31,969
we could still have a Z fighting problem

1821
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,470
in handmade hero even though we're not

1822
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:36,170
using a depth buffer and that's because

1823
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:40,010
we will be sorting our things right and

1824
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:42,829
so we could still have this problem the

1825
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:44,390
original problem here where is if we had

1826
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:47,149
set our things that poorly such that our

1827
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:48,770
our Z coordinates had gotten so large

1828
01:17:47,149 --> 01:17:50,989
that the mantissa could no longer

1829
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:53,120
distinguish between the two of them we

1830
01:17:50,989 --> 01:17:55,340
might sort the two things incorrectly

1831
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:57,380
all of a sudden like a supposed to be on

1832
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:59,300
top of B but we drew B first right and

1833
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:01,550
that's still a form of Z fighting it's

1834
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,079
just not the same as the kind of a GPU

1835
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:05,300
where since things are usually angled

1836
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:07,279
and doing weird things you get a stipple

1837
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,409
pattern because the the who is in front

1838
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,779
who it thinks is in front is changing we

1839
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:13,369
would not have that problem probably but

1840
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:14,869
what we would have is we'd have the sort

1841
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:17,119
order when it got up to that point where

1842
01:18:14,869 --> 01:18:18,710
it collapsed to 0 bits now it would sort

1843
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:20,149
them differently potentially because it

1844
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:21,739
would just use whoever came first or

1845
01:18:20,149 --> 01:18:24,019
something whereas before it was actually

1846
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,760
doing the sort so we still at least look

1847
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:27,980
it up that now we won't have that

1848
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,900
because our Z values will never be that

1849
01:18:27,979 --> 01:18:31,039
large we will never have that kind of a

1850
01:18:29,899 --> 01:18:33,769
problem and we're doing it in full

1851
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:35,269
floating point which typically GPUs at

1852
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:37,610
full floating point Z buffers don't have

1853
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:39,320
that problem because 32-bit is totally

1854
01:18:37,609 --> 01:18:43,099
fine for doing any of the Z usually that

1855
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:45,679
you want to do so typically what you'll

1856
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:49,370
what you'll get what you see Z fighting

1857
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:51,710
wise is on modern things on modern

1858
01:18:49,369 --> 01:18:53,359
high-end GPUs the kind of Z fighting

1859
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:54,470
that you'd see is not really the same

1860
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:56,899
kind of thing that I'm talking about

1861
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:59,360
it'd be more like shadow map problems

1862
01:18:56,899 --> 01:19:01,639
where you're doing back transforms that

1863
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:04,279
lose precision because of the fact that

1864
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:07,160
the they don't map 1 to 1 on the pixels

1865
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:09,469
that's a whole separate thing so this

1866
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:11,869
kind of Z fighting is more common in

1867
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:13,940
older games than newer games

1868
01:19:11,869 --> 01:19:17,269
whereas newer games still have things

1869
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:18,799
that you could consider to sort of be Z

1870
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:21,110
fighting but they're really Z fight

1871
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,329
they're really not the same thing there

1872
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:26,089
because things are getting mapped in a

1873
01:19:23,329 --> 01:19:27,439
non 1 to 1 pixel way which is a separate

1874
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:29,390
thing and I don't have time to talk

1875
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:33,079
about that now but hopefully that's good

1876
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:36,230
hopefully that is yeah

1877
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:37,519
hopefully that clears that up so alright

1878
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:38,689
stream is over it looks like there's

1879
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:43,460
really no more questions anyway so

1880
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:46,250
that's good and so hopefully everyone is

1881
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:50,119
is a happy camper today everyone has has

1882
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:51,920
hatun had their dose of z and alpha and

1883
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:53,239
so we've got plenty of stuff this opens

1884
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,800
up a huge set of things to work on

1885
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:57,409
really excited about that tomorrow we'll

1886
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,730
do we'll just tackle some of that maybe

1887
01:19:57,409 --> 01:19:59,960
look at the ground in there maybe we'll

1888
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:00,739
work on the perspective transform who

1889
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,899
knows what we'll do but we'll do

1890
01:20:00,739 --> 01:20:04,399
something we've got tons of a huge big

1891
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:07,489
front opened up for us now so that's

1892
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:09,079
good and that's what we will go do so

1893
01:20:07,489 --> 01:20:10,969
thank you everyone for joining me for

1894
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:12,019
another episode of handmade hero it has

1895
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:13,250
been a pleasure coding with you as

1896
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:15,350
always always good when you could push

1897
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:16,430
forward into a new problem area I think

1898
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,180
that's kind of where we're at right now

1899
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:20,750
we're getting there

1900
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:23,960
so that's good thanks very much for

1901
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:25,340
joining me and again if you are if

1902
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,569
you're interested in the series you like

1903
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:28,670
the series this is your first time here

1904
01:20:26,569 --> 01:20:29,649
we're here every every day 5 p.m.

1905
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:32,329
Pacific Standard Time

1906
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:33,609
here on Twitch we'd love to see you come

1907
01:20:32,329 --> 01:20:36,229
back it's always good to see new faces

1908
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:37,939
if you want to follow along at home with

1909
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:39,679
a source code we also do provide the

1910
01:20:37,939 --> 01:20:41,299
source code if you preorder the game you

1911
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,130
can download the source code as well

1912
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,630
which is a good way to play around and

1913
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:47,150
just have fun with it

1914
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:48,409
we also have a patreon if you want to

1915
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:49,909
support the video series you want to

1916
01:20:48,409 --> 01:20:51,319
subscribe to the video series and just

1917
01:20:49,909 --> 01:20:53,059
that's just as a nice thing to do for us

1918
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:54,920
it's always very appreciated you could

1919
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,970
do that there we have a forum site you

1920
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:59,000
can go to where you can ask questions

1921
01:20:55,970 --> 01:21:00,619
and you can also take advantage of some

1922
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,359
stuff the community's done anti episode

1923
01:21:00,619 --> 01:21:04,099
guide ports to Mac &amp; Linux that sort of

1924
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:06,259
stuff and we also have a tweet bot that

1925
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,640
will tweak the schedule at you so if you

1926
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,960
want to catch the stream live and you're

1927
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,010
not sure what schedule is for the day or

1928
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,720
that sort of stuff check out the tweet

1929
01:21:10,010 --> 01:21:13,460
bot you can do subscribe or just check

1930
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:15,740
him out and see cuz it's usually got the

1931
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,539
day's schedule on there and it doesn't

1932
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:19,309
really tweet anything else except once a

1933
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:20,840
night and a blue moon so so that's a

1934
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:23,300
good place to check that out so thanks

1935
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:24,829
again for joining me and we will see you

1936
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,779
tomorrow for the last room of this week

1937
01:21:24,829 --> 01:21:29,239
for the Friday scream hope to see you

1938
01:21:26,779 --> 01:21:30,380
all here for some Friday fun if not have

1939
01:21:29,239 --> 01:21:34,029
a good weekend and I will see you on

1940
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:34,029
Monday either way take it easy everyone
