1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,669
start recording there we go hello

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,949
everyone and welcome to handmade Hero

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:10,469
the show where we code a complete game

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,169
live from scratch no libraries no

5
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:15,509
engines all by are very lonesomes just

6
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:17,490
just me and me and the fine fellows on

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,719
the stream I don't actually know how

8
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,489
many people we've got tonight but

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,019
there's there's always a good crowd here

10
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:23,579
and they're always very supportive and

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,899
it seems like they're really some pretty

12
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:26,639
awesome people from interacting with

13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,390
them on the forums and stuff so I really

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,890
couldn't ask for a better team to put

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,630
this game together with I could tell you

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,829
that right now now one of the things a

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,989
lot of people ask is why are we coding

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,759
game from scratch well half for

19
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:40,049
education half for fun I think there's a

20
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,488
lot to be learned from doing an entire

21
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:42,808
game from scratch and not relying on

22
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:44,159
other people's code because it forces us

23
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:46,530
to learn everything and we get to know

24
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,659
basically everything that goes on inside

25
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,629
a real professional quality you know

26
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:53,128
performant game engine but also because

27
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:54,899
it's just a lot of fun it's fun to go

28
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,339
you know spend some time doing things

29
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,020
just because they're interesting you

30
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,670
know and and so sometimes it doesn't

31
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,770
necessarily have to be the most rational

32
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,270
choice maybe you could go get a library

33
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,769
to do something but sometimes just once

34
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,060
in a while and this product is that once

35
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,920
in a while certainly for me and for a

36
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,118
lot of other people to kind of get in

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,590
there and just say hey let's play around

38
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,140
this for a while let's see what we can

39
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,520
do with it and frankly I think that's a

40
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,170
lot of fun it also tends to be where a

41
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,609
lot of new stuff is determined like

42
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,810
maybe you go in somewhere thinking

43
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,489
you're just doing something for fun and

44
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,600
it turns out you come up with a whole

45
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,039
new way of doing things that's better

46
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,269
than what's currently being done out

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,030
there so that's pretty cool too so

48
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:33,629
anyway here we are on day 41 which is

49
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,430
basically we've we do roughly an hour a

50
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:37,798
night of programming here on the stream

51
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,118
and so 40 hours is one workweek so

52
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,670
basically we are at the point where you

53
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,319
have finished one work week's worth of

54
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,329
work and we have our game running it's

55
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,089
got a little guy who walks around inside

56
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,069
of a tile map and basically what we

57
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,750
wanted to do was start moving from that

58
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,188
into something that's more of a full

59
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,078
game that's got like a good character

60
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:56,758
motion feel to it something that's got

61
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,099
some nice graphics for the backgrounds

62
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,780
is that sort of stuff and what I decided

63
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,789
we will do right at the cusp or I had to

64
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,228
start talking about math for real

65
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,759
because basically everything that we

66
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:08,098
want to do from here on in is going to

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,659
involve math that's that's more

68
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,038
complicated than just basic algebra

69
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,900
pretty much everything on the stream

70
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,919
that we've done so far has been stuff

71
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,250
that you could understand with

72
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,359
basic algebra skills and so now we're

73
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,560
kind of crossing that threshold where

74
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,360
that's not gonna be true anymore so I

75
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,159
thought like it might be a good idea for

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,140
those people out there who aren't super

77
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,909
comfortable with a lot of different math

78
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,469
stuff to just kind of start giving a

79
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,810
little bit of an overview of that and

80
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:32,099
maybe spend a day or two talking about

81
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,420
math and getting people on the same page

82
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,810
and then from then on we can kind of

83
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,189
play that as it as it comes up so I do

84
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,750
apologize for people out there who

85
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,310
already know math especially those

86
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,289
people out there who already know math

87
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,629
better than I do because obviously

88
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,818
you're gonna be pretty bored through

89
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,370
some of this stuff and that's fine you

90
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:51,719
know that's just what can I say we got

91
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,509
it we got to go over at some point so I

92
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,919
do apologize for that but hopefully you

93
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,149
know at the very least it'll still be

94
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,949
interesting stuff to talk about and

95
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,750
maybe you can also help out other people

96
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,829
on the stream who are having trouble who

97
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,489
are new to the math and don't

98
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:09,510
necessarily know all this stuff already

99
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:10,680
okay so what I did because I thought

100
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:14,609
this would be interesting to start us

101
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,590
off for our Monday stream what I did was

102
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,459
I decided that I'd like to sort of make

103
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:23,789
this this next hour here sort of be a

104
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,489
general answer in so much as can be as

105
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:28,078
one can be made to the the folks who

106
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,329
often asked the question and a lot of

107
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,980
times these are perhaps younger people

108
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,379
who ask this question you know people in

109
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,669
high school or whatever who are you know

110
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,169
maybe interested in game development but

111
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,189
don't know very much about how math and

112
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,469
game development relate to each other

113
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,409
who asked the question like do I need to

114
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,180
know mathematics in order to be a game

115
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,590
programmer or you know how much

116
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,329
mathematics or what mathematics do I

117
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,489
need to know how important is it that

118
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,709
sort of thing and I hear that question

119
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,420
asks a lot and I've never really stopped

120
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,709
to put together a real complete answer

121
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,419
usually with just what I say is it

122
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,359
depends on what kind of programming you

123
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:04,919
want to do if you want to be somebody

124
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:07,799
who programs you know just straight like

125
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,018
very logic oriented code that doesn't

126
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,659
really do a lot of motion stuff that

127
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,209
doesn't do a lot of randomness and stuff

128
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,798
like this then maybe you know you could

129
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,120
be a game programmer like a light game

130
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,759
programmer without really knowing very

131
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,590
much math and certainly if you want to

132
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,199
do programming in other disciplines that

133
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,699
aren't game related their entire like

134
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,750
disciplines of programming that really

135
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,189
don't involve any math at all

136
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,290
like you could probably have a career

137
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,699
that's really well-paid doing stuff that

138
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,200
had nothing to do with math most of the

139
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:39,449
time in other areas of programming but

140
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,370
the reality is that if game engine

141
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:44,279
programming like if actual real game

142
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,319
engine programming is something that you

143
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,579
are sort of looking at like you want to

144
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,290
be able to be either a full spectrum

145
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,240
programmer or somebody who does game

146
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,610
engine work the truth is that math is

147
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,319
actually used pretty much in everything

148
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,680
you do so it's almost impossible to

149
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,379
escape having at least you know a pretty

150
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,120
good grasp on a number of mathematical

151
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,949
topics it doesn't necessarily mean that

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,569
you have to be a really good

153
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,519
mathematician I know I certainly am NOT

154
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:09,899
but it does mean that you have to have

155
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,759
that familiarity and you have to have a

156
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,469
certain facility with these math

157
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,930
concepts in the sense that you use them

158
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,590
like tools and you have to be very fast

159
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:22,009
using them like tools to get work done

160
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:24,149
and that is just really the reality of

161
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,668
math and so what I wanted to do today

162
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:28,349
was I tried to make a list and I'm sure

163
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:32,219
it's probably an incomplete list but I

164
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:36,270
tried to make a list that was all of the

165
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:41,300
types of mathematics that just me just

166
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:44,819
just myself just I have had to use in

167
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,060
making game code over the past 30 years

168
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,228
so basically this is I'm and what I'm

169
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,199
gonna do today is basically go through

170
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:54,180
this list and show you why each one was

171
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,819
necessary and what I actually used it

172
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,189
for in so much as I can give sort of the

173
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,959
capsule summary and I think that'll

174
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:03,418
basically be the best way that I could

175
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,978
set us up for our discussions about math

176
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,049
that will go on for the next year or two

177
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:08,879
as we come to the various things that we

178
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,350
need I'll be able to kind of refer back

179
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,430
and go remember I talked about this well

180
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,919
now is the time that we have to start

181
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,030
using it and so I'd like to just kind of

182
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,219
go through these and see if I can

183
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,259
basically give that sort of high level

184
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,060
conceptual overview so that people who

185
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,769
really just don't have a lot of math

186
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,680
background here will sort of now know

187
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:27,240
okay like here's actually sort of the

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,490
breadth of the stuff that's actually

189
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,800
involved in one just one programmers

190
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,168
stuff that they've done over the course

191
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,449
of their career and yuka it's also safe

192
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:37,949
to assume that if you pick another game

193
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:39,478
programmer you'd get a different set a

194
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,519
lot of it would probably intersect with

195
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:43,139
mine but they'd probably have some

196
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,228
there that I don't have so they'd

197
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,840
probably know some branches of math and

198
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:52,139
some things in very expansive math that

199
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:55,888
I never had to do and don't know and

200
00:06:52,139 --> 00:07:00,810
vice versa right so okay let's get

201
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:03,810
started with the basics okay so I

202
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,579
believe it's we're back to our little

203
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,680
hand in I don't know why

204
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,930
loves the little hand so much but it

205
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,788
really does seem to alright I'm gonna go

206
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,228
ahead and move my my thing here for

207
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:18,060
drawing I'm actually using the drawing

208
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:19,709
tablet today drawing yeah my handwriting

209
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,720
is not so good on tablets I apologize

210
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:24,168
for that but that's just that's just how

211
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,120
it goes sometimes alright so let's start

212
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:29,250
by pointing out just the most basic

213
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,038
thing which is that if you are in high

214
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:36,810
school I'm assuming that you probably

215
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:38,939
have done arithmetic right algebra just

216
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:46,968
basic algebra you know basic basic

217
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:50,908
algebra geometry trigonometry whoa

218
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:53,430
tree there we go I know what's up with

219
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:56,399
this pen right here and calculus

220
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,199
probably now I realize that some people

221
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,750
maybe maybe haven't actually taken

222
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,360
calculus in their in their high school

223
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,528
years but I think most places probably

224
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,580
it would look something like this so you

225
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:07,978
have arithmetic algebra geometry

226
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,348
trigonometry calculus you've had this by

227
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:15,870
the time you would be in high school

228
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:17,430
sometime maybe you'd have to get two

229
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,569
very senior year to do calculus maybe

230
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,218
you'd do it earlier I'm not sure but if

231
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:22,289
you look something like this so

232
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:23,699
obviously you know that these two are

233
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:25,860
involved in all kinds of programming

234
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,500
because you've already seen me do these

235
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,240
on the string okay so two things that

236
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,129
you learn in grade school you've already

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,629
seen me doing this dream arithmetic is

238
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:35,129
we basically have to know that because

239
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,059
that's what we're program that computer

240
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:37,528
do all the time addition subtraction

241
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,609
multiplication blah blah blah you've

242
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:39,899
seen me do a ton of that in the stream

243
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,610
obviously the computer is doing tons of

244
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,740
it per frame there's no question there

245
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,720
algebra same thing you've seen me use it

246
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,610
lightly so far on the stream I believe

247
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,230
we had to solve for something once you

248
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,000
saw me rearrange terms just the other

249
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,409
day when I wrote down something of the

250
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,789
form I believe I did a plus

251
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:02,459
B minus a right and I said oh I could go

252
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,110
ahead and and rearrange this you know I

253
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,000
crossed out the eight terms or something

254
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,279
like that and then I also did one for

255
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,840
the the T I distributed the term so I

256
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,949
use the distributive property for t I

257
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,750
don't know if you guys were watching

258
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,830
when I did that but that was something I

259
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,809
did the other day so you've already seen

260
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,720
me do like algebra on the stream and it

261
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:20,279
will only get more of that as we as we

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,529
go so you've already seen me do these

263
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,569
what you haven't really seen me do is

264
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,279
these but they are certainly there and

265
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,050
so I'll briefly say how we're going to

266
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,490
use those and how I have used those and

267
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:35,370
then we'll move on to the more serious

268
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:39,090
mathematics okay so basic geometry and

269
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:41,820
by that we really mean Euclidian

270
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,790
geometry so basically the kind of of

271
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,680
geometry that you typically learn in

272
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:49,919
high school is called Euclidean geometry

273
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,329
and generally you know I don't really

274
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,649
know why Euclid gets his name on it

275
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,180
maybe he invented it I don't know I'm

276
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:55,709
not a mathematician like I said so my

277
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,079
math history and my actual math

278
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,820
knowledge are almost nil so everything

279
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,500
that you want to know specifically you

280
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,450
will always have to check I can only

281
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,009
tell you about how I program games with

282
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,410
math that's the only thing that you can

283
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,669
guarantee so so basically yes I just

284
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:10,500
assume it's named after you could I have

285
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:13,259
no idea but York Lydian geometry is

286
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,029
basically the study of geometry in the

287
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:17,700
types of spaces that we typically care

288
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:20,490
about in games as a general rule which

289
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,860
is to say systems where we have

290
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,649
coordinates and those coordinates meet

291
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,090
at right angles to each other right so

292
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:28,350
basically you know we've got these

293
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,170
coordinate systems where we have an

294
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,659
x-axis and a y-axis and the y-axis you

295
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:35,669
know it is is generally considered

296
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,409
orthogonal you know it is something that

297
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,089
that generally doesn't interfere with

298
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:41,909
the x-axis at all so when we pick a

299
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,500
point right we don't have some weird

300
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,209
coordinate system where the y-axis is

301
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,009
like a bendy curve or something like

302
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,070
this it's always this this nice straight

303
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:51,360
thing x and y and if we have as the same

304
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,700
thing happens we've got this nice

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,639
orthogonal coordinate system that's what

306
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,759
we tend to work with in games we tend to

307
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:04,350
give points in space coordinates using

308
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:06,889
either XY pairs or XYZ tuples right

309
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,279
triplets I guess you might say right and

310
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:12,129
Euclidian geometry is basically John

311
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,689
that's that's sort of the one that comes

312
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,610
into play when you're working on these

313
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,230
kinds of systems whenever you've got

314
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,509
these right angled coordinate systems

315
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,820
that's a textbook case for Euclidean

316
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:25,480
geometry and you Kilian geometry allows

317
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,430
us to start doing it sort of what we are

318
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,920
talking about when we are thinking in

319
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:31,389
these terms right and so you've done

320
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,919
these sorts of things I mean I'm trying

321
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,980
to think about what the sort of stuff is

322
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:38,319
that you do I can't remember back to you

323
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,149
know in high school when I started doing

324
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,230
these like it's like the trigonometry

325
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:43,179
and the geometry you kind of blur

326
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,310
together in my head I don't remember if

327
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:47,529
things like proving the congruence of

328
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:49,000
triangles like for example if I had you

329
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,829
know a triangle here or something like

330
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,600
this and then I had another triangle

331
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,490
here right like let's say I have these

332
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,259
two triangles proving that these two

333
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,659
triangles were basically congruent that

334
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:01,330
because they had angles in common you

335
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:02,860
know these sorts of things I think that

336
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,570
was the kind of stuff that they did in

337
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,730
high school geometry I'm not sure but

338
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:09,580
point being even that that simple

339
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,899
congruence of triangles that is like the

340
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,879
cornerstone of three-dimensional

341
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,039
projection for example so when you do

342
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,838
three-dimensional rendering and we will

343
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,759
do some of that a little limited amount

344
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,950
even though this is a 2-d game even just

345
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,990
that basic stuff that you learned in

346
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,360
high school is actually all totally

347
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,980
applicable already in games congruent

348
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,899
triangles happen all the time

349
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,539
so yeah trust me even though it seems

350
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:33,069
kind of straightforward and simple even

351
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:34,480
the geometry that you learned in high

352
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,700
school is the kind of stuff that you

353
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,450
will end up using now trigonometry is

354
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,850
used all the time a ton basically the

355
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:46,060
the most common case of it in games is

356
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:48,670
the really simple case of when you when

357
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,989
you need to translate between things

358
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:51,909
that happen in your coordinate system

359
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,799
again you've got like an XY coordinate

360
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:55,419
system here and you have very typical

361
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,519
cases of trig where you've got stuff

362
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:59,679
like you have a point out here somewhere

363
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,659
and you want to know its angle of

364
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,939
deflection you know basically off of

365
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:05,409
some other point for example maybe I've

366
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,760
got two points like a point here at a

367
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,529
point here and I want to know the angle

368
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,850
between them a lot of times you'll do

369
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:12,129
this for game programming you want to be

370
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,990
able to rotate things to point at other

371
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:16,450
things or you want to be able to do

372
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,220
stuff like figure out you know the rate

373
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,680
of turning of some things that you want

374
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,700
them to have all these sorts of things

375
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,989
trigonometry going back and forth

376
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,900
between some angle

377
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,060
and some real sort of notion of what

378
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,399
that means in terms of a direction in

379
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:32,289
space or in terms of locations of points

380
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,360
in space again

381
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:36,730
the most basic stuff that you learned in

382
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,680
trigonometry already useful in games and

383
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,970
it only goes up from there so just write

384
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,329
stuff that you already learned in high

385
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:46,060
school we will be using on the stream

386
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,129
repeatedly and so that's that's a you

387
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,379
know a real big one it never it really

388
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,909
never gets old like you know no matter

389
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:53,769
how complex the thing I've ever written

390
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:55,240
trigonometry always pops up just like

391
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,519
algebra in arithmetic it's just it's

392
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,919
baked into everything because games at a

393
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,769
fundamental level are very spatial right

394
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,289
they're just very spatial things and so

395
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:07,529
calculus is kind of the one that maybe

396
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:09,579
doesn't rear its head so often in games

397
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:14,559
depending on how you choose to implement

398
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:16,660
them and the reason I say that is

399
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,909
because you can cheat out of a lot of

400
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:21,069
calculus you can you can sort of be mr.

401
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:24,549
chooses not to do your calculus homework

402
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,470
if your game programmer by using things

403
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:27,759
like fixed frame rates and other stuff

404
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,899
like this and when I say fixed frame

405
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,549
rates I don't mean like the kind we're

406
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,169
doing where we're saying we're trying to

407
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:33,490
keep our frame rate constant so if it's

408
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,899
thirty we're kind of translated 30 or

409
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,889
that 64 is a 60 and so on

410
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:40,809
I mean more like you literally only have

411
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:42,370
one type of time step you could take you

412
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,750
can only go forward in a sixtieth of a

413
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,509
second and you have to run everything at

414
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,639
that and the reason is you can just sort

415
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,889
of bake constants into your motion

416
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,019
equations that just sort of work and you

417
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:55,539
don't have to think about the

418
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:57,639
integration of things over time which is

419
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:59,889
tends to be and the derivatives of

420
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,960
things over time as much because you can

421
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,850
basically fudge your constants and just

422
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,190
kind of like tune things to work sort of

423
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,779
without necessarily having to involve

424
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,610
yourself in a lot of this so sometimes

425
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,839
depending on the game and depending on

426
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,580
how you choose to program it you may be

427
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,470
able to get out of doing some of this

428
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,030
but if you don't do that and you would

429
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,160
like to be able to support they

430
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,799
basically be able to write code that can

431
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,539
dynamically have its the basically

432
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,669
doesn't have to be rewritten if you want

433
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,349
to change what the time step is and you

434
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:28,959
want it to play identically or nearly

435
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:32,019
identically in terms of what motion

436
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,400
things take then calculus starts to come

437
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:36,460
into play big time and the reason for

438
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,929
that is because again when

439
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,278
talking about tea when you're talking

440
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:41,229
about time and you're talking about the

441
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,149
arrow of time so basically you're

442
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,420
talking about time steps where you've

443
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:48,490
got some kind of a delta T you've got a

444
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,709
difference in time between one game

445
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,600
State this is the game state that was we

446
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,700
were at before and we want to advance to

447
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,870
a new game state right then basically

448
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,459
what you're talking about is you're

449
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,149
talking about taking a bunch of things

450
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:02,939
that are specified in terms of

451
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:06,820
instantaneous acceleration or velocity

452
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,399
meaning let's say for example 9.8 meters

453
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,070
per second squared I believe is the

454
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,549
typical constant for gravity where we

455
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,200
are in the world and if you think about

456
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:18,879
how these sorts of things are specified

457
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,370
that is how gravity actually works

458
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,009
that's the rate at which gravity

459
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,679
accelerates objects and so if you want

460
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,870
to be able to use gravity properly you

461
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,088
would specify it either as 9.8 meters

462
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,769
per second squared in your game or you

463
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,149
would have some own made-up value that

464
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,860
you made up for what you wanted gravity

465
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:38,429
to be but in order for it to actually

466
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:42,250
act like gravity you then need to do

467
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:43,778
integrations of this acceleration which

468
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,278
is actually the second derivative of

469
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:48,070
position stuff we'll be getting to later

470
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,350
right you need to be able to integrate

471
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,540
this up into the velocities of objects

472
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,519
so that you know how fast they're going

473
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:58,088
and then finally up into the positions

474
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,579
of things so that you know where they

475
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:02,830
are on the screen and again integration

476
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,449
and derivatives which are basically the

477
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,740
things that step you up for my sellers

478
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:06,880
new velocity to philosophy position

479
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,109
that's integration going upwards

480
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,339
derivative

481
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,869
you know derivatives or what take you

482
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:13,568
down from position to velocity to

483
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,219
acceleration that is all you know

484
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:17,170
calculus is bread and butter and so

485
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,789
certainly even if you were doing a

486
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,130
variable time step game even the most

487
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,420
basic stuff again that you learned in

488
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,459
high school which you probably learned

489
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,630
this you know this base stuff and if you

490
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,370
were in physics you actually literally

491
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,320
learned this not just integration and

492
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:31,119
derivatives you learned position

493
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,500
velocity acceleration as well even that

494
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,000
most basic stuff comes into play on

495
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,569
every frame of game because everything

496
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,029
in the world

497
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:38,740
Tippett tends to have even in very non

498
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:40,869
realistic games tends to want to have

499
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,400
very consistently behaving physical

500
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:43,599
properties that work the way they do in

501
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,759
the real world just perhaps with

502
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,889
different constants so things you know

503
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,019
maybe have more

504
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,670
friction on them or their gravity

505
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:52,230
stronger or less strong that sort of

506
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,660
stuff but they still want it you still

507
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,440
want to obey sort of those general ways

508
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,640
in which things work okay so that's the

509
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,670
basic stuff you learned in high school

510
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,240
and all of it is actually useful in

511
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:08,009
games it's it really does come up in a

512
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,380
lot of different places and I'm only

513
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,450
just mentioning a few of the ways there

514
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,070
are lots more right for each of them now

515
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,860
I want to point out something just to

516
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:19,439
give one simple example which is complex

517
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:21,779
numbers right you may have seen complex

518
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,269
numbers in your in your high school

519
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:26,129
classes right normally a number we think

520
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,839
of a real number it's like three point

521
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,179
five two or something like this that's

522
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:33,149
our number and we just think of those

523
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:36,900
numbers as what we normally compute with

524
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:41,519
but in if you remember from your your

525
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,250
grade school math and so on they also

526
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,660
introduce things like complex numbers

527
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:48,000
where they will tell you like the square

528
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,340
root of negative 1 equals I and they

529
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,319
will start to write things that look

530
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:54,269
like that right and there are these

531
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,980
numbers that have two parts they have a

532
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,829
real part in an it what they call it an

533
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,480
imaginary part right and you know

534
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:01,889
probably I don't know if you were

535
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,289
anything like me I okay I said I don't

536
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,580
have a natural aptitude for math and so

537
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,099
if you were like me you probably looked

538
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,859
at that and went well I'm pretty sure

539
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,389
I'm never gonna use that again because I

540
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,918
don't even have any idea why anyone

541
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,590
would ever care about this right it

542
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,940
seems completely ridiculous turns out

543
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:24,629
not to be true in fact even just basic

544
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:27,509
basic stuff you may need to do with 3d

545
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,690
graphics will involve numbers that are

546
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:32,160
not only similar to this sort of thing

547
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,769
but are actually even more complicated

548
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,120
than it and I will touch on those in a

549
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,089
second but basically what I just wanted

550
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,339
to do is kind of have a have just sort

551
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:43,798
of a quick mention of the fact that even

552
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:45,779
the things you probably thought were not

553
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,609
interesting or will never be important

554
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:50,609
in some of these subjects actually end

555
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:51,779
up being important because most of the

556
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:53,369
stuff that you learned in high school

557
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,299
math is actually pretty practically

558
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:59,489
applicable to two games all right so

559
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,509
more on that in a second so now let's

560
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,819
get into the stuff

561
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:04,529
that you probably didn't have much of in

562
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,879
high school I don't know maybe your high

563
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:06,869
schools were more vigorous than mine or

564
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,550
if you went to private uh seven to

565
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:12,379
public high school private high schools

566
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:12,379
might be fancier I don't really know

567
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:16,939
so you may have had more mapping right

568
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:24,149
but now we're just going to go through

569
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:27,269
stuff I learned after I got out of high

570
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,790
school while working on games to work on

571
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,589
games so this is only stuff that was

572
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:32,879
used in game technology right this is

573
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,949
none of the stuff that I'm about to say

574
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,300
his stuff that I did strictly because I

575
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,670
was curious or was interested in math

576
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:41,460
these are literally all things that I

577
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:44,190
had to learn because I actually needed

578
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,910
to type some code into a computer right

579
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:50,940
period all right

580
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:53,009
so first of all linear algebra is one of

581
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,470
the biggest ones that everyone talks

582
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:57,990
about and it's it's true that it is very

583
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:01,679
important and it tends to underpin a ton

584
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:04,558
of things so linear algebra the the most

585
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,820
obvious place that people face it is

586
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,849
basically with vectors and matrices

587
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,409
right so you've got vectors and matrices

588
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:12,269
which you've probably seen even if you

589
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,400
don't have any idea what they are or why

590
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:17,220
they are you've probably seen them even

591
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,740
if in just 3d editing packages vectors

592
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,509
are of course those what we use to

593
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,509
represent our points in space like those

594
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:27,450
tuples like the XY and Z or even RGB in

595
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:31,769
color space right vectors are basically

596
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,870
one-dimensional groupings of oh I

597
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:37,679
shouldn't say 1 dimensional they are one

598
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:41,569
a matrix is a two-by-two thing right

599
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,940
it's got numbers in it in sort of the

600
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:47,369
it's sort of but I don't know how to say

601
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,860
this other than 2 by 2 it's got rows and

602
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:52,439
it's got columns let's put it that way a

603
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,928
vector is not that way a vector only has

604
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,940
one dimension to it to itself but the

605
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,470
vector itself is said to be in some

606
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,039
number of dimensions based on how many

607
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:04,140
it has right it's always one of a row or

608
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,500
one of a column right so it might be X Y

609
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:10,679
Z written that way or it might be XYZ

610
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,390
and RGB written in this way which is

611
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,429
actually a little more common due to

612
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:17,580
some very stuff that will get into

613
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:19,110
in future episodes so it only has one

614
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:21,178
row or one column but it has as many

615
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:22,979
elements as it wants in it so a vector

616
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,240
might have like typically we'll deal

617
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,740
with three dimensional vectors two

618
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,829
dimensional vectors or four dimensional

619
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,599
vectors are very common X Y Z W and rgba

620
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:32,129
for example are typical examples of

621
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,719
four-dimensional extensions of these

622
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,860
three dimensional vectors and basically

623
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,389
what they are is like I said before they

624
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:37,648
represent points in space or anything

625
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,329
else that we might want to talk about

626
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:41,308
when we have things that are

627
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:43,470
interrelated in some way like these are

628
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:45,538
all properties of a single point let's

629
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,179
say in space and we want to bundle those

630
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,528
together now matrices are very similar

631
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,028
in fact vectors are kind of just a

632
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:54,298
special case of a matrix if you will

633
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:56,038
they are something that only has one of

634
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:58,259
their dimensions filled and it doesn't

635
00:22:56,038 --> 00:23:01,648
actually have you know they're not and

636
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:03,058
buy em they're just n wide and so you

637
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:08,699
know something that had more of those

638
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:10,109
like I drew before F I something that

639
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,130
has more of those and it doesn't act to

640
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:12,240
be two-dimensional it could be

641
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,309
three-dimensional could be as many

642
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,690
dimensions as we want and then it also

643
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:17,009
has each of those dimensions has a

644
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,480
certain width so they might be three by

645
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:21,000
three matrices two by two matrices for

646
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,470
my for my trees so typically what you

647
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,778
will see the first time that you'll

648
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,028
encounter stuff like this is again

649
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:30,269
points in space or colors very common

650
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:32,190
and then transforms on them because what

651
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:34,649
you'll typically see is you will see you

652
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,110
will typically see transforms of vectors

653
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:38,729
written as vector matrix math and the

654
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:40,308
way vector matrix math works is you'll

655
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,048
typically see it written like this

656
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:44,970
you'll basically see it done in a

657
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:47,250
fashion that sort of does this drawing

658
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,440
right and the way that it works is

659
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,388
vector matrix multiplication for example

660
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,340
in this case is when you take each

661
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:56,689
element of a vector and multiply it by

662
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:59,730
each element of a matrix in the order

663
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,009
rows of the vector times columns of the

664
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,599
matrix to fill in one here and then

665
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:07,408
again you do the same pairing here so

666
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,699
I'd have a XB y CZ and I can actually

667
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,750
write one of those out for you this is

668
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,690
not something that I want to cover right

669
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,819
now but just to give you example ax plus

670
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,330
B y plus cz right so you basically do

671
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,129
each term x times a you add Y plus times

672
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:21,449
B and you add Z times C so you basically

673
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,679
are doing that multiplication you then

674
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,330
move down to the next row and do the

675
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,790
exact same thing again so here you'd get

676
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:32,500
D times X plus e times y

677
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:35,730
plus Z times sorry F times Z try to keep

678
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,339
consistent order there and GX plus hy

679
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,720
plus isay right and so typically you

680
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:42,399
know you'll see a lot of this and the

681
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,759
reason that these are used is because

682
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,730
these matrices can encapsulate in this

683
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,430
format any kind of way that you could

684
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:54,099
transform a point such that it still

685
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,960
maintains certain criteria most of which

686
00:24:54,099 --> 00:25:01,599
are ok like most of which we don't mind

687
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:04,480
always preserving so by encapsulating

688
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:08,709
the math in this way you can do scale

689
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:13,329
you can do shears you can do movement

690
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:14,380
like translation right you can do a

691
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:16,750
number of things that you might want to

692
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,150
do to your vectors and what's more is

693
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,799
matrices themselves can be composed so

694
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,390
basically if I have a matrix that

695
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,799
represents a scale and a matrix that

696
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,390
represents a shear I can multiply the

697
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,849
matrices together and get a scale shear

698
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,290
matrix right so this ends up just being

699
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:30,969
a very efficient way to do some of these

700
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:33,399
3d graphics things so that's typically

701
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,779
where you will start to see linear

702
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,070
algebra first now again not gonna

703
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:37,990
explain any of that today because the

704
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:41,200
day is just the overview day but we will

705
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,970
talk about it certainly later but in

706
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,920
addition to those things those are

707
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,019
actually very basic things that you

708
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,400
might use linear algebra for but linear

709
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:50,230
algebra is actually a lot more powerful

710
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,240
than that because linear algebra

711
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:56,680
actually at its heart is more about

712
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,210
solving simultaneous equations and I

713
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,500
don't know if you've ever seen any of

714
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,940
this before if you've only had high

715
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,460
school math you may not have ever gotten

716
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,080
to this but you certainly have done the

717
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,740
simultaneous equations part you may just

718
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:10,149
not have it seen it phrased in the term

719
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,430
linear algebra air or in the ways in

720
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,350
which linear algebra often tackles it

721
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,240
you will have seen something certainly

722
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:19,750
in your high school math something that

723
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:24,730
looks like this where you have 5x plus 3

724
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:28,630
y equals 0 and let's say 2x plus 2y

725
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:31,539
equals 0 right you will have been given

726
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:34,090
these equations and you will have been

727
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:35,769
asked to solve for x and y and what you

728
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:37,149
will have been told right is you will

729
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,279
have been told something along the lines

730
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,780
of as long as you have as many equations

731
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,059
as you

732
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:45,549
variables then you will be able to solve

733
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:48,250
the system because you just solve one

734
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:49,480
equation for the for the variable and

735
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,009
then you substitute that back into the

736
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,549
other equation solve that and then

737
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:55,960
you've got the answer right well linear

738
00:26:54,549 --> 00:27:00,069
algebra is basically the formalization

739
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,779
of that of that process basically what

740
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,700
you end up doing is you will take all of

741
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:06,160
your equations that you have and you

742
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,019
will pack them into giant matrices so

743
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,670
each each row will basically be an

744
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:11,440
equation typically this sort of thing

745
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,860
so basically you know if I was doing

746
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,080
that one again where I had my 5x plus 3y

747
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:18,699
the five would go there and three would

748
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:20,529
go there we would only well you know let

749
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,840
me draw the 2x2 matrix of that of that

750
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:24,639
actual thing that I just wrote it would

751
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:28,419
be something like this five three two

752
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,890
two like so you would write this matrix

753
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,810
and then you would say that basically

754
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:35,620
I've got a vector that's multiplying by

755
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:38,319
that X&amp;Y right and that what I want to

756
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:39,699
do is I want to solve that again maybe

757
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,839
it's zero zero like we had written

758
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,850
before or maybe there's some actual

759
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,649
values in here whatever linear algebra

760
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:46,629
is about systemically being able to

761
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,490
solve these vector matrix equations and

762
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,490
basically there are processes that you

763
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:54,039
can run either iterative or or direct

764
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,509
that will basically solve entire systems

765
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,579
for you without making you go through

766
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:59,410
and have to do all the finicky you know

767
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,579
solve for one variable back substituting

768
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,500
the other one and blah blah blah so

769
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:04,210
basically you can scale this up to

770
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,460
things where you solve very large

771
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,400
systems of equations that can be huge

772
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,720
right now the other thing that's

773
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,170
interesting about that is you can

774
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,309
actually solve equations solve is the

775
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,630
wrong word but you can actually come up

776
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:18,250
with answers to equations that you

777
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,460
actually couldn't not possibly have

778
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,630
solved in you know in the regular way

779
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,850
that you would do mathematics for

780
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:28,330
example you might have things where you

781
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:30,699
have equations and variables that you

782
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:31,929
don't have enough equations for like

783
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,370
something like this

784
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,830
where I've got two equations with three

785
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:37,929
unknowns you can actually do things as

786
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:39,369
well that allow you to do approximated

787
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,279
solves or things that allow you to get

788
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:44,949
answers for things that simplify down to

789
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,930
show you the space of the possible

790
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,150
solutions if you have like more than one

791
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,380
if you have one or more variables that

792
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,030
can not be exactly software they can

793
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,890
give you basically what the shape is of

794
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,788
all the solutions like what it looks

795
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,229
like and spatially

796
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:57,489
so on so there's just a lot of very

797
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:59,440
powerful things you can do with linear

798
00:28:57,489 --> 00:29:01,179
algebra that aren't just about

799
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,619
manipulating vectors to matrices and so

800
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:04,659
there's there's just a huge amount of

801
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:06,218
stuff that's involved there and of

802
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,229
course it's all very applicable computer

803
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:12,070
science because really a lot of it was

804
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:13,690
sort of designed to make mechanical sort

805
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,898
of the manual processes of algebra so a

806
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,209
lot of it's very intimately related to

807
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:22,418
computer science as well so anyway

808
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:23,949
that's linear algebra now mm-hmm once

809
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,778
you start working with multiple things

810
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:28,389
like you know like I said you've got X Y

811
00:29:25,778 --> 00:29:29,558
Z all over the place and we you know

812
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:31,148
we've got all these points and typically

813
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:32,828
everything in a game has at least an XY

814
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:34,808
coordinated found XYZ coordinate and

815
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:36,158
we're trying to do all these things you

816
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:38,858
know in sort of these these

817
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,690
multi-dimensional spaces typically

818
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:42,158
regular calculus the kind that you learn

819
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,349
in high school where you just have just

820
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,509
basic calculus typically isn't going to

821
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:49,178
cut it and what you need to start doing

822
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:52,419
at that point is partial differential

823
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:59,019
equations right which is a form of

824
00:29:52,419 --> 00:30:01,179
calculus equations or PDE s if you will

825
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,038
partial differential equations and what

826
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,298
partial differential equations are is

827
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,729
they're basically like what you were

828
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:08,949
doing in high school calculus only

829
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:14,979
instead of only doing it with one

830
00:30:08,949 --> 00:30:18,429
variable that can change like in other

831
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:19,838
words normally in in high school

832
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:21,278
calculus I believe and I don't know

833
00:30:19,838 --> 00:30:23,198
maybe your again your calculus class may

834
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,538
have been better than mine but in my

835
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:27,699
calculus class for example you know we'd

836
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:29,919
have T for example would be a variable

837
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:31,149
that could change over time but then if

838
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,528
there are any other variables in the

839
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:34,748
systems of equations they were assumed

840
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,769
not to change over time or these other

841
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,659
sorts of things right

842
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:40,808
well partial differential equations is

843
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:42,278
basically the sort of study of how you

844
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:44,739
work with things where you have lots of

845
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:46,568
variables that could be changing and you

846
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:47,919
need to be able to work with them and so

847
00:30:46,568 --> 00:30:49,269
what partial differential equations is

848
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,639
basically about it is basically about

849
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:53,229
applying that high school calculus where

850
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:56,738
you were able to do derivatives and

851
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:58,479
integrals and stuff like this to systems

852
00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:01,389
where everything could be changing so

853
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:04,568
you maybe have an X a Y and Z and all

854
00:31:01,388 --> 00:31:07,538
the x y&amp;z are all things that might

855
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:08,319
change right so in that case what you

856
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:09,849
need to do is

857
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,970
you need to take derivatives of your

858
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:14,109
functions with respect to XY and Z and

859
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,500
then you need to be able to work with

860
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:19,089
them you know sort of to try think of

861
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,038
how to say this in the best way in order

862
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:22,629
to sort of do the sorts of operations

863
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,460
that you could do if you only had one

864
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,710
variable when you have multiple

865
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,179
variables and so a typical example of

866
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:34,179
this and like one that I used for

867
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:36,309
example in in the past is if you have

868
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:39,700
something like a function that's defined

869
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:40,960
in all of space so for example you know

870
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,149
a lot of times you'll see something

871
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,159
where you define it in in games you will

872
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:48,099
define some function that is space

873
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:50,350
facial so for any point in the world you

874
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:52,869
have a function that comes back and

875
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:55,269
tells you what the variable what the

876
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:57,038
value of this thing is in in the world

877
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:58,480
at that point and this could be used for

878
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:59,769
any sorts of things you know and this

879
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,819
function could be anything you know who

880
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:02,769
knows what it is something we made up

881
00:32:00,819 --> 00:32:04,119
but one example would be lets say that

882
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:06,460
we're doing some procedural world

883
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:08,469
generation and we basically say that for

884
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,288
any point in the world we want to know

885
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,298
how foggy it is there or something right

886
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:16,388
so this F is just literally the fog

887
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:17,829
density at that point right then

888
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:19,839
typically something that you might want

889
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:21,579
to do is say for any point in the world

890
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,428
and you know what I may be an even

891
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:25,928
better one would be if I could simplify

892
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:27,070
it slightly to something that's maybe a

893
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:30,879
little more relatable than fogginess

894
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:33,849
let's say we have an FX of Y and it

895
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:35,648
gives us back the height right of like a

896
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:37,959
height map so it's some procedurally

897
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:40,268
generated terrain right and what I want

898
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,860
to know is I want to know at any point

899
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:45,128
since I have this function that gives me

900
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:47,528
back the height I want to know what the

901
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:49,869
sort of the slope is at that point like

902
00:32:47,528 --> 00:32:52,329
what what direction points up the

903
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:55,388
steepest ascent of the place that I'm at

904
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:57,579
on this you know whatever this this

905
00:32:55,388 --> 00:32:58,898
height generation function is well

906
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:00,849
that's a textbook case of partial

907
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:02,768
differential equations basically there's

908
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,778
a thing called the gradient which is

909
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:07,599
when you take the partial derivative of

910
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:09,490
a function with respect to each of its

911
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,168
dependent variables and you slam them

912
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,480
into a vector so you'd have the partial

913
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:16,990
of F X and Y with respect to X and the

914
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,000
partial of f of XY with respect to Y and

915
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,038
that would basically give you that

916
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,730
vector that you wanted which is to say

917
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,220
that

918
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:25,420
in which the height is changing so

919
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,650
that's just an example of something that

920
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,300
you might do with it it's probably a

921
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,130
pretty weak example and to tell you the

922
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,839
truth my partial differential equation

923
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,400
foo is really weak if I had to pick one

924
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:35,139
thing that to be better at it would

925
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,250
probably be this right here because it

926
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,440
comes up a lot in physics and I just

927
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,119
never been that great with them I just

928
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,230
haven't had enough experience with them

929
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,579
of really working with them to ever

930
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,410
become that good of them so it's

931
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:47,859
unfortunate but I'm I'm lousy at these

932
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,370
guys

933
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,899
I remember the gradient pretty well

934
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:55,209
because I did a bunch of work with

935
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,380
gradients at one point but I was doing

936
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,250
some implicit surface rasterization

937
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:03,420
stuff and yeah anyway closely on its

938
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,799
heels is ordinary differential equations

939
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,180
which despite the fact that they sound

940
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:09,309
like things that only a pure

941
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,409
mathematician would love they are

942
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:14,619
actually things that you do find

943
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:16,509
surprisingly common in game programming

944
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,429
if you actually want to do it right so

945
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,710
what an ordinary differential equation

946
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:23,319
is is it's seemingly a solution to what

947
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,389
appears to be or I should say it it

948
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,640
appears to be a solution to something

949
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,319
that sounds unsolvable when you state at

950
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,139
first but it turns out it actually does

951
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,400
work in practice you know thank you to

952
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,289
the two brilliant mathematicians who

953
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,410
figured this stuff out but basically

954
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:39,519
when you have things like if basic

955
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,039
calculus sorts of stuff that you might

956
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,289
want to do like position I mentioned

957
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:50,590
this just a moment ago position velocity

958
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:52,179
and acceleration right if you remember

959
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,460
from either high school physics or high

960
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,839
school calculus class then basically

961
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,490
what you have here is these functions

962
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,440
are derivatives of each other so a

963
00:34:57,489 --> 00:35:01,809
position is where something is in space

964
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,130
its first derivative is velocity which

965
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:05,199
is how fast things are moving and its

966
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,119
second derivative again all high school

967
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,429
calculus terms its second derivative is

968
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,670
acceleration okay so if I have a

969
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:14,710
function write a function of T which is

970
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,030
my position then I know its first

971
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,920
derivative which is usually written like

972
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,980
that is the velocity and its second

973
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,420
derivative is a succession now I will

974
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,920
end up once I start trying to work with

975
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,530
these things I'll end up in a very

976
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,190
unsavoury circumstance once I want to do

977
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:32,530
something with for example drag now drag

978
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,599
is for you know you've all heard of it

979
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,400
with respect to airplanes and cars

980
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,159
certainly

981
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,809
if I have something like a car you know

982
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:42,429
and I'm making a racing game well that's

983
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,820
the awful car that's let's try that

984
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:44,259
again

985
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,300
let's say I have some kind of futuristic

986
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,880
looking car here something more like

987
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,859
this right there we go oh man this car

988
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,519
is looking good dude look at that look

989
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,909
at it go

990
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,590
look at its majesty then certainly we're

991
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:58,989
all aware of the fact that as air comes

992
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:01,329
and it hits the surface of this car it

993
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:04,209
actually imparts some force to the car

994
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:06,940
and that force pushes the car backwards

995
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,559
in some sense so despite the fact that

996
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,420
the car is trying to accelerate it also

997
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:11,889
has to contend with the fact that it's

998
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,079
getting somewhat decelerated in the

999
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:16,089
direction it wants to go by the force of

1000
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,829
the air resistance or drag that's on the

1001
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,420
car in fact they do a lot of work with

1002
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:21,130
aerodynamics to write to try and make

1003
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,409
cars as aerodynamic as possible to kind

1004
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,780
of deflect air in a graceful fashion so

1005
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:29,710
that doesn't impart as much force onto

1006
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,600
the car as it otherwise would right well

1007
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,980
if you start to have drag the first

1008
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,239
thing that you'll learn in physics when

1009
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,670
you start to talk about drag is that

1010
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:40,329
it's proportional to the surface area of

1011
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:42,880
the thing getting hit by the air and the

1012
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:45,039
velocity of that air right how fast is

1013
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,940
the air going well the velocity right is

1014
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:51,759
in this space the velocity is in in the

1015
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,980
first derivative of position but the

1016
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,990
computation for drag drag is actually an

1017
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,358
acceleration drag is an acceleration

1018
00:36:55,989 --> 00:37:01,719
which is which operates down here right

1019
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:03,130
so that means that the force that you're

1020
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,929
trying to well I shouldn't say

1021
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,700
acceleration it's a force really that

1022
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:08,949
you know force an acceleration you can

1023
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:10,179
transfer by using F equals MA if you

1024
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:11,108
remember that for this class but you

1025
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:15,669
don't need to know that now don't worry

1026
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:18,789
about it anyway velocity if I'm going to

1027
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,670
try and compute it well the velocity is

1028
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:24,550
the thing that tells me how much force I

1029
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:27,460
have on my drag that's what tells me my

1030
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,410
drag force right but if velocity tells

1031
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,449
me my drag force and drag force is what

1032
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:32,980
I need to integrate up to get my

1033
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:36,399
velocity in the first place I've got

1034
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:38,590
this nasty cycle of this the the actual

1035
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,090
thing I'm trying to compute defines the

1036
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,190
quantity that I need to use to compute

1037
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,420
it so it's like you can't possibly solve

1038
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,820
this equation it's like something that

1039
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,260
depends on its own derivative right and

1040
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,640
you're just like I don't know what to do

1041
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,320
here I guess I just have to fudge it

1042
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,420
not true that is what ordinary

1043
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,010
differential equations are ordinary

1044
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,990
differential equations is essentially

1045
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,180
the study of equations that are their

1046
00:37:55,989 --> 00:37:59,949
own derivatives or integrals to however

1047
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:02,109
you want to want to look at it and

1048
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:03,789
basically these sorts of equations can

1049
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,289
actually be solved exactly for ordinary

1050
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:07,389
differential equations if you want to a

1051
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:08,829
lot of the times so you can actually

1052
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:11,469
make this work out precisely if you

1053
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,179
really want to and similarly another

1054
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:14,709
very typical one that's that's kind of

1055
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:16,690
fun that people don't think about very

1056
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,920
often but that's totally true another

1057
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,019
place you'll see ordinary different

1058
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,780
differential equations pop up is if you

1059
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:24,489
want to make zooming be proportional on

1060
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,050
distance from an object so for example

1061
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:28,809
let's say I've got an object and I've

1062
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,310
got a camera here is my camera this is

1063
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,860
my little you know what it's an eyeball

1064
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:35,500
you know my little eye that's looking at

1065
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:38,320
this thing right here's my little my

1066
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,550
little sphere that I'm looking at well a

1067
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,680
lot of times you might want to put

1068
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,760
zooming on the mouse wheel right and so

1069
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,989
basically what you want to do is as you

1070
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,460
roll the mouse wheel forwards or

1071
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,479
something you get closer and as you roll

1072
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,920
the mouse wheel backwards you get

1073
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,050
further away now when people implement

1074
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,210
this poorly and by the way I'm looking

1075
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,350
at you a lot of 3d software vendors out

1076
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,220
there because a lot of people implement

1077
00:38:53,349 --> 00:39:00,009
this incredibly poorly what they will do

1078
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:01,059
is they will for when you roll the mouse

1079
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,910
wheel or do whatever you going to do

1080
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:07,389
they will actually move you a constant

1081
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:10,119
amount for each click or as you sort of

1082
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:11,379
drag forwards or whatever they'll

1083
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,170
actually move you a constant amount

1084
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,910
closer to the thing and that's awful

1085
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,010
because since zooming when you get

1086
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:20,109
closer to something the amount that it

1087
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:22,450
gets bigger in your field of view is not

1088
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,730
the same depending on where you are from

1089
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:26,679
it if you're right next to an object and

1090
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,690
you step one foot forward closer to it

1091
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,819
it becomes huge in your field of view

1092
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,500
whereas if you were 50 feet away from it

1093
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,640
and you took one step forward its size

1094
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,289
would barely change at all

1095
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:36,519
so the concept that the user would ever

1096
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,500
want to step a constant distance is

1097
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,610
ludicrous right what they actually want

1098
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,739
to do is they want to step an

1099
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,570
ever-diminishing distance closer to it

1100
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:45,219
so they want to basically start out with

1101
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,269
large steps getting closer and then they

1102
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,529
want to get smaller and smaller and

1103
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:49,329
smaller and smaller so what does this

1104
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,490
mean well it means that the distance

1105
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:54,009
that you'd want to move is proportional

1106
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:55,509
to the distance itself so basically the

1107
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,580
derivative of the distance is

1108
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,770
proportional to the distance right

1109
00:39:57,579 --> 00:40:02,000
classic ordinary differential equation

1110
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:04,250
if we want to do a smooth

1111
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,059
in on an object zoom smoothly over time

1112
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:09,320
right animated so forget mouse wheel now

1113
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:10,789
we're trying to animate in on that

1114
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,930
object and I want to be a perfectly

1115
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:13,579
smooth zoom that operates at a variable

1116
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:14,750
framerate I've got a solve an ordinary

1117
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,519
differential equation because in order

1118
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,949
to do that I have to say that I always

1119
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:20,150
want during the whole time step no

1120
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,259
matter what the time that comes in I

1121
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,510
want to solve that equation to figure

1122
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,310
out what is the distance that if I was

1123
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,680
moving continuously would always

1124
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:29,000
continuously give me a movement distance

1125
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,940
that's proportional to the actual

1126
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,079
distance that I am right again we're

1127
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,789
near differential equations it's

1128
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:36,289
actually a very simple problem in order

1129
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:38,750
if equation differential equations

1130
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:39,800
Saul's sounds incredibly difficult if

1131
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,789
you don't know them but once you know

1132
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,170
them you're just like oh yeah that's

1133
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:43,550
space that's that's like an easy

1134
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,650
differential equation right that's like

1135
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,030
stuff that you know an OD e person would

1136
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:52,670
just be like oh yeah I did that day one

1137
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:56,810
in my class or day two or something all

1138
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:58,400
right so that's the calculus fellows

1139
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:01,279
those are those are those are the

1140
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,139
calculus fellows and again they're kind

1141
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,570
of tied pretty closely into two linear

1142
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:07,190
algebra here so then we get into stuff

1143
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:11,269
you know I said look you clitty in

1144
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:15,380
geometry stuff that you use a lot so

1145
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:16,699
basically complex numbers I mentioned

1146
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,980
those earlier where they were the kind

1147
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:20,929
of five plus 3i thing

1148
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,639
well basically complex numbers or rather

1149
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:25,519
the concept that you have sort of these

1150
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:28,009
extra specifiers so that numbers aren't

1151
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:31,699
just real values they got more parts of

1152
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:33,380
them actually non Euclidean geometry and

1153
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:36,230
that's sort of that sort of complex

1154
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,390
number concept come up again like I said

1155
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,469
I kind of alluded to the fact that they

1156
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:42,889
would in a way that you wouldn't expect

1157
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:45,230
if you just want to do even really basic

1158
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:47,118
stuff in three dimensions then obviously

1159
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,429
linear algebra will get you a lot of the

1160
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,588
way there but as soon as you want to

1161
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:53,960
rotate something if you ever want to do

1162
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:56,358
rotations then you step out of the world

1163
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,190
of comfortable linear algebra and

1164
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:00,889
Euclidian geometry and into the world of

1165
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,809
non Euclidean geometry which you

1166
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:05,358
sometimes still use well often still use

1167
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:08,750
linear algebra to work with but again

1168
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,619
the the Euclidean part falls away and so

1169
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,750
you typically have to do a bunch of

1170
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,300
stuff related to that but again not not

1171
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,769
on topic tonight so basically not

1172
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,530
including geometry you

1173
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:20,780
geometry on surfaces that have nothing

1174
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,430
to do with those nice pretty orthogonal

1175
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,070
ones that I drew before it they do not

1176
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:28,009
look like this where you've got a nice

1177
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,809
XYZ instead they are stuff like geometry

1178
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,730
on the surface of a sphere for example

1179
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:33,829
and so your coordinate systems might

1180
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,409
look something like that and they have

1181
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:40,219
weird properties like for example if I

1182
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:41,420
go the same distance in along the

1183
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:43,399
different directions I may not get back

1184
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,840
to the same place that I was on before

1185
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,010
like you know it's all wet this way and

1186
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,329
then that way I might not get the same

1187
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,950
places if I went this way and then that

1188
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:50,210
way which is you know what one of the

1189
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:52,460
sort of hallmarks you might expect from

1190
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,690
Euclidean geometry so you basically get

1191
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,829
a lot of interesting things that happen

1192
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,780
in non Euclidean geometry and you may

1193
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:57,980
ask why do I care about that and why is

1194
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,780
that having to do with rotations well

1195
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:04,190
the reason is because rotations in 3d

1196
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:07,730
space just plain aren't Euclidean the

1197
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,070
rules that they follow just just kind of

1198
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:12,940
defy your logic a little bit in terms of

1199
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,940
what you would expect to have happen

1200
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:18,769
excuse me with ordinary numbers one of

1201
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,690
the examples is they do not commute

1202
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:22,639
properly so for example if I have a

1203
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,590
rotation where you know I'm going to

1204
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,900
spin something around one axis and then

1205
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,550
I have another rotation of the same

1206
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,349
object that I want to apply where I'm

1207
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,170
going to rotate it around another axis I

1208
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:35,779
can't flip the order of these two things

1209
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,610
the the orientation that the object ends

1210
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,970
up in after I do these two rotations if

1211
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:42,710
I do a and then B the orientation of the

1212
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:44,599
object will not be the same as if I did

1213
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,699
B and then a now sometimes for certain

1214
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:48,380
rotations it will be but for the vast

1215
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:51,769
majority of rotations it simply isn't

1216
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:55,490
and so the attempt to represent these

1217
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:58,759
rotations has been a long and difficult

1218
00:43:55,489 --> 00:44:01,579
battle in computer science and in

1219
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,820
mathematics in general and there's lots

1220
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:07,279
of different ways in which these are

1221
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:11,950
attempt to be dealt with they in they

1222
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:18,280
include the exponential map they include

1223
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:18,279
Euler angles right they include

1224
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:26,420
quaternions they include duals of those

1225
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,650
right there's just a whole family of

1226
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,329
things Oh

1227
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,940
Rodrigues parameters

1228
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:34,029
right or Euler parameters which are not

1229
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,230
the same as Euler angles etc etc

1230
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:38,690
basically there's a whole bunch of

1231
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:40,219
different things that people have come

1232
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,420
up with to try and represent these and

1233
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,789
work with them efficiently and

1234
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,519
especially the most popular ones in use

1235
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:48,050
today which are basically these guys

1236
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:52,570
quaternions and their duals

1237
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:55,340
those are all about doing operations

1238
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:57,590
that are in non Luc Euclidean geometry

1239
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,170
space a quest hernion for example is

1240
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:02,059
four-dimensional and it is in four

1241
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,820
dimensions but constrained to the

1242
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:07,820
surface of a four-dimensional sphere or

1243
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,019
hyper sphere more specifically and so if

1244
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,150
you think about that example I just gave

1245
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:12,769
where I said here is a look this is a 3d

1246
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,940
sphere I mean it's actually 2d because I

1247
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:16,159
drew it in 2d but imagine in three

1248
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,829
dimensions you have a sphere a ball and

1249
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:23,059
you've got essentially two parameters

1250
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:24,409
right that define the sphere I'm sorry

1251
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:26,150
that that would move you around the

1252
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:28,909
sphere right a sphere that is a surface

1253
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,320
so it's only got you know two degrees of

1254
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:32,690
freedom from any point on the sphere I

1255
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:35,000
could only really move in any two in any

1256
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:38,210
two orthogonal directions at any given

1257
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,429
time right but another way to think

1258
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:43,159
about that sphere is well we could use

1259
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:45,049
three parameters to specify where we are

1260
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:48,769
on the sphere right and we could just

1261
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:50,000
say that the only possible sets of those

1262
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:52,130
three parameters that we're willing to

1263
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,389
consider are the ones that lie on the

1264
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,559
sphere because three you know three

1265
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:56,239
parameters would allow us to specify

1266
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,099
anywhere in space you could be out here

1267
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,500
or here or here right anywhere in space

1268
00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:02,299
3d will give us but we just want this

1269
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,269
one sphere that's embedded in that 3d

1270
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:08,330
space we could simply constrain our our

1271
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:09,679
X Y Z's using some additional constraint

1272
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:11,960
and I can tell you that that constraint

1273
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,989
happens to be basically that the length

1274
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,030
of that vector right equals some radius

1275
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:18,349
values but that's that's a separate

1276
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,890
that's a separate issue so don't worry

1277
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:20,690
about that

1278
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:21,980
point being we'd use a constraint to say

1279
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:25,610
that it has to fall on the surface of a

1280
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:27,349
sphere okay the same thing could be done

1281
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:30,470
in four dimensions we could say we have

1282
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:32,539
X Y Z W we have four parameters which

1283
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:33,949
would give us anywhere in 4d space but

1284
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,929
we're going to constrain it to be on the

1285
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:38,210
surface of a four dimensional hyper

1286
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:40,039
sphere which gives us only three free

1287
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,720
parameters essentially but that we're

1288
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:42,409
representing us for now if that doesn't

1289
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:44,328
make your mind

1290
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:45,379
explode I don't know what does point

1291
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:47,089
being those are the sorts of things that

1292
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,108
you have to work with and believe me

1293
00:46:47,088 --> 00:46:50,119
after you start thinking about them

1294
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:51,710
somehow they start to become second

1295
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:53,539
nature even though they are incredibly

1296
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,460
complicated and involved weird stuff

1297
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:57,319
like trying to visualize four dimensions

1298
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,769
which no human can really do adequately

1299
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:02,358
because we live in only three but not

1300
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:04,099
only do Quatro names involve that they

1301
00:47:02,358 --> 00:47:05,269
also involve our old friend complex

1302
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:07,849
numbers because not only do they

1303
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:09,409
consider having two parts they actually

1304
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:10,970
consider having all four parts and their

1305
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,019
arithmetic is defined in terms of those

1306
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:14,959
parts so a quaternion

1307
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:19,690
will often be written in something that

1308
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:25,960
looks like you know a plus bi plus c j

1309
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:28,608
plus DK where I J and K are all sort of

1310
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,159
things that resemble this kind of AI

1311
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:32,420
they all have rules such as any two of

1312
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:34,969
them multiplied together equal negative

1313
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:37,338
one and these sorts of things and so

1314
00:47:34,969 --> 00:47:38,358
quaternions themselves would be very

1315
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:39,949
familiar to anyone who worked with

1316
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:42,739
complex numbers they're sort of an

1317
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:43,669
extended version of that and again stuff

1318
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:44,750
that kind of makes your head explode a

1319
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:47,450
little bit if you're not used to math

1320
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:49,940
but is absolutely commonplace in game

1321
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:51,769
programming make no mistake about it

1322
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,659
so yes non-euclidean geometry and

1323
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:56,329
complex number sorts of stuff come up

1324
00:47:53,659 --> 00:47:58,519
again surprisingly often if you're doing

1325
00:47:56,329 --> 00:48:00,740
any 3d programming at all you will

1326
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,750
basically butt heads with them almost

1327
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:05,479
immediately all right

1328
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,400
so beyond that we've got sort of a bunch

1329
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,869
of other guys who I'll just mention I

1330
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,930
don't want to spend too much time on

1331
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:19,400
them because again like I've only got

1332
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:21,048
what if I got 12 minutes left okay so -

1333
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,220
what else we got in the grab bag of

1334
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:23,630
things and again these are all things I

1335
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:26,000
personally had to implement at some

1336
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:28,900
point or another I'm only doing maths in

1337
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,389
games that I actually had to use myself

1338
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,700
and we're only I still got about seven

1339
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:37,818
more things here to list okay so -

1340
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:41,719
apology - apology I mentioned on the

1341
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:43,250
stream actually already - apology is the

1342
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:45,199
study you know I'm gonna go ahead and

1343
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,219
I'm gonna go get myself some fresh room

1344
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,679
here because these things aren't as

1345
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:50,028
related anymore topology are dimensioned

1346
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,129
on the screen basically topology is the

1347
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:53,389
study of manifolds and how they're

1348
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,818
connected in this sort of stuff now

1349
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:56,239
what's a manifold well basically if I

1350
00:48:55,818 --> 00:48:57,349
have

1351
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:59,089
kind of a space we've already talked

1352
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:00,949
about one that sphere for example would

1353
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:03,500
be an example of a manifold basically if

1354
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:05,299
I have some kind of a space so like

1355
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,090
before we said let's say we have a 3d

1356
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,880
space so we have basically an X a Y and

1357
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:12,200
a Z vector in our vectors and we can

1358
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,519
specify our positions let me write that

1359
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,019
vertically I want to get used to writing

1360
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,630
them vertically again because you know

1361
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:19,099
we're gonna be doing some math you stuff

1362
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,390
anyway so if I've got points in

1363
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:22,789
three-dimensional space you know they

1364
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:25,250
could be anywhere if I start to talk

1365
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:27,500
about some subset of the entire space

1366
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:29,239
that basically form some kind of a shape

1367
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,710
like a sphere but it could be anything

1368
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:32,929
else you know like some kind of a weird

1369
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:34,639
strip you know like a road that's been

1370
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:37,399
laid down or something like this right

1371
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,750
like maybe I've got my 3d terrain and

1372
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,340
I've got you know here's my trees or

1373
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,079
whatever and then there's a road that

1374
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,809
goes through it maybe I want to talk

1375
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,849
about that road as a surface that's an

1376
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:49,039
example of a manifold a manifold is

1377
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:50,839
something that is some lower dimensional

1378
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,449
space in this case a two-dimensional

1379
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,700
space writes a flat surface 2d that's

1380
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:58,039
embedded inside of a 3-dimensional space

1381
00:49:55,699 --> 00:50:00,159
so it's in 3d but it's only two

1382
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:02,329
dimensions worth of information right

1383
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,309
that's example of a manifold and

1384
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:06,619
topology is based in the study of these

1385
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:09,440
things how they are connected how they

1386
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:10,639
can be represented and sort of things

1387
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,110
that you might need to know about them

1388
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:13,969
so for example on the stream we already

1389
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:16,490
talked about the concept of toroidal

1390
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:18,829
versus disc topology I said basically if

1391
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:21,169
you have a world where if I go off one

1392
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:22,969
edge I come back on the other you know

1393
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,220
if my guy can wrap around that's an

1394
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:27,769
example of toroidal topology because

1395
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:30,169
it's as if you were on the surface of a

1396
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:31,969
torus right of a donut basically you

1397
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,099
know like an inner tube because you can

1398
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:36,379
keep going around in either of the two

1399
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:38,389
major directions and you just kind of

1400
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,730
loop around the thing right imagine an

1401
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:41,989
ant walking on an inner tube you get

1402
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,639
that exact same thing where it can just

1403
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:45,379
walk around and around and around in one

1404
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:46,940
direction and never seem to stop and

1405
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,360
until it realizes it's just walking in

1406
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,740
circles

1407
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,170
it doesn't realize it because it just

1408
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:53,419
thinks it was always going forward again

1409
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:54,519
Terrel topology versus disk topology

1410
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,889
would be if you could get to the end

1411
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:59,630
disk topology would basically be I start

1412
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:01,279
walking and I get to a barrier that I

1413
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,170
just I can't go past anymore and so we

1414
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,090
decided already we basically already did

1415
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,710
a topological decision in our game we

1416
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,840
decided to have to write toriel topology

1417
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,769
instead of just topology just something

1418
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,780
to think about that

1419
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:14,300
topology right and there's a lot of

1420
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:15,440
stuff to talk about in topology some of

1421
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,900
it comes up and games some of it not so

1422
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,300
often but it's it's a pretty wide field

1423
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:23,119
certainly so moving on from there

1424
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,769
Minkowski algebra which is not really a

1425
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,329
field of mathematics I wouldn't say it's

1426
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:32,329
just a thing that comes up a lot because

1427
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:33,619
of G JK g JK is well not just GJ k but

1428
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:35,449
collision let me just say more broadly

1429
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:36,139
cuz it's not just it's not just use okay

1430
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:37,669
really

1431
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:39,170
it's basically collision detection and

1432
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,900
we may even use it in the collision

1433
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,700
detection in handmade hero basically

1434
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,309
Minkowski algebra is the algebra of

1435
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:49,399
shapes it basically does you does things

1436
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:52,400
like if I have a square and a circle I

1437
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,079
can add them together and get a rounded

1438
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,849
rectangle that's the world's worst

1439
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,130
rounded rectangle and basically I do

1440
00:51:55,849 --> 00:52:00,230
that by tracing out the circle at each

1441
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:02,869
of the four corners of the square for

1442
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:05,030
example and then taking that sort of

1443
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:08,449
entire space that was formed by them

1444
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:10,820
right typically this is used in games it

1445
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:14,210
was used actually at least as early as

1446
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:16,010
quake it possibly before then I I don't

1447
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:20,659
know how what the earliest example of

1448
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:22,880
minkowski's algebra and games is and two

1449
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:24,920
typical uses of it one is the gjk

1450
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,039
algorithm which I will not explain here

1451
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,750
but that uses Minkowski algebra at its

1452
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:33,380
core to do collision detection between

1453
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,789
moving convex solids and and so that's

1454
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,440
one example that's very common but

1455
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:39,230
another example is just simple world

1456
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,090
shrinkage and growing growing and what

1457
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,940
that basically is is if I have a world

1458
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:47,170
let's say this this box here and I've

1459
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:49,400
got a dude in the world who has say a

1460
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:51,950
spherical or cylindrical or something

1461
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:55,519
collision representation I can choose to

1462
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:58,639
do my collision checking always based on

1463
00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:00,440
trying to intersect circles with these

1464
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,579
line segments that define my boundary or

1465
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,769
something with this but there's another

1466
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:05,840
option which is to simply shrink the

1467
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:07,969
world in such a way that it now

1468
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,460
approximates what the sphere could

1469
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:11,929
actually go if the sphere was shrunk

1470
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,300
down to a point so you're basically

1471
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:16,009
taking the world and growing it by the

1472
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:18,410
sphere and shrinking the player down to

1473
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:20,080
the point and the collision that happens

1474
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:22,819
when a point moves around a sphere

1475
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,569
expanded world is the same as a sphere

1476
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,210
moving around

1477
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:28,370
then on expanded world so basically this

1478
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:32,240
allows you to do simple point operations

1479
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:34,009
or line operations for movement against

1480
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,359
world geometry without ever having to

1481
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:37,400
deal with the fact that things are

1482
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,690
actually were actually spheres or

1483
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,760
cylinders in their collision

1484
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:42,829
representations and again I believe

1485
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:52,280
quake used that in its collision

1486
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:53,299
detector so that's mikowski algebra it

1487
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,170
does come up a lot in collision

1488
00:53:53,300 --> 00:54:00,200
detection obviously control theory very

1489
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:02,180
popular control theory is basically you

1490
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:07,819
know the study of things like feedback

1491
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:10,129
systems and you know Springs and these

1492
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,380
sorts of things there's things like the

1493
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:13,670
proportional PDC's proportional

1494
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,760
derivative controller these sorts things

1495
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:18,440
use a lot in robotics basically and we

1496
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,330
use it in games a lot to control

1497
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,039
variables that we want to control over

1498
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:24,500
time so for example if we want to do

1499
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:26,659
motion stuff where we have something

1500
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,030
that we want to kind of like come you

1501
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:30,739
know sort of pick up some speed and then

1502
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,150
slow down again you know we might use

1503
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:34,369
control theory to kind of do that if we

1504
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,720
have stuff like a missile that's chasing

1505
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:38,509
a target and it's supposed to turn the

1506
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:39,919
slow kind of rate again control theory

1507
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,360
it's basically all the sorts of stuff

1508
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,780
you might do in the real world to

1509
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:47,870
control real world robotics weaponry

1510
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,730
these sorts of things that we want to do

1511
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:51,109
in games to simulate the motion of

1512
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:53,389
things as they might move in the real

1513
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:55,220
world you know and that's that's very

1514
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,929
common again we'll be doing that in

1515
00:54:55,219 --> 00:54:58,009
hand-made here a bunch proportional

1516
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:00,049
derivative controls will probably make

1517
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:00,230
an appearance other sorts of things like

1518
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,470
that

1519
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:08,150
definitely very popular ok interval

1520
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:09,289
arithmetic what is that a lot of people

1521
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:12,340
probably have never heard of that

1522
00:55:09,289 --> 00:55:17,000
interval arithmetic is basically a

1523
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:18,769
arithmetic on ranges just exactly what

1524
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,269
it sounds like basically what happens is

1525
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:22,519
sometimes you need to compute things

1526
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:24,530
over spacial areas and that's where this

1527
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,340
really comes in handy I don't know that

1528
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,630
that's necessarily what it was

1529
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,260
originally designed for I don't think it

1530
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,309
was I think it might have been

1531
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,450
originally designed for automatic

1532
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:32,420
differentiation or something like this

1533
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:35,619
but point being I've used it a bunch for

1534
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,619
area computations

1535
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:41,039
what it allows you to do is it allows

1536
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:42,960
you to evaluate equations on entire

1537
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,670
ranges of values instead of just one

1538
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,170
value at a time so you have some

1539
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:52,320
equation x squared plus 5x or something

1540
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:55,170
like this that you want to evaluate and

1541
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,850
instead of evaluating it for just X you

1542
00:55:55,170 --> 00:56:00,090
want to evaluate it for all the numbers

1543
00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:03,329
between a and B all of them so if this

1544
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:05,820
was 3 and this was 1700 you want to

1545
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:08,519
basically be able to call X f of X and

1546
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:11,640
find out what this equation can take in

1547
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:13,079
terms of its output for all the values

1548
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:14,819
in between there and there right and

1549
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:17,009
that's what interval arithmetic allows

1550
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,870
you to do now where do I use this I use

1551
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,880
this when I'm trying to compute what

1552
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:23,730
functions will do over regions so for

1553
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,519
example if I have a grid system for my

1554
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:28,050
game and we're bucketing things up let's

1555
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:29,880
say even in a tile map and I have a

1556
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:32,700
particular tile and the tile map I want

1557
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,920
to know what the maximum water level

1558
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:36,449
could be and I have a function for the

1559
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,420
water level I want to know what the

1560
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:41,879
maximum water level is in here I can do

1561
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:44,159
interval arithmetic on it to figure out

1562
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,050
what that maximum would be I'll get out

1563
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,609
the minimum and maximum for it in one

1564
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,990
fell swoop instead of having to do a

1565
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,120
bunch of point sampling to figure out

1566
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:53,129
where it is very powerful for that sort

1567
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,949
of region checking I've used it a lot in

1568
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:58,590
the past really cool pretty simple to

1569
00:56:55,949 --> 00:57:00,000
learn and very very powerful in certain

1570
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:04,050
in the right circumstances certainly

1571
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,820
okay we've got graph theory probably

1572
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,990
needs no explanation graph theory is

1573
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,030
basically the thing that allows you to

1574
00:57:06,989 --> 00:57:11,699
do all your studies of pathing and and

1575
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,530
graph traversal stuff like this even

1576
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:15,089
simple stuff like path finding on grids

1577
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,220
is often broken down to graph theory

1578
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:19,019
problems where you know we've got sort

1579
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:20,969
of these sorts of searches and

1580
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:22,980
technically graph theory and you might

1581
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:24,719
say operations research it's it's hard

1582
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,760
to say what you want to call these

1583
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,069
things I'm not again not a mathematician

1584
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,170
and I'm not a pennant on these things so

1585
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:33,510
what each algorithm actually falls into

1586
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:35,460
in terms of discipline I may never quite

1587
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:36,750
get right they might say it's graph

1588
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,829
theory but really that's technically an

1589
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,880
Operations research problem but

1590
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,230
operation research is kind of an

1591
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,360
umbrella term I feel like graph theories

1592
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,800
in there I mean I don't know so you know

1593
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,150
if you really want to know try to go dig

1594
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,910
up a good math like maybe Mathematica or

1595
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:50,318
that online what's that thing mathworld

1596
00:57:48,909 --> 00:57:51,429
there's that thing that that Wolfram

1597
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:54,818
bought that was basically a giant

1598
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:57,250
compendium of Matthieu things anyway so

1599
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:59,469
if you've got things like iíve got some

1600
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:01,119
series of spatial things and I want to

1601
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:02,649
do pathing between them find out how I

1602
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,410
can get from one to the other I want to

1603
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:07,329
do stuff like figure out you know what

1604
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:11,230
the widest span is or something like

1605
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:13,059
this on on a level on a connected set of

1606
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:15,190
levels or even tiles that sort of thing

1607
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:17,289
just searches and understanding things

1608
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:19,778
about layouts like that that's all graph

1609
00:58:17,289 --> 00:58:21,278
theory in there and studies of graph

1610
00:58:19,778 --> 00:58:22,510
sorts of things so pathing is the

1611
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:23,798
typical example that you'll often see

1612
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:27,520
but there's a bunch of other stuff that

1613
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:28,989
you might want to do in there oh man

1614
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:29,980
okay so I've got a couple more to do and

1615
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:31,318
only one minute left we might go a

1616
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:34,059
little bit of wrong a little bit long

1617
00:58:31,318 --> 00:58:35,288
but anyway operations wreathes research

1618
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:36,910
which I wrote down briefly but I'll

1619
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:37,720
write down again cuz then we've got this

1620
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:39,578
sort of another thing in there

1621
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:41,500
operations research I use a lot now

1622
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:43,119
basically the sort of the umbrella term

1623
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,130
for figuring out how you gonna optimize

1624
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,230
things so you'll see things like the

1625
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:49,630
metropolis algorithm right which is a

1626
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:51,250
pretty powerful one it's kind of the the

1627
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:53,380
be-all and end-all algorithm when you're

1628
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,480
like I just don't know how to solve this

1629
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,278
problem usually that means you solve it

1630
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,139
this way with the metropolis album right

1631
00:58:57,278 --> 00:59:02,489
basically what operations research is is

1632
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:04,868
they deal with minimizing or maximizing

1633
00:59:02,489 --> 00:59:06,848
something right so basically you have

1634
00:59:04,869 --> 00:59:08,349
some criteria and this is why it

1635
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:09,880
overlaps with the path thing again if

1636
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:11,019
you want to find the shortest route

1637
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,160
between two things that would be

1638
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:13,690
operations research if you want to

1639
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:16,210
figure out the optimal distribution of

1640
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:17,889
some quantity among different parties

1641
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:20,318
based on some weight so that sort of

1642
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:22,778
thing you get that again you want to do

1643
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,699
something like figure out the most

1644
00:59:22,778 --> 00:59:26,500
optimal ordering for a set of ascending

1645
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:29,460
language instructions this guy right

1646
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:32,289
here I've actually done that before you

1647
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,000
get you get operations research anytime

1648
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:37,150
you want to try to maximize or minimize

1649
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,239
some criteria given a set of rules that

1650
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:41,680
you can use to structure something and

1651
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,679
it's very very general right you get a

1652
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:46,358
lot of stuff that can happen in there

1653
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,649
okay so very quickly I'll just throw out

1654
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:49,019
the last couple of years since we're out

1655
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:52,269
of time

1656
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:53,980
probability and statistics obviously is

1657
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:55,298
something that we'll be using because

1658
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,469
we'll be picking random numbers and

1659
00:59:55,298 --> 00:59:57,969
trying to do stuff where we determine

1660
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,379
what like what's the probability that

1661
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,709
the player will get a certain thing and

1662
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,420
we want to

1663
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,769
control that in our level design so

1664
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,880
obviously probability the stats probably

1665
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:05,230
don't need much introduction of where

1666
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,930
they're useful you use them all the time

1667
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:09,039
even in very simple ways that sort of

1668
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:10,529
stuff if you want to control

1669
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,969
distributions and other things like this

1670
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:14,830
and then there's also of course all the

1671
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:16,480
discrete math topics which I don't

1672
01:00:14,829 --> 01:00:18,190
really know very much about you

1673
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,050
typically use leave them to the FS where

1674
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:23,369
it's what you have probability and and

1675
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:25,599
pseudo-random number generators right

1676
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:27,579
obviously those sorts of things all

1677
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,830
involve the study of numbers at a very

1678
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:31,420
deep level and they're the sort of basis

1679
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:33,009
for all that stuff so any cryptography

1680
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,079
that you do anytime you generate random

1681
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:36,550
numbers you're all leaning on all the

1682
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:40,029
stuff that people have done sort of in

1683
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:43,180
that field ok and so I'm trying to think

1684
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:46,150
if there's anything I forgot we're right

1685
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:47,679
on time so I'm hoping that I didn't of

1686
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,820
stuff that I've done these are only the

1687
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,169
things that I could remember so it's

1688
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:53,050
possibly that I had to do some things

1689
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:55,858
that I just didn't remember but I

1690
01:00:53,050 --> 01:01:03,280
believe that I got all of the major ones

1691
01:00:55,858 --> 01:01:08,108
there ok alright so hopefully that is a

1692
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:10,420
a final sort of place I can point people

1693
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:14,049
now that's like if you have an hour and

1694
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:17,079
you want to know what kinds of math you

1695
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:20,680
should know if you're going to be a game

1696
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:26,019
programmer that's the stuff that I had

1697
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:28,868
to learn I don't really regret any of it

1698
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:30,579
I feel like all of the math I've learned

1699
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:33,430
in all of those disciplines was all

1700
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:36,579
pretty darn cool and it's allowed me to

1701
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:39,399
always approach things with sort of a

1702
01:01:36,579 --> 01:01:41,170
lot more weaponry than I would have had

1703
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,820
if I'd had to just kind of muddle

1704
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:44,050
through it as a programmer and I think a

1705
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:47,200
lot of the solutions that I come up with

1706
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:50,710
would have been worse and so that's what

1707
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:53,169
I can say about that and so starting

1708
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:56,530
tomorrow we will start learning about

1709
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:58,900
vectors and start programming with them

1710
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:00,519
so you can see how they work and that

1711
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,930
will be the first thing that we'll we'll

1712
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:04,119
start off and that of course is linear

1713
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:06,098
algebra and geometry and trigonometry is

1714
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:07,900
right in that wheelhouse that's what

1715
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:09,190
we'll be starting with whether we get to

1716
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,440
any of these other ones in the course of

1717
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:13,059
hand-made hero will largely be dependent

1718
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,559
on what we need to do

1719
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:17,170
but I can guarantee you we will probably

1720
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,110
hit at least four or five of them if not

1721
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:22,539
all of them in the course of the game

1722
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:24,340
somewhere that is how common a lot of

1723
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:26,289
these things are if you want to do stuff

1724
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,519
right and actually kind of know what

1725
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,869
you're doing is just hacking it and

1726
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:31,389
crossing your fingers that it works so

1727
01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:34,210
yeah so there you go let's open it up to

1728
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:36,219
questions please put Q quality Q : in

1729
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:38,980
front of your question so that I will be

1730
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:40,750
able to see it and please try to keep it

1731
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:42,880
to stuff we've done in today's stream or

1732
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:44,380
on a previous stream in fact today's

1733
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,700
stream but it might be good to kind of

1734
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,630
restrict it mostly to mask questions

1735
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:51,210
tonight since that's all we've done

1736
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:51,210
today but you know we'll see how it goes

1737
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:11,069
all right let's see it got to give you

1738
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:11,069
guys a chance to catch up here let's see

1739
01:03:11,969 --> 01:03:19,529
do you even breathe bro uh not much no I

1740
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:22,659
mean I I probably should breathe more

1741
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:24,250
it's true you said that toriel topology

1742
01:03:22,659 --> 01:03:25,659
means that if you walk in one direction

1743
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,579
you'll eventually get back to where you

1744
01:03:25,659 --> 01:03:29,409
started doesn't a sphere also have this

1745
01:03:27,579 --> 01:03:32,279
property how do we know our world as a

1746
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:38,589
torus and not a sphere that is a

1747
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:42,730
fantastic fantastic question so let's

1748
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:45,070
take a look actually the answer to your

1749
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:49,440
question has to do with how we have

1750
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:52,990
unwrapped it in and you can kind of see

1751
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,880
it's for lack of a better way of saying

1752
01:03:52,989 --> 01:04:00,009
it you can kind of see with how the

1753
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:02,860
motion on the torus works versus how the

1754
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:04,810
motion on the sphere works so if you

1755
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,220
think about a sphere and I kind of I

1756
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:08,860
wish I may be I should eventually

1757
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:10,239
install some kind of a 3d package on

1758
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,590
this so we can look at 3d things a

1759
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,929
little bit easier because my drawings

1760
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:15,280
are not going to be very good

1761
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:18,279
unfortunately but if you take a look at

1762
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,230
what happens on a sphere right we have

1763
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,510
an XY coordinate system in our game

1764
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:24,909
right we were moving in XY coordinates

1765
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:26,830
and what we were doing in XY coordinates

1766
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:28,539
is we were saying that we

1767
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:30,009
essentially have a tile map right you

1768
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:31,300
remember us constructing this tile map

1769
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:35,020
and that tile map was the same

1770
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:37,750
everywhere right so you know we have a Y

1771
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:39,940
that goes up we have an X that goes over

1772
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:42,730
and we basically have this sort of grid

1773
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:45,010
that were that where things are always

1774
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:46,900
square right there's always a square and

1775
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:48,190
no matter how far you go in any

1776
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,690
direction even if you wrap all the way

1777
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:51,840
around you're gonna see exactly this

1778
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:53,559
kind of thing around you locally right

1779
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,180
well if you think about what would

1780
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:57,699
happen on a sphere right

1781
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:59,019
imagine that we started kind of along

1782
01:04:57,699 --> 01:05:00,789
we're on the earth and we started along

1783
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:02,530
the equator somewhere and when we're

1784
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:04,239
when we're right on that equator right

1785
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:06,310
things actually do look kind of like

1786
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:09,519
that right they do look kind of like

1787
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:12,219
they would here but ask yourself if I

1788
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:15,340
was to take that equatorial line and

1789
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:18,759
divide it up amongst the the tile maps

1790
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:21,460
how many tiles would I have around the

1791
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,380
equator right now remember as we go

1792
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:25,090
upward we're still retaining that

1793
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,440
two-dimensional coordinate system so

1794
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:28,420
we're still talking essentially about

1795
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,700
lat/long lines like they would be on the

1796
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:32,800
earth and if you know what happens if

1797
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:35,469
you ever looked at a globe basically the

1798
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,430
space the size of the rings of those

1799
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:38,500
lat/long lines

1800
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:41,619
continues to diminish as you go upwards

1801
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,030
so if I had you know I don't know how

1802
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:45,969
many tiles you want to consider if I

1803
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:47,890
have 32 tiles around the equator before

1804
01:05:45,969 --> 01:05:49,419
I wrapped around by the time I got up

1805
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:51,279
here I would be down to something like

1806
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,670
four tiles and then when I got up to the

1807
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:57,850
very pole I just have like one

1808
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:59,860
vanishingly small tile right so the

1809
01:05:57,849 --> 01:06:01,929
reason that we are a toroidal topology

1810
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:04,900
and not a sphere topology is because we

1811
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:09,279
enforce the fact that the dimension of

1812
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:11,530
our tile map does not diminish in any

1813
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,710
direction we always have the same number

1814
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:17,080
of tiles width and height wise right no

1815
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:19,240
matter where you are the width of our

1816
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:21,610
tile map in terms of tiles the count of

1817
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:24,309
tiles along the y-axis does not depend

1818
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:26,380
on the x axis location and vice versa on

1819
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:28,239
a sphere that would not be true on a

1820
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,769
sphere we would have to basically modify

1821
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,919
how many tiles there were as we went

1822
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:37,420
upward or modify the size of those tiles

1823
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:40,349
right furthermore when you actually got

1824
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:42,240
up to this point all of these tile lines

1825
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:44,699
would actually vanish into a single

1826
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:46,259
point right and at that single point

1827
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:48,689
where they vanished you would no longer

1828
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,400
know even which tile you were on so when

1829
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:52,200
you went to wrap around to the other

1830
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,639
side of the world you could essentially

1831
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:56,609
the player would be free to almost

1832
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:58,650
choose to be on any of the tile paths

1833
01:06:56,610 --> 01:07:00,750
when they got up there right if we

1834
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,880
didn't shrink down does that make sense

1835
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,019
so basically there's two choices right

1836
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,150
we could either shrink the number of

1837
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:08,250
tiles or keep the tiles number the same

1838
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:09,840
but have them all definition size till

1839
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:11,190
they got to a singularity point and

1840
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,620
that's what happens at the top of that

1841
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:16,050
sphere so topologically speaking we

1842
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:18,150
basically have no options on a sphere

1843
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:20,250
for actually preserving that coordinate

1844
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:22,380
system that we wanted without making

1845
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:27,539
some very significant sacrifices by

1846
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:29,550
contrast on a torus right don't know if

1847
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:32,429
I can draw one here by contrast on a

1848
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:35,519
torus these lines never converge right

1849
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:37,739
basically the ring around here right and

1850
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:40,170
the ring around here they never get

1851
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:41,789
closer together they never the the

1852
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:43,470
spacing between these is always

1853
01:07:41,789 --> 01:07:46,920
equidistant the whole way around the

1854
01:07:43,469 --> 01:07:49,619
torus right so we can always lay down a

1855
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,059
grid and that grid never gets wider or

1856
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:55,230
smaller no matter where we are on the

1857
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:57,480
torus right and and that's why yeah

1858
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:59,219
that's why that that is is the way it is

1859
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,179
oh dear

1860
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:04,619
well we have a bit of a we have a bit of

1861
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:06,299
a problem ladies and gentlemen the

1862
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:10,679
laptop has run out of batteries but

1863
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:14,010
unfortunately it's the laptop that has

1864
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:15,809
the questions that has the questions on

1865
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:18,989
it oh boy

1866
01:08:15,809 --> 01:08:20,550
well that is unfortunate I guess we will

1867
01:08:18,989 --> 01:08:23,519
have to pause the stream for a minute

1868
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:29,720
here here at 9:10 plus for one second

1869
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:29,720
while I get a battery of some kind Oh No

1870
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:07,328
okay that was unfortunate

1871
01:09:01,809 --> 01:09:18,069
lesson learned it's true my laptop can

1872
01:09:07,328 --> 01:09:19,479
not go uh how horrible well lesson

1873
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:22,059
learned I guess I'm going to have to get

1874
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:25,828
a spare but like this laptop basically

1875
01:09:22,059 --> 01:09:29,048
can't last hardly at all it dies

1876
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:30,998
immediately basically I do not know why

1877
01:09:29,048 --> 01:09:32,618
I have no idea why I don't know if it's

1878
01:09:30,998 --> 01:09:34,778
just that the battery's old and of

1879
01:09:32,618 --> 01:09:36,248
course Linux always reports that it has

1880
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:38,739
like half the battery left or something

1881
01:09:36,248 --> 01:09:40,358
and then it dies so it's like you're you

1882
01:09:38,738 --> 01:09:43,149
don't even get really any warning that

1883
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:45,489
the laptop is about to die it just goes

1884
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:49,420
away so unfortunately I will have to

1885
01:09:45,488 --> 01:09:53,169
restart so okay alright the laptop is

1886
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:58,529
back now thankfully and so let's see

1887
01:09:53,170 --> 01:10:02,889
let's get hex chat open here hex chat

1888
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:08,498
there we go so at least we can see the

1889
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:10,769
questions again and and now all right

1890
01:10:08,498 --> 01:10:14,288
so please if you had a question

1891
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:17,230
obviously I didn't catch it because the

1892
01:10:14,288 --> 01:10:18,189
laptop died so please repost your

1893
01:10:17,229 --> 01:10:20,948
question with the Q :

1894
01:10:18,189 --> 01:10:23,828
and I will reap ick up where we left off

1895
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:27,939
now that I can actually see questions

1896
01:10:23,828 --> 01:10:33,399
again yeah fantastic

1897
01:10:27,939 --> 01:10:34,960
gotta get a got to get a power brick for

1898
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:37,808
this room so it'll always be plugged in

1899
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:39,279
if it's in here yeah do you think it's

1900
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,989
important to clarify that many of these

1901
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,639
subjects are things you can learn as you

1902
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:45,428
need them and it's more of an overview

1903
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:49,239
of math of what math is using games not

1904
01:10:45,429 --> 01:10:52,210
what is needed as a baseline yes well I

1905
01:10:49,238 --> 01:10:53,379
mean I hopefully I said that relatively

1906
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:55,929
clearly when I said it stuff that I

1907
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,219
learned as I went but but yeah you don't

1908
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:58,690
need to learn it to start game

1909
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:00,698
programming at all but of course as

1910
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:01,808
you've seen on handmade hero you've been

1911
01:11:00,698 --> 01:11:03,488
able to probably follow most of the

1912
01:11:01,809 --> 01:11:05,170
stuff that I did and hadn't had to do

1913
01:11:03,488 --> 01:11:07,689
that so you kinda you'll see as we go

1914
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:11,260
forward in programming exactly when each

1915
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:13,089
thing kicks in and it's like that's the

1916
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,409
that you would want to learn it in terms

1917
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:15,610
of if you are starting game partly

1918
01:11:14,408 --> 01:11:18,488
though I highly recommend learning as

1919
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:20,889
much math as you can as you go basically

1920
01:11:18,488 --> 01:11:22,328
like you know just constantly be

1921
01:11:20,889 --> 01:11:24,069
studying in the background if you can be

1922
01:11:22,328 --> 01:11:25,988
until you know a fair bit of math

1923
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:28,210
because there's really a ton of it and

1924
01:11:25,988 --> 01:11:29,859
like I actually wish I knew more ah

1925
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:31,149
there's a bunch notice I don't know like

1926
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:33,009
I don't know a geometric algebra for

1927
01:11:31,149 --> 01:11:34,509
example and I wish I did I only know

1928
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:36,130
like the barest little minimum of it

1929
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:43,599
there's a bunch of things that I but I

1930
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:45,400
wish I knew so I think you were confused

1931
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:47,800
about non Euclidean geometry the space

1932
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:49,420
of most 3d games is the Euclidean well

1933
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,130
that's what I said if you remember I

1934
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:52,510
said the 3d space most games Euclidean

1935
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,889
but what I said is non Euclidean

1936
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,909
geometry you have to use almost

1937
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:59,440
immediately and the reason is because

1938
01:11:54,908 --> 01:12:00,868
rotations are non Euclidean and that is

1939
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,460
not me being confused that's the truth

1940
01:12:00,868 --> 01:12:04,899
basically rotations

1941
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:07,029
I shouldn't say rotations are not

1942
01:12:04,899 --> 01:12:10,210
looking the representation for rotations

1943
01:12:07,029 --> 01:12:14,309
that we use in 3d graphics is non

1944
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:17,050
Euclidean quaternions are non Euclidean

1945
01:12:14,309 --> 01:12:18,489
basically they are the thing that you

1946
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:21,219
will see used most often to represent

1947
01:12:18,488 --> 01:12:22,299
rotations and so if you want to

1948
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:23,920
understand them you have to understand

1949
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:27,038
not Euclidean geometry because they are

1950
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:32,199
not the collodion what happens in

1951
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:34,689
partial differential equations if if

1952
01:12:32,198 --> 01:12:36,518
scott Meyers is in a gorilla suit and

1953
01:12:34,689 --> 01:12:37,928
distracts you so much this trussed up in

1954
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,989
a green car could swap your briefcase

1955
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:42,670
full of compression writing code for I

1956
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:44,678
would basically say that it depends

1957
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:45,940
whether you are actually sitting there

1958
01:12:44,679 --> 01:12:47,739
trying to bring the briefcase to your

1959
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:50,379
boss or whether you're observing it from

1960
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:54,428
a green car waiting at a red light out

1961
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:56,139
on the the airport Drive are using a

1962
01:12:54,429 --> 01:12:58,469
mouse or digital pen I'm using a digital

1963
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:58,469
pen

1964
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:13,130
do you take it stuff do you take a trail

1965
01:13:10,788 --> 01:13:21,590
of coke before you start the stream no I

1966
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:27,349
don't I don't really take anything let's

1967
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:29,840
see don't the tire tiles near the inner

1968
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:31,819
part of the Taurus gets smaller than the

1969
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,849
ones near the outside so isn't the top

1970
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:37,009
isn't the topography more of a magic

1971
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:40,279
cylinder in which each end is hooked

1972
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:42,650
into each other well so not really and

1973
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:44,840
the reason for that is just because like

1974
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:47,268
I said it's topology often isn't about

1975
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,159
the actual size of things it's about

1976
01:13:47,269 --> 01:13:52,189
whether there could be the things right

1977
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:55,848
so try to explain this a little bit

1978
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:57,409
better so basically inside the Taurus

1979
01:13:55,849 --> 01:14:00,319
here - apologies about how they're

1980
01:13:57,408 --> 01:14:01,969
connected not how big they are so as

1981
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:05,840
long as they don't vanish like they do

1982
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:07,788
here you're okay right the problem here

1983
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,679
is that it becomes invisibly small it

1984
01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:12,139
becomes down shrinks down to a single

1985
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,840
point and that means that at this point

1986
01:14:12,139 --> 01:14:16,489
there is no longer any notion of the

1987
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:19,010
connectivity between the rows of the

1988
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:22,158
tiles and anything else right so you

1989
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:24,139
can't follow a line along here and

1990
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:25,638
expect to end up in the right you know

1991
01:14:24,139 --> 01:14:28,609
on the right tile thing when you get

1992
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:32,538
back to the to the other side right it's

1993
01:14:28,609 --> 01:14:35,779
kind of hard to to say exactly what why

1994
01:14:32,538 --> 01:14:37,728
that's the case there so typically like

1995
01:14:35,779 --> 01:14:39,559
the problem with the sphere is basically

1996
01:14:37,729 --> 01:14:41,780
that you have that singularity at the

1997
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:43,820
top where everything disappears into a

1998
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:45,889
point whereas the torus never has that

1999
01:14:43,819 --> 01:14:47,988
so yes these would be smaller if we were

2000
01:14:45,889 --> 01:14:50,538
talking about the actual geometry of a

2001
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:54,698
torus but they never get any smaller

2002
01:14:50,538 --> 01:14:57,259
than that and they rewind inugami

2003
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:59,509
represented through the entire way so so

2004
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:01,429
that yeah you would have to ask an

2005
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:04,070
actual topology for a better explanation

2006
01:15:01,429 --> 01:15:05,989
than what I gave because again I am NOT

2007
01:15:04,069 --> 01:15:08,090
a mathematician so my explanations of

2008
01:15:05,988 --> 01:15:10,248
things are largely based on my

2009
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:12,949
functional knowledge of how they work

2010
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:16,069
and not necessarily a very good pure

2011
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:17,808
mathematical explanation and so really

2012
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:19,149
like again they would probably give you

2013
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:21,969
explanations that are more about

2014
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:24,219
what happens locally on the surface and

2015
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:27,039
less about sort of the more intuitive

2016
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:29,469
explanation that I gave but yeah so if

2017
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:32,198
you if you did want though to represent

2018
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:33,010
it somehow magically perfectly you are

2019
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:35,379
correct

2020
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:36,850
a tourist isn't quite right because if

2021
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:39,429
you wanted to represent the spatial part

2022
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:40,989
correctly you would need it to not get

2023
01:15:39,429 --> 01:15:43,690
smaller on the inside which is kind of

2024
01:15:40,988 --> 01:15:45,250
impossible to do right because it's

2025
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:46,569
gonna be the ring of smart here now one

2026
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,609
of the dimensions is fine the ring

2027
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:50,109
dimension that goes around is fine

2028
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:51,460
because that's always the same size no

2029
01:15:50,109 --> 01:15:53,259
matter where you are but the there's

2030
01:15:51,460 --> 01:16:01,090
this one is smaller than this one in

2031
01:15:53,260 --> 01:16:02,710
terms of the inner and outer so yeah how

2032
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:04,329
is dealing with complex numbers and four

2033
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:06,100
dimensions better or more useful for

2034
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:08,408
doing rotations as opposed to using a

2035
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:11,170
rotation around an arbitrary axis matrix

2036
01:16:08,408 --> 01:16:13,960
I Det don't get how quaternions are

2037
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:17,289
better so there's a lot of ways that

2038
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:22,420
quarter nians are better and I will I

2039
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:25,029
will show you a simple example so let's

2040
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:31,300
say that you want and and I'm not sure

2041
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:35,529
exactly I'm not sure exactly what you

2042
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:39,520
mean by the phrase using a rotation

2043
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:41,319
around an arbitrary axis matrix so I

2044
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,510
don't know what you actually mean by

2045
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:45,880
that but I'm going to assume that what

2046
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:48,310
you were referring to is a rotation

2047
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:50,739
matrix right so you were talking about

2048
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:52,870
in our matrix which is basically a

2049
01:16:50,738 --> 01:16:56,408
matrix you know that looks something

2050
01:16:52,869 --> 01:17:01,319
like you know one of the one of these

2051
01:16:56,408 --> 01:17:01,319
kind of matrices sort of things right

2052
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:07,448
well actually that's not quite right we

2053
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:09,130
need an extra one in there that's bad so

2054
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:10,509
we need a we're talking about a rotation

2055
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:14,140
matrix where we basically have like a

2056
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:17,500
cosine sort of sign sort of a thing I

2057
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:18,850
don't actually remember exactly how this

2058
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,560
would look it's like a negative sign

2059
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:22,360
here one of these kinds of guys you're

2060
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,280
talking about this sort of thing where

2061
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:26,589
you basically have have something like

2062
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:28,269
this a rotation matrix and I guess

2063
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:29,560
arbitrary axis means it would be more

2064
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:32,080
complicated than this because that's a

2065
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,969
single axis rotation so I don't know how

2066
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:35,850
to write one of those may

2067
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:37,109
she's out by hand but yeah so you're

2068
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:38,460
basically talking about a rotation

2069
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:41,639
matrix that's some three dimensional

2070
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:42,840
rotation about some axis so we'll say

2071
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:46,260
that's a rotation matrix that's

2072
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,640
parameterised by an axis and an angle is

2073
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:51,300
that basically what we're talking about

2074
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:52,140
here hopefully I don't know but let's

2075
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,270
say that that's what you were talking

2076
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:56,430
about so we have rotation matrix versus

2077
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:59,070
a quaternion that's going to basically

2078
01:17:56,430 --> 01:18:01,050
be the same quaternion it's so it's so

2079
01:17:59,069 --> 01:18:02,789
you're representing it the exact same

2080
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:07,260
rotation around some axis with a theta

2081
01:18:02,789 --> 01:18:10,140
right so basically the reason that you

2082
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:13,500
want to use quaternions instead of

2083
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:16,739
rotation matrices are I mean the very

2084
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,539
first one is efficiency so one of these

2085
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:22,379
matrices is going to at least run you

2086
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:23,909
three by three or nine values right so

2087
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:27,119
anytime you're computing with one of

2088
01:18:23,909 --> 01:18:29,670
these you essentially have to do a a

2089
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:32,609
three by three matrix you have to store

2090
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:34,770
nine values and those nine values have

2091
01:18:32,609 --> 01:18:36,809
to be renormalized continuously right

2092
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:38,280
because basically if you're one of the

2093
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:39,719
requirements for a rotation matrix in

2094
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:41,759
order for the rotation is that it cannot

2095
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:42,989
change the size of anything right that's

2096
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,390
what kind of what makes it a rotation

2097
01:18:42,988 --> 01:18:46,679
matrix is that the size is invariant so

2098
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:48,060
that basically means that every all of

2099
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,590
the axis didn't have to be orthonormal

2100
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,969
and blah blah blah so you've got a you

2101
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:52,890
know you've got a matrix that's

2102
01:18:50,969 --> 01:18:54,539
basically three vectors and those

2103
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:56,219
vectors have to be unit length like this

2104
01:18:54,539 --> 01:18:59,100
guy this guy this guy all have to be

2105
01:18:56,219 --> 01:19:00,180
unit length which also implies that the

2106
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,829
rows are unit length right

2107
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:03,329
so basically you've got this rotation

2108
01:19:01,829 --> 01:19:04,559
act just actually just it's it's much

2109
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:06,809
less efficient to store it because the

2110
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,180
quaternion only requires storing four

2111
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:10,410
values right so already we're kind of at

2112
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,310
an advantage if we're in quaternion

2113
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:13,010
space because we've got four values

2114
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:14,760
instead of nine and that's kind of handy

2115
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:16,890
furthermore when we actually do

2116
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,210
operations on these guys there's a

2117
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:19,800
number of operations that we can do

2118
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:21,329
extremely trivially on the quaternions

2119
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,039
that actually are fairly expensive on a

2120
01:19:21,329 --> 01:19:25,590
rotation so for example if I want to

2121
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:28,109
actually construct one of these guys

2122
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:30,360
right I have to take the the sine and

2123
01:19:28,109 --> 01:19:32,219
cosine and fill out all nine values this

2124
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:33,689
guy I actually only have to fill out the

2125
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:36,300
four values that only have to take the

2126
01:19:33,689 --> 01:19:37,859
cosine of the thing now that's actually

2127
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:40,230
kind of special because since I don't

2128
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:41,399
need the sine right you need the sign

2129
01:19:40,229 --> 01:19:43,409
for the rotation matrix since I don't

2130
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:45,420
need the sine I can often compute the

2131
01:19:43,409 --> 01:19:45,880
cosine as a byproduct the reason for

2132
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,350
that and

2133
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,000
we're kind of getting off into lala land

2134
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,230
here but you know I'm just gonna just

2135
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,420
thrown out some examples for you since

2136
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:54,819
you asked the cosine of theta it can

2137
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:56,859
often be directly computed as the dot

2138
01:19:54,819 --> 01:19:58,658
product between two things right so you

2139
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:59,289
never actually have to take a cosine you

2140
01:19:58,658 --> 01:20:01,029
never have to have to do a

2141
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:01,988
transcendental typically like if you

2142
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,819
want to know the angle between two

2143
01:20:01,988 --> 01:20:05,589
vectors you just do a transpose beam you

2144
01:20:03,819 --> 01:20:07,029
get the cosine right if these were

2145
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:09,190
normalized you'd get the cosine for free

2146
01:20:07,029 --> 01:20:10,809
if not you have to normalize that but

2147
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:13,269
that's you know usually small potatoes

2148
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:15,190
between compared to doing a sine Coast

2149
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:17,770
which you'd have to do for this guy

2150
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:19,479
right so typically you can actually

2151
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:21,580
compute quaternions wholly without

2152
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:22,869
trigonometric functions altogether which

2153
01:20:21,579 --> 01:20:24,340
is kind of amazing

2154
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:25,840
whereas for rotation matrices you're

2155
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:27,400
never getting away with that you've got

2156
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,719
to do at least that and possibly more

2157
01:20:27,399 --> 01:20:30,069
depending on you know if you're doing

2158
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:31,929
Rodrigues formulation where you're doing

2159
01:20:30,069 --> 01:20:33,579
the full rotate around the arbitrary

2160
01:20:31,929 --> 01:20:35,319
matrix you're talking about a lot of

2161
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:37,059
operations to initialize those 9x9 s and

2162
01:20:35,319 --> 01:20:39,039
then furthermore you got to do 3x3

2163
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:40,659
matrix multiplication to compose them so

2164
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:43,238
every time I want to combine one H still

2165
01:20:40,658 --> 01:20:46,569
another I got to do a full 3 by 3 times

2166
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:49,149
3x3 operation to compose the the

2167
01:20:46,569 --> 01:20:50,289
matrices and I don't have to do that

2168
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:52,869
with my attorney and quaternions have a

2169
01:20:50,289 --> 01:20:54,609
much simpler composition form it's not

2170
01:20:52,869 --> 01:20:55,869
quite as simple as just like you know

2171
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:59,229
adding them together or something like

2172
01:20:55,869 --> 01:21:01,300
that but it's still pretty good right so

2173
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:02,289
you've got all that but you also got a

2174
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:03,670
bunch of other stuff that happened with

2175
01:21:02,289 --> 01:21:07,060
quaternions that are much more powerful

2176
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:08,319
than matrices quaternions have this nice

2177
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:12,010
property that they actually represent

2178
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:14,109
things sort of over the over the space

2179
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:15,250
of double rotations not single rotations

2180
01:21:14,109 --> 01:21:16,839
and I'm not going to try explains that

2181
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:19,000
what that means right now but I will

2182
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:22,329
simply say that if you have two

2183
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,399
quaternions or more you can oftentimes

2184
01:21:22,329 --> 01:21:25,988
deal with them rather directly as if

2185
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:27,158
they were vectors and normalize after

2186
01:21:25,988 --> 01:21:28,479
the fact there's something you cannot do

2187
01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:30,429
with matrices because they will generate

2188
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:32,799
quickly so for example let's say that I

2189
01:21:30,429 --> 01:21:35,350
have several orientations in space for

2190
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:38,230
example I have five animations playing

2191
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:39,940
right I have five animations playing and

2192
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:41,619
I want to blend them all together at the

2193
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:43,448
same time so I have five animations

2194
01:21:41,619 --> 01:21:44,979
playing for a guy's run it's like or

2195
01:21:43,448 --> 01:21:46,238
well it's maybe that's a little bit

2196
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:47,799
unrealistic let's say we have three

2197
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:49,629
animations playing so I have three

2198
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,909
animations playing and each of those

2199
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:54,520
animations is going to compute a

2200
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:56,799
position for the guy's head his neck

2201
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:58,090
right so I've got his neck and each of

2202
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,520
the three animations well one said it

2203
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:01,110
was pointing this way

2204
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,610
said it was pointing that way and once

2205
01:22:01,109 --> 01:22:04,949
it is pointing this way right now

2206
01:22:02,609 --> 01:22:06,659
because my animator wanted to do some

2207
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:08,429
tweaking and whatever you know we've got

2208
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:12,659
blends between those animations so we

2209
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:16,050
say that we want 30% of animation a plus

2210
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:18,569
40% of animation B which leaves of

2211
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:20,640
course 30 more percent for animation C

2212
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:22,799
okay so that's the equation I want to

2213
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:24,869
compute with my orientations to figure

2214
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,300
out what the resulting orientation of

2215
01:22:24,869 --> 01:22:29,849
all these guys should be for the neck of

2216
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,409
my character okay now this is something

2217
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:33,210
you've done in our animation tools

2218
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:34,829
without even knowing it right you you

2219
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:36,239
you wait animations that you blend

2220
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:37,710
together so we all know this is this

2221
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,939
operation it's like I want to blend

2222
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:41,760
three animations together to get a

2223
01:22:38,939 --> 01:22:43,619
resulting animation okay well if I want

2224
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,930
to do that with matrix math you're

2225
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:47,579
almost dead in the water actually

2226
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:49,020
because you don't know how far like

2227
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:50,309
these two diametrically opposed

2228
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:51,750
animations are going to cause you some

2229
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:53,670
pretty severe numerical problems

2230
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:55,590
potentially especially if they look like

2231
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:56,909
that because once you start adding 30

2232
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,810
percent of one thing in 30 percent of

2233
01:22:56,909 --> 01:23:00,090
another thing that happened to be

2234
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:03,030
diametrically opposed you will start to

2235
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:04,920
collapse down to here so you can't just

2236
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:06,869
add these matrices directly together or

2237
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,460
you'll get really bad degeneracy as you

2238
01:23:06,869 --> 01:23:10,050
try to like blend these things together

2239
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,550
and you'll end up with almost all this

2240
01:23:10,050 --> 01:23:13,260
animation even though that's not what

2241
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:15,500
should have happened quaternions don't

2242
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:17,670
really suffer from this problem too much

2243
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:19,380
quieter knee is because they represent a

2244
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:21,239
larger space of rotations they actually

2245
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:23,430
represent twice the total space of

2246
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:24,989
representations don't ask me about that

2247
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:26,850
yet because we're nowhere near that

2248
01:23:24,989 --> 01:23:28,909
that's a topic that's probably beyond

2249
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:30,840
handmade here oh but that's what they do

2250
01:23:28,909 --> 01:23:32,579
because of that you could actually add

2251
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:35,940
these things together much more reliably

2252
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:39,059
because this this situation almost can't

2253
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:41,339
happen you basically get a a case where

2254
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:43,230
even in neck orientations that are very

2255
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:45,119
far from each other appear in

2256
01:23:43,229 --> 01:23:47,009
quaternions to actually be much closer

2257
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:50,130
to each other than they are twice as

2258
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:51,449
close in fact as matrices which means

2259
01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:52,890
that if you add them together you can

2260
01:23:51,449 --> 01:23:54,479
actually directly add them together and

2261
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:57,539
normalize after the fact and you will

2262
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:59,879
get much better behaved systems and not

2263
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:01,319
only that but instead of adding nine

2264
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,760
numbers together each time you do one of

2265
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:04,769
these ads and then having to renormalize

2266
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,360
the whole thing which is basically

2267
01:24:04,770 --> 01:24:08,220
renormalizing the entire matrix that's

2268
01:24:06,359 --> 01:24:09,509
nine numbers you base there just adding

2269
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:11,039
four numbers together so it's just four

2270
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:13,588
plus four plus four and then you

2271
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:17,128
renormalize just those four right

2272
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:19,639
much much cleaner so easier to construct

2273
01:24:17,128 --> 01:24:22,529
smaller to store easier to work with

2274
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:25,109
much better numerically behaved can also

2275
01:24:22,529 --> 01:24:26,788
do stuff like neighborhood Inge there's

2276
01:24:25,109 --> 01:24:28,169
just there's a ton of reasons why

2277
01:24:26,788 --> 01:24:30,328
pattern Ian's are better so basically

2278
01:24:28,168 --> 01:24:32,189
like if you're using 3x3 mains to use to

2279
01:24:30,328 --> 01:24:33,599
represent your animation data or your

2280
01:24:32,189 --> 01:24:40,499
orientation data in 3d world you're

2281
01:24:33,599 --> 01:24:43,878
probably a sad panda what can I say ever

2282
01:24:40,498 --> 01:24:52,078
do anything with the PLAs transforms not

2283
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:53,568
personally but what's going on here did

2284
01:24:52,078 --> 01:24:55,648
I just lose my stream

2285
01:24:53,569 --> 01:25:00,239
are we still live why didn't say

2286
01:24:55,649 --> 01:25:01,919
reconnecting you know looks good I'm

2287
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:03,088
assuming I'm still live every do you

2288
01:25:01,918 --> 01:25:07,519
think with Laplace transforms not

2289
01:25:03,088 --> 01:25:07,519
personally but if I remember correctly

2290
01:25:07,878 --> 01:25:15,689
spiracle harmonics don't you use them in

2291
01:25:13,078 --> 01:25:18,478
spherical harmonics I don't actually

2292
01:25:15,689 --> 01:25:20,189
know I feel like the Laplace transform

2293
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:22,649
is used in spherical harmonics a lot I

2294
01:25:20,189 --> 01:25:23,760
could be wrong about that so I don't use

2295
01:25:22,649 --> 01:25:25,079
them I'm not much of a rendering guy

2296
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,909
don't do a lot of rendering code

2297
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:28,948
I feel like Laplace transforms happen

2298
01:25:26,908 --> 01:25:31,078
these days though that's what I that's

2299
01:25:28,948 --> 01:25:34,648
what I feel like but I don't actually

2300
01:25:31,078 --> 01:25:39,568
know so that's yeah I'm not sure about

2301
01:25:34,649 --> 01:25:41,369
that what type of math is used in a I

2302
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:44,069
specifically prediction a reaction of

2303
01:25:41,368 --> 01:25:45,418
two player choice I'm not an AI expert

2304
01:25:44,069 --> 01:25:47,489
so I don't really know what kind of math

2305
01:25:45,418 --> 01:25:48,979
they typically use I don't know baby

2306
01:25:47,488 --> 01:25:50,899
Bayesian

2307
01:25:48,979 --> 01:25:53,649
Bayesian networks and that sort of stuff

2308
01:25:50,899 --> 01:25:56,029
you know I'm not sure certainly

2309
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:57,589
optimization like operations research is

2310
01:25:56,029 --> 01:25:59,090
an a ie kinds of things so you use a

2311
01:25:57,590 --> 01:26:01,579
bunch of that I'm sure but I don't know

2312
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:07,610
I'm not really any experts I'm not sure

2313
01:26:01,579 --> 01:26:09,140
to say is all of the things shown in

2314
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:10,670
math class is useful sometimes stuff

2315
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:13,039
seems so unnecessary and mind killing

2316
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:15,529
what's your opinion on that my opinion

2317
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:19,220
is yes it's probably all useful but it's

2318
01:26:15,529 --> 01:26:20,779
all taught very poorly so my my

2319
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:22,220
assumption is that almost everything

2320
01:26:20,779 --> 01:26:24,079
that you actually see in a high school

2321
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:27,409
math class is actually particularly

2322
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:28,789
useful however you would never know it

2323
01:26:27,409 --> 01:26:30,349
by the way they teach it because they

2324
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:31,579
teach early typically teach it in a way

2325
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,170
that it will be almost impossible for

2326
01:26:31,579 --> 01:26:35,329
you to even think of how it might be

2327
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:36,949
used and only later in life when you

2328
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:39,409
actually find places where you start

2329
01:26:36,949 --> 01:26:51,250
using it you go oh that's why I would

2330
01:26:39,409 --> 01:26:51,250
need to know that let's see

2331
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:08,520
okay quaternions as you use them in

2332
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:12,130
rotation are definitely not Euclidean

2333
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:14,020
they're not like they just aren't you

2334
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:16,210
cannot treat them Euclidean Li because

2335
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:18,910
they have a normalization constraint to

2336
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:22,779
them right and so basically when you're

2337
01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:24,609
doing quaternions I don't want to argue

2338
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:26,170
with people on stream quaternions as you

2339
01:27:24,609 --> 01:27:29,369
use them in rotations are not Euclidean

2340
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:29,369
period what ascends it there

2341
01:27:37,810 --> 01:27:41,140
can we talk a bit about what out of the

2342
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:45,190
master list we expect to use in this

2343
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:48,610
game yes so we'll use arithmetic algebra

2344
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:50,529
geometry trigonometry calculus obviously

2345
01:27:48,609 --> 01:27:52,389
I don't know whether we'll use partial

2346
01:27:50,529 --> 01:27:55,179
differential equations or ordinary

2347
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:57,039
differential equations we'll definitely

2348
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,659
use linear algebra euclidean geometry

2349
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:59,979
we'll definitely use I don't know if

2350
01:27:58,659 --> 01:28:02,979
we'll ever use any non nuclear charge

2351
01:27:59,979 --> 01:28:04,209
because we're not doing 3d topology we

2352
01:28:02,979 --> 01:28:06,159
already mentioned even on the stream

2353
01:28:04,210 --> 01:28:08,949
Minkowski algebra will probably use in

2354
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:10,359
the collision detector I don't know

2355
01:28:08,949 --> 01:28:12,130
whether we'll use any numerical analysis

2356
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:14,439
which is like iterative methods for

2357
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:17,109
solving things but possibly control

2358
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:19,569
theory definitely interval arithmetic

2359
01:28:17,109 --> 01:28:21,279
possibly but I'm not sure discrete math

2360
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:22,869
obviously but I don't know it very well

2361
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:23,920
so we'll probably just be using most of

2362
01:28:22,869 --> 01:28:25,689
what other people have done like we'll

2363
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,220
go use someone's pseudo-random number

2364
01:28:25,689 --> 01:28:28,449
generator and we won't necessarily talk

2365
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,560
about how you construct it because I

2366
01:28:28,449 --> 01:28:31,000
don't really know how to construct a

2367
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,680
good random number generator graph

2368
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,680
theory almost definitely probably in

2369
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:37,680
statistics almost definitely so yeah

2370
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:49,300
well the next few weeks cover the basic

2371
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:50,469
functionalities that are math heavy or

2372
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:52,180
will you spread it out the topics more

2373
01:28:50,469 --> 01:28:54,819
yeah will basically be covering them

2374
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:56,500
when we get to them but now is the time

2375
01:28:54,819 --> 01:28:58,299
when I have to start talking about math

2376
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,890
because there's really nothing left to

2377
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,750
do in terms of our engine work that

2378
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:03,820
isn't going to be using at least vectors

2379
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:07,738
so that's why I decided to kind of have

2380
01:29:03,819 --> 01:29:07,738
this stream at this point in time

2381
01:29:20,498 --> 01:29:26,708
let's see it's nice to see you recommend

2382
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:28,208
learning math so strongly can did you

2383
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:32,019
learn most of it from books or did you

2384
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:33,908
take courses all books really I've never

2385
01:29:32,019 --> 01:29:39,789
taken a math course since I got out of

2386
01:29:33,908 --> 01:29:41,708
high school I heard Markov chains are

2387
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:44,288
also useful crossing control xxx

2388
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:46,300
probability will we use these I don't

2389
01:29:44,288 --> 01:29:47,708
know I mean it depends on how we

2390
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,179
implement our world generation that's

2391
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:51,279
probably the only place that we'd really

2392
01:29:49,179 --> 01:29:52,658
have a chance to use them

2393
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:54,128
obviously I mentioned the metropolis

2394
01:29:52,658 --> 01:29:57,248
algorithm and I feel like that's

2395
01:29:54,128 --> 01:29:59,349
technically filed under a Monte Carlo

2396
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:02,050
Markov chain model I don't really

2397
01:29:59,349 --> 01:30:03,519
remember though and so you know if we

2398
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:04,989
use some kind of permutation based world

2399
01:30:03,519 --> 01:30:08,010
generator maybe a Markov chain is

2400
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:08,009
technically involved there I'm not sure

2401
01:30:08,969 --> 01:30:12,908
the Internet pennant police doesn't

2402
01:30:11,288 --> 01:30:15,488
forgive oversimplifications why do you

2403
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:16,988
even bother it's a good question but the

2404
01:30:15,488 --> 01:30:18,549
answer is because it's my stream and

2405
01:30:16,988 --> 01:30:22,478
that is kind of nice because it means

2406
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:24,219
that what I say goes so I try to be

2407
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:25,449
pretty nice to people who write in but

2408
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:26,979
if someone wants to argue about a math

2409
01:30:25,448 --> 01:30:28,569
thing I just don't care because at some

2410
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:30,159
level it's like I only know the math

2411
01:30:28,569 --> 01:30:32,168
that I know and I can only explain

2412
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:33,339
things that I know and so I already said

2413
01:30:32,168 --> 01:30:34,809
at the very beginning of the stream if

2414
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:36,340
you really want to know the very

2415
01:30:34,809 --> 01:30:37,619
specific math terms for everything you

2416
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:41,409
will have to look them up yourselves

2417
01:30:37,618 --> 01:30:45,488
because not only do I not know them but

2418
01:30:41,408 --> 01:30:47,498
I like don't think I could ever know

2419
01:30:45,488 --> 01:30:48,938
them all I know a lot more math that I

2420
01:30:47,498 --> 01:30:50,948
use day to day than I could ever

2421
01:30:48,939 --> 01:30:53,320
possibly really remember all the

2422
01:30:50,948 --> 01:30:55,868
specifics for and still be a very

2423
01:30:53,319 --> 01:30:57,698
productive programmer right like the

2424
01:30:55,868 --> 01:31:00,009
level of specificity you need to always

2425
01:30:57,698 --> 01:31:02,319
say the exact right thing in terms of a

2426
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:04,989
math explanation is way beyond what I

2427
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:07,958
think anyone who does as much different

2428
01:31:04,988 --> 01:31:09,398
types of math as I do could do unless

2429
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:11,769
you were just some kind of like an idiot

2430
01:31:09,399 --> 01:31:14,829
savant or whatever right so it's gonna

2431
01:31:11,769 --> 01:31:16,599
happen get used to it and I'm more than

2432
01:31:14,828 --> 01:31:18,128
happy to have people post corrections on

2433
01:31:16,599 --> 01:31:20,590
the forums for people who want to know

2434
01:31:18,128 --> 01:31:23,439
specific math terms are like he said

2435
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:24,909
that this was X here but it was actually

2436
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:27,639
Y or whatever in terms of like you know

2437
01:31:24,908 --> 01:31:28,839
this term or that term so people want to

2438
01:31:27,639 --> 01:31:31,168
learn the actual terms that they'll have

2439
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,168
links

2440
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,350
let's see

2441
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,770
you

2442
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:58,009
so the people is saying that the stream

2443
01:31:55,909 --> 01:32:00,199
dropped out yeah it definitely said

2444
01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:01,820
reconnecting on my side but for some

2445
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:03,800
reason it still says drop-frame zero

2446
01:32:01,819 --> 01:32:08,750
which means I feel like this counter is

2447
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:10,190
not particularly accurate that's kind of

2448
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,619
frustrating cuz it means I have no way

2449
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:14,089
of knowing that it what happened

2450
01:32:12,619 --> 01:32:15,500
which is kind of annoying but I saw the

2451
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:17,779
reconnection dialog so I know it went

2452
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:18,369
down but I don't know why I didn't tell

2453
01:32:17,779 --> 01:32:29,239
me

2454
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:32,239
OBS let's see here all right looks like

2455
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:34,519
we're basically done so that is the end

2456
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:37,189
of the stream thank you everyone for

2457
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:38,330
joining me for a little math I can't say

2458
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:39,589
it has been a pleasure program with you

2459
01:32:38,329 --> 01:32:41,000
because we did not program but it has

2460
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:42,980
been a pleasure going over math of

2461
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,529
course which is very useful in

2462
01:32:42,979 --> 01:32:47,959
programming in which we will be making

2463
01:32:44,529 --> 01:32:49,789
increasingly frequent use of as the

2464
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:52,069
stream goes forward so I hope you will

2465
01:32:49,789 --> 01:32:54,649
not be shy about exploring math on your

2466
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:56,029
own and kind of looking into the math

2467
01:32:54,649 --> 01:32:57,769
topics that we cover because there are a

2468
01:32:56,029 --> 01:32:59,269
lot of really important math things out

2469
01:32:57,770 --> 01:33:02,510
there to learn and it does take a little

2470
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:04,820
bit of dedication on everyone's part to

2471
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:07,970
kind of go learn math the math that they

2472
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:10,189
don't know in time to do stuff in

2473
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:11,750
handmade Hira so thank you very much for

2474
01:33:10,189 --> 01:33:12,979
joining me if you would like to follow

2475
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,960
along with the source code starting

2476
01:33:12,979 --> 01:33:16,429
tomorrow with the math and so on if you

2477
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,050
want to pre-order the game you can go to

2478
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,310
handmade hero org and if you peer out of

2479
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,750
the game it comes with all the source

2480
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:22,310
code so you can basically download it

2481
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:24,050
every night and follow along with what I

2482
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:25,430
do on the stream if you want support the

2483
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:27,350
video series we do have a patch run you

2484
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:28,820
could subscribe to and if you'd like to

2485
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:30,260
learn along with the series we do have a

2486
01:33:28,819 --> 01:33:32,149
news and forum site that is where I was

2487
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:34,100
saying people could post corrections to

2488
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:36,529
math statements I make in this code

2489
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:37,940
discussion forum for example it also has

2490
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:39,109
an episode guide it has a schedule for

2491
01:33:37,939 --> 01:33:40,519
the week posted as well it has an

2492
01:33:39,109 --> 01:33:41,869
episode guide that said that you can use

2493
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:43,520
to catch up on past episodes that you

2494
01:33:41,869 --> 01:33:45,109
missed and it's got a coding resources

2495
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,370
page with ports to Linux and Mac and

2496
01:33:45,109 --> 01:33:48,289
stuff like that you can use if you're

2497
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:50,390
trying to run handmade hero on another

2498
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,739
platform from the source code so

2499
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:53,150
hopefully you will check that out if

2500
01:33:51,739 --> 01:33:54,649
you're interested thank you very much

2501
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:57,019
for joining me I will be back tomorrow

2502
01:33:54,649 --> 01:33:58,789
at 8 p.m. Pacific Centre time to talk a

2503
01:33:57,020 --> 01:34:01,160
little bit about vectors and do some

2504
01:33:58,789 --> 01:34:03,260
code with vectors with you so you can

2505
01:34:01,159 --> 01:34:04,939
start to see how they work in the real

2506
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:07,909
world so thank you everyone for joining

2507
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:09,969
me and I hope to see you tomorrow

2508
01:34:07,908 --> 01:34:09,969
you
