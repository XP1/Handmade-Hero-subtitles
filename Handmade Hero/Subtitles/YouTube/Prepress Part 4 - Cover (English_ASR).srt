1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,459
fundamentally speaking a cover for a

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,809
book and the book it's the same process

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:08,339
there's no difference between the two

4
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,839
you're still probably printing them on

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:11,460
the same press you're probably still

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,070
using on the same processes you're using

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,679
the same papers but the difference is

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,070
usually you make all sorts of different

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,259
choices for the cover so it's not like

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,149
there's a special cover thing that you

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,039
make it on a different machine or

12
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,379
something like this it's a similar

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,970
process it's just you've chosen all

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,858
these other things that you probably

15
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:34,229
would never choose for the average

16
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,210
interior page of a book I mean you might

17
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:39,738
choose it for some special interior page

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,259
but you wouldn't generally choose it so

19
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:46,878
making the cover is usually completely

20
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:50,039
different from making an interior page

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:54,179
because of all the different choices so

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,770
yes you still do the CMYK separation the

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,359
same you still fix all that stuff you

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,859
know so you're gonna want to do all the

25
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,378
stuff that I already said for interior

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,070
pages but then you've just got a whole

27
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:08,700
other suite of things that come on top

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,009
here and here's what they are so the

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,109
first thing is you're gonna have to work

30
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,600
with your printer for that paper

31
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:19,799
selection process way more closely

32
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:22,259
because there's so many options you have

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,479
I mean there's things that I don't even

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,978
know exactly what it is like this ski

35
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,099
Journal magazine for example is

36
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:33,328
something called soft touch laminate

37
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:37,889
it's not the same as a matte finish so

38
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:40,228
it is a type of dull finish designed to

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,049
make this part stand out and also to

40
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:46,259
have a smooth feel to it but it's not

41
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,520
matte paper I mean or it isn't it's you

42
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,209
it's matte beware something done to it

43
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:54,359
right so there are many more options

44
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,578
that a printer may have for paper that

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,078
you would never care about for the

46
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,379
interior of the book but you might care

47
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,938
about them for the cover and similarly a

48
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,109
lot of the stuff that you wouldn't

49
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,239
really do on the interior of the book

50
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,758
you might want to do for the cover this

51
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,759
is one example so I showed you how this

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,009
part here it's specially glossy so

53
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,829
what's happening there well

54
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:20,340
in addition to the CMYK image that you

55
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,409
give to the printer for the cover you

56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,110
can also give the printer a series of

57
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:28,620
masks and these are basically pure white

58
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,280
images with just a black just pure black

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,900
drawn to isolate a region so just like

60
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,500
you would use like a layer mask or

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,299
something it's exactly that idea but

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,610
instead of being used in the actual

63
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,620
production of the artwork what it is is

64
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,410
this just something that says where a

65
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,319
specific print pass should apply to the

66
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,400
cover so for example in this case what

67
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,708
you would have done is they would have

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,689
made their cover normally with like CMYK

69
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,469
and then they would have had a special

70
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:01,739
separate file with just like black for

71
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:04,469
the ski journal title and then the

72
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:08,878
printer would have been told to use that

73
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:11,848
mask to do a glossy pass to coat the

74
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:14,009
finished product after printing just in

75
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:17,399
that area with the glossy coating and

76
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:22,500
that's what makes this reflective on top

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,109
of a non reflective page right so

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,568
there's lots of things that you can do

79
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:30,450
with those masks depending on what your

80
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:32,699
printers capabilities are you just saw

81
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:35,668
one of them which is a glossy post pass

82
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:41,638
that is typically called spot gloss or

83
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:46,200
spot UV the word UV is a very strange

84
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:48,689
thing I don't really understand why they

85
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:53,699
chose to use it but what it really means

86
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:55,489
is effectively through the third time

87
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,888
gloss

88
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:04,469
remember I said uncoated no gloss on the

89
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:07,769
paper matte X amount of gloss on the

90
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:10,620
paper glossy is like two X amount on the

91
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:14,250
paper and then they actually sometimes

92
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,879
call it UV coating if you then take that

93
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:22,139
glossy paper and put a third gloss pass

94
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:25,589
after you've done the ink so spot UV or

95
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,810
spot gloss is just a way of saying it's

96
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:29,489
the same as when we do a normal UV

97
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,860
which is put the whole glass over the

98
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,480
whole thing but instead of going over

99
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,680
the whole thing we're just gonna do it

100
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,910
in certain spots

101
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,560
hence spot UV or spot gloss that's what

102
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,750
you saw there was like a spot gloss

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,250
finish and by the way since we hit our

104
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,160
stretch goal for that that is what the

105
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,689
meow cover will have to it will have a

106
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,550
section that's shiny like that because

107
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,990
we thought that was a pretty classy

108
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,410
we liked that look when we're looking at

109
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,199
graphic novels that had it but you can

110
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,960
do other things too another one is

111
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,839
embossing so a printer can literally

112
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,489
like punch into the paper and like

113
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,279
deform if it's a heavy enough weight

114
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,759
paper they can deform out the paper so

115
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,049
that there's like a raised section and

116
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,810
again you provide them a mass for that

117
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,350
and it can raise the section they can do

118
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,720
foils and these are like little metallic

119
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,120
like actual metallic pieces that get

120
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,780
pressed onto the paper so that they

121
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,370
actually have like a you know metal it's

122
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,859
a totally different like material like a

123
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,509
metal material that gets put on there

124
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,949
right and then finally I don't even know

125
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,509
if our particular printer does this

126
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,180
because we didn't ask them since we

127
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:45,449
don't actually want it but then there's

128
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,449
custom inks so this is the part where

129
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,029
hopefully now no one has to remind me if

130
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:54,839
you're doing a print process and you

131
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:57,809
want some kind of custom inks for your

132
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,060
cover there are lots of crazy ridiculous

133
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,918
options that I didn't explore because we

134
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,530
didn't want them but they are out there

135
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,149
there are fluorescent inks that can

136
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,609
reproduce those kind of fluorescent

137
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:11,099
glowy colors my understanding is they

138
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,470
fade over time so that's why you

139
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,510
typically don't use them as the ink that

140
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,300
you're going to use normally there's

141
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,788
metal inks so there are inks with actual

142
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,288
like copper in them or silver probably I

143
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:23,579
mean I don't really know what all the

144
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:25,139
different kinds they have available are

145
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,209
because like I said we didn't care about

146
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,329
that but there are actual metal doped

147
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:33,239
inks so you can do an ink pass that can

148
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,609
be very detailed but so not like big

149
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,490
blocky things for like embossing or the

150
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,680
spot UV but like super detailed ink pass

151
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:45,550
with metal shining inks right

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,680
it exists there's scratch-resistant inks

153
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,379
these are inks that are designed not to

154
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,840
really slough off even in like sort of

155
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,100
extreme circumstances and my understand

156
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,228
is they use these for like printing like

157
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,110
box stuff like they're gonna be handled

158
00:06:56,228 --> 00:07:01,329
a lot of things like that so there's a

159
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,038
ton of different things you can do with

160
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:05,469
the cover that you probably would never

161
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,269
do with the interior but it exists so be

162
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,710
aware of it and if these are the kind of

163
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:10,810
things you want for your cover because

164
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,888
maybe you want a crazy cover those are

165
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,959
things you can talk to your printer

166
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,629
about now in terms of the physical

167
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,969
layout of the cover it's different than

168
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:20,649
a page the pages are normally laid out

169
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,720
one way and we'll talk about those as we

170
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:26,560
roll into the actual sheet printing

171
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,970
process but the cover is not so the

172
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
cover is typically typically made

173
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,470
separate and it's usually gonna be like

174
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,840
one continuous image that has the back

175
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,490
the spine and the front all together

176
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,739
because you want that to sort of wrap

177
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,660
around the book and you want it to be a

178
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,139
continuous image the whole way right so

179
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,030
you don't see like a gap along that fold

180
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,740
also if there are flaps if the way that

181
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,750
you know sometimes books they might have

182
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,519
a dust jacket if it's a hardcover or

183
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,800
they might have built-in flaps even if

184
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,918
it's if it's a trade paperback or

185
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,960
something like that that's probably part

186
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,939
of your coverage too but again these are

187
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,310
things your printer every printer has

188
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:05,348
different things they want so they'll

189
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,399
tell you what what you want to do but

190
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:08,348
the important thing remember is like

191
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,668
cover is made separately it's not the

192
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,139
same dimensions as your book it's

193
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:12,728
different and need to be aware of that

194
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,519
you especially need to be aware of the

195
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:17,680
fact that the spine for your book the

196
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,658
size of the spine in that image will be

197
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,360
determined by how thick the book is

198
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:25,449
because the amount of image that is

199
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,580
shown on that spine is based on the page

200
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,970
count and the paper weight right so

201
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:34,059
that's how thick the book will be so you

202
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,589
can't go making your cover you can make

203
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,538
the image for your cover ahead of time

204
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,419
maybe or most of it but you can't go

205
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:42,610
making your final cover artwork with the

206
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:45,669
wraparound spine until you actually know

207
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,919
what paper you want and how many pages

208
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:50,169
the book is so again something to keep

209
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,139
in mind with when you're when you're

210
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:54,399
making this process but basically other

211
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:55,449
than the fact that you have a lot of

212
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,720
crazy options

213
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,100
you might want to take advantage of and

214
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,170
you're going to use slightly different

215
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,190
dimensions that your printer should

216
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,389
we'll be able to tell you like the

217
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,010
printer we'll be able to tell you here's

218
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:09,189
how wide your spine is going to be right

219
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:11,139
they've got that information it's pretty

220
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,990
much the same process otherwise right

221
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:16,240
it's just you're making CMYK images that

222
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,279
look good it's a different dimension but

223
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,560
it's that process and then you might

224
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,269
paint a bunch of extra masks if you've

225
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,299
got all these crazy effects spot glass

226
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,649
foils embossing whatever else might be

227
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,329
going on there right the true printer

228
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,559
could do you might even have whole other

229
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,210
ink passes if you're using those

230
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:34,089
metallic inks or some other kind of

231
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,300
special ink right but otherwise yeah

232
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:40,780
same process just more of it right like

233
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:42,370
more things come in here because while

234
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,990
you don't want to pay for all that for

235
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,549
the interior of the book because man it

236
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,259
would be very expensive if you're doing

237
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:49,049
tons of passes through the press for

238
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:52,360
every page the book cost would be

239
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:54,579
potentially very high right your cover

240
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,230
is an important thing it's what you're

241
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,730
gonna show off at like trade shows and

242
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,350
that sort of stuff if you're ever in a

243
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,629
bookstore and a display and some people

244
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,250
are gonna see there's an intangible feel

245
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:04,840
to it when you pick it up right you want

246
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,419
the book to feel good and look good all

247
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,710
that stuff the cover is part of that and

248
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:10,839
so you tend to spend a little bit more

249
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,450
money on the cover to get those things

250
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,120
and Plus even if you had infinite money

251
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,280
and we're just looking to blow it do you

252
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,019
really want weird foils on every penny

253
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,759
it's gonna get distracting so you're

254
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,549
kind of talking more about a specialty

255
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,889
kind of book that you would do that to

256
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:28,719
you you could see certain graphic novels

257
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:30,789
that had a certain visual styles of them

258
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,500
might actually want to start doing like

259
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:33,789
foil printing or weird stuff on the

260
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,299
interior right and you could imagine

261
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:42,069
that making sense but it not for a story

262
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:44,259
based you know sort of you know more

263
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,760
long-form story based thing like now it

264
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:47,169
would just be weird and distracting

265
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,730
you're supposed to be like in immersed

266
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:50,349
in this story and there's all these

267
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,490
crazy reflective foils you know in your

268
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,899
face whatever it doesn't make a lot of

269
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,060
sense but you could you can imagine

270
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,039
probably in your head the book that that

271
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,719
would make sense for so it's not like

272
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,919
it's only confined to the cover you

273
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,350
could do something while if you want to

274
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,419
there again same process printing masks

275
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,769
and telling the printer what mask goes

276
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:08,279
with which effect that's really all

277
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,279
you're talking about
