1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,049
hello everyone and welcome to hand made

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,689
here oh sure we go a complete-game live

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,339
on stream I don't know what we're gonna

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,410
do today coz it's been a long time

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:14,039
sweeping back we were on winter break

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,940
it's been a couple weeks and here's the

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:21,329
thing I'm in the middle of some for

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,730
kotor modifications so we also are gonna

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,409
have to talk about that sometime soon

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:29,750
next weekend I will be completely done

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,250
with them I'm almost done now but I

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,140
don't want to go over and cover like how

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,759
all the new stuff works just to bring

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,558
people up to speed on what's going on so

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,878
they can follow until then so there

16
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:40,859
might be some weirdness and also it's

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,628
some of the stuff is half-baked right

18
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,488
now like on this machine I think I

19
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,530
haven't copied the latest one over yet

20
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:48,328
so it's still the one that we were we

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,460
did a stream over the week where I kind

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,530
of showed for coder modification stuff

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,420
that I was doing so we still kind of

24
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,948
have the the older version here so I

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,600
apologize for that but again it's just

26
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:59,909
it's in the middle of an upgrade and so

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,539
we're gonna we'll talk about that a

28
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,890
little bit more next weekend when all

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,978
that stuff's done I'll go over kind of

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,228
what's in there and how that works now

31
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:12,539
more importantly though over winter

32
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:14,849
break this was really the biggest news

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,080
and it only just happened couple days

34
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:22,500
ago so George man horn actually got in

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,228
touch with me and said that remedy the

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,079
debugger that he'd been working on was

37
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,519
starting to get get ready for primetime

38
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,109
and as you know one of the biggest

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,938
things that I find really grating about

40
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:39,959
development is having to use Visual

41
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:43,919
Studio it's really just difficult to

42
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,879
work with and there's so many reasons

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,978
for that we've talked about it many

44
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,959
times but it's basically like it's very

45
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:51,810
slow and cumbersome and it requires this

46
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,339
massive install it has a weird licensing

47
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,478
regime that constantly decides it's

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,579
unlicensed and you have to deal with

49
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,709
that and all these are things and you

50
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,029
know install sequel server on your

51
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,649
machine I mean it's just it's absurd

52
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,728
right like the the amount of stuff that

53
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,280
you have to go through just to get a

54
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,390
debugger is kind of crazy but you know

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,370
there haven't been a lot of alternatives

56
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,699
to it anyway I took a look at remedy

57
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:16,150
which was the

58
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,949
that that George been working on and I

59
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,409
am pleased to report that it's looking

60
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:21,789
like really solid and so I thought today

61
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,590
I might sort of go over that a little

62
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:26,049
bit as a start of warm-up to get us back

63
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,390
into the groove of things and just see

64
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,489
can we switch to that on stream now it's

65
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:33,369
very reasonably priced for anyone else

66
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:35,650
who wants to switch with me and so if it

67
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,870
turns out to be you know useful this is

68
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,250
an easy thing to afford much cheaper

69
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,599
than a visual studio which costs

70
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,979
thousands of dollars or something if

71
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:50,560
you're you don't want the professional

72
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:54,729
license it is available here here is the

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,069
thing so it's remedy BGH IO I don't know

74
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:58,509
why there's a slash that like it seems

75
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:00,818
like you should be able to do that but I

76
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:04,090
don't know maybe not um so anyway this

77
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:06,189
is the the URL for purchase for some

78
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,569
reason its name your own price I feel

79
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,719
like something like this is worth at

80
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:12,099
least like 50 bucks or something I paid

81
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,068
50 bucks for it because I was like

82
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:16,449
that's how much I'll pay easily for good

83
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:17,319
debugger if it turns out to be good and

84
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,619
it seems like it's gonna be good I

85
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,239
should I send more money but yeah so I

86
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,920
don't know why it's priced so low

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,959
because that's basically free

88
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,030
essentially so I would recommend paying

89
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:33,489
something but also George this probably

90
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:36,310
should be more than three anyway so if

91
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,019
we go in here we can see the

92
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,870
distribution and the first thing I would

93
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:46,209
point out is look at how beautiful this

94
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:48,159
looks right like Visual Studio Lake they

95
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,170
can't even distribute visual studio

96
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,030
without a virtual machine when they do

97
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,798
their previews I don't know if you guys

98
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,329
have seen this but like when they ship

99
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,069
betas a visual studio it comes with a

100
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,469
virtual machine that you have to run it

101
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:02,919
in that's how bad they are at

102
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:05,620
distributing software right this which

103
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,518
is a pretty darn good debugger so far

104
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:13,359
looks as good as Visual Studio it's one

105
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:16,870
executable that's five Meg's that's it

106
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:18,340
right and that's just like a sight for

107
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,798
sore eyes right it's like that's

108
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,598
something that you can trivially put on

109
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,620
your machine you don't have to worry

110
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:25,300
about it

111
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,500
you can check it into your source code

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,420
control so you know you

113
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,279
have all your previous versions so if

114
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,980
you want to roll back to a version you

115
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,929
were using before you just can forget

116
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,370
that visual studio use never that's

117
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,379
never gonna happen right you're you're

118
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,840
never gonna roll back to a version in

119
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:45,430
source control forget it

120
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:47,109
so again just really really happy to see

121
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,209
that now I'm gonna go ahead and install

122
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,220
the latest version I had put an earlier

123
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:55,779
version on this machine this is the

124
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,280
latest one at 1:3 and I don't have a lot

125
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,629
of experience with it yet I'm kind of

126
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,129
early in on it

127
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:01,719
but it seemed to work quite well the

128
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:03,790
only thing that didn't have yet is like

129
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,360
PDB finding stuff wasn't quite in there

130
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:10,030
yet so it didn't really work with PD B's

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,430
that an X's that are moved that are like

132
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:14,500
using pdb alt path and moved or archived

133
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,150
from their locations but it seems to

134
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,610
work quite well for stuff that's just

135
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,739
left in place so if the eggsy or dll's

136
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,230
pdb path that it's got baked into it

137
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,710
points to the pdb seemed to work pretty

138
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,390
well

139
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,099
we can go ahead and try it out on

140
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:30,250
handmade hero so let's let's go ahead

141
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,500
and and and load it up and you can see

142
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,439
what I mean I'm gonna just go ahead and

143
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:39,069
be an optimist here on four-quarter I'm

144
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,870
gonna go into our bin directory Laurel

145
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,668
it's our Miss directory but our one

146
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,228
that's in the path here you know we've

147
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:46,359
got MS dev in there for launching the

148
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:48,120
debugger I'm gonna go ahead and say that

149
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,650
let's just make a remedy dot bat file

150
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:55,019
and what I'm gonna do here is just make

151
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:58,689
a thing that calls out to remedy and

152
00:05:55,019 --> 00:06:00,639
let's see here yeah there we go and so

153
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,829
I'm just gonna have it so that you know

154
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,019
let's be optimistic and see if we can't

155
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,699
make this into our daily debugger and

156
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:09,279
then we don't ever have to see visual

157
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:12,759
studio again so there we go

158
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,739
oops I gotta have the actual eggsy name

159
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,099
in there there it is and for those of

160
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:20,079
you unfamiliar with das batch files

161
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,580
let's mention it again percent star is

162
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,529
just the syntax for saying any

163
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:26,769
parameters that were passed to the batch

164
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:29,379
file on the shell just pass them through

165
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:31,478
so this would allow us to you know if if

166
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,909
remedy ends up having a bunch of command

167
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:35,560
line switches that we want to be able to

168
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,720
use here and there that just allows

169
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,250
those get passed through so you can kind

170
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,360
of think of this batch file as the thing

171
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,158
that like

172
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,348
goes and finds the executable we're

173
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:54,250
running but also that has that ability

174
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:56,800
to add flags as well right now here's

175
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,959
one thing I don't know I don't know if

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,020
remedy wants to run in a particular

177
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,750
location so what I'm gonna do here is

178
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:08,279
I'm gonna probably go a little bit

179
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:12,598
further just just a hair further maybe

180
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,888
well see but this wouldn't and local

181
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:18,000
eggsy files wouldn't work correctly they

182
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:21,579
did that so what I don't know is how

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,779
remedy puts files on the drive so I

184
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,750
don't know what I'm gonna do here

185
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:27,549
exactly I'll leave it like this for now

186
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,649
and we'll maybe look at that a little

187
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,689
bit later I also think George is

188
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,899
tweaking some of that stuff now so well

189
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:36,879
we won't worry about too much okay so

190
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:40,329
let's see what happens let's say we're

191
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:44,229
in the W directory here I'm just curious

192
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:48,579
what happens if I do remedy like this

193
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:51,310
and then I close yeah so this is what I

194
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:54,878
was worried about so it writes this I am

195
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,949
doing I and I file into wherever it

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,778
currently is so what I think I'm gonna

197
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,490
do for now I don't think that's good

198
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,629
like he should probably change that

199
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,180
because it should it should probably

200
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:09,189
write that into a more specific location

201
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,218
so what I want to do is I want to kind

202
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:15,490
of guard against that for now until that

203
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:17,620
gets resolved in the action in like a

204
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,750
future update so if I come in here to

205
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,370
that remedy file what I'm gonna do is

206
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,959
I'm just gonna guard it by saying look

207
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,300
this thing always has to run in its own

208
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,908
directory and we'll deal with it from

209
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,528
there now that does mean that anything

210
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,399
that you know you pass on the command

211
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,708
line that you thought was gonna be

212
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,179
relative to where you are isn't actually

213
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,879
going to be and that's unfortunate but

214
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,559
you know we'll just deal with that

215
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,168
because it's better to not leave this I

216
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,958
am grave files lying around so this way

217
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:45,669
we'll do a push T into that directory

218
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,849
will start remedy this way so it doesn't

219
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:52,659
lock up our command line and then we'll

220
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,570
go from there so here we go and well let

221
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,969
me do that

222
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,649
again so here's remedy again and I'll

223
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,420
close it and this time it should not

224
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:01,940
have written that file out here right

225
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:04,189
Matt didn't so that keeps that properly

226
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,410
guarded and and off we go

227
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,000
so that means now you know for if we're

228
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:09,980
in here and we wanted to start this up

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,639
we can just start about let's take a

230
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,409
look at the actual debugger itself so

231
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,259
you can see across the top it's got a

232
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:20,059
familiar menu system here and I do know

233
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:23,028
someone how to use it already I play

234
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:25,068
with it a little bit on my own basically

235
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:27,679
what happens is in here you can specify

236
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:30,620
the target information that you that you

237
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,629
want we want to use hand-made here

238
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,568
obviously and so that's in our build

239
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:37,990
directory back here it's win32 handmade

240
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:39,799
right and so we can put that in there

241
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,448
for command argument we don't really

242
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,639
have any at the moment for the working

243
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:45,919
directory we know that we run inside

244
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,959
handmade like so so it looks like that

245
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,490
and one of the nice things is you can

246
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,789
just save your session really quickly

247
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,220
using what these are TG r DB g files you

248
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:56,870
don't have to make a SL n or prj or all

249
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,370
these weird other different things that

250
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,159
it's hard to tell like what refers to

251
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,690
what so r DB g files just this is the

252
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,360
debug target so you know you can just

253
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,500
save that and have it and you're done

254
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,259
and so one of the nice things about that

255
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,299
is i can just maybe in here in our

256
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:14,179
handmade directory i might just save

257
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:15,889
that out you know i guess to the route i

258
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:19,458
don't have a lot of opinions maybe about

259
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:21,139
where that needs to go but maybe we'll

260
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,049
put that in the route or what i could do

261
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:25,698
is i could put that in a debug directory

262
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:28,578
we've got this nvidia directory and

263
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:29,990
we've got the MS vc proj directory and

264
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:31,429
so you know the other thing i could do

265
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,620
is make a remedy specific directory i

266
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:34,879
don't know how necessary that really is

267
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,198
so i might just make a debug directory

268
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,549
and we'll start putting things in there

269
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:39,740
in general maybe the in video stuff will

270
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,028
go in there as well so we don't have to

271
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,970
have like lots of directories for this

272
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:46,159
sort of stuff so once that's in there

273
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,259
oops what did i do wrong oh i got a name

274
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,230
this thing so this is like just wintered

275
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:54,110
your handmaid let's say so i believe

276
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,860
once you do that if you just close it if

277
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,959
you start it again

278
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,699
I believe you can just go open and then

279
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,289
pick it and then you've got your target

280
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:01,969
set up the way that you know however you

281
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:04,370
did and you can switch between them that

282
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,500
way so it's pretty easy to do exactly

283
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,460
like they were an MS vc project or

284
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,429
something like that

285
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,889
it should just work right and that's

286
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:14,479
really it the key commands he's done a

287
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,000
nice job mapping them to things you

288
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,730
already mostly know so to launch the app

289
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,399
you can just hit f5 and you know it runs

290
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,570
and similarly you know it's got all the

291
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,449
familiar features if we break into it

292
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,950
you're pretty much good to go we can

293
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,660
click on our starting now click on but

294
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,030
you can see the modules that are loaded

295
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,500
in here and you can see which ones have

296
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,069
symbols they're exactly the ones you'd

297
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,289
expect

298
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,350
we don't have symbols installed for the

299
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:44,599
win32 libraries so we're just looking at

300
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:50,029
the ones that we've made the handmade

301
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,190
one the win32 opengl one and the other

302
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,809
one through two handmade egg Z right

303
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,920
those are the components that are

304
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,329
running the game at the moment and

305
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,089
they're all loaded which is exactly what

306
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,550
we want so if we take a look at the call

307
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,700
stack for any individual one of these we

308
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:06,019
got to go to our threads window here now

309
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,230
one of the things that I found a little

310
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:15,949
bit confusing and I don't really

311
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:20,690
remember to be honest with you I don't

312
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:26,720
remember why this isn't hard on when

313
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:28,280
windbg or MSV see there's some piece of

314
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,460
information that's missing here if that

315
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,259
makes it hard to tell which of these is

316
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,720
our threads and which of these are

317
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,700
threads created by operating system

318
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,379
services let's take it let's just take a

319
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,970
look because I wanted to send this

320
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:46,100
feedback but I was like I don't even

321
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:50,029
really know what don't even really know

322
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:54,529
what the feedback is so if I go here to

323
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:55,669
win through two handmade SLN and of

324
00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:57,139
course it takes a while to start up

325
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:59,899
because you know how could you possibly

326
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:04,759
load that in time and I run this thing

327
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:10,610
if I go to the threads window here so

328
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:14,929
you can kind of see like somehow they

329
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:17,269
get this information right and it's this

330
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:20,750
name thing I don't know where exactly

331
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:21,079
that's coming from but that is really

332
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,059
hey

333
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,250
because now I know that these are the

334
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,739
thread procs and this is the main thread

335
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:32,809
and so it's easy for me to jump down in

336
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:34,789
there right so that's one thing that

337
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:37,009
would be a nice improvement around UV I

338
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:38,240
it's one of the only things I noticed

339
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:40,549
when working on it I was like there was

340
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,240
something that was a little bit nicer to

341
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:47,689
use in in the debuggers I was familiar

342
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,610
with already so anyway that's a little

343
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,079
bit of an issue and so you know the

344
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,430
reason that it becomes difficult is

345
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:55,069
you're kind of hunting through here to

346
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,620
find these things and so you look in

347
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,959
here I'm guessing what it is is that the

348
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,009
other ones hunt upward till they find

349
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:05,539
something they recognize maybe to be

350
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,939
completely honest with you I really just

351
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:09,980
don't know but we can see on here that

352
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,190
that this is you know eventually we can

353
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,570
see the one that is ours and we can like

354
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,750
look at where it is and all that sort of

355
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,100
stuff once we've done that it actually

356
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,429
works exactly the same as everything

357
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,550
else to you know you can just run and it

358
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:27,439
should be able to to break when you stop

359
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,759
on things and so on although that

360
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,500
actually doesn't look like it is at the

361
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,389
moment so maybe I maybe I misspoke there

362
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,828
I didn't have I don't remember having

363
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:34,519
much trouble getting break points to

364
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:39,049
work properly

365
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:42,250
I wonder what's going on there I in the

366
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,250
right place okay

367
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:56,449
doudou there we go so let me just see

368
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:59,329
what I can do here let me go here I can

369
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,920
single step through things just fine but

370
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,060
it doesn't seem to really want me to be

371
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,319
able to set a breakpoint which is weird

372
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:08,479
because I did this a bunch on my own

373
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:11,230
computer and it was fine but this

374
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,070
definitely doesn't seem to want to

375
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,080
alright so maybe this will be a short

376
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,430
demo like I said it's still in progress

377
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,750
so I don't know although I didn't really

378
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,359
have this problem so I wonder if I've

379
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,870
got something more tricky going out the

380
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,480
pdbs on this machine

381
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,919
let's try setting a breakpoint here if I

382
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,590
look at what my breakpoints are you can

383
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,819
see them right here right this one it

384
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,830
definitely located this one it looks

385
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,120
like it had trouble doing oh that's

386
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:42,160
because that's not an actual function

387
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,159
that's why so see that works just fine

388
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:49,939
and so did that so I don't know what I

389
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,260
was having trouble with there and maybe

390
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,370
that's just working out the kinks you

391
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,460
know like I said this is very early

392
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,590
access at this point and this is a

393
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,920
retail build so it's the worst possible

394
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,300
case as well but it does look like it's

395
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,919
having trouble with breakpoints setting

396
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,089
a little bit at least in this miliar

397
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,709
because like for example it couldn't

398
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,450
single step over that line which meant

399
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,519
that it couldn't it wasn't able to set a

400
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,440
breakpoint anywhere in here which I

401
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,579
assume has something to do with again

402
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,910
like that sort of code problem so let me

403
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,160
take a quick look at whether that's

404
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:26,649
release mode issues or not because I'm

405
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:31,699
curious natsu so let me go into and

406
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:33,470
code let's go ahead and open up for

407
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,580
coder here and I just want to change

408
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:40,399
this build dot back to an OD so it's

409
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,259
gonna be a debug built and then in here

410
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,350
I'm gonna go ahead and run that build

411
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:46,730
and just have everything rebuilt for a

412
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,040
debug mode I just want to see if it

413
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,230
behaves any differently here I'm not

414
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,360
sure if it will or not but so here's

415
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,279
this restarting same place I'm gonna

416
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,539
step through this and see now if it

417
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,569
still has the same problem with stepping

418
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:02,179
as it had before and if you remember

419
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:06,318
correctly it basically as when I got

420
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:07,849
down to the sound area here it wasn't

421
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,578
able to continue single single stepping

422
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,250
over that and it looks like it's having

423
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:16,039
no trouble with that sort of thing now

424
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:20,990
so yeah I want to say that maybe the

425
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:23,568
problem with what is it doing oh never

426
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,250
mind it just didn't do anything I want

427
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:27,318
to see that maybe he still got some bugs

428
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,759
with how to figure out where to set the

429
00:17:27,318 --> 00:17:31,579
breakpoint for the next line in a

430
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:34,549
release mode build that'd be my guess

431
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:36,379
because this looks just fine and

432
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:38,629
similarly I'm assuming now I could reset

433
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,100
those break points for what I wanted

434
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,100
before that I was having trouble so I

435
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:45,319
wanted to set a breakpoint like here

436
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:48,230
yeah and that works just fine so I there

437
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:50,299
my guess is there it may not be quite

438
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:54,170
ready for the release mode builds yet

439
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:56,480
for whatever reason again I'm gonna try

440
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,920
and put together a big list of things to

441
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,170
send to George's like here's all the

442
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,759
things I noticed so that's one the nice

443
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,230
part about that is if it repros in

444
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,150
handmade hero it's pretty easy to point

445
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,250
him at it just be like here's handmade

446
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,940
hero

447
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:11,930
go nuts and so hopefully that's

448
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,779
something that can get straightened out

449
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,029
pretty easily so let's go ahead and

450
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:20,480
continue on just with this a little bit

451
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,279
more so it works the same way as you

452
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,630
would expect in terms of being organized

453
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,619
or Windows which is nice the only

454
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,420
difference is like for some reason

455
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:28,039
memory and registers are not enabled by

456
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,360
default probably because they're not

457
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,009
enabled by default in Visual Studio and

458
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,500
he was trying to clone that experience

459
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:36,200
which is great by the way giving people

460
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,509
what they expect is really good because

461
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,720
it just eases their transition but

462
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:43,440
obviously I'm gonna want those

463
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,970
so I turn all those on first of all and

464
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,920
then these things can be peeled around

465
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,589
exactly as you would expect so basically

466
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,440
like you know you can gather things up

467
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:54,689
if you want to and they just create

468
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,529
little tabs exactly as you would expect

469
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:02,600
right and so now it's just a question of

470
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:06,119
well how do I want to make this window

471
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:09,659
arrangement work and one of the things

472
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:12,829
that I actually like that he did here is

473
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,210
he doesn't use mixed mode assembly and

474
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:17,039
source which is what videos show you

475
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,340
does he does a separate disassembly

476
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,839
window and source window so as you step

477
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,470
through you can see both of them

478
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,709
together

479
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,990
I do actually prefer this that's windbg

480
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,759
style so that's the way windbg works

481
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:36,480
Visual Studio meant to be work

482
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:39,180
differently the reason I like that

483
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,529
better is because most of the time if

484
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,630
I'm stepping through the disassembly for

485
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:44,399
anything serious if I'm stepping to

486
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,630
disassembly just because there's some

487
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,700
weird thing I wanted to look at real

488
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:50,280
quick then it doesn't matter I don't

489
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,299
care which one I have but if I'm

490
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,960
stepping to disassembly because

491
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,669
something is actually important usually

492
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,059
I'm in and I'm gonna look at it for a

493
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,009
while

494
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,599
usually I'm in release mode because the

495
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,980
disassembly for debug mode is usually

496
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,179
irrelevant right it's it's storing the

497
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,140
stack all the time like you wouldn't

498
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,820
really be looking at this assembly

499
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,320
because it's garbage so it's only if

500
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:08,490
there's some weird compiler bug you need

501
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:09,419
to track down or something right you're

502
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,450
usually not really looking at the

503
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,710
disassembly so if I'm looking this is it

504
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,360
the assembly I'm usually gonna be in

505
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,380
release mode and in release mode the

506
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,079
correspondence of the disassembly with

507
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,500
the source is pretty bad like it's

508
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,389
usually not very good and so I don't

509
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,799
really like having it intermix with the

510
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,009
source because it makes it harder to

511
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,289
read actually so I want to be able to

512
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:36,269
see them both but I don't really want

513
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:38,129
them interleaved because usually it's

514
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,150
not prepped it's not actually correct it

515
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,580
doesn't actually add to the information

516
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,230
it detraction it so having them both is

517
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:45,059
great so I can be like okay I see it

518
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,120
thinks I'm roughly around here although

519
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:49,559
I'm not really you know exactly there

520
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,479
now let's look at the disassembly that

521
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,829
actually works quite well for me like I

522
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,519
like that

523
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:55,678
and so

524
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,279
I actually agree with this decision and

525
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:02,790
and I would say stick with that right

526
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:04,349
okay so let's go ahead and organize our

527
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:08,428
windows as you know I kind of like to

528
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:11,459
have the watch window on the side so I'm

529
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:15,929
going to go ahead and you know sort of

530
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:18,269
peel over here the watch window and I

531
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,870
don't know exactly how I want this stuff

532
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:23,099
organized we'll kind of see in a second

533
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:25,229
but we're gonna want something like this

534
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:28,169
so I'm gonna want the watch window up

535
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,710
there and I'm probably going to want

536
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:34,110
things like modules and threads and all

537
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,490
that stuff into a separate window over

538
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:37,889
here on this side and I'll try to put

539
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,779
the least you know normally I would use

540
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,150
this slot I can't because my head's

541
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:43,170
there when we're doing a streaming so

542
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,800
that makes it a little harder to

543
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,090
organize but we'll get by right and so

544
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,480
I'm gonna go ahead and put the

545
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:53,428
breakpoints window over here as well and

546
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,960
I'm going to put the call stack over

547
00:21:53,429 --> 00:22:00,059
here and probably the threads as well

548
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,440
and I usually need to be able to see the

549
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:04,769
call sack in the threads at the same

550
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:09,870
time so I might try to do something

551
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:14,609
where like the call stack is like over

552
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:16,739
here right and the threads are over here

553
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:19,729
maybe something like that I'm not sure

554
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,170
right but something like that probably

555
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,929
so anyway the output in the disassembly

556
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,808
can probably go here together registers

557
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,250
probably wants to be over here as well

558
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:33,299
so we can switch to that I don't know

559
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:35,880
it's hard to say memory can probably go

560
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:39,928
over here somewhere

561
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,550
let's say there and modules can probably

562
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:44,429
go up there as well because these are

563
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:46,619
things that we use less frequently so

564
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,700
that that's all fine again

565
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:49,379
don't know if this is really the

566
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:53,759
organization I'll use but something like

567
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:56,250
this is probably what we want so that's

568
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,990
all and as you would expect everything

569
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,769
else seemed to work pretty good so up

570
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:05,308
here you know I can do button and index

571
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:06,720
and and see it it's pretty pretty good

572
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:09,750
right it just does exactly what

573
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,500
expect compound types seem to work quite

574
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:15,298
nicely so a new keyboard controller if I

575
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,150
want to look at it it seemed like I

576
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:20,609
could look at things just just fine all

577
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,970
of that seemed to be fine and it seemed

578
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:26,129
like I could step through them and so on

579
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,929
so a couple things I'm not sure about I

580
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:30,210
don't know if it has the same kind of

581
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:33,630
problems as Visual Studio like for

582
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,970
example if you're inside a block and you

583
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,710
want to look at something let me see if

584
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:42,890
I can get to a block that has some local

585
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:50,150
variables in it that are relevant so

586
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:53,700
yeah let's see I guess this is fine yeah

587
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:56,070
weird really just not we need it okay

588
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,000
so audio wall clock would be an example

589
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:01,740
Frank audio wall clock so if I want to

590
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,490
look at audio wall clock you know here

591
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,009
it is and once it goes out of scope I

592
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,690
want to keep looking at it which in

593
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:11,819
debug mode is very easy because it's

594
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,159
still in the stack in the same place so

595
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:15,839
it should be easy to look at and so it

596
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,250
looks like that so that's another thing

597
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,538
I should really be writing this down you

598
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,609
know in fact I'm gonna go ahead and do

599
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:24,529
that let me just go ahead and and start

600
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:26,788
a little list here on my other machine

601
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:29,908
type on the right keyboard if you want

602
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:33,750
it to actually work so I'm gonna go

603
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:37,070
ahead and start a list here to George so

604
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,069
that he can get

605
00:24:51,390 --> 00:25:01,240
so okay so far we've found release mode

606
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:06,038
breakpoints seems body and stuff that

607
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,990
just went out of scope isn't visible

608
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,460
anymore

609
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,220
again that's exactly the same as Visual

610
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,840
Studio so not a reason not to switch

611
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,240
because you have that problem in your

612
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,339
case it's just something that I know can

613
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,720
be done better and so now that there's a

614
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:22,269
debugger that looks like it's going to

615
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,200
be better it'd be a great feature to

616
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:28,869
have right

617
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:31,390
very very nice so anyway as we come

618
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:33,879
through here I like I said don't think

619
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:35,830
there's that much to look at I mean just

620
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,470
kind of works exactly like Visual Studio

621
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:41,319
and there's not really much else you

622
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,529
need to know let's try to set a

623
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:48,099
breakpoint somewhere I don't know where

624
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:49,839
we want to set a breakpoint let's look

625
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:51,459
at some other code in here if I just

626
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:55,538
open up some code randomly that we've

627
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,058
got um maybe we want to look at some of

628
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:59,859
entity code let's say you know cuz we

629
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:02,399
were looking at some of that stuff so

630
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:06,298
maybe we want to set a breakpoint right

631
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:09,009
here let's say can I run there yes I can

632
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:11,619
everything looks good also I would

633
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:13,089
notice I would point out the

634
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:14,709
responsiveness of this thing is great

635
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:16,329
it's not like Visual Studio where you

636
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,090
hit the step button and you can look at

637
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:21,308
your watch and and you know go get a cup

638
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:23,220
of tea before it finishes updating like

639
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:27,308
the watch window it's like right away

640
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:31,630
which is really nice so again really

641
00:26:27,308 --> 00:26:33,279
nice work on that just demonstrating

642
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,690
what we know to be what we already knew

643
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,069
to be true which is that these things

644
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,070
don't have to be slow it's only if it's

645
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:40,509
visual studio that's slow so one thing I

646
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:42,609
would point out is there probably should

647
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:45,038
be a keyboard shortcut for expanding

648
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,599
this stuff and there doesn't seem to be

649
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:50,798
so I'm gonna add that to the list as

650
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:53,178
well so let's say keyboard expand

651
00:26:50,798 --> 00:27:03,168
collapse of

652
00:26:53,179 --> 00:27:05,239
window compounds I don't know what it

653
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:08,690
should be but like right arrow or return

654
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:11,450
or something and so stepping through

655
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:15,048
here yeah again like looking at some of

656
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:17,838
this stuff you can see it I want to see

657
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:19,460
how it gets updated and and just make

658
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:21,618
sure that that seems to working so let's

659
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,669
say I open up match vector oops this

660
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:24,668
helps if I type it correctly

661
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,249
well I can't how do I edit that or can I

662
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:36,200
not edit that because that would be

663
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:39,200
another thing that yeah so it doesn't

664
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,569
look like I can change these maybe I can

665
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,419
only delete them so I feel like they

666
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:46,778
should be editable so let me go ahead

667
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:46,778
and add that

668
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,180
and once I've got one of those in here

669
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,160
let's see if I open one it's fairly

670
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,590
large here so there we go

671
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:12,480
here we're gonna that's supposed to

672
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:14,339
clear and it did that's good and then

673
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,549
we've got one of them that's gonna get

674
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:19,549
set although it may be getting set to

675
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,650
[Music]

676
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:32,190
let's see entity facing direction can I

677
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:33,900
inspect a particular one so it looks

678
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,720
like it's kind of hard to inspect

679
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,430
variables there like I say entity facing

680
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,190
direction but it doesn't know how to do

681
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,840
that dear F maybe so I think maybe he

682
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,130
doesn't have a parser yet in here so

683
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,799
that's another thing that would have to

684
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:54,510
go in there um unless I'm wrong about

685
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:55,889
that you see here T facing Direction so

686
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,339
that's zero that's why it didn't show up

687
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,530
in there

688
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:03,659
so the weight vector let's see if that

689
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:05,099
gets updated properly oops again so not

690
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,820
be able to edit this is tough because I

691
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:10,439
misspell things too often but that

692
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:16,139
shouldn't be very hard to add I wouldn't

693
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:20,190
think alright so let's see if this

694
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:23,390
updates to one yeah it did so I think

695
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:27,570
that's all good so I'll put in there

696
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:31,320
what do we want to say there that like D

697
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:38,579
references after work

698
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:43,889
so like any and also changed values

699
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:47,220
should be something like that so I think

700
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,610
that's most of what we would be doing in

701
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,610
here

702
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,470
all that seems fine what I will say is

703
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,230
this stack window looks a lot better

704
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,730
than the visual studio stack window like

705
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,380
you get all those nice parameters in

706
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,799
there I think you can turn off some of

707
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,420
that on a visual studio but I don't

708
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,279
think it's quite as complete the module

709
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,720
name I'm gonna kind of get rid of here a

710
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,319
little bit more because we don't really

711
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,789
need that and since my head is blocking

712
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:18,109
too much of the screen I think we'll

713
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:20,509
just leave it like that so we can kind

714
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:22,519
of see but that's kind of nice you know

715
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:24,619
that you get all of those on there what

716
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:26,240
I will say is that they it does make it

717
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:29,299
so that it's a little bit difficult to

718
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,890
see all of the things that you like if

719
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:32,990
you just want to see the stack more

720
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,630
concisely it might be nice if you could

721
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:38,450
turn that off so I don't think there's

722
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,900
any setting for that but that would be a

723
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,900
nice thing

724
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:07,299
let's see breakpoints still seem pretty

725
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:07,300
good I don't know so I guess like I

726
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:16,430
guess what I would say is I suspect that

727
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:18,230
at the moment there's no hardware

728
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:20,210
breakpoints and that will probably have

729
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:24,079
to get added I don't tend to rely on

730
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,250
hardware breakpoints very often I can

731
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,899
tell ahead of time to that this is

732
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:32,269
probably gonna have to go up here cuz I

733
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:40,310
can't see it there um get me get me all

734
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:42,619
my registers yeah yeah I can kind of

735
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:45,200
tell that that the breakpoint stuff

736
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:47,239
needs to get more robust to again

737
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,130
probably like I said this is early so

738
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,559
it's probably just not at the top of his

739
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:58,520
list but basically like data breakpoints

740
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:59,659
and conditional breakpoints at some

741
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:05,529
point you got to get those in there

742
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:08,300
because for you know more tricky for

743
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:12,549
more difficult scenarios you start to

744
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:12,549
have to have like stuff for that right

745
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,059
it's nice it's by the way it's nice that

746
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,769
these are separate first step into

747
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:27,339
instruction and step over instruction

748
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:31,980
versus line all right so I think I've

749
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:31,980
got a nice healthy set of things here I

750
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,460
would say probably the other thing that

751
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:50,859
I suspect that it doesn't do at the

752
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:56,679
moment that we're gonna need it to do is

753
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:59,888
casting so like in here right where we

754
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:05,380
say something like what's a good example

755
00:32:59,888 --> 00:33:06,729
so traversable index is oops well that's

756
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,909
not where we are so let's say we were

757
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,909
here

758
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:23,849
although it looks like I'm never going

759
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:25,169
to quite get there how do I don't

760
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:27,709
actually know how to unset that

761
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,710
breakpoint

762
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,259
ah

763
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:43,190
well that's interesting so for some

764
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:49,279
reason it treats this breakpoint as

765
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:51,140
occurring here that seems a little off I

766
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,139
think there's something off about the

767
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:57,110
pvb person there Oh duh it's cousin if

768
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,210
zero block I'm gonna be it let's try

769
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:01,959
this there we go

770
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:06,400
yeah sorry George that's my fault

771
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:09,470
alright so in here if I look at color

772
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:15,260
and I you know let's say want to look at

773
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:17,628
this as a this x value here if I want to

774
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,919
well I guess I can't really do it but

775
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:21,159
let's say I want to look at that as an

776
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,898
array of integers or something you know

777
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm assuming that you can't put

778
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:29,148
expressions in here yeah so basically

779
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,820
like this for the same reason you can't

780
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:33,019
look at like entity era P which you know

781
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,490
we'd kind of need to be able to do or

782
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:37,460
like in any facing direction was the one

783
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:39,709
I tried right it's gonna need to be able

784
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,059
to parse those expressions and give you

785
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,230
something for a limited set of

786
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:44,599
expressions right doesn't need to be

787
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:49,340
able to do every single one but that's

788
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,659
relatively tricky because you know the

789
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,129
types that can go in here are the types

790
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,050
of the programs you have to be able to

791
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:54,949
get those out of the PDB and all that

792
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,650
sort of stuff so that's that's pretty

793
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,879
that's a pretty big one

794
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:03,070
they'll have to happen at some point so

795
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:08,630
let's see expressions in watch window

796
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:12,250
forecasting listening arrays so that one

797
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:16,970
kind of needs to go a little further and

798
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:18,289
I guess I don't know memory window so

799
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:22,549
some of these things have right-click

800
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:25,279
menus so this one had one there right in

801
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:30,350
the memory window it looks the same so

802
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,970
you can sort of I don't know what oh I

803
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:37,039
see so if I

804
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:40,000
oh it's double-click does that work in

805
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,000
here too no

806
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:47,289
so that's kind of nice that you can set

807
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:51,850
the number of columns it looks like you

808
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:55,779
can sort of have some nice highlighting

809
00:35:51,849 --> 00:36:01,480
there that's kind of nice too what's hex

810
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:03,810
II don't actually think I know what hex

811
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,809
he is

812
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:14,230
well let's see if we can find out is

813
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,900
hexie just a ski if it's a ski in hex if

814
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,590
it's not like a ski if it's a normal

815
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,090
letter and hex if it's not maybe

816
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,350
otherwise I'm not sure what that is so

817
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,600
for the memory window I don't know

818
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:29,759
exactly how to how it works let's try it

819
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,759
so let's suppose I put entity in here

820
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:40,509
okay so it looks like it only does

821
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:44,860
addresses so maybe you have to do so if

822
00:36:40,510 --> 00:37:01,180
to type the address manually 2 6 2 1 2 3

823
00:36:44,860 --> 00:37:02,740
a 9 5 8 ok I see so basically well I'll

824
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,779
be honest I don't really know what hexie

825
00:37:02,739 --> 00:37:07,209
is still I guess it's sort of the thing

826
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,130
that I was thinking of it shows the

827
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:16,420
letters if they are letters otherwise it

828
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:19,420
doesn't yeah ok so I would say this

829
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:22,150
thing kind of needs to oh I like that

830
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:26,050
though I would say this thing also kind

831
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:28,000
of needs to be able to have an easier

832
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,400
way of getting stuff in here because at

833
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,679
the moment like if I wanted to cut and

834
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,309
paste into there how would I get the

835
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:39,609
value right because I can't I can't copy

836
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:44,500
this like there's no way to actually get

837
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:46,599
that value in here right so they're kind

838
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,769
of needs to be ways to you know like

839
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,769
edit those values like

840
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:12,559
um trying to think of anything else we

841
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:15,379
haven't really put through its paces oh

842
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:19,809
and I forgot to put into here to the

843
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:25,910
like thread window should use last

844
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:36,220
symbol names found so you can see which

845
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:36,219
is which and that I think maybe that

846
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:50,610
this is not zero zero one zero

847
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:50,610
[Music]

848
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:04,090
so I think that maybe just about it

849
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:07,059
and so yeah like looking at it and just

850
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,860
playing around with it a bit I think

851
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:12,639
it's not quite ready because of just

852
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,829
some of those things like the I would

853
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,949
say the breakpoints in release mode need

854
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:21,299
to get more stable and then this window

855
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:25,329
needs to work with expressions more

856
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:28,150
that's most of it maybe some way to pick

857
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,860
the threads better but that's mostly it

858
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,559
a lot of the other stuff I listed there

859
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:34,960
are things that I would be okay without

860
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,730
like I could get by and not having to

861
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,480
install video visual studio would be

862
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:43,840
enough for me like that I would easily

863
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,099
make that trade so I think this isn't

864
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:51,880
pretty good shape look I'm pretty

865
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:53,650
optimistic that this would be easy to

866
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,170
replace visual studio with for most of

867
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:59,230
the things I do without that much more

868
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,849
stuff that needs to happen so that's

869
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,858
pretty encouraging really nice work on

870
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:04,750
that George that's coming along really

871
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:07,989
nicely it seems pretty stable hasn't

872
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:10,420
crashed on me or anything here which is

873
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:13,899
good you know you don't want your

874
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:16,358
debugger adding to your debug woes and

875
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,680
everything else seems pretty good so I

876
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:22,269
think we've got a good list there to

877
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:24,909
send him and I say we could just call

878
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:27,070
that a win and we could probably use

879
00:40:24,909 --> 00:40:28,569
this a little bit too for handmade hero

880
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,440
the watch window would really be the

881
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:35,470
major blocking factor and maybe those

882
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,329
release my breakpoints but but a lot of

883
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:38,618
times we step with the bugger we compile

884
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:40,539
in debug mode so I'm not sure that would

885
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:42,309
matter very much so it would really

886
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:44,500
mostly be the fact that the watchman is

887
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:46,389
a little harder to use because they

888
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,000
can't handle those expressions I think

889
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:51,339
we got expressions in here I think we

890
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,858
would pretty much be good to go I think

891
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:57,130
that would pretty much do it for us all

892
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:59,889
right so that's pretty encouraging we've

893
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,240
already got our own editor handmade and

894
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:04,139
now it looks like we're gonna have our

895
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:04,139
own handmade debugger too

896
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,789
it's looking pretty good we even have

897
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:13,610
our own handmade drawing package we just

898
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:14,869
need to make a handmade compiler I guess

899
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,809
well I guess we need a handmade

900
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:19,369
operating system too but you know what

901
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,259
can you do

902
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:23,809
alright so thanks very much George for

903
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:27,440
all of that hard work there it looks

904
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:30,469
great we'll send off this list of

905
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,690
feedback hopefully some of the more

906
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:34,069
pressing ones aren't too hard to add I

907
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,380
don't really know the expression when

908
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,789
the watch window part I mean the nice

909
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,360
thing about that is you can sort of hack

910
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:45,340
in the you know the basic stuff so just

911
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:48,559
like basic casting and basic

912
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:50,630
dereferencing that's most of it right

913
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,670
you don't have to go down a huge rabbit

914
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,420
hole to make some super elaborate

915
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:57,590
expression parsing blah blah blah right

916
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,539
and so I guess what I would say there is

917
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,579
that like you know maybe starting off

918
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:04,130
something simple that just gets us

919
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:06,110
enough so that we can switch then later

920
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:11,780
you know you can spend the time and do

921
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:13,960
some more elaborate you know real

922
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,910
expression parsing and do all kinds of

923
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,340
fancy stuff so I'll go ahead and send

924
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:21,230
that off to George little later I want

925
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:23,329
to go ahead and polish up that email

926
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,579
it's kind of just little jot down things

927
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:29,210
as I thought of them and off to clean it

928
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:30,980
up a little bit but yeah all right so

929
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:34,599
that's great I'm pretty happy about that

930
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:38,030
if you're interested in in that debugger

931
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:41,980
again if you want to purchase a copy

932
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:46,250
yourself you can into Google type remedy

933
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:49,340
BG and then hit return that will bring

934
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:51,710
up this page which is the page on

935
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,809
handmade Network for it which does have

936
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:56,329
the forums again this is the purchase

937
00:42:53,809 --> 00:43:00,829
link so you can go buy it here and then

938
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:04,730
again for giving feedback this is the

939
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:07,009
place so the forums you can go here and

940
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,289
start threads Nicholas Lindbergh also

941
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,300
looks like he was working on it here

942
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:13,340
he's already got some in fact here's the

943
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:17,480
I'm GUI ima one that we were talking

944
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:21,800
about so that's

945
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:24,420
yeah that's just another like kind of

946
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,140
good example of people already starting

947
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,519
to find these things

948
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:32,369
so yeah pick up a copy of that find bugs

949
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:35,250
make suggestions send them back here and

950
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:38,339
George this should not be free there's a

951
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:42,360
lot of work that went into this charge

952
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:44,010
something for it alright so let's go do

953
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,990
some regular programming today cuz I

954
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:48,120
feel like you know we might as well try

955
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:51,269
to get our feet wet a little bit here if

956
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:53,819
I remember correctly we had like an hour

957
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:56,309
the the streams that we were working on

958
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:59,570
just before we left for winter break we

959
00:43:56,309 --> 00:44:02,759
kind of gone through here and we had

960
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:07,710
gone through all of the github issues

961
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:12,420
that we've had and we try to like you

962
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:15,210
know clean them up as best we can get

963
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:18,900
rid of bugs that we we knew we could fix

964
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,940
and so on right and so we've got a few

965
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,309
more in here Martin Smith Zico as he

966
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,230
always does fine stuff for us as well

967
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:28,110
and so there's a new one here that he

968
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:31,139
opened Kim was trying to get things

969
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,309
working on Mac but Mac OpenGL is so poor

970
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:34,170
at this point I don't think it's ever

971
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:36,090
going to I think we're gonna have to do

972
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:39,180
a metal version for Mac so I don't know

973
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:42,000
how much we really care about some of

974
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:44,549
these OpenGL problems because like I

975
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,139
said OpenGL is kind of not OpenGL can I

976
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,690
think are kind of dead I think that's

977
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:50,400
just forget about them so we're probably

978
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,630
gonna have to do a metal D 3d thing at

979
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,670
some point which won't be that hard

980
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,269
we've got our render completely isolated

981
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:59,519
so switching over to a different back

982
00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:01,500
you know backing API is not the end of

983
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,630
the world

984
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,730
so anyway a couple of things that we do

985
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:10,320
want to do though is I think we want to

986
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:11,460
talk about the the Downloads the the

987
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,410
different ways that the send all

988
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,590
downloads work now because I basically

989
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:19,559
went in have the hhas so that they can

990
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:20,730
be exploited directly now and you don't

991
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,250
have to worry about that so much anymore

992
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:25,260
and so what I wanted to do as a very

993
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:27,449
first very simple thing is change the

994
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,490
readme file because now it's out of date

995
00:45:27,449 --> 00:45:31,379
and it doesn't actually refer to what's

996
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:32,818
going on so you can see here

997
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,289
we have lung that basically says you

998
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:38,909
know how things are going and then we

999
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:41,880
need to say here how this stuff should

1000
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:45,210
be set up now this test assets zip

1001
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,640
doesn't really get impacted unpacked in

1002
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:50,940
there so we kind of need to talk about

1003
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:52,588
this a little bit more specifically so

1004
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,690
we don't need to build the asset pack

1005
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:57,150
files anymore so what we need to say

1006
00:45:54,690 --> 00:46:05,670
instead and we also need to change this

1007
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:19,500
right let's see right so that's supposed

1008
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:21,869
to look like this so we just want to say

1009
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:34,460
look you've gotta have the art files in

1010
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:37,019
there so I think that's all good and

1011
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:43,608
what we need to now do is describe step

1012
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:43,608
3 which is like how you set these up so

1013
00:46:54,559 --> 00:47:01,469
so in step three we want to describe how

1014
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:05,490
you unpack this stuff so that you know

1015
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:09,230
people can do that and what you really

1016
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:13,049
need in here in the data directory right

1017
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:15,679
is you just need these hhhh a's right

1018
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:21,360
you just need that and all of those are

1019
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:24,239
already exported so you just need those

1020
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,650
and then inside the art director i guess

1021
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,739
we're gonna need a step for that you

1022
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:38,340
want to put these PNG x' right but i

1023
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:40,379
think so

1024
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,170
there's a couple different things to do

1025
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:45,329
here and we're a little bit premature on

1026
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,340
this it might be nice to go ahead and

1027
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:49,799
push to get ourselves to a place where

1028
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:53,250
we just rebuild from PNG s 100%

1029
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:56,430
correctly and then we just distribute

1030
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,800
the PNG x' and off we go

1031
00:47:56,429 --> 00:48:01,649
right and so you know that way you can

1032
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,130
do a full art builds pretty easily just

1033
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:07,740
by you know letting the game import

1034
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:10,619
everything or you know whatever that

1035
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:12,449
sort of thing so you know maybe we want

1036
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:16,579
to push towards that a little bit and

1037
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:32,909
say something more like this so in here

1038
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:35,130
we would just say okay let me actually

1039
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:38,250
also look while we're at it I'm gonna

1040
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:39,869
look at what Sun Devil actually has for

1041
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,300
us here because I don't actually know

1042
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:44,819
the answer to that question but I would

1043
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,230
like to basically I would like to get it

1044
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,850
to the point where it's easier for new

1045
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:49,110
people to come on board because we

1046
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:52,019
haven't really done that in a while

1047
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:53,490
and as we are wrapping up engine stuff

1048
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:55,139
and moving towards gameplay stuff

1049
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:57,089
there's probably people who might come

1050
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:59,099
along and want to follow along with that

1051
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:00,930
who haven't follow along with the rest

1052
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,549
and it's just if you haven't been

1053
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:04,139
following along you can't really build

1054
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:07,320
the game because we haven't done any

1055
00:49:04,139 --> 00:49:10,469
work to make that happen it assumes you

1056
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:12,510
followed us the whole way right if you

1057
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:14,519
want to build the art assets the code

1058
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:17,250
can always be built but the art assets

1059
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:20,849
are like a different story so let me go

1060
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:25,230
ahead and and like just take a look at

1061
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:30,539
the send owl-like downloads here where

1062
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:32,670
is that so Oh Linux multiple desktops

1063
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,279
you can't see right now thankfully me

1064
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,950
struggling with Linux multiple desktops

1065
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:44,130
which of course I set up and then get

1066
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:51,799
confused by let's see so if I want to go

1067
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:51,800
to my send download

1068
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:58,360
that's gonna be here somewhere

1069
00:49:55,139 --> 00:49:58,359
[Music]

1070
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:21,729
and I guess I also have to sign in yeah

1071
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:26,140
and like I said I just kind of want to

1072
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:29,228
know at this point I want to know like

1073
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:30,639
that people can get like up and running

1074
00:50:29,228 --> 00:50:32,438
with handmade here and more easily and

1075
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,088
so we might just do some work on that

1076
00:50:32,438 --> 00:50:35,768
and we also need that anyway because

1077
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:38,918
it's nice to just clean up the art path

1078
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:41,828
there and make sure that that everything

1079
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:43,328
is you know is buttoned up we had some

1080
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:47,640
things we wanted to do there if you

1081
00:50:43,329 --> 00:50:47,640
remember correctly we kind of wanted to

1082
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:54,699
make it so that like the mark-up was in

1083
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:58,568
text files and so on okay so let me see

1084
00:50:54,699 --> 00:51:05,409
if I can get back to their orders let's

1085
00:50:58,568 --> 00:51:07,630
see let's go to the download URL so

1086
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:09,729
currently we've got handmade Hiro latest

1087
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,229
art and data and handmade Hiro latest

1088
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:13,149
source code delete a source code just

1089
00:51:11,228 --> 00:51:16,538
builds out of the box fern and as far as

1090
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:18,699
I know the latest art and data when you

1091
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:21,249
download it I'm just gonna take a look

1092
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:22,659
at what exactly is in there and make

1093
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:27,278
sure that we refer to it a little bit

1094
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:29,199
more cleanly so we'll get that going but

1095
00:51:27,278 --> 00:51:31,358
yeah I think what we want to do then

1096
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:34,239
let's just say that what our goal is

1097
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:36,219
gonna be for the next couple weekends is

1098
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,728
to get ourselves completely clean

1099
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:42,009
rebuilding and I'll post a new set of

1100
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:43,868
PNG s where you basically just you just

1101
00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:46,719
download a zip of the PNG s that's all

1102
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:49,749
of that and then that will just build

1103
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,608
right and what we can do is we can

1104
00:51:49,748 --> 00:51:53,708
export those text files like I was

1105
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:57,038
saying that have the markup for things

1106
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:59,469
in them we'd want to do that anyway we

1107
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:02,349
can just lean on that as a system that

1108
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:03,759
allows us to augment the PNG s with what

1109
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:06,939
we need and then everyone can rebuild

1110
00:52:03,759 --> 00:52:09,728
them so at the moment it looks like we

1111
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:11,889
supplied the exact art and data files so

1112
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:14,139
okay so this is easier than I thought

1113
00:52:11,889 --> 00:52:16,679
so for the time being though what we'll

1114
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:16,679
say is

1115
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:44,129
of the handmade latest art and data zip

1116
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:49,190
must go into the W and made arts and

1117
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:49,190
video and made data directories

1118
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,369
right

1119
00:53:06,539 --> 00:53:17,829
so that looks good you know can we also

1120
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:19,900
while we're in here talk about how to

1121
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:26,589
unpack the code so if I download the

1122
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:32,920
source code that has like you know a zip

1123
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:34,710
file in it code - yeah so you know what

1124
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,630
[Music]

1125
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:40,300
maybe we can talk about this a little

1126
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:42,940
bit differently maybe we can simplify

1127
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:46,119
this a little bit so maybe we say look

1128
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,769
the way directories you can try out

1129
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:53,940
through the video first

1130
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:53,940
unpack the and made hero day

1131
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:56,549
you know what is this called go start in

1132
00:54:22,780 --> 00:55:00,300
data how's this and so inside that

1133
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:03,100
handmade hero source directory just

1134
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:05,440
looking at that as well so there's like

1135
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,150
a bunch of other things in there as well

1136
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,639
and we don't really care about those

1137
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:15,869
necessarily so I won't go out of my way

1138
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:15,869
to describe those but so we can say look

1139
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:21,509
unpack one of the sources it's in here

1140
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:37,579
that looks fine battle looks fine to

1141
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,680
build the game you know you're gonna

1142
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:41,539
need this installed and you can build it

1143
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:44,449
and run build that bat and that will

1144
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:46,969
build it into W builds and then I run

1145
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:49,210
the game all this stuff is correct right

1146
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:52,269
you have to be in the handmade directory

1147
00:55:49,210 --> 00:56:12,829
and then you have to run the executable

1148
00:55:52,269 --> 00:56:14,269
that all looks right all right so let's

1149
00:56:12,829 --> 00:56:15,799
just leave that for now and then

1150
00:56:14,269 --> 00:56:17,780
eventually I think we can probably

1151
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,400
simplify things down a little bit by

1152
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:22,640
making it so that you don't actually

1153
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:26,869
have to deal with this directory anymore

1154
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:28,789
you'll just unpack pngs and it'll build

1155
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:31,789
the HSAs automatically into the data

1156
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:40,210
directory as necessary um that seems

1157
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:40,210
fine and so yeah I think that's all good

1158
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:52,619
I think that's all good that way people

1159
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,630
don't have to worry about the asset

1160
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,550
build at all now and hopefully that'll

1161
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,680
just be a little bit clearer for them uh

1162
00:56:56,550 --> 00:57:01,440
so anyway let's talk a little bit more

1163
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:03,319
about getting this the PNG stuff set up

1164
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,789
kind of more the way that I would prefer

1165
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,080
because we've kind of gotten almost all

1166
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:10,139
the way there and we might as well just

1167
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,840
finish up right all right let me switch

1168
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:14,940
this back yeah so that's all good and

1169
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,690
now we're happy and everyone is shiny

1170
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,250
and happy and smiling alright so what I

1171
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,809
want to do now is just take a look at

1172
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,480
the way this is working so you know if

1173
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:27,929
we run things and we think about how

1174
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,179
this is going and by the way this is

1175
00:57:27,929 --> 00:57:31,379
kind of nice so Visual Studio we may not

1176
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:34,529
have to deal with us very much longer

1177
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:36,300
that debugger was looking pretty close I

1178
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,150
don't want to get too excited because

1179
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,099
you know maybe it just won't work out

1180
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:42,660
but you know I'd like to get to the to

1181
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:44,490
the point I wanted

1182
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,598
I'd like to get to the point where we

1183
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:47,368
could get rid of it and that would be

1184
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,220
just really exciting so you know I'm

1185
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:53,519
hoping I'm really hoping but you know

1186
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:54,959
we'll see so anyway let's let's go ahead

1187
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,659
and talk about some stuff that we want

1188
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:02,070
to do here I'm gonna go ahead and set

1189
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:04,079
this back to optimized build for now so

1190
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:06,119
anyway if we go ahead and run the code

1191
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,119
at the moment and we just think about

1192
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:11,608
what's going on if you look at the

1193
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,559
current situation we have a couple

1194
00:58:11,608 --> 00:58:16,829
things that are like I think pretty

1195
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,779
important for us to to just address

1196
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:20,789
before we actually go start learning a

1197
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,190
ton of game stuff in here

1198
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:24,779
one is the lighting which is that our

1199
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,579
lighting just kind of needs to be

1200
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,869
probably simplified a little and you

1201
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:30,509
know like right now we even have the

1202
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:31,829
volume set to be too small so you can

1203
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,270
see that it doesn't even cover

1204
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:34,710
everything that you can possibly zoom

1205
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:37,769
out to see you can see our lighting

1206
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:39,570
boundary there and so I think we need to

1207
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:43,769
kind of simplify our lighting to not be

1208
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:45,088
quite so aggressive as it is and you

1209
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:47,489
know because we were doing kind of full

1210
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:48,989
like a global illumination and we maybe

1211
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:51,629
need to back off to something that's a

1212
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:53,368
little bit more representational just

1213
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:55,559
because you know we did what we could so

1214
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:57,300
we want to be able to to make it so that

1215
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,619
that runs nice and fast and is this

1216
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,278
largest

1217
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:03,420
the visible region is always and then

1218
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:05,909
the other thing that we want to do like

1219
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,318
I said is address the problem with the

1220
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:10,018
art assets right now which is that we

1221
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:15,900
kinda just haven't quite finished that

1222
00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:18,238
process of of storing the metadata in

1223
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:20,278
text files that can be regenerated and

1224
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:23,429
so what I'd like to do is focus on that

1225
00:59:20,278 --> 00:59:24,989
part I think mostly let's get that part

1226
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:27,838
straightened out and then let's go

1227
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:28,889
simplify our lighting and then let's

1228
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:30,058
call it a day

1229
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:31,739
because I don't know that there's very

1230
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:34,019
much else maybe there's one thing we

1231
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:35,849
should do which is sound because we have

1232
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:38,909
our sound in sort of a half-baked state

1233
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:40,619
let's finish that out and then I think

1234
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:44,699
we can call the engine done because I

1235
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:46,380
mean we're pretty close right we can we

1236
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:48,298
can make a list of things right now but

1237
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,829
it's looking like you know you could

1238
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:52,199
build a game with this pretty easily

1239
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:54,479
we should also reenable our sprite

1240
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:58,439
sorting stuff so like that doesn't

1241
00:59:54,478 --> 01:00:00,149
happen anymore with the clipping that we

1242
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,700
remember or we have Z bias in there to

1243
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:04,588
fix that it's turned off right now so

1244
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:07,169
you know a couple quick things I think

1245
01:00:04,588 --> 01:00:08,068
we do have a couple days of solid work

1246
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,630
to do

1247
01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:10,858
but we're looking really good coming

1248
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,479
back from winter break it's pretty

1249
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:15,210
exciting I mean this is an engine we

1250
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:17,939
built entirely ourselves fully streaming

1251
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:20,999
dynamic lighting infinite size worlds

1252
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:22,380
effectively no loading screens like I

1253
01:00:20,998 --> 01:00:25,288
don't know man

1254
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:26,849
like Pat yourselves on the back if you

1255
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:29,309
followed us this far because we've done

1256
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:33,298
like an entire engine from scratch

1257
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:39,028
for realz no joke not a single library

1258
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:40,349
in sight right yeah it's pretty good we

1259
01:00:39,028 --> 01:00:41,909
do have to play sine and cosine though

1260
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:43,559
we are still using the C runtime all

1261
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:45,239
right sine and cosine we can't kind

1262
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:49,349
complete victory til sine and cosine are

1263
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:53,219
gone so I don't know looking pretty darn

1264
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:54,660
good I would say and so again just a few

1265
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:56,130
things we want to button up there and

1266
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:58,498
then we can just start focusing on world

1267
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:01,619
building and stuff which will build this

1268
01:00:58,498 --> 01:01:04,218
out into a game pretty quickly because

1269
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:07,369
yeah I mean that's mostly what a game is

1270
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:10,048
so anyway I think that's pretty good and

1271
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:13,070
and I'd like to get started on that so

1272
01:01:10,048 --> 01:01:15,380
let's start with just the basics here

1273
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:18,850
I would like to go ahead and look into

1274
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:22,070
what its gonna take for us to transition

1275
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:24,739
so basically right now we only have a

1276
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:25,970
way of storing things in hij files I'd

1277
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:28,869
like to go ahead and see what we can do

1278
01:01:25,969 --> 01:01:32,359
to transition over to storing things as

1279
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:34,819
sort of textual markup that we can use

1280
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,740
and I'd like to separate those out so

1281
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:41,080
one of things I want to do here is say

1282
01:01:36,739 --> 01:01:44,209
look inside that handmade directory

1283
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:47,150
we've got art and that I want to

1284
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:50,329
consider as input from the art team so

1285
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:53,599
actually what I'd like to do is not this

1286
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:57,769
right I don't actually want this to be

1287
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:59,839
with the art assets necessarily and the

1288
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:02,750
reason for that is that I would like

1289
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:07,539
those to be separate and so what I think

1290
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:10,519
I might do is start to pull away from

1291
01:02:07,539 --> 01:02:13,309
this structure a little bit and make it

1292
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:16,909
so that a data pack is basically two

1293
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:21,980
things it's a set of text files and a

1294
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:28,879
set of PNG files and wav files that go

1295
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:32,740
together and that way we can package up

1296
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,420
the text files with the source code and

1297
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:38,000
the PNG s can be shipped separately and

1298
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:40,309
that's just for our purposes because

1299
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,889
every night I upload that all the source

1300
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:44,900
code I don't want to re-upload giant

1301
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:49,429
three gigabyte art packs or something

1302
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:55,280
right and so I think that's really you

1303
01:02:49,429 --> 01:02:57,529
know mostly the the problem there so I

1304
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,570
like to go ahead and do that and push

1305
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:01,550
towards that a little bit much and so

1306
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,990
maybe we kind of start to talk about a

1307
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:06,890
slightly different structure that will

1308
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:10,159
occur here and so we've got sort of this

1309
01:03:06,889 --> 01:03:13,309
data and those are the HHA files that

1310
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:15,469
come in here and here's the arts and

1311
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:20,779
maybe this wants to look a little bit

1312
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:24,069
more sort of compacted there I'm not

1313
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,070
exactly sure how we want to do that

1314
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:36,880
give me a name what do we call these

1315
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:37,989
like source packs it's sort of like you

1316
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,809
know pretend you were going to be

1317
01:03:37,989 --> 01:03:44,859
shipping and add a mod for handmade hero

1318
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:48,219
what would you call the package you know

1319
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:52,240
it's like a datapack or something like

1320
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:54,189
this but there's two versions of it

1321
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:56,289
there's an HHA which you can just ship

1322
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:58,090
by itself and someone can install it and

1323
01:03:56,289 --> 01:04:10,000
play but then if someone wants to edit

1324
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:12,490
that what do you call it what do you

1325
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,409
call it folks we need a name we need a

1326
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:26,379
name its source material may be call

1327
01:04:20,409 --> 01:04:30,399
them sources and so one of the ideas I

1328
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:32,980
had in here was if we had like you know

1329
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:37,180
sources or whatever right and I make

1330
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:40,809
something here that's like the like base

1331
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:43,480
pack what I was thinking is previously

1332
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:44,739
we sort of had this loose notion and I

1333
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,789
didn't really have any way to do it

1334
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:48,489
inside the source code because they

1335
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:49,509
don't really know what to do but before

1336
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:52,029
when we were building things

1337
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,040
everything went into the core hij file

1338
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:55,810
right so like you make a local a judge a

1339
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:58,719
file and it would just pack everything

1340
01:04:55,809 --> 01:05:01,090
into there but what I was thinking is

1341
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:03,279
what we could do instead is if we have a

1342
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:05,740
directory like sources here then what

1343
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:09,670
that could do is every one of these like

1344
01:05:05,739 --> 01:05:13,569
bass or whatever inside here all of your

1345
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:21,659
stuff that you want like you know we

1346
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:21,660
could have our sound

1347
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:30,749
music and you know markup or something

1348
01:05:28,528 --> 01:05:34,409
maybe the mark-up goes in the outside

1349
01:05:30,748 --> 01:05:35,879
right so inside the sources directory if

1350
01:05:34,409 --> 01:05:38,338
we made one of these then you could

1351
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:40,499
imagine other people's doing this which

1352
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:42,358
is like and maybe we even do this just

1353
01:05:40,498 --> 01:05:45,108
to make sure that it works right so

1354
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:51,449
you've got sort of these things that are

1355
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:56,308
like sources that you know like this is

1356
01:05:51,449 --> 01:06:01,798
the intro cutscene and this is the base

1357
01:05:56,309 --> 01:06:05,339
you know game or whatever and when we do

1358
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:08,998
a rebuild each directory inside the

1359
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:13,409
sources directory we would then compile

1360
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:15,719
into an HHA here so we no longer it

1361
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:17,909
would no longer have to think about the

1362
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:20,009
like what goes into the local or it's

1363
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:23,548
like the directory structure on the

1364
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:25,559
drive gets packed individual hhas so

1365
01:06:23,548 --> 01:06:28,619
that's easier for people to create their

1366
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,480
own additional packs because they just

1367
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:31,559
create the data structure that goes that

1368
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,509
the directory structure that goes to

1369
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:36,298
that pack and then it just gets packed

1370
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:38,548
in automatically to one that corresponds

1371
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:40,409
to that directory structure right cuz I

1372
01:06:38,548 --> 01:06:42,268
and I was struggling with that I know if

1373
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:44,098
you remember but when we did that I was

1374
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:45,959
like I don't know where should it go I

1375
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:46,980
guess when you create a locally to say

1376
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,809
it goes in there

1377
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:53,869
right and so I feel like this would be a

1378
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:56,700
really good way to solve that problem

1379
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:58,710
you know and I just didn't think of it

1380
01:06:56,699 --> 01:07:01,139
at the time so it wasn't like I didn't

1381
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:02,579
do it because you know I wanted to do

1382
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:04,078
the other thing first I just didn't

1383
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:07,528
think of it I think this is a much

1384
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:09,690
better way and so if we imagine creating

1385
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:11,518
something that works in this way then I

1386
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:14,818
think we can sort of get ourselves into

1387
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:18,358
that position now one of the things

1388
01:07:14,818 --> 01:07:21,480
that's a problem too is that I thought

1389
01:07:18,358 --> 01:07:25,199
of that we don't need to do and we can

1390
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,969
work around now is if you look at what

1391
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:28,768
happens here the way that I chose to

1392
01:07:26,969 --> 01:07:31,230
solve the problem of how to tag things

1393
01:07:28,768 --> 01:07:32,909
was by changing the file names but what

1394
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:35,519
I realized is that's not that good

1395
01:07:32,909 --> 01:07:36,480
because if the artists want to export

1396
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,039
new file names

1397
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,440
name things whatever they want and

1398
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:41,730
they're not gonna keep these names right

1399
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,829
they're just going to give us a new set

1400
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:48,480
of source files so what we would rather

1401
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:49,980
do is stick that I think this into the

1402
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,289
text files right

1403
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:55,050
so when we go into the sources you know

1404
01:07:52,289 --> 01:07:57,029
and we look in here the the text files

1405
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:59,160
that would have things like hotspots

1406
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:02,580
we'll just keep the tags in for the

1407
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:06,000
things as well right and so I think

1408
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:08,039
that's all we really need to do a bunch

1409
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,050
of busy work there that we're gonna have

1410
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:13,349
to actually do but I think that'll work

1411
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:16,980
quite nicely and so I wish I had kept

1412
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:20,329
the original names on these things and I

1413
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:30,000
may go back and try to find the original

1414
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:31,439
set there too just to see like and in

1415
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,710
fact maybe I'll just get that right now

1416
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:37,649
because I think the send owl page still

1417
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:40,289
has those in the old downloads so maybe

1418
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:43,379
we switch back to the old names and we

1419
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:45,560
make the text file do the work right and

1420
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:51,659
again I think that's just a nice way to

1421
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:54,539
to go down that road alright so let me

1422
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:57,210
try that and see if that works

1423
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:59,539
so up here on the download page you know

1424
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:03,859
there's this old legacy files directory

1425
01:08:59,539 --> 01:09:07,140
and we've got the legacy art files

1426
01:09:03,859 --> 01:09:09,930
download and in that legacy art files

1427
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:12,930
download I think that's got a lot of

1428
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:14,279
that stuff that we would want there and

1429
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:18,060
you know the other thing that I'm

1430
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:24,180
thinking too is we can we can dump that

1431
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:27,060
HHA out into how should I put it into

1432
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:29,850
p.m. geez for the intro art as well and

1433
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,470
we can import all those as well I might

1434
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:33,450
not want to do that I might ask Anna to

1435
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:34,890
clean those up for us too because they

1436
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:39,358
were kind of the ones from yangshin

1437
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:41,730
still had like some weird like places

1438
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:44,160
where the Alpha was not what you would

1439
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:45,959
expect and stuff so we might want to

1440
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:48,298
clean those up and because well you know

1441
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:53,039
while we're at it basically

1442
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:54,779
so if I look at the PNG art packs yeah

1443
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:58,710
so I've got the ones with the original

1444
01:09:54,779 --> 01:10:05,969
names here the like head body and and

1445
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:08,130
stuff ones yeah so let's just grab those

1446
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:09,359
let's just let's just grab those as well

1447
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:14,699
so I'm going to go ahead and pop over to

1448
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:16,799
this machine put the the thumb drive in

1449
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:18,988
there I'm just going to grab those off

1450
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,210
the back and then we can go from there

1451
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:24,559
so let's grab and you can do this at

1452
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:26,760
home too if you're in the mood right

1453
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:31,980
because like I said this is up on the

1454
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:34,140
this is up on the handmade hero download

1455
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:38,250
page so Santa's can be removed that's

1456
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:40,590
good and let's pop back all right so

1457
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:43,979
here's that legacy art file so let's say

1458
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:47,219
we go in here and we go to sources and I

1459
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:50,849
unpack this thing and I say all right

1460
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:57,600
PNG art packs you're going into base

1461
01:10:50,850 --> 01:11:00,980
game come on open all right maybe not so

1462
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,980
we want to put that into base game art

1463
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:06,810
and if I remember correctly we separated

1464
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:09,890
characters into body and head so we

1465
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:13,170
don't really need this anymore right

1466
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:16,950
those can go and then I'll close this

1467
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:19,640
guy out and so looking at this right

1468
01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:22,738
this is the original name for stuff like

1469
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,420
that we had in there and you can see

1470
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:26,519
that there's quite a bit of difference

1471
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,880
there between that and what we actually

1472
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,950
named them to get them tagged properly

1473
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:34,409
which is in here we've got if you look

1474
01:11:31,949 --> 01:11:36,569
at our current art directory right you

1475
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:39,659
can see like this is called Black Forest

1476
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:41,099
a one but you know it's not called that

1477
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:45,238
at all I think it's called block floor

1478
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:47,700
grass right and so what we want to do is

1479
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:50,250
preserve Anna's names for these things

1480
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:52,859
right and I think we can do that pretty

1481
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:56,100
easily like I said by just using text

1482
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:59,670
files to describe them and I don't know

1483
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:01,030
exactly how we want to do that but I'm

1484
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:03,699
guessing that

1485
01:12:01,029 --> 01:12:09,849
could just it's probably easiest to just

1486
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:12,279
put this in one file I think can you

1487
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:15,270
think of a reason not to I can't really

1488
01:12:12,279 --> 01:12:15,269
think of a reason not to

1489
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:25,000
you know the bonus of spamming tons of

1490
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:26,409
text files into the directory because we

1491
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,010
could we could do this two ways I'm just

1492
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:32,289
gonna point out what they both are one

1493
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:35,560
way is we have a text file for every PNG

1494
01:12:32,289 --> 01:12:37,779
right so basically we would create for

1495
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:40,510
block forest oh one we've created text

1496
01:12:37,779 --> 01:12:43,449
filed mirrors block for us so on so we'd

1497
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:45,909
say block Forest a one dot txt and in

1498
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:49,000
there we would put this information so

1499
01:12:45,909 --> 01:12:52,539
we would say the block forest oh one has

1500
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,310
the block floor and grass tags right in

1501
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:57,369
addition to anything else we want to say

1502
01:12:54,310 --> 01:13:00,340
about it the other way is we would just

1503
01:12:57,369 --> 01:13:02,739
have a single text file and that text

1504
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:07,390
file would list all of the files that we

1505
01:13:02,739 --> 01:13:09,159
want write the bonus of doing one text

1506
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:10,750
file is just easier to work with you can

1507
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:12,489
just open it one text file in your

1508
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:15,039
editor and search for the thing you were

1509
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:17,159
trying to edit right it's it's easier

1510
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,289
and quicker

1511
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:21,970
the thing that's harder about it is it

1512
01:13:20,289 --> 01:13:24,880
doesn't play as nicely potentially with

1513
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:26,619
say source code control to people making

1514
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,039
change at the same time you now have to

1515
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:34,390
like merge those text files together and

1516
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:38,529
so it's hard to say which of those ones

1517
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:41,260
you want to do right since I think

1518
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:45,210
handmade hero is is more of a small team

1519
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:48,880
small focused kind of a project right

1520
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:50,319
it's not a triple-a we have 3,000 people

1521
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,760
working on this project like Red Dead

1522
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:53,829
Redemption 2 or something like this

1523
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,210
we're literally the amount of time it

1524
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:57,130
takes to watch the credits to Red Dead

1525
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:58,899
Redemption 2 is like longer than it

1526
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:01,119
takes to actually play like the game Red

1527
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:03,539
Dead Redemption 2 because there's just

1528
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:06,449
that many people who worked on it um I

1529
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:11,399
don't know that we really care about

1530
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:11,399
that merge problem

1531
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,029
so I think I want to go with a single

1532
01:14:13,989 --> 01:14:19,630
text file because that just makes it

1533
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:21,460
easier you know what I mean so let's try

1534
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:24,159
that if we run into problems it's not

1535
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:26,380
that hard to later split it out right

1536
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,300
and furthermore we can make our game

1537
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:30,100
load all the text files that are in that

1538
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,680
directory and process them so if

1539
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:35,110
somebody did want to make one per thing

1540
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:36,909
they could right so we're certainly not

1541
01:14:35,109 --> 01:14:38,369
gonna stop anyone from doing that I just

1542
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:40,840
don't think I'm going to take that tack

1543
01:14:38,369 --> 01:14:44,970
so let's see we were going to do that so

1544
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:47,920
let's say inside the handmade directory

1545
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:50,740
we go to the sources here and we say

1546
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:53,109
look there's this base game directory

1547
01:14:50,739 --> 01:14:55,059
and here it is and I'm gonna say like

1548
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:58,769
this is like base game dot txt or

1549
01:14:55,060 --> 01:15:01,630
whatever right and so it's got you know

1550
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:04,780
information here about what this

1551
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:08,920
actually is and so what I'll do is I'll

1552
01:15:04,779 --> 01:15:20,409
incur mention like also a note KC these

1553
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:26,680
are the assets for the base game and you

1554
01:15:20,409 --> 01:15:29,949
know base game in game assets the base

1555
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:37,090
game and then we would also have another

1556
01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:48,550
one that was intricate scene text and

1557
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:50,319
that would be like these cutscene and in

1558
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:52,750
each of these we just want to list the

1559
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:56,649
pngs this one I can't do yet because we

1560
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:59,199
haven't downloaded pngs for those so we

1561
01:15:56,649 --> 01:16:03,429
just want this to occur so what I want

1562
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:05,349
to do is I want to merge this with this

1563
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:06,909
so the way I'm going to do that to make

1564
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:10,300
it a little easier on myself is I'm just

1565
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:11,590
gonna use the command line here because

1566
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,390
even though the goths command line is

1567
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:13,920
kind of crappy it still is better than

1568
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:16,360
nothing

1569
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,539
it's certainly no Linux command line by

1570
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:21,639
a long shot but still if I go into that

1571
01:16:19,539 --> 01:16:24,579
art directory you can see here's all of

1572
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,000
the art files that we have right now

1573
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:29,140
with

1574
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:31,119
their names if I want to I can look the

1575
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:34,450
dirt command actually has you can see

1576
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:36,970
here options on controlling how the

1577
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:38,739
output goes so if all I want to do is

1578
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,720
just get those names in here I can use

1579
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:43,599
what's called the bear directory listing

1580
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:47,230
which is dira /b and you can see here

1581
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:49,870
hopefully right do you see how it just

1582
01:16:47,229 --> 01:16:52,779
lists them all out for me like that and

1583
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:57,010
so if I want to I can do adder /b and I

1584
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:59,079
can dump that into a temp file and so

1585
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:04,480
let me just do temp dot txt there right

1586
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:07,090
and then if I load up that now I just

1587
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:09,219
have this complete list and so what I

1588
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:12,010
can do is start to make the format here

1589
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:13,570
that will describe these and so what I'm

1590
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:15,250
going to do is just make like a simple

1591
01:17:13,569 --> 01:17:18,179
format I can use to put the information

1592
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:23,199
in that I wanted to put in about these

1593
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:30,159
and so maybe I say something like you

1594
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:33,189
know there's a maybe I say bitmap or

1595
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:35,199
something like a source bitmap or

1596
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:38,949
something like that I don't know I don't

1597
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:42,159
need to say it's a source something like

1598
01:17:38,949 --> 01:17:43,300
this right I guess I don't even really

1599
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:46,239
need an equals there I can just say

1600
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:50,710
here's a source bitmap block for floor

1601
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:53,889
grass right and oh actually guess that's

1602
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:56,470
wrong because this is the handmade art

1603
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:58,240
directory so that's these are actually

1604
01:17:56,470 --> 01:18:03,180
the things we want to use for

1605
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:03,179
Association let me back that up a little

1606
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:07,779
so these are actually the things that

1607
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:10,270
we're going to use for Association so

1608
01:18:07,779 --> 01:18:13,329
first I actually want to do the other

1609
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:18,040
directory as well so in here let me go

1610
01:18:13,329 --> 01:18:21,760
ahead and and kill this buffer let me

1611
01:18:18,039 --> 01:18:25,750
look at the other directory so in

1612
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:28,539
sources base game right in here what I

1613
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,470
want to do is all of those things in the

1614
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:33,670
art directory

1615
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:35,860
I want those again to be adder /b so it

1616
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:36,739
does that right let me go ahead and put

1617
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:41,689
those intent

1618
01:18:36,739 --> 01:18:44,329
temp dot oops temp dot text and so now

1619
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:45,949
if I load those and I just grab this out

1620
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:48,529
these are the ones that were actually

1621
01:18:45,949 --> 01:18:50,210
getting sources from so now I can say

1622
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:52,609
all right there's a bitmap source so

1623
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:54,730
load this thing and then I want to say

1624
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:58,159
some stuff about it right and now

1625
01:18:54,729 --> 01:19:00,439
remember we've got these this is the

1626
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:02,840
information that we've got for it so far

1627
01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:04,909
and so what I want to do is kind of grab

1628
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,770
that stuff out and put that in here in

1629
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:08,180
some meaningful way now we're gonna have

1630
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:10,730
our work cut out for us because this

1631
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:12,170
file needs to be able to be resaved and

1632
01:19:10,729 --> 01:19:14,059
all sorts of other stuff as well

1633
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:18,050
so there's gonna be trickiness here

1634
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:19,400
certainly as we kind of go forward but

1635
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:23,600
that's just how things are going to go

1636
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:25,849
uh so here's our block floor grass we

1637
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,430
know that that is what we want to put in

1638
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:31,010
here so this is basically the tags for

1639
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:33,530
this thing so how we want to specify

1640
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:37,060
this I don't necessarily know but we can

1641
01:19:33,529 --> 01:19:37,059
just do it probably something like this

1642
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:48,230
right and that's really it so we might

1643
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:50,690
want other things in here as sort of a

1644
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:54,409
separate piece of information eventually

1645
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:57,669
I don't actually know but we can kind of

1646
01:19:54,409 --> 01:20:00,019
look at that as we as we go further so

1647
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:01,779
we've got three other things in here and

1648
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:09,290
we can do all those as well so here's

1649
01:20:01,779 --> 01:20:11,509
another source right and you know maybe

1650
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:14,239
we should have named this the problem is

1651
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:15,860
this it's not for coder doesn't know

1652
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:17,869
that this is a code based file so it's

1653
01:20:15,859 --> 01:20:20,509
not gonna try and do anything to help us

1654
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:22,159
here with how this works but that may be

1655
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:24,619
fine but we may want to actually also

1656
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:26,449
maybe we want this text file to actually

1657
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:28,869
be labeled with something else so that

1658
01:20:26,449 --> 01:20:31,340
syntax highlighting and something can be

1659
01:20:28,869 --> 01:20:33,409
kickin so maybe it shouldn't be based

1660
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:38,090
game dot text I don't know that's kind

1661
01:20:33,409 --> 01:20:41,149
of a question going forwards how we want

1662
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:44,750
to deal with that so anyway if I take

1663
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:47,960
this a little bit more seriously here so

1664
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:49,460
going forwards let's look at what block

1665
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:56,390
Orphanage oh one actually

1666
01:20:49,460 --> 01:21:00,289
was so black orphanage oh one is I think

1667
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:07,610
this yeah so block wall man-made wood

1668
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:15,500
drywall is this one and so those are the

1669
01:21:07,609 --> 01:21:26,389
tags that wrong here right and then in

1670
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:28,699
here we've got some other ones and so on

1671
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:30,710
now one of the things that I'm not sure

1672
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:35,630
about is does this actually just want to

1673
01:21:30,710 --> 01:21:37,670
be called block and so right because we

1674
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:42,260
kind of have this notion of that their

1675
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:46,819
sources block body character cover hand

1676
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:48,980
head right so I don't know if maybe do

1677
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:55,250
these want to be that way like does this

1678
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:59,059
want to just be this probably I think it

1679
01:21:55,250 --> 01:22:04,310
might want to be so because the type is

1680
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:07,520
kind of special right and the tags are

1681
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:09,440
not as special they're matching things

1682
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,810
they don't affect the processing really

1683
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:14,299
these are just for information so that

1684
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:16,910
when the game wants to go grab assets it

1685
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:19,250
uses those this is actually like how the

1686
01:22:16,909 --> 01:22:21,769
asset is loaded and processed and so I

1687
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:27,020
think I want that to be more specific

1688
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:30,890
right so orphanage two and three we had

1689
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:37,130
in here these two so it's the wood in

1690
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:39,680
the stone so too is the wood and three

1691
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:40,909
is the stone right - is the wood three

1692
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,510
of us now

1693
01:22:40,909 --> 01:22:48,500
uh so again just copy those in here like

1694
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:51,230
so and we don't need block anymore

1695
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:53,529
because it knows that from the type same

1696
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:53,529
here

1697
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:02,279
so I think that that seems pretty good

1698
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:04,710
to me right I think we can just use that

1699
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:07,050
and that way we keep the filenames the

1700
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:08,969
same we can put all the markup in here

1701
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:15,329
that we need so any other stuff that we

1702
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:17,369
need to put in here it'll just work yeah

1703
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:21,920
I don't I don't see much trouble with

1704
01:23:17,369 --> 01:23:25,500
that seems pretty easy pretty easy right

1705
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,909
so we have orphan bodies here and we're

1706
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,500
gonna have to figure out which all these

1707
01:23:26,909 --> 01:23:30,439
are because I don't remember what they

1708
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:34,880
all are right so we'll have to do that

1709
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:38,389
and then we've got the Oh looks like I

1710
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:46,469
may be deleted these a little too soon

1711
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:49,560
oh no I didn't I left them in place

1712
01:23:46,469 --> 01:23:53,760
somehow I was smart enough to not delete

1713
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:55,469
those but I so I guess I was smart

1714
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,710
enough to only delete the orphan but the

1715
01:23:55,469 --> 01:24:01,560
character ones alright great

1716
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:03,779
it's always nice to be smarter than you

1717
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,830
thought you were because often times

1718
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:07,710
you're dumber than you thought you were

1719
01:24:04,829 --> 01:24:10,619
so it's kind of the rare occurrence all

1720
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:12,810
right so let's see let's continue down

1721
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:14,340
this path let's get all these merged and

1722
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:16,830
saved off into a file and then we'll

1723
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:18,679
parse the file probably won't have time

1724
01:24:16,829 --> 01:24:21,029
that today we'll start on that tomorrow

1725
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:23,640
and then we also have some work to do

1726
01:24:21,029 --> 01:24:25,469
with exporting the existing markup that

1727
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:27,900
we have which we didn't really do very

1728
01:24:25,469 --> 01:24:32,100
much of but we probably want to do that

1729
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:33,420
as well okay so we've got the rest of

1730
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:39,150
these guys in here I'm just going to go

1731
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:41,310
ahead and do the basic sort of getting

1732
01:24:39,149 --> 01:24:43,319
them started and then we'll try to

1733
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:46,110
figure out who's who because I don't

1734
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:49,049
really remember which is a bit of an

1735
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:51,059
issue I admit that I apologize but we'll

1736
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:53,070
just have to do it manually sometimes

1737
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:56,580
well not sometimes there's a lot of

1738
01:24:53,069 --> 01:24:58,829
times there's a bit of grind to game

1739
01:24:56,579 --> 01:25:00,059
development because you don't ever get

1740
01:24:58,829 --> 01:25:03,359
things right the first time in fact you

1741
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:05,820
rarely do and so you have to be willing

1742
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,538
to kind of go back and and redo things

1743
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:08,009
when there

1744
01:25:06,538 --> 01:25:09,210
you know a better way to do them we

1745
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:10,590
don't need a character template in here

1746
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:14,099
by the way obviously because that's just

1747
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:17,550
a lineup thing that we exported so we

1748
01:25:14,099 --> 01:25:21,840
could be reference it uh so we've got

1749
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:23,909
ground cover in here let's see I guess I

1750
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:29,849
can just kind of cut and paste this in

1751
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:46,319
here as well you get all of those in

1752
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:49,529
there and all these in there and now

1753
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:51,719
these are all the later part right this

1754
01:25:49,529 --> 01:25:53,849
is the part that we were looking at in

1755
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:57,210
the X portion of things right so that's

1756
01:25:53,849 --> 01:26:00,599
just here and so these are just now for

1757
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:02,429
our advisement okay so going forwards

1758
01:26:00,599 --> 01:26:06,599
also let me while I'm at it let me

1759
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:12,929
finish this part here so let's put this

1760
01:26:06,599 --> 01:26:27,059
in there oops those are not hands those

1761
01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:36,980
are heads in there so those are all the

1762
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:45,480
heads of all the orphans and finally the

1763
01:26:36,979 --> 01:26:49,319
miscellaneous stuff at the end so here

1764
01:26:45,479 --> 01:26:50,638
we've got the title screen which

1765
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:52,170
honestly the title screen

1766
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,239
I think should probably go with the

1767
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:57,210
intro stuff so I don't really think the

1768
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:59,448
title screen should be in here so I

1769
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:06,750
might suggest that we move that over

1770
01:26:59,448 --> 01:27:10,009
into here instead right

1771
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:12,988
now this for stuff like the title screen

1772
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:15,289
we have an import path for those that's

1773
01:27:12,988 --> 01:27:17,908
a little bit different

1774
01:27:15,288 --> 01:27:19,300
it goes through like just kind of an

1775
01:27:17,908 --> 01:27:21,239
arbitrary bitmap path

1776
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:24,760
so I don't know what to call those

1777
01:27:21,239 --> 01:27:26,170
exactly maybe a plate I'm not sure but

1778
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,210
they're kind of like they're their own

1779
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:29,440
thing so let's think about those we

1780
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:35,079
maybe already had a name for him so

1781
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:47,309
we'll look and see so we got items in

1782
01:27:35,079 --> 01:27:49,479
here and then obstacles in here and

1783
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:52,090
again I don't really know if the word

1784
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:53,379
obstacles they're an item and head and

1785
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:55,449
cover and stuff I don't know if those

1786
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:57,130
are all correct they might be they might

1787
01:27:55,449 --> 01:27:58,090
not be we got to go look at the importer

1788
01:27:57,130 --> 01:28:02,230
and see what it wants to do

1789
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:04,960
but again the files here kind of tell us

1790
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:06,639
so we did use oh and in fact we did use

1791
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,230
the word plate so I was right about that

1792
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:10,480
I guess my intuition works the same in

1793
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:12,969
both cases so if we kind of look at all

1794
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:14,349
of what these are here now we just have

1795
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:16,960
to kind of figure out which one goes

1796
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:19,930
with which so some of these are easier

1797
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:24,939
than others obviously in here we've got

1798
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:29,170
like Fred Hannah and and Molly those are

1799
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:32,799
our cat characters and also Krampus so

1800
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:38,590
those we can just use directly so cat

1801
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:46,029
Berman ghost is Hannah and so the tags

1802
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:52,230
on that artist cat Berman and ghost and

1803
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:52,229
then the brown tabby is Fred's

1804
01:28:53,069 --> 01:28:58,199
so that's pretty straightforward as well

1805
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:09,430
the gray tabby gives Molly who you saw

1806
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:18,750
on stream if you saw the four coder

1807
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:23,550
streams there we go

1808
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:23,550
by the way I guess I forgot to put the

1809
01:29:24,119 --> 01:29:41,829
semicolon there now why I put the

1810
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:43,119
semicolon in I'm not sure just because I

1811
01:29:41,829 --> 01:29:44,920
think I like to have things with

1812
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:47,260
semicolons at the end of them having

1813
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:50,079
been a C programmer my entire life

1814
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:53,380
but yeah so anyway coming back here

1815
01:29:50,079 --> 01:30:02,229
we've got Krampus which doesn't have any

1816
01:29:53,380 --> 01:30:04,980
tags besides just Krampus apparently so

1817
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:07,029
those are all good and then we've got

1818
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:09,549
yes some of these are pretty easy

1819
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:11,590
probably so we just have hat one two

1820
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:13,690
those look like they weren't tagged so

1821
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:16,420
we don't really need to put any tags on

1822
01:30:13,689 --> 01:30:18,129
these at all I don't think because we

1823
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:20,529
never tagged them and forest an

1824
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:22,539
orphanage ossicles we didn't tag we

1825
01:30:20,529 --> 01:30:24,579
didn't tag the title screen the

1826
01:30:22,539 --> 01:30:27,640
templates obviously aren't relevant the

1827
01:30:24,579 --> 01:30:32,590
cover never got tagged so we're really

1828
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:34,510
talking just about these here so now we

1829
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:36,220
just kind of need to go look these up

1830
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:39,010
let's do the characters first they

1831
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:40,869
probably are the easiest so we've got

1832
01:30:39,010 --> 01:30:44,500
skeleton skeleton broken skillets and

1833
01:30:40,869 --> 01:30:49,510
dark and mummy so I'm assuming that this

1834
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:50,289
is wrapped that this is dark that this

1835
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:55,360
is broken

1836
01:30:50,289 --> 01:30:56,890
and this is that ones there right and so

1837
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:58,449
those are pretty straightforward because

1838
01:30:56,890 --> 01:30:59,650
they just happened to map directly and

1839
01:30:58,449 --> 01:31:01,389
like I said those are easier than the

1840
01:30:59,649 --> 01:31:05,129
characters which we kind of named weird

1841
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:05,130
things and you know who knows

1842
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:38,050
oops that and so here we go with this

1843
01:31:19,409 --> 01:31:41,859
and done now for hands I we've got fire

1844
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:44,920
glove and skeleton so I'm assuming that

1845
01:31:41,859 --> 01:31:48,000
fire is this one I'm assuming that bones

1846
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:52,840
is this one and that fingers is this one

1847
01:31:48,000 --> 01:32:00,180
so I think we can just do tags Undead

1848
01:31:52,840 --> 01:32:00,180
bones dark and here we can do tags

1849
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:09,340
why didn't that's weird

1850
01:32:06,699 --> 01:32:11,319
shouldn't this be glove oh it's not a

1851
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:13,300
glove right never mind

1852
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:15,519
it's just our hand that doesn't have a

1853
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:18,310
glove so I take it back it's not a glove

1854
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:20,290
right so I think this should all be

1855
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:22,990
lined up now properly and so we're just

1856
01:32:20,289 --> 01:32:24,760
down to orphans now and so those are the

1857
01:32:22,989 --> 01:32:28,659
annoying ones because like I said

1858
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:31,840
they're kind of kind of random so body

1859
01:32:28,659 --> 01:32:33,729
orphan here oh that's easier cuz we know

1860
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:37,900
which one's the hero since they're kind

1861
01:32:33,729 --> 01:32:40,000
of special so that would go in here and

1862
01:32:37,899 --> 01:32:44,920
that's that's easier so this is tags

1863
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:50,470
this is an orphan hero and then we've

1864
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:52,270
also got the head orphan hero so you

1865
01:32:50,470 --> 01:33:01,030
know that should be it will be tagged as

1866
01:32:52,270 --> 01:33:03,100
well so that's good and now we need to

1867
01:33:01,029 --> 01:33:05,859
correspond these ones that are more

1868
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:10,360
difficult right oh wait no it's one more

1869
01:33:05,859 --> 01:33:11,949
we can do which is baby so oh no we

1870
01:33:10,359 --> 01:33:14,559
can't we have to actually look that one

1871
01:33:11,949 --> 01:33:16,920
up alright so we just need to correspond

1872
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:19,780
these now and make these tagged properly

1873
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,578
and so

1874
01:33:19,779 --> 01:33:23,948
if I go in here and look at which ones

1875
01:33:21,578 --> 01:33:26,288
are which but you can see like one two

1876
01:33:23,948 --> 01:33:31,808
three four whatever I need to correspond

1877
01:33:26,288 --> 01:33:34,630
to those now to these so I have to look

1878
01:33:31,809 --> 01:33:37,479
for example head orphan one I have to

1879
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:41,019
look at where which head that was so

1880
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:42,909
here's the head orphans and we can just

1881
01:33:41,019 --> 01:33:46,800
go oh you know what I could probably do

1882
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:49,569
is sort by size so if I sort by size

1883
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:53,229
these will probably line up because the

1884
01:33:49,569 --> 01:33:56,498
sizes are going to only line up right so

1885
01:33:53,229 --> 01:33:58,749
if I go here and I scan down to the

1886
01:33:56,498 --> 01:34:02,738
first time that I see one of the

1887
01:33:58,748 --> 01:34:05,109
characters right character here oh I'm

1888
01:34:02,738 --> 01:34:08,399
assuming that then I will get that same

1889
01:34:05,109 --> 01:34:12,130
thing although oh wait character hero is

1890
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:12,518
not supposed to be there that's a

1891
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:15,489
mistake

1892
01:34:12,519 --> 01:34:17,110
right because character hero is should

1893
01:34:15,488 --> 01:34:17,859
have been deleted it's gonna be inside

1894
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:20,319
head hero

1895
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:22,808
so that's that's actually wrong did I

1896
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:24,578
delete so I deleted almost all the

1897
01:34:22,809 --> 01:34:28,989
correct character files but I missed one

1898
01:34:24,578 --> 01:34:30,908
there we go alright so block tweet we

1899
01:34:28,988 --> 01:34:35,138
know these correspondences so we get

1900
01:34:30,908 --> 01:34:37,598
down here to body orphan hero body hero

1901
01:34:35,139 --> 01:34:39,729
we already did that one so now let's

1902
01:34:37,599 --> 01:34:41,349
scan down for the next one head orphan

1903
01:34:39,729 --> 01:34:44,409
hero we already did that one as well

1904
01:34:41,349 --> 01:34:48,248
head hero so then we've got head orphan

1905
01:34:44,408 --> 01:34:52,899
Lambert and head orphan Oh - now they

1906
01:34:48,248 --> 01:34:57,510
should be the same and they are right so

1907
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:57,509
that's good so OH - is Lambert

1908
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:10,020
so head orphan Lambert's so I guess the

1909
01:35:07,289 --> 01:35:12,180
only real tags here are orphan , Lambert

1910
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:12,660
and those are gonna be the same on the

1911
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:14,940
body

1912
01:35:12,659 --> 01:35:16,829
I would assume right because it's just

1913
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:18,419
body oh wait no the bodies are just

1914
01:35:16,829 --> 01:35:22,769
completely different we decided bodies

1915
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:24,989
don't go with heads anymore all right so

1916
01:35:22,770 --> 01:35:25,740
that's Oh - we've got character we don't

1917
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:28,649
need to know

1918
01:35:25,739 --> 01:35:44,189
we've got head orphan Oh six so head

1919
01:35:28,649 --> 01:35:51,839
orphan oh six is climb we then have head

1920
01:35:44,189 --> 01:35:53,899
orphan Sonny why do these not shouldn't

1921
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,970
those line up differently where is

1922
01:35:53,899 --> 01:36:03,329
locked floor man-made stone why isn't

1923
01:35:56,970 --> 01:36:10,680
that oh how are those slightly different

1924
01:36:03,329 --> 01:36:12,659
sizes is that creepy I guess we we saved

1925
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:15,480
it from and it changed the size at

1926
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:29,399
some point that was interesting alright

1927
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:35,569
so head orphan oh one is Sonny what do

1928
01:36:29,399 --> 01:36:35,569
we got next Cassidy is Oh for

1929
01:36:42,539 --> 01:36:56,279
then we got Carla right

1930
01:36:47,729 --> 01:37:06,138
Oh three and then we got head orphan oh

1931
01:36:56,279 --> 01:37:19,618
five wait why do say five now oh nine is

1932
01:37:06,139 --> 01:37:26,159
Brahm yeah good

1933
01:37:19,618 --> 01:37:27,328
so then twelve is oh but that's body but

1934
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:32,629
that's okay we can start doing bodies

1935
01:37:27,328 --> 01:37:32,630
now so body orphan tank is twelve so

1936
01:37:36,738 --> 01:37:52,578
this is tags equals four Fionn tank I

1937
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:57,539
think right then orphan strength is

1938
01:37:52,578 --> 01:37:59,840
ninety four so oh six strength almost

1939
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,840
there

1940
01:38:02,969 --> 01:38:12,230
then we've got head orphan drew that's a

1941
01:38:09,899 --> 01:38:12,229
five

1942
01:38:19,448 --> 01:38:36,710
and then we've got a bunch of bodies so

1943
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:43,329
we've got earth which is a one go we've

1944
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:43,329
got Giles who is seven

1945
01:38:48,488 --> 01:38:54,789
we've got Dylan who is 12

1946
01:39:00,729 --> 01:39:12,408
Taylor that's the body of o2 right let's

1947
01:39:11,149 --> 01:39:16,448
see this isn't taking as long as I'd

1948
01:39:12,408 --> 01:39:16,448
feared it's a little dry but it's fine

1949
01:39:17,349 --> 01:39:34,670
Rhoda it's 13 assume I spelled that

1950
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:51,670
right yeah body orphan dark so that's

1951
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:51,670
our five and Viva is 11

1952
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:16,109
and Slade is eight so I was right there

1953
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:22,899
why did I leave Oh No

1954
01:40:16,109 --> 01:40:28,199
but I already filled one in I got braum

1955
01:40:22,899 --> 01:40:28,199
wrong how did I do that

1956
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:49,440
it was owned nine right I put it into

1957
01:40:45,899 --> 01:40:56,699
eight that was mistake

1958
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:58,169
plus to be there I think slate is

1959
01:40:56,699 --> 01:41:03,569
spelled that way right

1960
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:07,460
did I not guess I did okay where is

1961
01:41:03,569 --> 01:41:09,869
slate come back here

1962
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:16,399
here we go

1963
01:41:09,869 --> 01:41:16,399
okay so then we've got fauna orphan four

1964
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:28,850
and what else

1965
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:40,920
cook body

1966
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:47,399
he's our three so I'm not sure why some

1967
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:49,140
of these are three tab it's like I just

1968
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:52,429
for some reason indented some things

1969
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:52,430
three yeah

1970
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:57,269
so we're mostly bodies left looks like

1971
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:58,770
we've got almost all the heads we're

1972
01:41:57,270 --> 01:42:01,050
missing two heads we've got a fair bit

1973
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:03,090
of bodies left to go here alright so

1974
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:07,050
let's see body or from cook angle

1975
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:09,500
stringers hand body orphan fall so

1976
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:09,500
that's 11

1977
01:42:14,329 --> 01:42:35,279
so that's tags orphan floats orphan

1978
01:42:21,619 --> 01:42:39,719
fall-spring is nine and I should do just

1979
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:57,679
copy that because I'm going to use it so

1980
01:42:39,719 --> 01:43:00,619
seven is winter speed is fourteen oops I

1981
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:07,219
said I was going to use it and I didn't

1982
01:43:00,619 --> 01:43:07,219
and summer thirteen

1983
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:50,800
we've got Laird at 14 and baby is 10 and

1984
01:43:38,279 --> 01:44:00,489
health is 8 all right I think we're

1985
01:43:50,800 --> 01:44:02,590
almost done let's see yep I think we're

1986
01:44:00,489 --> 01:44:14,639
basically done so then all we've got is

1987
01:44:02,590 --> 01:44:16,319
10 is baby this

1988
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:19,380
and it looks like for some reason we

1989
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:20,368
didn't put the hero Oh was character

1990
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:22,590
here that shouldn't have been in there

1991
01:44:20,368 --> 01:44:25,019
so I think we've got everything now I

1992
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:28,469
think that's it so that's the entire

1993
01:44:25,020 --> 01:44:35,159
markup that associates all the tags with

1994
01:44:28,469 --> 01:44:36,779
the correct pngs right and for the intro

1995
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:41,638
cutscene again we're gonna have to put a

1996
01:44:36,779 --> 01:44:43,469
bunch more plate files in here as sort

1997
01:44:41,639 --> 01:44:46,260
of once we actually get those p.m. G's

1998
01:44:43,469 --> 01:44:49,800
in but you know for now we can ignore

1999
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:51,829
that so if we've got those two and we

2000
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:57,060
kind of come back here so now we can see

2001
01:44:51,829 --> 01:44:58,829
if we look at the handmade sources

2002
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:00,449
directory we can go to the base game

2003
01:44:58,829 --> 01:45:01,948
right it's got this text file the

2004
01:45:00,448 --> 01:45:04,460
scissor that's in there we've got three

2005
01:45:01,948 --> 01:45:09,960
directories we can put our stuff into

2006
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:11,730
that we want and this title screen I'm

2007
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:12,149
basically saying should should get out

2008
01:45:11,729 --> 01:45:14,250
of here

2009
01:45:12,149 --> 01:45:16,170
right so that should actually go into

2010
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:20,399
the intro cutscene directory like so

2011
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:24,719
right and this way now what we can do

2012
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:26,579
when we ship the source stuff we upload

2013
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:30,420
the send al can just be a pack of this

2014
01:45:26,579 --> 01:45:32,639
source directory here and then people

2015
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:38,210
can download that and use it but we can

2016
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:38,210
also like I said keep the txt files

2017
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:46,198
instead of packing those up we can put

2018
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:49,710
those into a different directory right

2019
01:45:46,198 --> 01:45:54,238
now I don't know exactly how we want

2020
01:45:49,710 --> 01:45:55,889
that to go there's another way we could

2021
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,229
do it right which is that instead of

2022
01:45:55,889 --> 01:46:02,250
putting those here in we could basically

2023
01:45:58,229 --> 01:46:06,689
say like oh the handmade sources

2024
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:08,420
directory there's a like the txt files

2025
01:46:06,689 --> 01:46:11,158
actually goes somewhere else completely

2026
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:12,899
so that they don't overlap so the

2027
01:46:11,158 --> 01:46:16,618
sources directory only includes this

2028
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:20,460
stuff and like bass game text and an

2029
01:46:16,618 --> 01:46:22,439
intro cutscene text are elsewhere but I

2030
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:24,149
don't feel like we probably want to do

2031
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:26,549
that even though that's a little bit

2032
01:46:24,149 --> 01:46:28,469
easier for us to package up every time

2033
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:30,960
you want to upload to send out it

2034
01:46:28,469 --> 01:46:32,368
actually not how you would want probably

2035
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,739
it for editing when you're actually just

2036
01:46:32,368 --> 01:46:38,848
making the game data you know what I

2037
01:46:34,738 --> 01:46:40,799
mean I would assume or maybe you do I

2038
01:46:38,849 --> 01:46:42,960
don't know maybe because the text files

2039
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:46,590
are edited separately maybe they should

2040
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:52,469
be somewhere else I'm not sure

2041
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:54,860
hmm that's a good question do I like

2042
01:46:52,469 --> 01:46:54,859
this better

2043
01:47:07,989 --> 01:47:14,510
so I don't really know that's parts a

2044
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,250
little bit trickier and like I said the

2045
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:19,010
problem with it is just that you know

2046
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:24,590
you want these text files to be things

2047
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:28,340
that are that we can change and not have

2048
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:29,720
to redistribute the art files on sundown

2049
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:31,430
again because you know they're pretty

2050
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:34,190
big right you look at how much is in

2051
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:36,350
this based game directory right and it's

2052
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:39,710
like 60 megabytes and so we don't really

2053
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:42,320
want to redistribute 60 megabytes of

2054
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:44,149
pings every time we make one change to

2055
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:47,479
the base game text file which is you

2056
01:47:44,149 --> 01:47:50,929
know 4k because that can just be packed

2057
01:47:47,479 --> 01:47:52,579
up and put in there so you know what I

2058
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:55,360
think I am gonna go and get ahead and do

2059
01:47:52,579 --> 01:47:57,800
that just to make it a little bit easier

2060
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:59,619
what I guess I'll do is say okay if we

2061
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,949
go out to handmade let's say that these

2062
01:47:59,619 --> 01:48:07,519
go somewhere else here and then they can

2063
01:48:03,949 --> 01:48:12,649
get checked into source code control as

2064
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:15,380
well and so maybe you know we have

2065
01:48:12,649 --> 01:48:27,229
something here that's like markup or

2066
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:28,310
whatever right you know or tags so that

2067
01:48:27,229 --> 01:48:30,649
way we have a source is in a tags

2068
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:33,260
directory and this and they're separate

2069
01:48:30,649 --> 01:48:34,609
right and that way this can just get get

2070
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:36,050
checked into source code control and

2071
01:48:34,609 --> 01:48:37,789
this sources directory can be

2072
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:40,850
distributed as the separate thing that

2073
01:48:37,789 --> 01:48:42,470
you download so everything else gets

2074
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:44,930
packed up every day but the sources

2075
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:47,060
don't because they're just too big you

2076
01:48:44,930 --> 01:48:49,550
know what I mean and then we would just

2077
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:52,400
vaporize the art directory right the art

2078
01:48:49,550 --> 01:48:57,110
directory just goes away entirely and we

2079
01:48:52,399 --> 01:49:00,739
just don't touch that anymore I think

2080
01:48:57,109 --> 01:49:05,000
that's pretty good right I also would

2081
01:49:00,739 --> 01:49:05,989
say that I don't necessarily know yeah

2082
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,880
like what we want to do the day

2083
01:49:05,989 --> 01:49:10,239
directory long-term and I guess we just

2084
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:13,190
kind of vaporized all this stuff

2085
01:49:10,239 --> 01:49:15,199
eventually as well but we'll see so I

2086
01:49:13,189 --> 01:49:17,419
think that's more sane I think that's

2087
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:18,889
how I would like to do it and we've got

2088
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:22,220
a couple things we need to do to make

2089
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:23,930
that happen I don't know where we are on

2090
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:27,230
I think I started so I've got about

2091
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:28,310
seven minutes left I think so I don't

2092
01:49:27,229 --> 01:49:31,309
know that I really want to do too much

2093
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:33,110
more today but what we can do is take a

2094
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:34,810
quick look at what we're gonna do when

2095
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:37,399
we when we actually come back and and

2096
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:40,610
tomorrow and start on aren't this stuff

2097
01:49:37,399 --> 01:49:42,319
so if I go ahead and and open up the

2098
01:49:40,609 --> 01:49:46,519
hand made here our source code and we

2099
01:49:42,319 --> 01:49:49,009
look at the sorry not the art we look at

2100
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:52,460
the asset directory I'm sorry the asset

2101
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:55,190
loader source code so like I said before

2102
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:57,409
inside here you know these these art

2103
01:49:55,189 --> 01:50:01,639
assets get written back these this right

2104
01:49:57,409 --> 01:50:03,019
modifications to HHA part is the thing

2105
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:05,840
that allows to do edits and then those

2106
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:07,790
those things get saved and so what we

2107
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:11,590
need to be able to do in addition here

2108
01:50:07,789 --> 01:50:13,880
to the right modifications to HHA file

2109
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:19,279
is we're gonna have to now be able to

2110
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:21,560
maintain this that that text file right

2111
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:23,139
so in here you know when we've got the

2112
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:26,690
[Music]

2113
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:29,210
I'm sorry in here where we've got these

2114
01:50:26,689 --> 01:50:30,649
tags that we're putting on there we need

2115
01:50:29,210 --> 01:50:33,140
to be able to maintain that file now

2116
01:50:30,649 --> 01:50:34,759
there's two ways we can do this one way

2117
01:50:33,140 --> 01:50:37,130
we can do it is to write an additional

2118
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:38,900
file so we can actually put in here

2119
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:40,159
instead of ever overwriting our base

2120
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:41,750
game dot text file which is something

2121
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:44,599
that we've edited and set up for the

2122
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:48,289
tags that we want to to apply to each

2123
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:50,060
individual bitmap file that comes in we

2124
01:50:48,289 --> 01:50:52,310
can either make something that rewrites

2125
01:50:50,060 --> 01:50:54,140
one of these and you know puts the

2126
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:55,970
additional stuff in there or we can make

2127
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:57,920
it so that it outputs a separate one

2128
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:59,240
right and the separate one has the

2129
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,220
additional things in it that we've

2130
01:50:59,239 --> 01:51:05,329
changed when we do our write

2131
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:07,430
modifications I don't know which of

2132
01:51:05,329 --> 01:51:09,019
those we really want to do it seems like

2133
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:11,750
if we're going with a single a single

2134
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:13,850
text file we might want to rewrite it so

2135
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:20,449
it would just rewrite the the one that

2136
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:23,840
we have and go from there so again kind

2137
01:51:20,449 --> 01:51:25,519
of tricky and I might say you know and

2138
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:27,050
and so we've got this this notion of

2139
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,970
like the alignment points and all that

2140
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:30,409
sort of stuff and it seems like we

2141
01:51:28,970 --> 01:51:32,300
probably just want all that stuff to

2142
01:51:30,409 --> 01:51:34,489
just go directly in here I mean why not

2143
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:35,060
and so when we do that I think we

2144
01:51:34,489 --> 01:51:37,909
probably just

2145
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:40,880
rewrite this file and so in addition to

2146
01:51:37,909 --> 01:51:43,250
doing rate modifications to HHA what

2147
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:46,670
we're gonna have to do in here is open

2148
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:51,199
up the the text file the tags file for

2149
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:53,119
this and you know and write that out so

2150
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:54,500
another thing we could do here is say

2151
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:56,899
that you know maybe these files

2152
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:59,090
themselves are called tags files you

2153
01:51:56,899 --> 01:52:00,859
know you know we could do that or we

2154
01:51:59,090 --> 01:52:02,600
could say like you know make a special

2155
01:52:00,859 --> 01:52:04,460
things forgot in HHA this maybe is like

2156
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:07,480
a handmade your a tag file or something

2157
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:11,630
like that which is a different thing you

2158
01:52:07,479 --> 01:52:13,429
know what I mean and so that we can

2159
01:52:11,630 --> 01:52:14,960
recognize what they actually are as

2160
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:16,310
opposed to saying a text file which

2161
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,890
really could be anything

2162
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:20,330
we know that the format is ASCII but

2163
01:52:18,890 --> 01:52:22,430
it's not really a text file in the sense

2164
01:52:20,329 --> 01:52:25,670
that it's not an arbitrary like a CPP

2165
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:29,630
file is also a text file right but

2166
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:31,520
that's not exactly true so if I go in

2167
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:33,590
here I might want to associate this with

2168
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,810
like notepad or something right so that

2169
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:38,539
we can actually look at these you know

2170
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:41,300
like that I don't know didn't I thought

2171
01:52:38,539 --> 01:52:43,069
notepad I have to update this Windows 10

2172
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:47,800
machine or try to I thought notepad

2173
01:52:43,069 --> 01:52:51,019
wasn't it supposed to be able to handle

2174
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:52,039
UNIX line endings one of these days I

2175
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,870
thought that was something they were

2176
01:52:52,039 --> 01:52:57,829
adding and I know how to get that but

2177
01:52:53,869 --> 01:53:01,399
I'd like it um so anyway I'd like to be

2178
01:52:57,829 --> 01:53:04,760
able to to probably rewrite those and so

2179
01:53:01,399 --> 01:53:06,379
I think it'll probably start by doing is

2180
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:08,780
we'll make something that imports that

2181
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:11,239
and does the tagging properly so we'll

2182
01:53:08,779 --> 01:53:13,849
update our import routine here and then

2183
01:53:11,239 --> 01:53:15,619
for the export routine what we'll do is

2184
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:18,920
we'll continue the thing that we had

2185
01:53:15,619 --> 01:53:20,899
before where we owe and you know what

2186
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:25,760
that would also give us a place to set

2187
01:53:20,899 --> 01:53:31,399
our author right so this we could

2188
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:36,890
actually fix now right remember if we go

2189
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:39,679
into the HHA if we take a look here if

2190
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:42,800
you look at these hhas we have the HHA

2191
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:46,329
edit program and that can give us the

2192
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:48,969
info on one of these things like

2193
01:53:46,328 --> 01:53:51,488
you know like this and one of the things

2194
01:53:48,969 --> 01:53:54,670
that's in the annotations if we say like

2195
01:53:51,488 --> 01:53:56,439
jump one of these guys it tells us a

2196
01:53:54,670 --> 01:54:01,090
bunch of things like the descriptions

2197
01:53:56,439 --> 01:54:04,359
and who the author was in the case of

2198
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:07,809
some of the newer assets like the local

2199
01:54:04,359 --> 01:54:10,389
HHA when we look at those assets what we

2200
01:54:07,809 --> 01:54:12,909
can see is that the annotation stuff is

2201
01:54:10,389 --> 01:54:14,230
kind of set somewhat haphazardly like

2202
01:54:12,908 --> 01:54:17,439
there's an author but there's no

2203
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:20,919
description and so that stuff is also

2204
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:23,348
things that could actually get solved by

2205
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:25,480
those tag files because now we could put

2206
01:54:23,349 --> 01:54:25,869
any of that markup that we wanted in

2207
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:30,218
there

2208
01:54:25,868 --> 01:54:32,049
we could put so for example in here you

2209
01:54:30,219 --> 01:54:36,309
know what we could say is we could say

2210
01:54:32,050 --> 01:54:38,469
like global or something like default so

2211
01:54:36,309 --> 01:54:40,480
everybody gets this so we could say like

2212
01:54:38,469 --> 01:54:46,109
off there is an Arab

2213
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:46,109
right and you know actually

2214
01:54:57,260 --> 01:55:03,119
and so that way like the author and

2215
01:55:01,139 --> 01:55:06,328
description for these particular assets

2216
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:08,009
can get set to something reasonable so

2217
01:55:06,328 --> 01:55:09,808
that if you were going to be looking at

2218
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:11,400
them in the future and you just got this

2219
01:55:09,809 --> 01:55:13,920
HHI felling you know idea what it was

2220
01:55:11,399 --> 01:55:15,118
supposed to be if you actually looked at

2221
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,989
the content of the education file it

2222
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:23,399
would tell you where it came from and

2223
01:55:17,988 --> 01:55:24,718
you know that it was art from Anna as

2224
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:27,958
opposed if somebody handed you another

2225
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:29,729
HD file made biases like some buddy out

2226
01:55:27,958 --> 01:55:31,439
there whose you know doing some mods dan

2227
01:55:29,729 --> 01:55:33,719
made here or something like that and put

2228
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:36,538
together separate HJ file they could put

2229
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:38,670
together all through in description

2230
01:55:36,538 --> 01:55:40,288
things and then each one of these could

2231
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:41,699
override the author in description if

2232
01:55:40,288 --> 01:55:43,018
you wanted to but of course in most

2233
01:55:41,698 --> 01:55:44,879
cases you wouldn't really need to

2234
01:55:43,019 --> 01:55:46,469
because most of the time I assume that

2235
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,019
the art packs won't be heterogeneous in

2236
01:55:46,469 --> 01:55:50,248
that way so I think this is better I

2237
01:55:49,019 --> 01:55:51,900
think we should go with this and we'll

2238
01:55:50,248 --> 01:55:54,420
implement that tomorrow it won't be that

2239
01:55:51,899 --> 01:55:56,279
much of a change it's just a slightly

2240
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:58,489
better system than what we had and then

2241
01:55:56,279 --> 01:56:00,929
we could finally call it really done

2242
01:55:58,488 --> 01:56:04,288
because then we've got a way of building

2243
01:56:00,929 --> 01:56:06,239
everything from scratch anytime we want

2244
01:56:04,288 --> 01:56:07,649
and we have a clean distribution model

2245
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:09,388
so we know what we're doing and so I

2246
01:56:07,649 --> 01:56:10,799
think like we've done our homework here

2247
01:56:09,389 --> 01:56:12,179
we've explored a bunch of options and I

2248
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,400
think where you've got something pretty

2249
01:56:12,179 --> 01:56:16,519
good let me go ahead and do some Q&amp;A

2250
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:30,768
here

2251
01:56:16,519 --> 01:56:34,150
let's switch back here and we'll see so

2252
01:56:30,769 --> 01:56:34,150
do we have any questions

2253
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:45,039
when utilizing each scheme you mentioned

2254
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,090
to the priest ream the single

2255
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:48,939
inheritance scheme how would you

2256
01:56:46,090 --> 01:56:51,220
implement functionality to allow modding

2257
01:56:48,939 --> 01:56:53,139
of the game's existing entities and the

2258
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:55,990
code handling them such as a physics

2259
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:59,350
overhaul mod which replaces the physics

2260
01:56:55,989 --> 01:57:02,679
system in the game well so there's a

2261
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:08,470
couple different things about that which

2262
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:12,789
I think are semi orthogonal but so in

2263
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:15,579
terms of implementing a modding I don't

2264
01:57:12,789 --> 01:57:17,229
really prefer a single inheritance so I

2265
01:57:15,579 --> 01:57:18,550
wouldn't use the phrase single

2266
01:57:17,229 --> 01:57:21,849
inheritance to say what I was talking

2267
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:23,800
about John usually prefers to do single

2268
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:26,410
inheritance as his way of implementing

2269
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:29,350
just single type entities writes meaning

2270
01:57:26,409 --> 01:57:31,930
an entity has a type which his does have

2271
01:57:29,350 --> 01:57:34,180
so they happen to be implemented with a

2272
01:57:31,930 --> 01:57:36,610
he likes having the compiler generate

2273
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:39,810
the jump table for him don't ask me why

2274
01:57:36,609 --> 01:57:41,859
he just does okay his prerogative

2275
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:44,590
you know he's shipped two of the best

2276
01:57:41,859 --> 01:57:49,539
games of all time so I'm not gonna argue

2277
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:52,360
with it but I would never really bother

2278
01:57:49,539 --> 01:57:54,340
with that part I would just use the type

2279
01:57:52,359 --> 01:57:56,079
and then make a dispatch table if that's

2280
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:59,289
what I wanted but you know but either

2281
01:57:56,079 --> 01:58:01,090
way they're basically the same design so

2282
01:57:59,289 --> 01:58:03,579
if you're using that particular design

2283
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:05,710
and you want to mod it all you do is

2284
01:58:03,579 --> 01:58:08,500
when somebody ships the DLL that's the

2285
01:58:05,710 --> 01:58:10,840
mod they just say I override the

2286
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:12,850
handling you know in that mod it's got

2287
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:14,739
the table of what functions you provide

2288
01:58:12,850 --> 01:58:17,289
you're like oh I provide the handler for

2289
01:58:14,739 --> 01:58:18,849
entity type blah and then instead of

2290
01:58:17,289 --> 01:58:21,819
calling the existing code for any type

2291
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:24,460
block it calls the mob code for entity

2292
01:58:21,819 --> 01:58:27,039
type blah right and furthermore you can

2293
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:29,619
compose those if you want meaning the

2294
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:32,529
system can allow you to dispatch to the

2295
01:58:29,619 --> 01:58:34,720
old code if you wanted to right so if

2296
01:58:32,529 --> 01:58:36,489
the mod code just wants to do one thing

2297
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:38,199
and then dispatch to the old code for

2298
01:58:36,489 --> 01:58:42,579
that entity it can just do that that's

2299
01:58:38,199 --> 01:58:45,939
not hard right so again pretty simple

2300
01:58:42,579 --> 01:58:47,739
and john would have a slightly harder

2301
01:58:45,939 --> 01:58:49,539
time implementing that than I would

2302
01:58:47,739 --> 01:58:50,829
because since I use just type and

2303
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:52,720
dispatch table it's easier for me to

2304
01:58:50,829 --> 01:58:54,488
work with in his case it would be a

2305
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:56,619
little bit harder because you'd have to

2306
01:58:54,488 --> 01:58:58,569
because he's using the virtual function

2307
01:58:56,619 --> 01:59:00,099
table he asked to kind of still work

2308
01:58:58,569 --> 01:59:03,039
with C++ is broken

2309
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:04,900
inheritance system but he could still do

2310
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:06,760
it right if you asked him to make that

2311
01:59:04,899 --> 01:59:08,199
code he wouldn't go oh my god I have no

2312
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:09,579
idea how he'd be like okay sure and he'd

2313
01:59:08,199 --> 01:59:11,019
go do something similar to what I just

2314
01:59:09,579 --> 01:59:13,238
described but with the inheritance

2315
01:59:11,020 --> 01:59:14,440
system right or maybe he would say okay

2316
01:59:13,238 --> 01:59:16,209
at that point inheritance isn't a good

2317
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:18,669
idea I'll just use the type the type

2318
01:59:16,210 --> 01:59:20,050
same exact thing but the typed way that

2319
01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:21,219
case you just described right like maybe

2320
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:25,060
he would switch at that point I don't

2321
01:59:21,219 --> 01:59:27,340
know as far as replacing the physics

2322
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:29,650
system physics is a system that runs

2323
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:31,300
outside the entity system right because

2324
01:59:29,649 --> 01:59:33,369
it has to handle the interactions of

2325
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,719
entities so typically what ends up

2326
01:59:33,369 --> 01:59:36,729
happening is you don't have an entity

2327
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:39,010
system that has the physics baked into

2328
01:59:36,729 --> 01:59:41,139
it anyway so you're going it's sort of

2329
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:42,789
like asking how do you need to architect

2330
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:44,289
your entity system so the renderer can

2331
01:59:42,789 --> 01:59:47,738
be replaced it's like it doesn't really

2332
01:59:44,289 --> 01:59:49,479
make sense because physics as a plug-in

2333
01:59:47,738 --> 01:59:51,549
architecture if you want to have the

2334
01:59:49,479 --> 01:59:53,379
physics solver be a plugin that's fine

2335
01:59:51,550 --> 01:59:55,260
because usually what entities do is they

2336
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:58,090
just articulate their rigid body and

2337
01:59:55,260 --> 02:00:02,400
continuum dynamics out in some way and

2338
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:05,680
then the physics system runs those steps

2339
02:00:02,399 --> 02:00:07,659
typically the only interface that you

2340
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:09,940
see between any system and the physics

2341
02:00:07,659 --> 02:00:11,920
system is the articulation of the rigid

2342
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:14,079
bodies so like here's where the things

2343
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:15,940
are going to start and then the

2344
02:00:14,079 --> 02:00:18,010
simulation then reports back like we're

2345
02:00:15,939 --> 02:00:20,769
what collided and the entity system can

2346
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:23,680
operate on that as a result right but

2347
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:25,030
really you don't the physics system

2348
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:26,380
shouldn't really be baked in the NDA

2349
02:00:25,029 --> 02:00:28,750
system no matter what its architecture

2350
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:30,699
if that's probably a bad sign if you're

2351
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:33,840
doing that right so I don't think that's

2352
02:00:30,699 --> 02:00:33,840
really part of the question

2353
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:38,469
so what does windbg do better than

2354
02:00:37,210 --> 02:00:39,579
visual studios to bugger have you

2355
02:00:38,469 --> 02:00:41,829
thought about using it in the interim

2356
02:00:39,579 --> 02:00:43,689
between now and when remedy is ready so

2357
02:00:41,829 --> 02:00:45,309
when DB G does something's better than

2358
02:00:43,689 --> 02:00:47,529
something's worse basically the things

2359
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:48,940
they do worse our workflow related they

2360
02:00:47,529 --> 02:00:50,170
have a lot of problems with like hotkeys

2361
02:00:48,939 --> 02:00:52,569
not being buying the stuff they don't

2362
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:54,279
hunt for pdb files very effectively

2363
02:00:52,569 --> 02:00:55,599
they don't load symbols at the times you

2364
02:00:54,279 --> 02:00:57,309
would want them to load them they wait

2365
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:59,050
till they do like delay loading and

2366
02:00:57,310 --> 02:01:00,580
stuff so you can't resolve breakpoint

2367
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:02,980
names it's a lot of stuff that they have

2368
02:01:00,579 --> 02:01:04,569
problems with and windbg it's better in

2369
02:01:02,979 --> 02:01:06,669
terms of the debugger it's a lot more

2370
02:01:04,569 --> 02:01:07,869
features it's a lot easier to do stuff

2371
02:01:06,670 --> 02:01:09,699
like use like symbol

2372
02:01:07,869 --> 02:01:12,579
server or to control how symbols are

2373
02:01:09,699 --> 02:01:13,809
being loaded at a finer grained level or

2374
02:01:12,579 --> 02:01:15,909
to look at what things are being loaded

2375
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:17,440
and stepping through there and figuring

2376
02:01:15,909 --> 02:01:19,479
out how that stuff gets bound you can

2377
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:21,369
also force loading of a PDB to it the

2378
02:01:19,479 --> 02:01:23,439
file easily and say I want to use this

2379
02:01:21,369 --> 02:01:24,819
PDB even though it doesn't match like

2380
02:01:23,439 --> 02:01:26,139
all that stuff just works because it's

2381
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:27,159
got a command line that allows you to do

2382
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:29,380
all that stuff

2383
02:01:27,159 --> 02:01:31,029
it's got time travel debugging so if you

2384
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:33,730
want to you can turn on recording and

2385
02:01:31,029 --> 02:01:36,099
say oh you know I hit a bug and now I

2386
02:01:33,729 --> 02:01:37,599
want to go back in time to like way back

2387
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:40,570
before the bug triggered and see what

2388
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:43,060
happened you could do that it's got the

2389
02:01:40,569 --> 02:01:44,439
ability to do like remote debugging a

2390
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:45,610
lot more cleanly and kernel debugging

2391
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:47,439
and all these sorts of stuff it's got

2392
02:01:45,609 --> 02:01:50,349
like a lot more Pro features along those

2393
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:52,179
lines there's tons of stuff in the

2394
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:55,450
command line that you can do in terms of

2395
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:57,670
just you know basic debug inspection

2396
02:01:55,449 --> 02:02:00,069
stuff you can do things like look at

2397
02:01:57,670 --> 02:02:02,739
what the process list is as if it were

2398
02:02:00,069 --> 02:02:04,630
like see structures and ask questions

2399
02:02:02,739 --> 02:02:06,579
about it and all these sorts of things

2400
02:02:04,630 --> 02:02:08,440
so it's just a better architect and

2401
02:02:06,579 --> 02:02:12,489
debugger just all around it's just much

2402
02:02:08,439 --> 02:02:14,379
better the only problem is it just

2403
02:02:12,489 --> 02:02:15,789
doesn't have good workflow and they

2404
02:02:14,380 --> 02:02:17,500
don't really seem to be serious about

2405
02:02:15,789 --> 02:02:19,269
making the workflow better they sort of

2406
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:20,680
are making servitors I tried to maybe

2407
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:22,060
like post and feedback it didn't really

2408
02:02:20,680 --> 02:02:24,250
go particularly well I don't think they

2409
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:27,789
care that much about really actually

2410
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:29,949
making it easy to use and smooth not

2411
02:02:27,789 --> 02:02:32,710
shouldn't be easy but fast to use and

2412
02:02:29,949 --> 02:02:34,689
smooth it's just they don't seem to get

2413
02:02:32,710 --> 02:02:36,130
that yet and so I don't know if they

2414
02:02:34,689 --> 02:02:38,589
ever will they might be they maybe they

2415
02:02:36,130 --> 02:02:40,329
will if they do it could be useful at

2416
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:42,190
the moment still pretty rough it's a lot

2417
02:02:40,329 --> 02:02:43,510
like remedy in that there's some things

2418
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:47,229
that I would just consider I can't quite

2419
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:49,570
switch this yet for windbg but it's

2420
02:02:47,229 --> 02:02:50,529
alright you know on this machine I

2421
02:02:49,569 --> 02:02:51,819
wouldn't bother because we've already

2422
02:02:50,529 --> 02:02:55,059
got Visual Studio and it works just fine

2423
02:02:51,819 --> 02:02:58,109
so we you know it's fine I probably just

2424
02:02:55,060 --> 02:02:58,110
hold out for remedy

2425
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:03,890
getting a bit fancy here but you think

2426
02:03:02,300 --> 02:03:05,659
of me hey enough scope defaults in the

2427
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:07,280
hht so you could have multiple defaults

2428
02:03:05,659 --> 02:03:12,559
and a file each of which has its own

2429
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:13,939
scope I mean it might be handy I don't

2430
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:17,180
know that I would really want to bother

2431
02:03:13,939 --> 02:03:20,629
but it might be like for example like

2432
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:24,500
you know you might say oh let me make a

2433
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:31,279
tags equals orphan default and then put

2434
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:32,779
all the orphan stuff in there right that

2435
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:35,090
seems totally reasonable you know like

2436
02:03:32,779 --> 02:03:39,969
there's two ways you could do that you

2437
02:03:35,090 --> 02:03:43,940
could just reset the defaults right here

2438
02:03:39,970 --> 02:03:45,500
like this and then later you'd set them

2439
02:03:43,939 --> 02:03:48,049
to something else and then you could

2440
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:50,899
delete the orphan from all of these I

2441
02:03:48,050 --> 02:04:01,550
don't know if we care about that yet or

2442
02:03:50,899 --> 02:04:05,599
not it's not a bad thing I just don't

2443
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:08,210
know if it's really save as much I'm not

2444
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:09,789
averse to a blow though I mean it could

2445
02:04:08,210 --> 02:04:12,140
safe that could be useful I don't know

2446
02:04:09,789 --> 02:04:13,550
you know you could use the d1 report

2447
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:15,740
time flag for CL to see where the

2448
02:04:13,550 --> 02:04:18,350
comparison at the time no actually I

2449
02:04:15,739 --> 02:04:20,710
didn't know that is it is it actually

2450
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:20,710
useful

2451
02:04:26,698 --> 02:04:35,688
so you're singing just say that oh my

2452
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:38,689
god

2453
02:04:35,689 --> 02:04:38,689
okay

2454
02:04:51,359 --> 02:05:08,899
I mean I I don't know what to make of

2455
02:05:01,109 --> 02:05:08,899
this I guess it's sort of

2456
02:05:22,029 --> 02:05:30,368
it's a little much you know what I'm

2457
02:05:25,929 --> 02:05:32,170
saying I mean mostly what it tells me is

2458
02:05:30,368 --> 02:05:33,518
what I already know which is Windows in

2459
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:35,529
the standard library or complete

2460
02:05:33,519 --> 02:05:38,019
disaster and ruin everything including

2461
02:05:35,529 --> 02:05:40,569
your compile time I mean most of stuff

2462
02:05:38,019 --> 02:05:43,208
on here isn't ours why are we even

2463
02:05:40,569 --> 02:05:45,488
seeing things called soap method inside

2464
02:05:43,208 --> 02:05:50,288
our compile time which has nothing to do

2465
02:05:45,488 --> 02:05:52,299
with that right this is why like in my

2466
02:05:50,288 --> 02:05:54,569
actual code base at Mali rocket we don't

2467
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:59,019
allow any includes or libraries at all

2468
02:05:54,569 --> 02:05:59,859
period because it's just garbage right

2469
02:05:59,019 --> 02:06:01,479
it's just garbage

2470
02:05:59,859 --> 02:06:03,158
so really all that does is make me sick

2471
02:06:01,479 --> 02:06:06,939
I'm not sure I would want it turned on

2472
02:06:03,158 --> 02:06:08,888
very often but yeah like just including

2473
02:06:06,939 --> 02:06:11,050
Windows at age 4 including the C runtime

2474
02:06:08,889 --> 02:06:14,729
library it's just a disaster you know

2475
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:18,820
it's a disaster it's bad code and it

2476
02:06:14,729 --> 02:06:22,239
clogs up everything but yeah that does

2477
02:06:18,819 --> 02:06:23,618
seem nice right you know maybe I'll

2478
02:06:22,238 --> 02:06:28,478
maybe I'll put that in here if we ever

2479
02:06:23,618 --> 02:06:29,920
want to look at it again oops just we

2480
02:06:28,479 --> 02:06:34,449
remember the flag because it's a little

2481
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:36,479
bit of a non sequitur just tuck that in

2482
02:06:34,448 --> 02:06:36,478
there

2483
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:47,310
but yeah I mean God you just look at how

2484
02:06:43,050 --> 02:06:48,840
much crap windows and it's like you know

2485
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:51,030
Microsoft you added a flag to the

2486
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,750
compiler to tell me that your code is

2487
02:06:51,029 --> 02:06:53,929
crap

2488
02:06:51,750 --> 02:07:02,159
right like but I already knew that so

2489
02:06:53,930 --> 02:07:04,230
yeah a my as was called that flag -

2490
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:12,809
confirmed the fact that Microsoft's

2491
02:07:04,229 --> 02:07:15,439
libraries are crap and I could just

2492
02:07:12,810 --> 02:07:15,440
print out yes

2493
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:30,570
like we're done with Q's

2494
02:07:49,819 --> 02:08:00,409
all right I think we're good so I'm

2495
02:07:52,649 --> 02:08:03,000
gonna go ahead and wrap it up all righty

2496
02:08:00,409 --> 02:08:04,500
there we go thank you for um for joining

2497
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,539
me for lips on a handmade hero it's been

2498
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:09,449
a pleasure coding with you as always I'm

2499
02:08:06,539 --> 02:08:11,069
excited to kind of get this stuff

2500
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:12,960
wrapped up because it'll be kind of nice

2501
02:08:11,069 --> 02:08:15,269
to just have everything in a nice little

2502
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:16,800
package any bit like hey look it really

2503
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:19,380
works

2504
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:21,570
if you want to following along with the

2505
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:23,430
code at home obviously and kind of what

2506
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:25,289
we talked about a little bit today in

2507
02:08:23,430 --> 02:08:26,369
terms of getting that cleaned up you can

2508
02:08:25,289 --> 02:08:28,050
always pre-order the game on handmade

2509
02:08:26,369 --> 02:08:31,319
hero Oregon comes with all the source

2510
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:33,329
downloads and those will soon be even

2511
02:08:31,319 --> 02:08:34,529
easier to use looks like they're pretty

2512
02:08:33,329 --> 02:08:36,210
easy to use right now because I did

2513
02:08:34,529 --> 02:08:39,239
upload the latest hij stuff so you can

2514
02:08:36,210 --> 02:08:40,770
kind of start where we are today and not

2515
02:08:39,239 --> 02:08:42,059
really have any issues and the readme

2516
02:08:40,770 --> 02:08:43,380
files we're up to date now so it should

2517
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:46,530
be pretty easy for people to get started

2518
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:48,390
but we'll be making that even better as

2519
02:08:46,529 --> 02:08:50,429
we go because I think we can kind of

2520
02:08:48,390 --> 02:08:54,090
transition to a pretty clean scheme now

2521
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:57,329
that'll make a lot of sense so anyway

2522
02:08:54,090 --> 02:08:58,860
that's it for today I'll be back here

2523
02:08:57,329 --> 02:09:01,319
tomorrow when we'll do some of that text

2524
02:08:58,859 --> 02:09:04,319
input/output stuff just to get that part

2525
02:09:01,319 --> 02:09:06,869
of the pipeline cleaned out and yeah

2526
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:10,079
that should be about it and then we can

2527
02:09:06,869 --> 02:09:12,300
move on to maybe we'll just throw sound

2528
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:13,890
in or at it because we kind of got to

2529
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:15,810
clean up the the way that that stuff

2530
02:09:13,890 --> 02:09:16,920
gets managed in the memory management

2531
02:09:15,810 --> 02:09:19,200
now that we simplified those things

2532
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:21,569
maybe we'll do that before we go finish

2533
02:09:19,199 --> 02:09:23,689
the lighting in the homestretch though

2534
02:09:21,569 --> 02:09:25,939
people feeling pretty good about it

2535
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:27,809
engines looking pretty pretty sweet

2536
02:09:25,939 --> 02:09:29,429
alright hope see you back here tomorrow

2537
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:30,780
till then have fun programming I'll see

2538
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:32,840
you around the internet take it easy

2539
02:09:30,779 --> 02:09:32,840
everybody
