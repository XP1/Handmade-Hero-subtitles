00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,300
Start recording.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello, everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,400
The show where we code a complete game live on Twitch.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,100
No engine.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,100
No Library.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,900
Just are only our wits to guide us really.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,800
And, you know, sometimes that can be a problem because some days

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,200
you're just not smart enough, you're just not and you know what?

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,800
That's okay.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,200
Because at the end of the day programming is a marathon, it's not a

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Sprint and so you just have to keep at it and eventually you'll get

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,000
where you're going.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,800
That's my motto.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Anyway,

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,100
And today we are totally keeping at it.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,900
We're working on some Z, stuff that we've been working on for a couple

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,400
days.

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,500
And, of course, it wasn't really a problem of us not being smart

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:43,700
enough.

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,300
It was the problem of just us having a bunch of things that we wanted

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:46,800
to figure out.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,000
And so we're kind of going through and figuring out how we want to

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,500
handle everything in terms of layers in the game.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,900
And so we kind of opened up a bunch of things yesterday because

25
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,100
there's there's, we sort of have this little thing that when we can

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,800
walk up and down levels and kind of a little imaginary stairwell thing

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,900
and it kind of opened up a bunch of things that we need to

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,300
Take care off to get Z handling, totally solid in the game.

29
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,300
And that was really one of the big unknown pieces in terms of engine

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,700
architecture.

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,600
And it's not really a necessarily about the architecture per se

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,400
meaning it's not really about necessarily how the components that are

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,900
running the game fit together but it is sort of about this the

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,300
underlying language of the game, right?

35
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Like how it treats Z and how the different components look at Z and

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,900
use, Z is something that we don't want to.

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,900
To leave in the air for very long, right?

38
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,800
We want to get that nailed down before we start writing any game code,

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,500
certainly because we don't want to be in this situation where we get

40
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,700
halfway through the game and realize our Z is totally wrong.

41
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,300
So we want to be able to sort of know that we've done a good

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,200
exploratory job and have a reasonably good opinion about how ours he's

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
going to work before we kind of push through that.

44
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,200
So before I get started, let me just remind everyone.

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,500
It is day 108.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,900
That means if you have pre-ordered the game

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Handmade here, dot org and you want to follow along at home at the

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,100
source code, exactly.

49
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,100
As I am doing it, you will need to unzip day 107 source code.

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,300
So go ahead and unzip that into a directory and that is all you would

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,600
need to follow along with what I'm doing.

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,300
Well and of course the free version of Visual Studio, A Community

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,000
Edition or whatever.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
But let's go ahead and take a look at where we're at, right?

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,600
And let's talk about some of the things that we need to do to get us

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,000
to where we want to be.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,700
So we set up.

58
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,000
Some interesting stuff here.

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,800
Basically, what we did is we said well, we're not going to draw any

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
ground, we're just going to draw the trees for now because that if the

61
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,900
ground were there, it would obscure the different levels and we

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,800
actually have several levels.

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,000
Now, stacked on top of each other and we drew these little.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,500
We don't actually have a bitmap for stairwells yet, which is a little

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,900
bit of a mistake on our part.

66
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,800
But what you going to do?

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
So we drew these little yellow rectangles in there and we can use

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
them, we can actually use them to walk down.

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,100
Levels, right?

70
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,800
So I can I can keep going up to the top of the stairwell and then

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
walking down it and you can kind of see that as I do that we descend,

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,100
right?

73
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,800
And if I want to walk upwards we Ascend to the next level, right?

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,100
Like so.

75
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,800
And you can also see that we're doing some fading in and out.

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
There, you can see is the trees come in, they fade.

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
But what you'll notice in the thing that I kind of left off with

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,900
yesterday, which I think might be a good thing to fix today at the

79
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,900
start, is you'll notice that we're not like the

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
Actual Z motion of things is not correct.

81
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Like if you if you've ever just looked at even in the real world,

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
you'll know that s things.

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
If things are moving towards you or moving away from you, they appear

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,200
to be moving faster as they get closer to you, not as they get further

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,600
away.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,600
But as you can see, from the way it's working here, that's that's not

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
what's going on, right?

88
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,100
Things in the distance are actually moving faster towards us than

89
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,800
things in the front, and that's because we haven't done anything.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,300
To try and do proper perspective to make our game.

91
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,500
Actually have that real 3D movement feel in Z and even though we're

92
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
not a 3D game, we are handling a bunch of Z as if we are a 3D game and

93
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,200
we just our art happens to be 2D.

94
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,600
And so what we want to do is we want to get the math right there so

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
that it will look as good as it can look because it won't affect our

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,100
performance really, to do the correct Z calculation.

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,700
So, if we go ahead and do all the optimization on our renderer to

98
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,800
handle all the stealing and stuff like we're planning to do, I

99
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,400
We already wrote the simple version, but when we do the optimized

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,100
version for doing all that work to support scaling and stuff, we want

101
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,100
to make sure we don't lose all of the goodness that we get from that

102
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,600
by having a stupid function, that calculates, the scaling at the head

103
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,100
end, which is the cheap part, right?

104
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,600
So what I want to do today is talk a little bit about how that works

105
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,400
and then we'll go ahead and try to set up something where we can

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,900
compute, what those values should be in a more correct way.

107
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,200
So let's take a look.

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,800
Let's go over to the Blackboard here and take a look at that.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,100
I can kind of try to explain a little bit about how 3D transforms work

110
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,400
without going into too much detail on stuff that we don't care about

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
because we're 2D.

112
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,700
But while still kind of hoping to give you a full enough picture that

113
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,300
you understand how it works in general.

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

115
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Now, I'm going to draw both the traditional diagram, and a little

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,100
extension of the traditional diagram, just to set you up for Success.

117
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,300
Should you ever try to step past a 2-D game into a 3D game and want to

118
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,000
kind of understand what's going on?

119
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,800
So anyway, I, I want you to imagine, if you will, you're monitor,

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,500
right?

121
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,200
You've got, you've got a monitor, right?

122
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,000
And I'm going to draw this.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
This is the screen here.

124
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,700
And you are back here somewhere, right?

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,200
And you are looking at the monitor, okay?

126
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,100
And if you know this is where you are.

127
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,800
This is your eye.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,200
And you're you know there's your eyelashes lovely and you're looking

129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
at the screen, right?

130
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,900
You can kind of imagine that what you want to have happen is you want

131
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,100
the screen to behave almost as if it were a window into a

132
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,000
three-dimensional world that were behind it, right?

133
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,400
And what we want to do is we want to draw things on this screen at the

134
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,900
locations where they would appear, right?

135
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,700
If they were to be flattened onto the screen based on where your I was

136
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:29,900
actually,

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
Really seeing them if they were out here, right?

138
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,800
So if I have, you know, some kind of a cube that's out here, right?

139
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,100
That I'm trying to draw.

140
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,300
Like so then you can imagine drawing a line out to each of the points

141
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,600
of the cube.

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Like, so, right and seeing where that line intersects the monitor,

143
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,600
right?

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,500
And then if you drew the cube, with those points, that would give you

145
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,800
the perspective version of the cube, right?

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Because if you think about it, no matter where we sort of take a plane

147
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
in the world, if we were to take all of that incoming light, right?

148
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,700
You can imagine this is light, that's coming.

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,300
Into your eye or something like that.

150
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,000
If we were to just capture all of the light that was passing through

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,600
that plane and found all of it that was headed for your eye.

152
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,700
That would give us.

153
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Write that complete picture.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,400
Okay.

155
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,800
And so if you think about looking how this looks from the side right

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,600
here is the monitor.

157
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
So I'm taking this, this piece here.

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,300
There's the monitor right here is the eyeball

159
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,000
And here's my Cube.

160
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Alright, so here is that line that I'm drawing right down to the that

161
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Iris and you can actually see here where it would intersect, right?

162
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,300
And what I want you to notice.

163
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Is that these points?

164
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,000
This cube is totally aligned right with the horizontal and if we

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,900
wanted to project it straight across both this point.

166
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,300
And this point, let's say this is point a and this is point B.

167
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,600
These two points would actually be projected to the exact same place,

168
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:08,800
right?

169
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,100
They be projected to like there,

170
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
But if we were going to do this sort of perspective, projection, and

171
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,600
that, by the way is orthographic.

172
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,000
That's what they call an orthographic projection in orthographic.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,900
Projection didn't mean to put an S on the end of that, an orthographic

174
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,500
projection is one where points project in straight, parallel lines

175
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
onto that.

176
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,600
The, the imaginary display surface there, right?

177
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,600
That were pretending is the monitor.

178
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,200
But if we actually use perspective lines, right, you can see that

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,900
Loops draw.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That very well really need some kind of a 3D imaging, like one of

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
those little construction programs, if we were to do these lines in

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,900
perspective so that they all converge at the I point, right?

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Then, you'll notice that the same points that were at the same level,

184
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,000
which would have been projected to the same point.

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,700
If we were orthographic in perspective,

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Right, which is what this kind of projection is.

187
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,100
In perspective, they actually appear sort of shrunk down, right?

188
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,300
You can, you can sort of imagine if I was to take like the other one

189
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,400
here, right?

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,400
The back part of the cube, even though it's exactly the same size.

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,300
As the front part that back part projects onto a much smaller plate, a

192
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,800
much Fuller area, right?

193
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,700
It's only that big, whereas the same size object under that big and so

194
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,300
what we get here is this is is you know, what they often call, you

195
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,600
know, foreshortening, right?

196
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,300
Or just perspective you see terms thrown around for it not necessarily

197
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,500
in technical sense, but in an artistic sense, even right?

198
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,700
But that's what's going on there, right?

199
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,700
The shrinking is because we are trying to project things as if we are

200
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,900
capturing the light that's heading to your eye.

201
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Now it's not quite as simple as that.

202
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,900
I will briefly mention the more complex diagram that's actually a

203
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,200
little more accurate.

204
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,000
This is the simplistic one that we're going to use and that most books

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,500
use for three weeks waiting 3D.

206
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,100
So we'll stick with it so you can follow along with those cuts expire.

207
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,600
There's actually a slightly more complete explanation, which is that

208
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,100
in Optics when you're actually talking about capturing light, it

209
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,400
doesn't really work this way.

210
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,500
What actually happens, right?

211
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Is you've got a lens assembly, right?

212
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,700
And I'll sort of idealized that lens assembly by drawing just a single

213
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,100
lens.

214
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,300
Right.

215
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,800
But you imagine like, a camera or your eye or something like that,

216
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,400
right?

217
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:28,900
What?

218
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
Actually happens and I apologize.

219
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,100
Effect, turn off your brain and don't listen.

220
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
To this right now, if you're afraid of being confused by stuff that

221
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,500
doesn't apply to today's lesson, because this is entirely optional

222
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,700
everything that I'm saying from from here, until when I tell you to

223
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
turn the brain back on, okay?

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But for people who just want to know, this is how things actually

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,300
work.

226
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,100
So in the real world, it's not quite as simple as that.

227
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,800
What actually happens is, there are lenses either your eyeball or a

228
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,100
camera lens, something like that.

229
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,800
And light, that is coming in to the lens.

230
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Like so,

231
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,900
Right, light that is coming into the lens, hits, the lens and gets

232
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,400
refracted, right?

233
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Which is the term we use to describe what happens to light when it

234
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,000
passes through something, which does not absorb it.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,500
But only changes its direction, right?

236
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,800
It gets refracted and focus down to a point, okay?

237
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,800
That point is called the focal point.

238
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,600
It is behind the lens somewhere and you can see, it's kind of similar

239
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,100
to this drawing.

240
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,600
We drew over here but what then happens is the light continues, right?

241
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,900
Because it's just focusing to a point and then continuing through

242
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,700
there's nothing to gather the light there.

243
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,300
And then in the back we actually have something that gathers it right.

244
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,900
Either?

245
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,200
It would be your retina right in if this was your eyeball, right?

246
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,000
Or it would be like the image plane or the film back in a camera.

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
Let's say, right.

248
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,200
The actual thing that you're trying to expose the light to write or

249
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,800
the sensor in a digital camera, okay?

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And the reason that this diagram is relatively important to

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,600
understand.

252
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,000
If you want to understand more advanced imaging techniques, is that if

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,700
you look at what happens here it is.

254
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,000
Not the case that a point in the real world is only sending light in

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,300
one direction to a pixel on the screen, right?

256
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,900
What's actually happening.

257
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:37,500
A cone of light, that is the radius of the lens big at the lens and

258
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,100
which focuses down to a single point at the point where you're talking

259
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,200
about the, the light reflecting, right?

260
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
So photons are coming in here, right?

261
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,100
Photons are hitting some surface.

262
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,700
Let's imagine.

263
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,400
This is some surface here, whatever it is.

264
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,000
This is the wall photons are coming in from all directions.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,400
Remember when we talked about lighting photons are coming in from all

266
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,900
directions, they're hitting this and they're bouncing out

267
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,400
Out.

268
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,000
Right.

269
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,200
All of the photons that bounce out within this, cone will all hit the

270
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,600
lens and we'll all project two points on back on this, on this image

271
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
plane, right?

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,800
And it's kind of hard to draw a single diagram, which actually

273
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,600
captures how that will work, because I can't show you.

274
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
It's a very multi-dimensional problem.

275
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,500
There's where the point is dependent determine sort of where it

276
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,900
projects.

277
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,700
To the film back and The Cone, right?

278
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,700
You imagine is not actually focusing quite to a point.

279
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,400
It's actually doing sort of this sort of a thing back here, right?

280
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,500
There's there's sort of this this this different sort of process

281
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,000
happening with all the light that happens.

282
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,600
So it's actually kind of confusing to think about exactly how this

283
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,400
actually works.

284
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,400
If I was to draw one, perhaps a little bit more accurately for an

285
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,500
image, it would look something.

286
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,200
if the supports that it would look something,

287
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,400
Probably raise the part back here as well.

288
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,900
Okay, here we go.

289
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
It would look something like okay I've got this back here.

290
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
This is my actual image right?

291
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,400
And at each point on the image, right?

292
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,600
I'm going to end up with all of the light that could have hit this

293
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,900
point, right?

294
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,000
That pass through this lens and the part that I'm trying to get to

295
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,600
which is really hard to draw this diagram, right?

296
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,000
This is probably why computer graphics books, don't go into this kind

297
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,900
of detail until you get to physically based rendering.

298
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,100
But basically, the point that I was trying to get to so far is that

299
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,000
what happens here, right?

300
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,600
Is that when this light passes out in to hit the lens right and it

301
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,700
gets refracted.

302
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,100
Well, it depends where this point is where it's going to actually

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
capture the light from, right.

304
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:57,800
Right.

305
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,700
And so you have to imagine, like, all of the

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Is that are going to hit that point from the lens, all get projected

307
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,400
down and hit a specific point out in the real world.

308
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,300
Like so.

309
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,900
Okay, I try to draw this as accurate as I can.

310
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,200
I don't know if I did a very good job.

311
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,200
But so here is a point on the image plane here is a point in the world

312
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,000
and there is our wall, a mover wall up so it can hit it there.

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,600
Right?

314
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,100
And so what you can see is the actual light that's passing through the

315
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
lens here is actually much.

316
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,900
There's actually more

317
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,800
More light coming than just a single Ray that hits directly.

318
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,000
It's a whole family of rays that are in a cone, right?

319
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,600
And what this means is the bigger, the lens size, like the bigger, the

320
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,800
actual physical size of the lens is the more actual light from

321
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,400
surfaces.

322
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,600
It's capturing and actually The Wider, the angle of stuff coming off

323
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
of the surface is Right.

324
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,500
Hopefully, that makes some sense.

325
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,900
So what happens in this process is you're not just talking

326
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,800
About single point projected single points.

327
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,600
First you have that cone right, which hopefully I've Illustrated here

328
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:12,600
to some degree and then you also have what's often called Boca or

329
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,100
depth of field.

330
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,600
Which is that you have to remember what would happen if there wasn't a

331
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,100
wall right here, where these things converge, right?

332
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,400
Suppose, the wall actually was back where I originally drew the wall,

333
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,600
right?

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,100
So here is my wall.

335
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,100
So the points all converge here.

336
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Then what happens is?

337
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,700
They fan out again, right?

338
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,900
And so now, not only am I capturing light from a cone from a point,

339
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,500
right?

340
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,200
All of the photons passing through there that come out of here,

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,300
But the actual area in the world that is contributing light to that

342
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,200
point is not infinitesimal, its large, right?

343
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,600
And the further back the wall is from this point.

344
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
The more of those photons.

345
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The bigger the area is that I would sort of be capturing and this is

346
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
called like the focus point, right?

347
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
This is this is actually where you are focusing, right?

348
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,000
That's the focus of the camera.

349
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,500
So anything that's right in here.

350
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Will be nice and crisp but everything that's

351
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,800
Outside, or if I was to move it closer.

352
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,300
Again, look at that area.

353
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,500
It's taking a whole area and projecting it onto one point, right?

354
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,900
So everything that's nearby to this appears to be in Focus because all

355
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,500
of the points in the cone that are focused on the lens are actually

356
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,100
coming from a single point, but as you move away in either direction,

357
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,000
you get blurrier and that's where you get depth of field from right?

358
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,700
So there's one more part of this equation.

359
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Okay.

360
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,500
Which is that how wide this is is actually not only determined by the

361
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,100
lens assembly.

362
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,700
It's also determined by something called the aperture and the aperture

363
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,700
is of synthetic device that has nothing to do with the lens.

364
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,900
It's just in there and what it does is.

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
It closes to a certain size.

366
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,900
Thus clipping off part of the raised so that they can't get through,

367
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,800
right?

368
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,400
This is what you set.

369
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,000
When you set something like an F, stop on your camera, okay?

370
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,100
And as you can see, if you were to set the aperture to a wider size,

371
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,000
you will get.

372
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
So if the f-stop is wider right?

373
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,700
Which corresponds to lower values of f, stop the way that they do

374
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,500
f-stop numbers.

375
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,000
I won't go into because that's if your

376
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,300
We're not doing any of this on the street.

377
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,700
Like I said, you can do not worry about it, but I just thought I'd

378
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,000
give you some insight into how physical rendering works if you're

379
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,500
actually doing say a ray Tracer or something.

380
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,000
I actually simulate some of this in the game that I'm doing in for my

381
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,700
day job.

382
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:52,100
But anyway, so if you set this f-stop to a lower number, it means it's

383
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,600
wider.

384
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,900
So there's more it's like it's a, it might let this whole cone in,

385
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,500
right?

386
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,900
But if you set it to a narrower setting, right?

387
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,100
Then it's going to be it's going to be higher f-stop number, right?

388
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,000
So for example if you have a lens that's got an F stop of to, you

389
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,500
know, set to 2, that's going to be very wide and taking a pretty large

390
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:14,800
coat.

391
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,800
If you set your camera's, f-stop to 14, it's going to be very narrow

392
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
and what you can see, if you imagine what happens there as this gets

393
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,500
narrower and narrower, the cone collapses down to something that is

394
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,900
very close to a line.

395
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,100
What happens?

396
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,700
Less

397
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,400
Light.

398
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,600
More depth of field, right?

399
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,900
Or I should say more things in Focus, right?

400
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,700
Because as you cut that down the apparent area, like imagine if I was

401
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,500
to cut out, right?

402
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
Like let's take just this area here, right?

403
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,200
So we have that Focus Point.

404
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Here is the focus point and we've got all these lines passing through

405
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,100
it right.

406
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,400
Well, you can kind of see that if I was to allow, right?

407
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,100
If I'm to allow that whole cone through, then I'm talking about the

408
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,500
focus diverging very quickly out here, but if I was to in stay, only

409
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,800
be letting in ones that were very narrow cone.

410
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,500
You can see that.

411
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,800
I have a lot further to go before I widen out to the same amount,

412
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,400
right?

413
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,700
And so setting, that f-stop, number higher, reduces the amount of

414
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,600
light thereby.

415
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,400
Making it more difficult to capture, same nighttime imagery, but

416
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,800
giving you a wider Focus range so that you can have more

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,900
Things in focus at the same time, right?

418
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,000
So, I hope that makes some sense to you.

419
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,100
This is what's actually happening and what we're doing in the

420
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,000
simplification, which now you're going to turn your brain back on a

421
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,500
very shortly.

422
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,400
So, warm up here, get ready to turn your brain back on, it's time.

423
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,100
Okay.

424
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
So the simplification that we use when we're not trying to simulate

425
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,400
these effects.

426
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Like if we don't care about polka, if we don't care about lens

427
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,500
aberration, which is stuff that happens because this is not a perfect

428
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
comical thing.

429
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,300
If we don't care about like

430
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,700
Just to give you some.

431
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
A of crazy stuff you can do.

432
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,100
If you're doing photorealistic rendering, you can simulate light

433
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,500
bounce inside the camera.

434
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,000
So, for example, there's camera walls here as this comes in.

435
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,400
Some of the stuff will get deflected up here.

436
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,000
But then that will bounce out and deflected, like, back onto the film

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,900
back eventually.

438
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,400
So really, really bright light sources can cause light bounce, which

439
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
will wash out the image.

440
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
There's all kinds of things like this.

441
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
In fact, you may have noticed.

442
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,800
I'll give you one more thing before you turn your brain back.

443
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,300
Kahn.

444
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,800
You may have noticed that your a see the these these these Bros out

445
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,000
there at the sporting events for like ESPN and stuff.

446
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,300
And they've got a camera that is like, f an absurd.

447
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,200
It looks like something like this, you know, and like it goes all the

448
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,700
way back and the cameras like this little thing, right?

449
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,800
And it's got this huge gigantic thing on it that's like a giant

450
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,400
shotgun thing, right?

451
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,600
So then at the end of that, there's like this huge hood on it.

452
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,700
I mean, this is like what the camera looks like, right?

453
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,000
It's a giant phallus.

454
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,500
It's a giant thing, right?

455
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,400
And what you'll notice is, there's two parts of that lens assembly,

456
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,900
right?

457
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
One of it is the lens assembly.

458
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,000
That's actually, just used for getting that really long.

459
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It long range, which I won't talk about how the lens assembly works.

460
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,900
But you want a, you want a sort of a bigger lens assembly if you're

461
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,900
trying to shoot things that are far away, we'll ignore that part for

462
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,300
now.

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,900
But you'll notice there's this

464
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,100
Big hood on the front and it has nothing to do with the lens.

465
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,500
It's just a thing.

466
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,100
You like, screw onto the lens and you've seen it on cameras to even on

467
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,800
personal cameras like a dlsr, a DSLR camera, right?

468
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,000
That's, that's reasonable.

469
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,200
Something that kind of looks, you know, like this sort of a thing as

470
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,900
regular camera.

471
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,300
You see it.

472
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
You put on a thing, right?

473
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
That looks kind of like that.

474
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,900
It's like this little four-sided hat thing that goes on the camera,

475
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,500
right?

476
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,300
And you're like what you know, what is that thing?

477
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Why is that on there?

478
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:53,800
And the

479
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,100
The answer is because again, light coming into the lens, will bounce

480
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,300
around in here and it will hit the film back.

481
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,500
It would all, we'll all the photons are coming.

482
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,100
Here are going to hit something and it gives or buy something.

483
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,000
And there's a hole in here where they can pass through bounce around

484
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,500
and hit.

485
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,800
Now.

486
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,400
For light, that's pretty weak, it doesn't matter because so few

487
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,700
photons will actually get through and hit this thing that you don't

488
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,200
care.

489
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,400
But when you're shooting in, say bright sunlight, which is when they

490
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,900
tell you to put this thing on, there are so many photons entering the

491
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,800
lens that if the sun was like up here and you have a

492
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Ton of photons.

493
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,800
That would be coming in off angle.

494
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,100
They would bounce around in here and wash out your image.

495
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,000
You'd get collection on the film back.

496
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,700
So what they do is they put in a hood right here like that, right to

497
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,100
block out those errant ones and only capture light that's coming in

498
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,400
directional, from the way that the camera is facing right now.

499
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
You may ask, why is it shaped like this, right?

500
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,900
Why is it shaped in sort of this?

501
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,800
This, this way, where there's only like four,

502
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Four pieces to it.

503
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,000
Whereas this one shaped like that, right?

504
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,900
And the answer to that is a little more confusing.

505
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But it basically boils down to the shape of the sensor in the back.

506
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,000
You don't really need a spirit.

507
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,600
You don't need a cylindrical Hood because typically the actual film

508
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,000
back itself, cuts out some of the bounce because it's not the, you

509
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,500
know, the lens is circular, but the film back is rectangular, right?

510
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,900
And so you're setting up these, these sort of blockers right to to

511
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,900
block specifically where the film back is going to actually be

512
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,600
be right.

513
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,500
And so you need heavy blockers on the top and the bottom because

514
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,300
that's where it's lined up the circle, right?

515
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,400
Let me see if I can, I can't really say anything.

516
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,300
To useful here.

517
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,200
All right, so you have a circle, right?

518
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,100
And the circle looks something like this.

519
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,000
It's overlaid.

520
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,100
I'm not doing a very good idea, Java this, right?

521
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,000
I have a circle, that looks like this, right?

522
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
And then I have a welt.

523
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,700
It's probably more like this.

524
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,700
So I have a circle that looks like this, right?

525
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,900
You can see that right here.

526
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,200
Here here and here, right?

527
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,400
You actually don't have all of this extra lens stuff, right?

528
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,700
Capturing more photons, then should even be coming in where the actual

529
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,900
sensor can collect them, right?

530
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
We're not even looking at this part of the image.

531
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Technically it should never can contribute, But the lens is a circle

532
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,700
and the film back is a

533
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
So you don't need, you need blockers on the top, the sides and the

534
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,400
bottom.

535
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
But right at the corners, you don't need as much because you don't

536
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,000
have as much of the lens contributing extra photons into the image as

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,800
you do here.

538
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,700
So, the actual shape of this Hood can be, you know, notched when they

539
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,500
have to do the longer hoods because you're trying to really narrow

540
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,200
down that Barrel because you've got a really big lens vac here, thats

541
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,800
collecting a ton of light, right?

542
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,300
Then they just do a circular head.

543
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,100
I think because it would just

544
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,300
it'd be stupid to try and match this in at all, but I don't really

545
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,700
know.

546
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
I'm not sure what their rationale is for not keeping this size.

547
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,600
I think it's just turns to it tends to just be easier to deal with

548
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
like this structurally.

549
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,400
But anyway, that's our little tour into photorealism again.

550
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,500
You don't have to know a single piece of this to do handmade hero.

551
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,400
We will do absolutely none of this really, but I just thought I'd give

552
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,100
you the background so that, you know, I only learned this way and it

553
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
was really annoying because I couldn't understand like all these

554
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
techniques until I learned

555
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:31,700
Other way.

556
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,700
And so I just wanted to give you a way to think about it and it also

557
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,100
makes your camera makes sense, right?

558
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,400
You can understand how your camera Works entirely just by knowing

559
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,300
getting familiar with this diagram, right?

560
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,900
Whereas this will tell you nothing about how your camera works, you

561
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,800
have no idea how the camera works, right?

562
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,100
So anyway, back to this.

563
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,100
So we understand how this works.

564
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,000
We're all good.

565
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,500
The approximation we want to use is one where we don't have any Focus

566
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,100
effects.

567
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,900
We're just going to pretend that everything's in Focus all the time.

568
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,800
So wherever something is we just trace it.

569
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Back to a single pin hole Point basically.

570
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,900
And if you want to think of this as a camera instead of thinking of

571
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,700
this, as a monitor out here that we're figuring out where the points

572
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,700
are, you could almost think of the film back as being back here and

573
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,900
we're just figuring out where things on the film back actually.

574
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,700
Are the reason why it's a little bit weird to do that is because

575
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,400
obviously you can see what happens to the light here, is it flips

576
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,000
around when it gets back here.

577
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,300
So you actually produce a negative image on a camera.

578
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,300
And by the way, that's actually what happens cameras flip, the images

579
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,800
that they have or you might think of the film is being loaded up side.

580
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,900
Down and reversed or whatever, right?

581
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,800
A mirrored film.

582
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,300
If you will, that is actually what happens.

583
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,400
I guess, mirror?

584
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,300
It is the wrong term.

585
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,200
Just flip just completely flipped, right?

586
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,500
However, you want to however you want to do that.

587
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,900
I trapped use the word mirror because it, I don't know, it's hard to

588
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
explain, it's hard.

589
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,100
That means like negating one access which is not necessarily what I'm

590
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,500
trying to say.

591
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,200
I'm trying to say that.

592
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,000
It it totally inverts itself on both axes, right?

593
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,800
It negatives and negatives, right?

594
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:00,800
Okay.

595
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Ignore that.

596
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,900
Ignore that again down, important.

597
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,400
So what we want to do, right?

598
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Is we want to figure out how we can compute say where this thing

599
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,700
should be on the monitor or if we want to do film back where it is on

600
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,900
the film back, they're actually both the same equation for the most

601
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,200
part, so we should figure out how to do it.

602
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,200
How do we do that?

603
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,800
Well, this turns out to be a very easy diagram to construct and solve,

604
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,200
right.

605
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,300
It's very, very simple.

606
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,300
If we are back here and we'll say that this is our I, right?

607
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,800
So that's RI point, maybe

608
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,600
we will call that e, right?

609
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,200
And then out here, we know we've got some image plane that we're going

610
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,500
to intersect with and we'll use the forward method because again, I

611
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,400
think this is how it's normally discussed and can see G books.

612
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,100
So curious, you know, our monitor, right?

613
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,400
And so, what we'll do is, we'll just call this distance here, right

614
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,300
the distance from the eye to the monitor.

615
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,200
We'll just call that D for now, write the distance between those two.

616
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And then we have out here, we actually have the point that we want to

617
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,500
project.

618
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,700
And so we're looking for, right?

619
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,500
Like this.

620
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,300
We're looking for

621
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,500
This point right here, P Prime.

622
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,200
Okay.

623
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,900
And now, as you can see, this is essentially a diagram that works no

624
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,800
matter in one axis at a time.

625
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,500
So we don't actually care which Acts were solving.

626
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,100
We could just, you know, say We'll solve for x or something, whichever

627
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,200
one we want to do, we're going to solve the same equation for every

628
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,000
axis X and Y, right?

629
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,000
So what do we actually need?

630
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,700
Well, we need to know how far this p is from E, right?

631
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,600
And that's pretty easy to figure out, right?

632
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,200
There's not much we would need to do there.

633
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
We know that we have, for example, a measurement, axis, here.

634
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,600
We know that we have, you know, whatever this axis we want to be.

635
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,500
Is and right now we're we've already said it Z, right?

636
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,400
We're looking right down the z-axis, although I guess Z is coming up.

637
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,400
So technically, Z goes this way, right?

638
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,700
But we know we've already sort of talk

639
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,700
About the fact that Z in our world goes up and goes up out of the

640
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,200
screen.

641
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,100
So we already know that this is the Z axis.

642
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,700
So really this distance here.

643
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,500
Right?

644
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,700
Is just whatever the Z coordinate is of this guy, right?

645
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,900
It's the cameras, z- his Z, right?

646
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
Because the cameras, he's going to be higher, right?

647
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,100
The eyes, I should say that.

648
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,300
I see, you know what, maybe I should call this C for camera cameras.

649
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Easy peasy, right?

650
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,100
So, this distance here is camera, z- peasy, right?

651
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,300
And what you can see, if we construct this here, is we've actually got

652
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:29,900
similar

653
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Angles here, right?

654
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,100
These are the same triangle but for the size right here is a right

655
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,400
triangle with the same angle here and the same angle here.

656
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
And here is another right.

657
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,500
Triangle with the same angle here, same angle here and what we know

658
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,000
from.

659
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,800
If you remember way back in your high school geometry or trig classes,

660
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,300
I don't even know.

661
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,700
I think it's probably geometry classes.

662
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If we want, we can always construct a ratio of any sides of similar

663
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,100
triangles, right?

664
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,100
So if we know that this side of this triangle here is D and the side

665
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,200
of the bigger triangle is cz- peasy, right?

666
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,400
Then we know we have a ratio that that would map the other points.

667
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,500
We need P Prime and P, right?

668
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Because we know that P Prime to P is going to be the same as that.

669
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,300
Devalue is to the

670
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,600
Z- p z, right?

671
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,700
That's, that's what we know about these triangles.

672
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,500
So, if we multiply out this ratio, right?

673
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,700
If we just solve this ratio, we would get P times d, right?

674
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,900
Are actually do it Vector style there D times P, right?

675
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,400
So, we have D times P, just cross-multiply equaling again.

676
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,900
Cross multiply here, c, z- p, pz p Prime.

677
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,100
Right.

678
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,300
And what you see here is, if P Prime is the thing we want to

679
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,000
No, then we just have to divide by this to get it, right?

680
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,900
So we'd have DP / c, z- p, z equals P Prime.

681
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,200
And that is the perspective projection equation in a nutshell, right

682
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,400
there?

683
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
That's all there is to it.

684
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,200
And what you can see right here, and you can understand, hopefully now

685
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,500
why we were doing it wrong.

686
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,800
If you remember when we just threw in that fudge value and I said, I

687
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
want to talk about it later.

688
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,900
It's because I wanted to show you all that stuff on the Whiteboard.

689
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,000
I didn't want to just throw in a correct solution and everyone be

690
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
like, what are we talking about?

691
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,100
if I actually go in here and

692
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,700
Let's see.

693
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,400
That was in get render entity basis.

694
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,800
You can see that we computed as e, fudge value here and we can

695
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,700
computed this easy.

696
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,300
Fudge value based on the Z coordinate so it seems like it's kind of

697
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,600
okay.

698
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,500
But then what did we do?

699
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,800
We multiply by it.

700
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,600
Right?

701
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:49,400
And as you can see, the equation for perspective, projection is not a

702
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,300
multiplication.

703
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,100
It's a division and that is why we're not having realistic Motion in

704
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,500
our Z.

705
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,100
Remember, take

706
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,000
A look at this, right?

707
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You can see how that works.

708
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,900
It's like some kind of weird Stargate.

709
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,700
Right?

710
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,300
Which would be nice if what we were constructing was a Stargate and be

711
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,700
sure to remember that effect should you ever want to construct the

712
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,400
Stargate?

713
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,200
But if we actually want our game to look like it has some 3D

714
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,700
perspective going on it, that is not the way to do it.

715
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,600
So let's think about how we would actually do this, right?

716
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,800
We want to implement this equation right here.

717
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,900
Now, what do we know?

718
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,800
Well P Prime is the thing that we want to solve for, right?

719
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,700
And so again this equation Works in both X and Y.

720
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,800
So, you know, you can imagine PX D PX, right?

721
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,100
Right.

722
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,700
Or equivalently the exact same equation.

723
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,800
Works in y right?

724
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,300
Like so, so both equations exactly the same to solve for each of our

725
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,500
variables, right?

726
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,500
So, what do we want to do here, right?

727
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,100
We want to solve for p Prime.

728
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,800
Well, that's our excuse me, that's our result P, right?

729
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,200
That's the thing that we're trying to solve for, okay?

730
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,100
And I guess right here, it's entity.

731
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,200
Ground point is actually the thing that we're projecting.

732
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,500
And so, in fact, what is this even week?

733
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,700
We decided to stop doing this thing?

734
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,100
Well, I don't know, that's just the way it is.

735
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,699
So anything.

736
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,500
Ground point is the thing that we're projecting.

737
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,199
And you can see right here that this is the part where we

738
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,800
A projection.

739
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,400
We take the entity based e XY and we add the entity base offset X Y,

740
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,600
to essentially produce sort of the unprojected version of the point,

741
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,000
right?

742
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,199
So this is kind of like the raw X Y that we did here, right?

743
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,300
That's our row XY.

744
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,699
But then we just we multiplied it by this by this value.

745
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,699
Okay, now the problem with doing that multiplications, what we

746
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,100
actually want to do is a division.

747
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,100
And so this this right here this dpy we know what the pi the in the

748
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,900
pxr

749
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,699
That's our raw Y and X.

750
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,000
Right?

751
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
That's what this is.

752
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,699
In fact, I could, I could even call them that if you wanted, although

753
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,100
I guess row.

754
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,800
XY is fine for now.

755
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,900
That's our raw X and Y.

756
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,900
And what we want to do is we want to actually compute this equation.

757
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,400
So we need a d value here.

758
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,900
So instead of being Z fudge, which is actually based on the Z

759
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,700
distance, what we actually need here is whatever that distance is

760
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,700
essentially the, the focal length, right?

761
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,300
We need, we need to know.

762
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,800
Oops, we need to know D, right?

763
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,300
And remember, what D is, is this the length from the, it's a distance

764
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,700
from the camera to the monitor, right?

765
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,300
And so, that's what we need to know.

766
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
They're okay.

767
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,800
Again, in this has to be

768
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,700
In the actual space that we care about.

769
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,300
So one thing that's interesting here to is, I guess now that I think

770
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,000
about it.

771
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,600
How is this working?

772
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,300
Exactly.

773
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,400
We did m.

774
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,700
2 pixels first, I don't know if we really want to do that.

775
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,400
We probably want to do all of this in meters actually first, right?

776
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,300
And so if you take a look at what's Happening Here, what we want to do

777
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,000
is we want to start getting rid of this stuff.

778
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,800
I think we want to save it.

779
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,900
Till the end here.

780
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,900
So it's something more like that if that makes sense this sort of

781
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,900
thing, right?

782
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,600
So that we're actually doing that that m 2 pixels at the end so we can

783
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,100
do everything else in meters.

784
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,800
So here we go.

785
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,600
Let's go ahead and say we've got distance from camera to monitor,

786
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,000
write something like that or just distance to monitor, that sort of

787
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,300
thing.

788
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,200
And, you know, how far is the monitor way in reality, is probably a

789
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,800
totally fine thing to use.

790
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,500
I feel like it's probably what.

791
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,600
I don't know maybe about a third of a meter or something like that.

792
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,800
I'm not sure how far I am away.

793
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,100
I need to look a ruler here or something like that, but let's say

794
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,300
we've got that far to the monitor, right?

795
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,000
And then in our world,

796
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,600
We then need to know that sort of that Z distance and in order to

797
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,200
compute the Z distance, we know that the Z distance is how far away we

798
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,100
are, right this this entity based P.

799
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,000
So we need our distance to P or I should say, maybe Z distance to

800
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,400
monitor something like that.

801
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,100
I need to know the distance to the point in Z, right?

802
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,500
I need this c, z- p, z thing.

803
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,600
And in order to do that, well we know what the points Z is right.

804
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,900
But we only know it relative to the place we're looking at, right?

805
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,600
Because remember, we did all this centered around a camera location.

806
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,200
We're looking at which is not actually where the camera is.

807
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,000
So if you imagine here is sort of a, maybe I'll do it this way, if you

808
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,300
imagine Kira's the world we were talking about looking at this point,

809
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:37,800
but that

810
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,800
He's the cameras actually somewhere up here pointing down at it,

811
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,300
right?

812
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,000
So we also have another value, which is essentially how far away is

813
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,100
the camera from what it's looking at, right?

814
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,200
And so, we have another one, which is basically like distance above

815
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,200
ground or camera distance above ground, right?

816
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,500
And so, who knows how far the camera is above ground.

817
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,800
That is something we can tune to taste, but maybe it's, you know, I

818
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,400
don't know how big we want it to be.

819
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,100
It's, you know, 10 meters above the ground for now and we can

820
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,800
basically play with these

821
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,300
Has values.

822
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,700
These are purely arbitrary values.

823
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,400
Obviously for framing the shot and setting the, the lens type, right?

824
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,500
They don't matter at all, we can pick them to you, whatever.

825
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,900
Whatever looks good we know, we will still get something that behaves

826
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:25,900
similar to a camera and so that distance 2pz right is going to be

827
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,700
whatever the entity based based peas Z was right.

828
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,700
And remember, that's going to be

829
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,300
If that number is positive, right?

830
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,200
It's actually going to be closer to us because he comes up words, and

831
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,500
if it's negative, it's going away.

832
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,100
So we actually want to subtract the Z value from the distance to

833
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,700
monitor because as it gets - gets, I'm sorry from the camera distance

834
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,300
above ground because it actually, as it gets - it's getting further

835
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,400
away from us, right?

836
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,900
So we want to make this value.

837
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,600
Get larger.

838
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,400
That time.

839
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,900
So then we get our distance to PC.

840
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,500
We now have essentially everything that we need right to compute that

841
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,200
the equation.

842
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay?

843
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
So let's go ahead and compute the equation.

844
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
Go back and scroll to it.

845
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,900
There it is.

846
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,800
So we want dpy, right?

847
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,500
And so we know what the p y p.

848
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,100
The p x py is, right?

849
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,500
We know that those are entity based the sorry.

850
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
We know that there they are.

851
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,500
Right there.

852
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,500
We know that they are raw X Y.

853
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,100
That's the, that's the actual value.

854
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,600
So we want our distance to the monitor.

855
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,400
Times that right?

856
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,700
And then we want to divide that by that sort of denominator and I'm

857
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,300
going to I'm going to call it denominator and that that will compute

858
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,600
our result, right?

859
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,500
So this is our new, what should I call this?

860
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,600
I guess we'll call this projected XY.

861
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,800
All right so there's projected X Y so I don't want to just do the

862
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,800
divided by the denominator because what we have to do here first is

863
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,200
verify that that denominator will actually be

864
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,000
Positive right we do or I shouldn't even say positive.

865
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,800
We want to make sure that it's not going to be a divide by zero,

866
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,000
right?

867
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,100
So we have to pick some cut off there so that when things get super

868
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,900
close to the camera, we will no longer draw them.

869
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,000
Otherwise, they would potentially be directly on the camera or

870
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,200
something.

871
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,700
That'd be like if you passed through the lens of the camera and got

872
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,200
back into the camera itself or something like that, right?

873
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
So what we need to do is compute that denominator.

874
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,800
The denominator again is the cameras, easy right?

875
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,400
-

876
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,000
The point Z and so that's what we've already computed here, right?

877
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,100
That distance 2pz total right.

878
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,800
That's the total distance up to it, so we've got that, right?

879
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,300
So all we need to do with our denominator is check to see whether

880
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,900
that's going to be, you know, big enough that we consider it far

881
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,000
enough away and that's that's what we normally call the near clipping

882
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,600
plane, right.

883
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,500
And if you've ever heard near clipping plane before, but the near clip

884
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
playing right is the thing that says?

885
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,200
Well, you know, if I take a look

886
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,900
Kathy's the similar triangles, right.

887
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,700
In fact, I'll just go up here to this, right?

888
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,800
At some point when something moves far enough back here that it would

889
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,200
actually be, you know, behind me, obviously, I don't want to render

890
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,300
it.

891
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,500
So that would be, you know, an ear clip playing of 0.

892
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,500
But if it was right on zero, I would have a divide by zero, so that's

893
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,000
not good either.

894
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,700
So I pick some arbitrary point out here just sort of say we're only,

895
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,500
we're only well-conditioned past this value, let's say 0.2 or

896
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,000
something.

897
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,000
So we're only going to consider things that are

898
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,400
At least that far away.

899
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,600
So we want to make sure that the distance to p z is greater than

900
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,300
whatever that in your clip plane is and then we can do our projected

901
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:46,800
XY.

902
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,500
Right?

903
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,600
Like so and what we'll do there is will just say well okay you know

904
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,800
we'll set the the kind of think of

905
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,200
What?

906
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,500
We just shouldn't draw the thing here.

907
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,900
So I think we probably need to say that.

908
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,800
It's clipped, like we're going to have to return something here.

909
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,300
That basically says don't draw this, right?

910
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,100
We need to do like, something like that if that makes sense.

911
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,600
And so, you know, we want to do something like like this, right?

912
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,700
I'll say, well, you know what I can do, I can just say it's nothing,

913
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,300
so there we go.

914
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,600
And so result, dot valid equals true, there we go.

915
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,300
And let's take a look here.

916
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,400
Oh yeah I'll just do.

917
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,100
We don't actually support a divide the moment.

918
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,700
So I'll do one over that.

919
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:40,700
There we go.

920
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,000
So our focal length, though.

921
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,400
I named it the wrong thing.

922
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
So there we go.

923
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,800
Sorry about that.

924
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,800
Got a little overzealous the naming.

925
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,000
So, there we go.

926
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,000
Focal length.

927
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Comes in both places that correct.

928
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
That doesn't look right.

929
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,500
I think I while I was busy talking, I think I made a mistake there.

930
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,800
D should only show up once.

931
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,600
Right.

932
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,700
So what did we get here?

933
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,000
We got one over the distance times.

934
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,600
The focal length times the rod.

935
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,100
That's correct.

936
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,400
So, why was the focal length used before or used again focal?

937
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,100
Length x 0 because I started to type it in here.

938
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,300
Yeah, I don't know why I did that.

939
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,000
That was just me being being my typos self.

940
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,300
So there's our projected XY, we've got it and so we can go ahead.

941
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,900
And also, you know, I

942
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,300
We can do it that way.

943
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,200
It's a little cleaner.

944
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,000
I think that's basically all we need this scale value.

945
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,500
I guess would just be if we were going to say so that was actually to

946
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,900
project other points.

947
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,700
So if we were going to take something that was one unit long and

948
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,300
projected, that's what we would want to return return for a scale,

949
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:05,500
right?

950
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,100
Because we want to say how things are scaling with C.

951
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,400
So if we want to say how things are scaling with Z, I guess what we

952
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,600
would probably want to return.

953
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,900
I got to think about whether that's correct.

954
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,900
Normally what we do is we project all four points but I guess what we

955
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,000
can do instead of just project the unit distance

956
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,000
That's right.

957
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,900
Take one right?

958
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,200
And say, well, if we were going to project one at this same distance,

959
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,100
what would it?

960
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,200
Give us, right.

961
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,700
And so what I can do is say, well, let's do a three, let's do three

962
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:44,600
projections, make raw XY actually be sort of raw XYZ and actually do

963
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,300
it this way, right, pass in a 1 value there.

964
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,900
So now I see how one will scale, and that's the scale value.

965
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,800
You are projected X, Y actually has like a secret Z component.

966
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,100
That tells us how it scales, right?

967
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,900
And then to actually do this, obviously, I don't

968
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,300
That Z value in there when it's actually been used.

969
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,800
Okay, so now we assuredly have some things we've got to fix, but of

970
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,100
course, actually already, even though we're kind of super janky here,

971
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,800
you can actually see that the scaling, at least now does actually work

972
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,500
more correctly, but that's sort of a separate that sort of separate

973
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:21,700
issue.

974
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,800
So, first off, let me

975
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Let me just set these values a little bit more here.

976
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,700
Looks like we're off center a little.

977
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,700
I don't understand why that would be but let me see.

978
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,500
It looks like we're just not centered but our transform is looking

979
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,200
actually correct but it just doesn't look like we're we're centered

980
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:42,600
quite yet.

981
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:42,900
Alright.

982
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,300
So let's double-check everything here because everything should be

983
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,600
based around the screen center which it is and because all of the

984
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,900
values that come in are just based around the screen center.

985
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,700
And so, when we're adding these

986
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Heather, right.

987
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,500
Best just in fact, I'm going to go ahead and just take this out here.

988
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:05,200
You know, that was for our y displacement, I guess was where that was

989
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,800
happening.

990
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,800
So I don't know if we want to keep doing that wise to a could put this

991
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
in here for now to simplify things out a little bit.

992
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,200
Okay.

993
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,300
So we have our distance values.

994
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,300
We have our focal length.

995
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,500
We have our raw X Y.

996
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:22,100
We have our entity based peas and the offsets to those base peas, and

997
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
that all kind of looks

998
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,100
He's roughly correct to me.

999
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:32,500
I'm not sure why we seem to be scaling out of the wrong place because

1000
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,300
I feel like all these values should have been properly centered around

1001
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,200
the X and Y.

1002
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,700
So, I'm not sure why we're getting.

1003
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,200
You can see that we're kind of everything seems to actually be down

1004
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,100
from where the camera is, and I don't understand why that is right?

1005
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,700
Everything seems to be offset massively before the actual scale.

1006
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,400
Only takes place before we do this, right?

1007
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:03,200
It's as if everything is very sort of shifted and I'm not sure exactly

1008
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,900
why that is might be something.

1009
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,200
I'm forgetting about how we're passing in our values.

1010
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,200
But anyway,

1011
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,800
It looks like everything else about it is correct though.

1012
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,700
So taking a look at this.

1013
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,000
I want to kind of know if the entity based peas here.

1014
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,600
These should all be centered around zero correct.

1015
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,300
So let me see.

1016
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,400
I want to make sure that that is actually true.

1017
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,500
So when we push a bitmap on here, right?

1018
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,700
M 2 pixels - so that's our problem, right?

1019
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,400
We haven't quite gotten it down to the point where things are all

1020
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,300
actually happening in.

1021
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:54,500
M, right are offset is still happening in pixels here and that bitmap

1022
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,500
alignment.

1023
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,300
Hmm.

1024
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,800
Mmm.

1025
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:08,200
Well, you know, that's not a problem per se, I just don't know if I

1026
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,100
want to leave that hanging around, right?

1027
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,300
I just don't know if I like that.

1028
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,000
It seems to me, you know, like I just wonder if that's just going to

1029
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,600
keep causing problems because everything should maybe be done in m, 2

1030
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,100
pixels, should maybe be done later on in the pipeline, right?

1031
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,000
So what the reason not to do that, it would force us to store the

1032
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,200
alignment until later and that doesn't sound fabulous.

1033
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,800
So taking it into meters fixed actually does seem like the right idea.

1034
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,900
The problem is all the rest of this stuff then has to be done in

1035
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,500
pixels, right?

1036
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,900
Which is actually fine.

1037
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,900
It's just kind of crazy, right?

1038
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,700
But okay so if you think about it, if the offset comes in as pixels,

1039
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,300
right?

1040
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:10,000
Then you know, now that would translate this into a pixel value,

1041
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,900
right?

1042
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:19,500
And in theory, I guess since the focal length and the distance 2pz are

1043
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,800
essentially going to divide out, I suppose it would still work even

1044
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,700
just having them not be, you know, being an ear in meters per pixel.

1045
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,800
So I guess technically, we could leave it that way.

1046
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,600
I'm just not sure that's such a good idea but we can actually do that.

1047
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,900
Now if that was the case and we were actually doing m 2 pixels, then

1048
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,900
we need that the camera distance above ground again to also be in

1049
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,500
meters to pixels as well.

1050
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,400
Hmm.

1051
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,100
Which is kind of crazy but let's make sure this is also camera

1052
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,400
distance Above Ground - entity base peasy.

1053
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,500
I lied, it's actually this quantity has to be and you can see this is

1054
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,900
kind of messy and I don't love it, but you can kind of see already in

1055
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,300
there.

1056
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,600
We're starting to get it back to the right centering.

1057
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,500
So yeah, okay.

1058
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,900
So m 2 pixels.

1059
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,000
This is, this is super chunky.

1060
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,300
I

1061
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,300
It's one of those things where I feel like it's so much nicer to

1062
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,800
write, it just doing everything in meters and saving the bitmap allow

1063
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,800
you to the end, but the same time, if we're going to try to go for

1064
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,000
efficiency in the render, you probably want to smack all that stuff

1065
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,600
down to begin with.

1066
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,900
So I guess we should just keep going this way and then we'll try to

1067
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,500
condense everything down into something that properly that that just

1068
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,800
makes it.

1069
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,400
So it's not too big of a deal that that's happening, right?

1070
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,800
all right, so

1071
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,800
I guess we would also need this focal length to be in meters to

1072
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,500
pixels.

1073
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,400
It's kind of crazy.

1074
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,400
And yeah, and then I think we're getting there.

1075
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,900
We are starting to get there.

1076
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,000
I want to move the camera back a bit here.

1077
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,600
So now you can sort of start to see that stuff is actually moving

1078
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,500
properly though.

1079
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,800
Like, for example, you can kind of see that.

1080
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,200
As I move around here, the things in the background, sort of look like

1081
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,800
they're more obeying, a proper perspective rule.

1082
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,800
So we're very close.

1083
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,600
Now, we just have to go through the math one more time.

1084
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,600
Now that we actually have to deal with the the M fix this thing and

1085
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,100
make sure that we have everything actually correct.

1086
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,200
I'm also going to restart here because I don't remember what we went

1087
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,600
down or up in terms of groups in terms of things here.

1088
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,600
So there's the actual starting setup of it and I feel like we also

1089
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,300
have a there's some kind of a weird

1090
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,800
Here with them with the stairwell.

1091
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,400
Wow.

1092
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,400
So you can see how much radek that scaling is.

1093
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,100
There we go.

1094
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,700
Alright, so let's go ahead.

1095
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,800
I want to see what happens.

1096
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,200
Also, I just want to see what happens if I change this value.

1097
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,900
Just playing around with it here.

1098
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,100
Yeah, so so we just have a we just have a few more scale, things to

1099
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:25,900
work out.

1100
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,200
We basically we're basically got everything essentially correct.

1101
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,800
We just got to go through and rework things out to make sure I'm your

1102
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,100
toaster pixels or right.

1103
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,200
But we're pretty much good to go now.

1104
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,400
So I think we're going to be fine.

1105
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,700
Like so yeah, are rectangles are currently the wrong size though?

1106
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,100
I believe, because I think we need to actually make sure that we

1107
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,200
properly handle their sizes.

1108
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,800
I don't know that we're probably handling the size of them back in

1109
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,700
the, in the the call that we were in the wreck.

1110
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,600
Drawing call.

1111
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,300
But yeah.

1112
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,200
All right.

1113
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,600
So let's work through this math.

1114
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,600
One more time now, knowing that we have M to pixels to contend with.

1115
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,100
So what's basically happening is this stuff is getting smacked down

1116
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:16,800
into m 2 pixels when we actually make the push bitmap call, right?

1117
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,800
So I got the push bitmap call.

1118
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,600
We now Know The Enemy base is offset is in meters to pixels, right?

1119
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,800
I should say isn't pixels.

1120
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:34,500
So what that means is that when we call entity, when we take any basis

1121
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,800
P, it's not in m 2 pixels.

1122
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,500
So I guess I'm just going to say the first thing.

1123
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,100
We'll do.

1124
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,300
Let's change entity basis.

1125
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,700
Basis P2 m, 2 pixels so that it's in m, 2 pixels.

1126
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,300
We want the focal length in meters to pixels.

1127
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,300
We want the camera to sits above ground and M are going to pixels.

1128
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,900
Everything's going to be in pixels and so then we do this computation.

1129
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,700
Now this computation is just done in pixels and that's fine.

1130
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,100
The New York

1131
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,900
Kipling is also in pixels, and that's

1132
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,300
Fine.

1133
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,300
Get rid of the Z, fudge value because that's gone now, right?

1134
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,300
And, and then when we actually do this, any base, BX y, this offset X

1135
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,300
Y is already in.

1136
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,400
Pixels is the reason we had to do all this.

1137
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,000
So we can actually do this math properly.

1138
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,000
We then do our divide out with our raw x y, and our screen center.

1139
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,100
All that goodness.

1140
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,900
And I think that's about, right, I'm going to change this back to the

1141
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,100
value.

1142
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,300
We originally had it at all.

1143
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:27,600
So so did I stop the game running?

1144
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,900
I did stop the game from running and

1145
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,500
So I think that's mostly all we need to do to make sure our scale is

1146
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,200
correct.

1147
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,800
And then we want to do is for how far above everything the camera

1148
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,700
should be, which is again, kind of a, an arbitrary value.

1149
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,700
I don't know what this should actually be able to think about what

1150
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,800
that actually is.

1151
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,300
Obviously, if we were to pull it down cameras, above ground, I wonder

1152
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:53,600
what happens if we just set that to zero, that's interesting.

1153
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:58,300
Kind of I'm interested to know what is happening here.

1154
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:13,500
It seems like we're getting a lot more elongation then we should have,

1155
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,500
right.

1156
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,100
So I feel like there's still something.

1157
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,300
Something odd going on there, right?

1158
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,200
And I don't know exactly what it is because I feel like this is

1159
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,100
correct.

1160
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:36,000
The focal length should not really be too far off from that.

1161
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,600
I would think, right?

1162
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,400
I wonder if this is a non-linearity problem as well.

1163
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,300
I'll see wife all that stuff's in pixels.

1164
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,500
It should still just work.

1165
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,500
I feel like this is should be scale-invariant right after.

1166
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Think about that little bit more.

1167
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,500
The camera distance above ground 0.5.

1168
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,500
So, really, this should be able to be higher though, right?

1169
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,300
I mean, the camera, should be able to be a few meters, above the

1170
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,500
ground, and still work properly.

1171
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,000
So, that's a bit odd, right?

1172
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,400
So, I want to leave that at that, and figure out what exactly is going

1173
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,000
wrong because we've still got something a little bit weird, should not

1174
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,800
be that small is I guess the way I would look at it, although the fact

1175
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:25,800
that

1176
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,400
Pixels is kind of weird.

1177
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,700
It's kind of weird.

1178
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,700
I feel like maybe there is a hidden scale thing that happens there,

1179
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,300
but I don't know.

1180
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,200
So anyway, the raw x y and a debased pxy were sent right?

1181
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,900
And this is correct, right?

1182
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,600
We've got the inverse of the distance, 2pz camera, distance above

1183
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:55,200
ground and then as the Z values get more - it gets further away which

1184
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,800
is exactly what we expect to see and the distance to it.

1185
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Always going to be roughly that which is what we expect.

1186
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,100
So yeah.

1187
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:11,700
I don't see I don't see what the problem is there and it really does

1188
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,600
seem like the focal length wants to be set a lot higher but I just

1189
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,400
don't understand why that would be right.

1190
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,000
Like if we were to set this focal length higher, then everything looks

1191
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,400
fine, right?

1192
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,800
You know, the game looks as we intended,

1193
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,800
It with it, with a, you know, the other focal length but I'm not sure.

1194
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,300
I know.

1195
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,400
Not sure.

1196
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:44,900
I know why.

1197
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,700
That would be

1198
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:52,400
Normally, there's a step where you turn, you know, World units into

1199
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,700
pixels and of course we've already are doing it in pixels.

1200
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,700
So maybe I'm just maybe the focal length actually gets multiplied in

1201
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,100
there in some way that I don't understand.

1202
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,800
So I'm going to have to actually see about that.

1203
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,400
Certainly

1204
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,900
But you can basically see that by changing these two values, we can

1205
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,300
get the effect we want.

1206
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,200
So there's actually nothing practically wrong at the moment, with the

1207
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,600
math.

1208
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Like it it works fine in terms of getting the effect that we want, and

1209
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,700
the effect is correct, you can see that.

1210
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:29,800
Now, it actually works properly right to give us the Parallax that we

1211
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,000
wanted and we can use those two values to control.

1212
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,800
Just how much of that we want.

1213
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,200
But the thing is, I just don't think that's what the

1214
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Should be right.

1215
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,700
And so I feel like what's happening is the fact that we're not doing

1216
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:50,600
it in meters actually, introduces some kind of a nonlinear effect,

1217
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,200
with the pixel values, that is why I have to make those values larger.

1218
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,200
And so I have to think about, I want to know why that is it data, but

1219
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,100
that's going to bother me.

1220
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,400
So I suspect that we will probably even though technically we've done

1221
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,600
what we need to do.

1222
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,400
I feel like I really want to go find out why that is right.

1223
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,500
But yeah, so everything seems to be working properly now and we can

1224
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,000
get exactly the effect that we wanted.

1225
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,300
It's just that I'm just not comfortable with how that worked out is,

1226
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,300
all right?

1227
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,700
Jump jump.

1228
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,500
I can actually jump up into the sky.

1229
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:35,500
Yeah.

1230
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:42,100
So anyway I think that's probably all I want to do right now because I

1231
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,500
don't know that I want to go.

1232
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,600
I want people to be able to ask questions that are not necessarily

1233
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,500
related to that.

1234
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:55,700
So I guess I'll just say here to do these the values of 20 and 20

1235
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,900
seemed wrong.

1236
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,900
Did I mess something up here?

1237
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,600
And you know, let me real quick.

1238
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,000
Before we start the Q&A, let me just do the math.

1239
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,200
One more time to make sure that I actually didn't screw it up because,

1240
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,200
you know, like I said, I haven't actually I guess made a kill his

1241
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,500
master on the stream yet, which is unusual.

1242
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,800
This could be the first one, right?

1243
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,500
It could be that I just did it totally wrong or something, right?

1244
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,100
Which would not be unlike me that's what normally happens in my real

1245
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:28,600
life.

1246
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,700
Like it actually looks like I'm better at math on the stream than I

1247
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:35,200
actually am because probably because I'm covering things that are

1248
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,100
maybe that I you know know pretty well when I'm actually working out

1249
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,800
new Mass stuff, it's atrocious.

1250
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,300
Like I just it's a disaster Zone all the time, you know.

1251
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:53,300
So anyway let's say this is the the monitor so cure is, you know that

1252
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,200
I point

1253
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,400
And here is p Prime.

1254
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,300
I'm sorry, here is p, here is p Prime.

1255
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,100
And so, we'll call this x.

1256
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:13,300
We will call this distance D again, and we will call this this long

1257
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,000
distance.

1258
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,300
We will call that

1259
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,700
Oh, I did do it wrong.

1260
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,800
I totally did do it wrong, I drew the diagram wrong, if this is the

1261
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,100
camera point, right?

1262
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,000
Then this is just that's yeah, I mean, I guess I shouldn't say, I did

1263
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,400
it wrong, but you didn't quite do it.

1264
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,400
As I probably should have, right?

1265
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,900
If this is the Z distance from we could just say this is the distance

1266
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,800
from the camera right to here.

1267
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,900
Yeah, it's going to come out to the same thing, so, never mind.

1268
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:00,900
I guess I didn't do it wrong.

1269
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,200
Well, I'm going to keep going anyway.

1270
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,400
But anyway, if this is the, the Z coordinate, that is the total

1271
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,800
distance, right?

1272
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,400
Then I know that my ratio is just going to be PX 2.

1273
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,300
Pz is equal to PX Prime 2D, right?

1274
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,800
So multiplying that out its p zp x Prime.

1275
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:25,200
Equals PX d, right?

1276
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:32,100
And so solving for this, I want pxd over peasy.

1277
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,300
Right?

1278
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:41,000
If that seems Seems like it to me, right?

1279
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:50,200
And so, yeah, so basically like that's what we're talking about here.

1280
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,600
That's the entirety of solving that equation.

1281
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,800
You don't see anything else going on there, really?

1282
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,500
Yeah.

1283
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,600
So, yeah, and if I take a look at what we're actually doing here,

1284
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,400
right?

1285
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,800
You've got 1 over distance 2pz which is what that is X focal length,

1286
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,300
kind of relaxed.

1287
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,800
So that's exactly right.

1288
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,900
The distance to the pz is just, how are afar the cameras above the

1289
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,700
ground level?

1290
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,000
Or I should say Target perhaps is a better word.

1291
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:29,600
Right.

1292
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:36,400
- whatever that that base is z value is, right?

1293
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,600
And that seems like that's correct because our Z value is going this

1294
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:40,900
way.

1295
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,500
So we want that to get more negative so that that I don't know.

1296
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,400
That really just seems right.

1297
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,000
Yeah.

1298
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:00,800
All right.

1299
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,200
Let's go to Q&A.

1300
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,800
Let's see here.

1301
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:15,900
Work.

1302
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah.

1303
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,800
Let's go to the Q&A.

1304
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,400
Oops.

1305
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,600
Is squinting analogous to closing a camera's aperture.

1306
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,800
So I don't think so.

1307
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:14,900
I think squinting is probably more similar to changing the focus and

1308
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:21,500
putting on one of those Hood things changing cameras aperture is more

1309
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,800
like your iris Contracting.

1310
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,200
Like when you go out in the sun and your iris contracts that's like

1311
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,800
the aperture I'm sorry that you're Irish your pupil you know the

1312
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,000
little black dot it contracts.

1313
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,300
That's that's like what that's doing?

1314
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,600
That's that's Contracting.

1315
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,100
The

1316
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:37,900
Chart right.

1317
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:47,000
Are you intending to multiply by x y z and not just the X Y as the

1318
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
variable says yes.

1319
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,100
So the reason we want to do all three is because we want to know what

1320
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,200
one would project to as well so that we can use it as our scale value,

1321
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,200
right?

1322
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,200
So that's why I do the Z as well.

1323
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,200
Just doing the exact same equation on all three variables.

1324
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,600
So we're just getting all three at once.

1325
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,100
That's all

1326
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,500
Wasn't the room height 8 meters.

1327
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,300
Really.

1328
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,800
Did we set the room height to be eight meters?

1329
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,400
If that's the case, that's just totally stupid and that maybe it you

1330
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,900
you may have mailed it.

1331
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:31,600
Let me see here.

1332
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,600
Typical room.

1333
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,900
Typical floor height.

1334
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,000
No.

1335
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,600
The floor height looks like it's about, right, right.

1336
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,300
Because that's about a 10-foot floor which is about right.

1337
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,900
Expect a ton of pre stream questions.

1338
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,100
Oh, what happened?

1339
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,500
Where we on the front page or something.

1340
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,700
Wasn't the parameter already converted to pixels if so then I think

1341
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,900
you are converting to meet converting meals for just twice.

1342
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:19,300
I don't think so, because so entity based P has not been converted to

1343
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,700
pixels, right?

1344
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,600
So that's at any base.

1345
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,900
B needs to be converted to pixels.

1346
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,400
The thing that was converted to pixels was entity offset, right?

1347
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,800
And that's why we can't do the things in meters because it was already

1348
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,800
done in m 2 pixels.

1349
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,400
We could have multiplied by the inverse here and then done everything

1350
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,700
in M, right?

1351
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,600
And then projected out right and that would have been fine.

1352
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,500
In fact we can try that and see if it's the same.

1353
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,500
I feel like it.

1354
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,700
Well I mean I guess we kind of know that it would be the same so I

1355
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,200
don't really need to do that but

1356
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,800
if you wanted to use this code to make a full 3D games, such as a

1357
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,000
first-person shooter, how much would you have to change to give the

1358
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,500
player an adjustable fov option?

1359
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,500
Well, so

1360
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,800
We can actually cover that since this we kind of need to debug this.

1361
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,000
So maybe Monday what we'll do is we'll cover that because really what

1362
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,700
you're doing here is the focal length is essentially what tells you

1363
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:29,000
what the fov is, right?

1364
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,300
That's what that does.

1365
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:39,800
And so really you can solve for what the focal length is trying to try

1366
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,000
to give you what the idea is here.

1367
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,100
So this is the value that we're using, right?

1368
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,500
That's the value that we're using to control the projection, right?

1369
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:54,500
And what fov is is it's this angle, right?

1370
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,700
This angle, let me draw new diagram.

1371
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,899
New diagram.

1372
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,100
There we go.

1373
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,700
So, let's say this is the top of the screen.

1374
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,399
So that's this is how big the screen is, right?

1375
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:23,000
So this is top of the screen, this is bottom of the screen.

1376
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:28,500
Okay, and here's the eye.

1377
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,399
Okay, so here we go.

1378
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,200
When we're doing is projecting point.

1379
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,800
So here is you know RP prime or whatever.

1380
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,700
And pees out here somewhere, right?

1381
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,899
What you're talking about when you talk about fov, right?

1382
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:45,800
Fov means field of view.

1383
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,200
And what that is is that's an angle, right?

1384
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,700
So if I say I've got 90 degree fov, what I'm talking about is that the

1385
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:59,400
maximum angle of a point that could be projected is going to be 40.

1386
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,300
Five, right?

1387
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,900
Because if it's 90, it's half this way, half that way.

1388
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,400
They're talking about the total angle like between the top and the

1389
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,700
bottom, right?

1390
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,900
So that total angle that's your fov.

1391
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,900
So what that tells you is well, if you just, if you've got this, you

1392
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,900
know, how far away the screen is.

1393
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:19,500
Right?

1394
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,000
I'm sorry, you know how big the screen actually is right.

1395
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,500
And so, if you want to know what this length is, all you need to know

1396
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,400
to

1397
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:35,000
To figure that out is to use this, this size, plus this angle.

1398
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,700
And, you know, you have a right triangle, you can use the tangent

1399
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,700
right to compute, what the D value would be for a particular fov.

1400
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:50,000
So the answer is you actually don't do anything to this code to make

1401
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,400
it support program will fov.

1402
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:57,000
All you do is you stick a tangent computation onto the front to

1403
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,400
basically compute D from knowing

1404
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,600
Angle and and a height, right?

1405
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,900
That's that's that's it.

1406
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,900
So it's the same code, it's just

1407
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,400
it's just

1408
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,100
Computing it

1409
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,600
So this says, expect a lot of preaching questions, but I don't really

1410
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,100
see that many questions on there.

1411
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:33,900
So, that's good.

1412
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,000
How long do you think this is going to take my estimate was 6:00.

1413
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,200
Which right?

1414
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,900
Like so I feel like that's a fair estimate.

1415
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,400
So right?

1416
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:57,900
If 6:00 and you figure a work week is 40 hours or so right then I

1417
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,800
figure if you divide this out,

1418
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,400
So that we're just saying, how many, like I'm going to say, work

1419
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,800
weeks, right?

1420
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:09,900
How many workweeks do we have here, right?

1421
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,800
It's roughly, like 15 or something, right?

1422
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,100
So we're talking about like a 15.

1423
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,000
Imagine if you were going to program 15 weeks of programming is

1424
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,400
roughly.

1425
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,900
What we're aiming to get the game done in which is actually incredibly

1426
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,200
short, right?

1427
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,600
It's incredibly incredibly short, it's much shorter than most people

1428
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:29,900
take.

1429
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:36,500
Been to make a game with an engine, but, you know, since we have to do

1430
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,500
it, we do only an hour at night and this wood, or this is already two

1431
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,100
years here, even an incredibly short game.

1432
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,300
If we actually stream all of the programming, which is what we're

1433
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:49,100
doing, just takes a really long time to get through nothing.

1434
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,200
You can really do about that.

1435
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
Sonic Fino, opengl no audio library.

1436
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
Know anything house being a masochist coming along.

1437
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,500
So it was all really simple, right?

1438
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,700
I mean, we already have the unoptimized version of the render and we

1439
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,100
have audio playing, so that turned out to be nothing.

1440
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,700
I mean, we'll take a couple weeks, maybe.

1441
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,100
So, you know, maybe something like, I want to say, like 24 hours or

1442
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,700
something of time to optimize a renderer but

1443
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,100
If that's what you call being a mask has, I mean literally like we've

1444
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,100
only program for 100 hours right?

1445
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:30,700
So far.

1446
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,300
And a lot of that's explanation time.

1447
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,200
So if you actually want to talk about how long it would actually take

1448
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:39,300
me to write those things like redoing opengl is Trivial, it's like a

1449
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,800
week's worth of work or something.

1450
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,400
Right?

1451
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,500
It's just a, it's a, no brainer and audio library.

1452
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,100
Audio is so simple.

1453
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,800
You can read an audio library in a day, right?

1454
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,300
It's totally trivial.

1455
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,400
We take a long time in the Stream because we tackle it.

1456
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,500
Of random stuff that we that I kind of want to go.

1457
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,900
That's like a trade-off based like handling Z.

1458
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,900
Like, we could have just not handled Z and that would have saved

1459
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:08,000
probably like, literally 50 hours of time or something, but, but yeah,

1460
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,100
like, it really just doesn't take very long at all, because we do

1461
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,800
explanations, and because we only do an hour, a night, it seems like

1462
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,600
it takes a long time, but if you actually map that into how long it

1463
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,700
would take you through just sat down and Cody, it's like nothing.

1464
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,400
So yeah, I mean, how long did it take us to do a texture map triangle

1465
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,500
1 hour and 40 minutes of it was explanation.

1466
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,400
So it took 20 minutes to program at extra mapper.

1467
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,200
That's how long it took us.

1468
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,500
So masochist.

1469
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,200
No, I mean if it's taking you longer than that to do the programming,

1470
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,900
you should come watch the stream and not call people masochists

1471
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,600
because you've got something to learn.

1472
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,000
Hello, as a software developer, I understand the performance benefits

1473
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,400
is C plus plus or important.

1474
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,900
However, there are a lot of

1475
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:05,100
PL based code at runtime tools coming out that streamline development

1476
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,700
on, both the web and in games.

1477
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,300
How do you feel about this departure from traditional software

1478
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,900
development tools?

1479
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:13,700
so,

1480
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,700
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what repl stands for in this case.

1481
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,900
Code at runtime tools.

1482
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,700
Are you talking about things that just try to come like jetting?

1483
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,400
What do you mean?

1484
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,000
Tell me what you mean.

1485
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,400
Our PPL code tools.

1486
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,600
Read eval print Loop.

1487
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,600
so, you're just talking about the fact that you can run code that you

1488
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,800
type in,

1489
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,800
Not sure, I understand here's what I will say.

1490
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,200
so,

1491
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,600
If you think that for some reason, C++ means that you can't

1492
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,600
interactively, code.

1493
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:10,100
Maybe you're new to the stream but here's the game running, right?

1494
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,000
And here's my code, right?

1495
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:19,000
If I wanted to do something like change the projection equation, I can

1496
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,700
just do that and it updates in the game live, right?

1497
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:29,100
So you don't need some crazy web language that runs super slowly and

1498
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:29,900
makes all of

1499
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,700
Our code lousy to get real-time coding, you just have to code the

1500
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:39,300
code, you have to write the code properly to do that and see which I

1501
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:44,100
think took us three hours of Total stream time to do so it's extremely

1502
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:48,300
simple to do that and see it takes hardly any time at all and there's

1503
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:51,800
like one or two things you can't do if you do that but they're things

1504
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,000
specific.

1505
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,700
See things you can't do once you do it that way.

1506
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:59,400
If you want the incremental stuff to work, but for most for 90% of the

1507
01:16:59,400 --> 01:16:59,900
tweaks, you

1508
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,300
Ooh, it's it just works.

1509
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,400
Do you use iPhone?

1510
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,700
If it's yes I would like to give you a copy of my game for iOS.

1511
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,400
Thank you very much for the offer but no I do not have an iPhone.

1512
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,300
Sorry.

1513
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,300
Will this game have cinematic mode?

1514
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,600
Well, it will have some cinematics.

1515
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:43,200
It'll have cutscene you'll have an intro cutscene

1516
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,100
Don't want to give too much away, but it will.

1517
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,100
I don't see any more questions.

1518
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:58,800
Are we done?

1519
01:17:59,300 --> 01:17:59,800
Is that it?

1520
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:00,900
Kappa.

1521
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,300
Everything just has a cap on the end of it.

1522
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,000
Apparently,

1523
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,700
And I feel like if Jonathan Blow wants to Flame about the iPhone

1524
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,900
Jonathan Blow Ken flame about the iPhone.

1525
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:21,600
I feel like he is well within his rights to do so because they're

1526
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,600
pretty darn annoying devices.

1527
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,800
Would the renderer be able to support something like zooming out for

1528
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,600
one screen that is twice as large.

1529
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,900
As normal sure, we can support any kind of zooming that we want if we

1530
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:46,000
wanted to support smooth zooming down to really tiny sizes, like so

1531
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,900
right now, I guess you can't really see it here.

1532
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,900
But you could sort of you, sort of saw it before when we were doing

1533
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:57,500
the test and we had this number a lot smaller.

1534
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,800
So when we were down,

1535
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:00,600
Here.

1536
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,300
Let's say, oops.

1537
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
That's not what I meant.

1538
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,400
So when we were down here, right?

1539
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,600
I don't know if you can see, maybe if I turn off those blue lines, you

1540
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,900
could see it a little bit better.

1541
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,700
Let me go in here and in turn off those, those boundary lines.

1542
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,900
So I'm going to go ahead and just turn those off, right?

1543
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,500
So if you turn off those boundary lines, I don't know if you can see

1544
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,200
this because it's not I guess it's probably not who I don't want to

1545
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,200
know what I just hit.

1546
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,000
I hit something that Windows is thinking about.

1547
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,600
Please don't do something, crazy Windows.

1548
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Know what?

1549
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,700
What the hell was that

1550
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,100
Why did it do that?

1551
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,100
I don't want a media center.

1552
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,100
Expiry, I don't even know what that was.

1553
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,500
That is unacceptable.

1554
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,700
Anyway, what I was trying to show you, is, if you take a look at at

1555
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,200
this, when things are shrunk down, do you see how you get some like

1556
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,600
kind of sparkly artists?

1557
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,200
Like, it doesn't look smooth, right?

1558
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,100
Like if you just look at the pixels in the in there, it kind of looks

1559
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:10,100
a little sparkly and janky at the edges, right?

1560
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:15,000
Whereas if I, if I go back to sort of the

1561
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,000
Normal size you can you can sort of see there.

1562
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Isn't that right?

1563
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,800
It's nice and smooth everywhere.

1564
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,700
The reason is because once you scale down to a certain size, we're

1565
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,200
only doing bilinear filtering which means once you scale below half

1566
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:28,800
size.

1567
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:33,700
So anything from half size down, third thighs, quarter size and so on

1568
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:37,600
you'll get sparklies because you're no longer sampling, all of the

1569
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,400
pixels that are involved, you know?

1570
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,000
So I'm sampling all the colors that are involved.

1571
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,300
And so, you get this week and talked about this a little bit and

1572
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,000
that's where you need.

1573
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:48,600
Mapping, which we didn't Implement because we don't actually ever need

1574
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,700
it for the actual game.

1575
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,200
And so it would just slow us down.

1576
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,300
But if you wanted to scale things down, really smoothly to very tiny

1577
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:55,900
sizes.

1578
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,300
So, let's say, you go to something twice the size the screen down to

1579
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,800
the size of the screen, down to half the

1580
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,400
The screen.

1581
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:05,000
So the total scaling size was like a quarter of its size, we would

1582
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,800
want to implement Implement mipmapping for that but we don't really

1583
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,800
have any need for that.

1584
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,000
I don't think in the game and so that's not necessary.

1585
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,200
So didn't have 73.

1586
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,100
Lots of quick time.

1587
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:26,800
Events too.

1588
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,200
Yeah, I don't know about quick, time events.

1589
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,700
Probably not quick, time events, but yet

1590
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,100
We're about is the explanation of the reloading, the code while

1591
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,600
running, it sounds like fun.

1592
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:46,600
So that is if you go to the Forum site, right?

1593
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,800
This is this thing here, if you go.

1594
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,500
So, this is handmade hero dot-org.

1595
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,600
If you go to the Forum site, you can actually go to this episode guide

1596
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,800
thing, and it's got like a lot of stuff on there.

1597
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:02,400
And this week, 5 fun with win32, basically shows you a bunch of stuff

1598
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,500
and we've got

1599
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,200
All kinds of fancy stuff in there.

1600
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,500
I don't even read, haven't used this, because we're not working on

1601
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,600
animation right now.

1602
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,800
We've used it like once or twice.

1603
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,900
I think, but we haven't used it too much.

1604
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:18,400
But one of the things that we also did is we actually have looped Live

1605
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,700
code editing, which is even cooler than Live code editing.

1606
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,500
So, you know, if you do something like we're I, you know, I go down

1607
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,200
the stairwell or something, right?

1608
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,500
And then, I come over here and I don't know, go down it again, right.

1609
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,300
Like, so,

1610
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,400
I can just set that as like a loop, right?

1611
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,500
And then it'll just play while.

1612
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,900
I edit the game, right?

1613
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,600
So I don't even have to go up there and do input, right?

1614
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,300
It's just, yeah, it's pretty awesome.

1615
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,200
Like, basically, like anyone who doesn't do this should do this, it's

1616
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,000
way better than even developing and like other languages that are

1617
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,800
supposed to be easier.

1618
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:58,300
This like, you know, it's it gives you all the benefits of optimized

1619
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:03,300
code, but you also have complete freedom to modify the code while

1620
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:04,100
running and there's a cup.

1621
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:04,500
Like I said,

1622
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,300
You can't change structure layouts.

1623
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,500
If you do it the way, we did it on stream because we did it in the

1624
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,100
simplest way.

1625
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,500
You can do it, you need more advanced stuff if you want to be able to

1626
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,500
train structure, layouts on the fly, but that's not that often and all

1627
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,200
you have to do is just restart, you know?

1628
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,000
Just just on those and that's not a big deal.

1629
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,700
So even the simple one that we did on the stream is pretty darn

1630
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,900
powerful at the end of the day, you know?

1631
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,300
So

1632
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,800
What kind of game is this going to be?

1633
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,100
And what will the point of it be?

1634
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:45,300
It's just a, it's a, it's just a Zelda type game where you kind of

1635
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:49,100
adventure around in a forest, and the emphasis is on programming.

1636
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,200
So we're trying to make sure that it has lots of complex programming

1637
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:52,700
things in it.

1638
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:56,300
Meaning like multiple Z levels and scaling between them and walking

1639
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,400
between them and, you know, all kinds of stuff and crazy.

1640
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,500
Between stuff like a very complex, object systems and stuff like that.

1641
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,000
We're focusing on that sort of thing, if that makes sense because we

1642
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,500
want the programming to be sort of difficult to cover and stuff like

1643
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:10,900
that.

1644
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,600
And we write the renderer and all that sort of stuff, it's not running

1645
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,000
opengl.

1646
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
This is our own renderer that we wrote which we're not done yet.

1647
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,100
That's what we're in the middle of doing.

1648
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,500
When the game is finished, you expect the game to look as good as if

1649
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,200
you made it in a commercial engine.

1650
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,600
I actually expect the game to look way better than it looked, then it

1651
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,900
would look in a commercial engine.

1652
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,800
And the reason that I say that is because the graphics are basically

1653
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,000
the same because we'll call opengl just like everyone else for our

1654
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,100
Hardware acceleration path.

1655
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:58,000
So it'll be basically the same but I feel like we'll just have a bunch

1656
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,300
of stuff that, you know,

1657
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,900
Game engines really are very lousy at nowadays like you know I when I

1658
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:07,100
load up games like a game in unity or something, I'm often staring at

1659
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:11,300
somebody's loading screen or the world, you know, has to pause when it

1660
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,900
loads and it goes from level to level something that and we will not

1661
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:17,800
have any of that stuff because we'll be doing our stuff properly.

1662
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,200
And so you know, I I don't suspect that.

1663
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,600
This this game will be just at parity with an engine.

1664
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,200
I suspect it will actually better in a number of ways an engine and we

1665
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,700
already are way better than any engine that I know of.

1666
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:33,300
Right now in terms of scale because we actually support

1667
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,500
extraordinarily, large worlds, or ready.

1668
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,200
We already did the work to like handle that and so assuming that we

1669
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,200
maintain that, I think will be pretty good as well.

1670
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,900
I also suspect our object system will be much better than anyone

1671
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,700
that's in available in commercial engines.

1672
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:46,400
So, yeah.

1673
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:47,800
So I don't intend this to be.

1674
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,600
Like I said, this is not a toy project.

1675
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,300
This should be significantly better than anything.

1676
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,400
You can buy off the shelf.

1677
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:59,100
The only thing we might not do is like go nuts on effects.

1678
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,200
So, you know, a commercial engine might have had better effects like

1679
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,400
special effects stuff because we probably won't spend time on some of

1680
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,100
that stuff that be the only thing, but you know, who knows, maybe,

1681
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,500
we'll even decide to do that at some point, but that, that wasn't

1682
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,800
really, I don't think that's super interesting cuz that's just kind of

1683
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,800
like, GPU sort of flailing.

1684
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,400
Can I learn how to be a better programmer from this channel?

1685
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,500
I hope so, that's the goal anyway, or at least a better game

1686
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,200
programmer.

1687
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,700
I don't really talk about any other kind of programming on the stream

1688
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:48,000
because I'm a game programmer so I don't know if it would help

1689
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
programming in general.

1690
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:49,400
But

1691
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,600
Hopefully it would it would be good for game programmers.

1692
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,900
How are you planning any DLC for this game actually?

1693
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,800
Kind of yes.

1694
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:06,500
And the only reason for that is actually because since the entirety of

1695
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,100
the game development is streamed.

1696
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,600
We've talked about this a little bit in the past.

1697
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,100
I've been trying to figure out how to still have their be surprises in

1698
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,100
it that people don't know about.

1699
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:20,000
And so one way that I was considering doing that was basically like

1700
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,300
release, you know, we do all the work up to shipping the game so that

1701
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,600
everyone, you know, could see that on stream, which is the goal, but

1702
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,800
then, you know, maybe I do a DLC pack that is not

1703
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,100
dreamed and so people can download that and and have surprises in

1704
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,500
there for things that they didn't know we're in the game, right?

1705
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,400
Until they find them.

1706
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:44,100
So maybe but it's not a concrete plan, you know.

1707
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,400
To use Windows Media Center a lot in your game development process.

1708
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:57,600
Yes, that is why it's so good that Microsoft made a hotkey that I

1709
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,400
don't even know what it was to get to Media Center.

1710
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,700
Because what if you're right in the middle of coding and you really

1711
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:07,400
need it to be like right now, you don't want to slow you down, right?

1712
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,500
You don't want to like, it's like having slow compile times, right?

1713
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,100
If it takes you a long time to open up Windows Media Center, that's

1714
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,000
really gonna drag on your productivity.

1715
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So good job.

1716
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,800
Microsoft getting that hot key in there because

1717
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,800
Sure that if someone had to go to the start menu and pick Windows

1718
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,700
Media Center, there would just be no way they'd ever get anything

1719
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,100
done.

1720
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:32,600
Manic the nobody.

1721
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,800
Why does he move slower at higher Zoom?

1722
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:39,200
So the reason is because we have not optimized our renderer yet and so

1723
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,000
actually, although it is running sort of at, you know, I don't know 15

1724
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,500
frames a second or something because holy cow computers are fast.

1725
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:53,800
Once we're using actually an extraordinarily slow rectangle filling

1726
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:59,100
routine because optimizing it is something that we want to start maybe

1727
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,300
in a week or so and so

1728
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,700
The closer you are to stuff the more pixels there filling on screen so

1729
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:06,700
the slower, it runs.

1730
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,300
Once we go ahead and optimize that this will all probably run, just

1731
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,700
fine and you won't see any of that.

1732
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,500
But until we actually do that work of doing the optimization, it will

1733
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,400
it will run slowly.

1734
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,500
When, when things are covering a lot of the screen because the cost, I

1735
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:28,500
guess the thing, I'm not implicitly saying the cost is based on how

1736
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,500
many pixels you draw.

1737
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,600
And right now, we're probably 100 times slower or something.

1738
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,600
Well, not 100 times slower.

1739
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,200
We're probably like 20 times slower than we should be or something

1740
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,000
heinous, like that would.

1741
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,300
And so, every pixel takes 20 times longer to process than it should.

1742
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,400
So if you have less pixels, it's drastically less time.

1743
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,900
Hence bigger things slower, smaller, things quicker.

1744
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,000
Will the game be fun?

1745
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,000
Well, I don't know.

1746
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,200
I'll try to make it fun but I'm not a game designer.

1747
01:29:59,200 --> 01:29:59,600
So

1748
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,400
A promise that I can promise it will be well programmed but I can't

1749
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,000
really promise.

1750
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,600
It'll be fun.

1751
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,900
Will you cover things like patching and downloading code from the

1752
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,500
internet?

1753
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,600
Probably not.

1754
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,300
I don't think we're going to cover networking on the stream.

1755
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,500
So we just, you know, we just let steam handle that I think is how we

1756
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,800
would mostly be doing that.

1757
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,500
So, looks like we are at the end.

1758
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,800
Are you planning on implementing some kind of Shader support?

1759
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,700
Oh man, you know, we've got it right.

1760
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:40,000
You, we just, I mean, but you just write it in C, so, but we've, we

1761
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,800
already did some fairly complex stuff which we haven't, we haven't

1762
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,700
quite put to use yet because we wanted to go get all of our Z and

1763
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,800
other assorted things straightened out first.

1764
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:57,000
But basically yeah we where is it here?

1765
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:58,100
Coordinate system.

1766
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:03,500
Coordinate system where it is, we already did a bunch of Shader stuff

1767
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,100
in preparation for lighting, right?

1768
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,800
So you can kind of see that sphere.

1769
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,200
There is is using reflection.

1770
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,700
Some reflection stuff that we were testing with these reflection Maps,

1771
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,500
right?

1772
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:18,200
So yeah.

1773
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:24,700
All right.

1774
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,400
Well, this game have a collector's edition.

1775
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,600
I want a plastic drag it in it for $150.

1776
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:44,400
Ningen, does that mean carrot in Japanese anyway, I feel like for

1777
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,400
$150, I don't know if that gets you a plastic Dragon.

1778
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,600
It might get you a cloth map.

1779
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:55,700
But if you want the plastic dragon that maybe only for the 250 dollar

1780
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:58,800
pre-order that's through GameStop.

1781
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,500
And but before you block at the 250 dollar price tag, remember you

1782
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:09,200
will also get a special golden prosthetic, limb for your limbless

1783
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:14,700
child in game that only people who do the 250 dollar pre-order get.

1784
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:19,700
So it's not just the plastic dragon in the Collector's Edition in the

1785
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:20,600
pre-order special.

1786
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,600
It's also that that special in-game golden golden Prosthetics.

1787
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,100
So you know, it's it's pretty hard to pass up.

1788
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,000
Up, get those 250 dollar, fat cash, wads ready?

1789
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,500
All right, I got to close down the stream now.

1790
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,200
I gotta go, guys.

1791
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,100
It's dinner time.

1792
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:41,900
I'm kidding.

1793
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,900
Of course about, there's not going to be a pre-order special.

1794
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,800
I'm not that kind of a developer.

1795
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,300
All right?

1796
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,800
Let me close this down because it's doing its little looping there.

1797
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,500
Let's close this down.

1798
01:32:59,200 --> 01:32:59,700
Thank you.

1799
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,100
One, once again, for joining me for handmade hero, it's been a

1800
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,400
pleasure coding with you, as it always is.

1801
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,100
I hope to see you back here, Monday.

1802
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,600
I believe it will also be 5:00 p.m.

1803
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,000
on Twitch at seems to be a good time slot for us.

1804
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,800
I think we're going to stay there.

1805
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,700
It's easier for me to work into my work day, if we do it that way.

1806
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:22,500
So that's when I tend to do it, as always, if you would like to follow

1807
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,400
along at home, you can pre-order the game at any time and it comes

1808
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,800
with a source code every night.

1809
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,200
I update the source code after you finish your.

1810
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,800
So if you want to play around the source code yourself,

1811
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,700
if you can go ahead and do that, just go to handmade hero dot org and

1812
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:36,400
hit that pre-order button and off you go.

1813
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,300
If you want to support the video series, we also have a patreon page

1814
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,200
which is much appreciated if you want to be a supporter.

1815
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:41,900
That's awesome.

1816
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,000
We also have a tweet but that tweets the schedule at you.

1817
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,900
So if you want to know when the stream is going to be live, check that

1818
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:48,900
out, it's pretty handy.

1819
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,100
It'll tell you the schedule every weekend, tweets out the full

1820
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,600
schedule for the week and then on weekdays, it gives you like kind of

1821
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,100
a warning.

1822
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,200
Like today's stream is going to be at such and such a time.

1823
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,500
And then finally there's a forum site

1824
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,200
Which is a great resource for trying to learn from the screen.

1825
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,100
There's a forum you can ask questions.

1826
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,700
There's also an annotated episode guide which you saw on today's

1827
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,400
stream in fact me pointing out and also there's ports to like mac and

1828
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,800
Linux and stuff which you know we're going to do on stream.

1829
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,400
But if you want to follow along today on Mac and Linux before we get

1830
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,300
to those ports, people in the community have already done them for you

1831
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,000
so you can just kind of go look at that, which is kind of awesome.

1832
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,100
So that's it.

1833
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,500
Thanks everyone for joining me.

1834
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,200
I hope to see you back here on Monday.

1835
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,900
Have an excellent weekend and until then take it.

1836
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,300
Easy.
