1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,100
Start recording.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,200
The show where we Kodak entire game from scratch using nothing, but

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
our bare fingers never toes.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
No engines.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,200
No libraries.

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,900
No nothing.

9
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,600
It's from scratch here on handmade here.

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,300
That's the way we do it and that is the way we have done it since day

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,800
one.

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,600
No reason to stop.

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,000
Now.

14
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,000
If you are one of those fine individuals who have pre-ordered the game

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,800
on handmade hero dot-org, you can go to the link that you got in your

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,600
email and download the source code.

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm you want that link keeps on working.

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,100
It's the gift that keeps on giving frankly.

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
And so if you want to follow along with today's stream and you do not

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,400
know how to do that, and you're just like, what's going on here.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
It's really simple.

22
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,800
All you got to do is extract the day.

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,700
47 zip, this one.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,800
We're on 48, run, j48, right now, so extract that day, 47 zip into a

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,900
directory and then also unzip.

26
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,600
The if you want to use our assets that come with it, that's a

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:56,900
separate.

28
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,800
So if I could download and unzip into the data directory,

29
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,000
And that allow you to be like exactly where we are right now.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
So you can follow along with everything I do at home.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,400
It's kind of like one of those shows on PBS where, you know, the guy

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,800
paints and you're supposed to paint along with them and you have no

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,400
idea like, why he's, you know what he's doing exactly.

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,900
But then it turns out to be some kind of weird cherry tree at the end

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,800
or something, right?

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,300
And it's fine.

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,800
All right.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,200
So without further Ado, let's get back to where we were yesterday,

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,900
which was very deflating because I was just

40
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,800
Out to finish some code and we had to end the stream because the

41
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,600
stream is over.

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,800
So let's take a look at what was going on there.

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,100
If you remember we had our little dude here, right?

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,900
And we were about to do some Collision work with him.

45
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
And we wanted to be able to have him run into the walls properly.

46
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,200
You can see he sticks on the walls right now.

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,500
And so what we need to do is we need to fix that.

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,900
We wanted to make a good Collision thing, so that we'd be kind of all

49
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,600
set to go.

50
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,600
All right.

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
So, how do we do that?

52
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,900
Well, we started writing something.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,100
I was sort of teaching.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Collision detection in baby steps and so we were going down each

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,600
individual baby step and we got to the baby step of how to test

56
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
against just simple walls.

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,000
So just as a point like a moving point versus one horizontal or

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
vertical wall, and we wrote the equations for that and we solve them

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,500
and then we didn't quite get a chance to actually ever write the loop.

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,900
So that's what we're doing today.

61
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,900
All's we got to do is write that Loop and then at least we can have

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,200
some decent Collision.

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,900
Now, we've got other

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,100
Stuff that we want to do after that to make our Collision detection, a

65
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,700
lot better, but that's the first thing that we need to do.

66
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,300
Just as our baby step before, we can really talk about what to do to

67
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:40,900
make it better.

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
So let's do that.

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Because right now, frankly, the Collision in this engine is awful.

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,900
Well, we don't really have an engine, but the Collision in this app is

71
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,000
awful and it shouldn't be off.

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
What should be good.

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,400
So, here we go.

74
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,900
What we have decided to do is take the place where the player was.

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,900
And the place where the player will be if he is unobstructed.

76
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,100
So the two points where he's going from, where is going to?

77
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,600
We have figured out all of the tiles that would be involved if we just

78
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,000
made a rectangle using that that span basically we're going to walk

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,300
through each of those tiles.

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,000
And if any of those tiles has a wall like if it's if it's marked as

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
solid then we are going to test against all four of the walls.

82
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,600
We're then going to take whatever the soonest Collision would be with

83
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,900
one of those walls and keep that as the earliest

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,700
And point that will tell us where our player will stop if he's going

85
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,200
stop.

86
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,400
Now.

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,100
We've pre initialized the minimum intersection time 1.0 which is

88
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,200
basically all the way to the new position.

89
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
Zero would be standing where we are.

90
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,100
1.0 would be all the way to the new location.

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,900
Right?

92
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
We've pre initialize it to 1 point 0.

93
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,600
So that every time through the loop, when we check to see, whether

94
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,800
we've gotten a better Collision than what we had before, if it's ever

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,100
above 1.0, meaning it would be past where we would actually want to

96
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,600
end.

97
00:03:59,600 --> 00:03:59,900
If the guy

98
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,300
I could move all the way to where you want to be.

99
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,300
We just won't even consider it so that kind of or any pre takes care

100
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
of all the Collision stuff that would be past the place where we would

101
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,600
end because obviously we don't care about collisions that happen after

102
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,900
we get to where we were already going.

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,800
And again, we'll fill our solution.

104
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,100
When we ever when we do ourselves, will still get those things that

105
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,700
are off there because we're figuring out the time.

106
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,200
We're doing a salute solve for the time at which you would Collide,

107
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,600
and that time is not bounded by anything, so it could say, oh, in 10

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,000
minutes, you'll end up down and hitting this wall and it's like, well,

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,300
great.

110
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Thanks, but we're not gonna, you know, we're not trying to take a

111
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,900
10-minute time step.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,500
So that's how that those things get eliminated is by setting this team

113
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,400
into 1.0, which is the full motion that can happen.

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,600
All right.

115
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,700
So what we do here is we first start out by saying, we going to do

116
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,400
each individual individual Collision detection, from the perspective

117
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,100
of the tile that we are checking.

118
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,300
So we take the tile that we're checking and we subtract away the the

119
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
the player position, right?

120
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,900
From that tile.

121
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,200
So we can actually do it in one of two ways.

122
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,400
We can do it, where we have the player is the we can have the vector

123
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,000
going from where the player is.

124
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,300
How should I say this?

125
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,000
We can have the where the player is be relative to the tile or we can

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,100
have the tile be relative to the player.

127
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
And I think what we want to do here in this case is just make it so

128
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
that the player is relative to the tile.

129
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,100
So we're taking the Tile Center and we're talking about the position

130
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,900
of the player relative to The Tile Center.

131
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,800
So, basically, the relative thing for that is going to be, we'd want

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,400
to do it this way.

133
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,600
We'd want to subtract the tile position, right?

134
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,100
We'd want to

135
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,500
Subtract the tile position from the player position which would give

136
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,100
us a vector from the center of the tile out to where the player is.

137
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:46,900
Okay.

138
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:54,100
We then also have this, the player Delta Vector, which is pointing in

139
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,400
the direction of travel and that, that player, Delta Vector is exactly

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,800
as long as the total distance.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,400
We want to travel to check basically the entire move, we would do this

142
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,200
time step if we were an obstructed.

143
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,600
So we go ahead and say, okay, we get that relative.

144
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,900
New player P, that's relative the center of the tile and now we have

145
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,200
the locations of the walls relative to the center of the tower as

146
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,500
well.

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,200
I mean Corner Max corner, right?

148
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,300
So now we need to do is test all four walls and take whatever the

149
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,900
minimum Z is.

150
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,400
So let's just test one wall for starters, right?

151
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,600
And I guess I've already kind of started with that here.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,200
Right?

153
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I said, test wall and I was going to pass the various parameters for

154
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,600
it.

155
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,900
So what I need to do is I need to write a function that will basically

156
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,600
update this for each wall, so that we can test the four different

157
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,500
walls of a tile.

158
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,300
So I'm going to write it in place, first for one wall and then I'll

159
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,900
pull it out into a function.

160
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,100
We can call once for each wall, so that we don't have to type the same

161
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,300
code four times, right.

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,700
Assuming that I can, we'll see, you know, maybe it's too hard to pull

163
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,800
out and I'm like a macro who knows.

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,000
We'll see.

165
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,200
Okay, this should be minimum T.

166
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
I don't know where Z came from there.

167
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay.

168
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,100
So here was our equation, Artie results.

169
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Meaning the, the T along that the percentage along the player, Delta

170
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,200
Vector, that we would have to go to intersect a particular walls x

171
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,800
coordinate at an x coordinate.

172
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,800
So, while an x-coordinate remember is a vertical wall, right?

173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,700
So at the x coordinate of the wall, we care about, right?

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,300
We want to subtract whatever the players x-coordinate is, and then we

175
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,400
want to divide by whatever the Delta x coordinate is.

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,900
So the X offset that will give us the tee, at which we would arrive

177
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,200
there.

178
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
We then want to check the bounds of that thing.

179
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
And in order to check the bounds of that thing.

180
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,000
We then have to figure out where the other component would be.

181
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,500
Right.

182
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
So, where would the, why be right?

183
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,500
Well, we know where the Y would be, the Y is just going to be that.

184
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,500
Result whatever that t result is.

185
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,100
However, far, the T result was, right.

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's just going to be that times that player, Delta Vector is why,

187
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:01,900
right?

188
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,300
Because remember, I can do an entire Vector, T result times, the

189
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,700
vector equals how far along that Vector, I've gone.

190
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,100
And in this case, I only care about the Y.

191
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,300
So I'm just going to use the Y component of it and save myself the

192
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,200
trouble, right?

193
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
It's going to be that.

194
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,000
That's how far he would move along that tea, and we've got the new

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,600
players x-coordinate here.

196
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,500
So you players.

197
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,100
Y coordinate here, right?

198
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,400
So we can go ahead and do that so we can go ahead and add that.

199
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,500
And this is how far he would have gotten total.

200
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Right?

201
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,100
The new y-coordinate is going to be his old y-coordinate and what, you

202
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,799
know, what, why is this new player P.

203
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,299
That's not right at all.

204
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,000
That should be old.

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,100
We want to where you started from.

206
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Its old player P.

207
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,900
I don't know why.

208
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,400
This is, why is why is that knew?

209
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,100
Who did that?

210
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,500
Who snuck in here?

211
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm sure obviously it could not have been me.

212
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,500
Somebody has.

213
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,000
Been into the code base and and put in the wrong variable.

214
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,000
How dare they?

215
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,800
Those people will be will be found and severely

216
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,000
Alright, so here we go.

217
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,300
We solve for that.

218
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,700
T result.

219
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,400
We find out what the new Y is and now we just need to see whether that

220
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,200
Y is within the bounds.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,600
That would be valid for this wall because the wall is not infinite.

222
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,100
It's between, you know, two things.

223
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,300
So we want to say basically that if that new Y is greater than or

224
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,700
equal to them in Corners.

225
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,100
Why?

226
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,900
Right?

227
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,900
Then it's definitely above the minimum bound and if the Y is less than

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
Or equal to the max Corners.

229
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:31,800
Why?

230
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,700
Then it's within that maximum bound of the tile, know what this test

231
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,400
walls doing there.

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,400
So if it's in there, then this is actually valid.

233
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,600
And if it's valid, then what you want to do is check that team in.

234
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,600
So we want to say if T Min is greater than T result.

235
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,400
Then that means this is a closer Collision than we've had before

236
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,100
right?

237
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,800
Excuse me.

238
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,200
And you know, we could check this first since it's a simpler test.

239
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
If that team in is greater than T result, then that means

240
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Then the T result is a closer collision.

241
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
And so, we should accept it.

242
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,300
Right?

243
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
So we should accept it.

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
And well, I certainly accept it assuming that the, the wall exists at

245
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,900
that point, right?

246
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,100
So that's really all we need to do.

247
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,700
But there's a catch and I talked about it on the last dream.

248
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,600
Don't know if you remember.

249
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
What's missing here.

250
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,800
Does anyone remember what's missing?

251
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,500
Remember.

252
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,900
Remember, what's missing remember?

253
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,300
Okay, I'm just gonna assume that you remembered in the Stream is right

254
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,600
now, filled with people saying, the thing that you are all remembering

255
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,200
when we do this computation 40 result, right?

256
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
We are going to get the intersection of essentially, the whole line

257
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,700
that the player is traveling along with that wall, which means he

258
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,300
could go backwards and hit the wall which we don't care about.

259
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,600
So, what we want to do is also say, well T result has to be greater

260
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,800
than 0 to begin with, right?

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,400
If T result is not greater than zero to begin with.

262
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,900
Then we're not going to we're not going to count this as a cliche

263
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,200
because that means the guy had to go backwards in order to hit it and

264
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,600
we don't we're not going backwards.

265
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,100
So that doesn't count.

266
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
So were strictly interested in collisions between 0 and 1, that's

267
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,100
where we want to be.

268
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
And so, so that's what we're checking for.

269
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,000
So, assuming that we got that we will then stop.

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,100
So, which wall did we Collide against here?

271
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,800
Right?

272
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,900
Well, so if we took wall X to be, oops, it's not, it's not

273
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,000
accidentally hit page up.

274
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
If we're assuming that we were going to test against, let's say our

275
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Max Corner X, right?

276
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,700
So max Corner X testing would basically give us

277
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,100
Excuse me.

278
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,000
Got an itch.

279
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,700
Would basically mean that we can test against the right wall of

280
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,900
anything, right?

281
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,700
So that's going to be, could go test that after it.

282
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,300
All right.

283
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,800
So now we have one more thing and I don't know if when I said what's

284
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
missing, you guys remember this as well, so I'm just going to come.

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,300
With it.

286
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,800
We again harped on it yesterday.

287
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
This guy right here.

288
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,700
What's going on with this guy?

289
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,400
Right?

290
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
What is the deal here?

291
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,300
People?

292
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,300
This might be small.

293
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,300
It might be so small.

294
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,000
In fact, it could be zero and what would happen if we were to divide

295
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,500
by a very small number or zero, we would get a disastrous results.

296
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,300
Zero, of course would cause the FPU to actually put like an invalid

297
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,100
value in there.

298
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,500
Or if we divide by a very, very, very small number of this will end up

299
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
being huge.

300
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,500
That's not such a big deal because it will immediately get thrashed by

301
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:31,900
this.

302
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,300
The basically we got to make sure this guy isn't zero at the very

303
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,200
least, right?

304
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,200
So we got a check to make sure that player X is not equal to 0 because

305
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,300
if it's equal to zero, it's Bad News Bears now.

306
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,000
Fortunately if I were the sort of person who ever remembered

307
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,500
All the weird rules for, like, what happens in the SSE registers Nu

308
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,900
divided by zero, it's possible that this is one of those routines

309
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
where it would just work, right?

310
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,200
Because if you could guarantee that t, result would always be greater

311
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,100
than 1.

312
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,000
In the case, where this was Zero, we'd actually be fine, right?

313
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,500
Because this check would nullify it, but I don't know, right?

314
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,300
So, I'm just, I'm not going to leave that to chance at the moment.

315
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,700
And if we really care about it down the road, when we're doing

316
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,400
optimizations, we

317
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,400
Go read the manual, and figure out, whether this is a safe divided by

318
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,000
zero Zone where we could like, turn off / 0, exception and just let

319
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,500
stuff rock out.

320
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,500
You know what I'm saying?

321
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Like one of those concerts where everyone gets backstage, you know the

322
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,400
ones I'm talking about anyway, so basically that is all we really need

323
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
to do to test against one wall.

324
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,200
Modulo bugs that I may have coded in there while I was gagging.

325
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
So in theory, we should be able to test against one wall.

326
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,600
Now.

327
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,700
While we are moving around, so I guess we're only testing its this

328
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,200
wall.

329
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,100
And so you know what?

330
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,900
I just realized though.

331
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,200
We're going to have to actually enable this case which we didn't yet.

332
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,200
That's that's what we actually want to do.

333
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,700
There we go.

334
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,200
Okay, so we got some compiler errors.

335
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,200
X is not a member of tilemap difference.

336
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,400
That is actually true.

337
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
This is so that's its Rel.

338
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,800
That's what I wanted.

339
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,200
Rel already made that into a V2.

340
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:17,900
There we go.

341
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,100
So no, who knows what'll happen now?

342
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,600
Okay, so we're not in good shape.

343
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,200
It's true.

344
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,600
Oh, well, that's just because I forgot to actually move the dude.

345
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Sorry, dude, I forgot to actually move them.

346
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,300
In the case where, you know, because basically what happens here,

347
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,900
right is we set these sorts of things like whether you Collide it and

348
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,200
that sort of stuff, right?

349
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,500
And then we did some updating stuff here depending on the situation

350
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
and all that sort of stuff.

351
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,100
So what we got to do here, I don't even, I don't even know what what

352
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,200
was this even supposed to be?

353
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,900
Abs, if called P absolute X is less than entity P.

354
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,100
AB style x r equals.

355
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
And so then what do we do with the our we just, okay.

356
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
So this was basically, this was our wall, this, this reset the

357
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,800
velocity.

358
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,600
So we're going to have to do something similar to that with the

359
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,000
velocity.

360
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
But for right now, we don't really care too much about that.

361
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,700
So we'll do that in a second.

362
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,200
But this is basically the problem that we need to solve right here.

363
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,300
We need entity P equals new player P and we haven't done that yet.

364
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,600
So, basically, what we need to do is we need to actually make our new

365
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,200
player P.

366
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,500
Dot offset code.

367
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,200
We want that too.

368
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,900
Actually.

369
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,300
Yeah, we don't even want that to be happening the way that it's

370
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:23,900
happening up here.

371
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,300
Really?

372
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,500
This is all this is all kind of not not good.

373
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,500
We're going to, we're just going to, you know, we're going to do.

374
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
This is what we're going to do.

375
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,500
We're gonna move all this craft into here and then we're going to say,

376
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,800
all right.

377
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,600
This is the actual stuff that we actually want.

378
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,900
So we've got our player Delta that can be computed stably.

379
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,100
And then what we want to do is say okay when we actually have the

380
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,700
player, Delta we need to recompute the velocity still, which is this

381
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,700
guy here, but we don't really know what's going to happen to that.

382
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,400
Exactly.

383
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,700
I guess we kind of do.

384
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
We could do that?

385
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,200
So it depends we have to talk about the order of operations there.

386
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,200
Later, when were finessing this but that's mostly right.

387
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,800
And so what we want to do now is actually move this stuff down there.

388
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,500
So we've got our player Delta and we've got that stuff.

389
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:10,900
Computed.

390
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,000
But now in this case, what we're going to do is we're actually going

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,900
to go ahead and do that update in a slightly different way.

392
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,800
Instead of doing it the way we're doing it before we're now going to

393
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,200
multiply that Delta vector by whatever our minimum intersection was.

394
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,400
And so that way if we hit something, we will only go as far as the

395
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,700
thing we hit because that team in will have been set to whatever that

396
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,200
closest thing we hit was in here.

397
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,200
And if

398
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,400
Nothing gets hit, then we'll just use 1.0, which will step us all the

399
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,900
way there.

400
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,100
Right?

401
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,300
Which is what we wanted.

402
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
So basically that's that's that's it.

403
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,200
And then I can do the actual update move which is here and we'll just

404
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,500
have to deal with velocity in a second once we're ready for that.

405
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay.

406
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,200
So we've got a new player P AB style X.

407
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Being a complaint here.

408
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,200
That's because this should, this is all just this is, this is all.

409
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,500
Oh, okay.

410
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,700
That's all right.

411
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,200
So, never mind.

412
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,400
I guess.

413
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
I did meet a new player P.

414
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,100
Guess, I did need new player pee.

415
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,300
Because I need to actually test against that AB style X.

416
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
I apologize, new player P.

417
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,400
I guess, I thought I had more than I thought.

418
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,000
I was.

419
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Well, maybe I didn't, I could just on that by accident.

420
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,800
I don't actually know that past Casey, was smarter than future Casey,

421
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,000
in this particular case.

422
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,099
All right, so we've got a new player P and, and it's actually

423
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,400
There we go.

424
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,700
It's actually being computed there.

425
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
And now down here.

426
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,300
I just have to basically we do this a different way, right?

427
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,600
I just have to redo it to be the new the new way.

428
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,700
Alright, so at least you can still move.

429
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,500
So we know that our team in equals 1 when we don't hit anything as

430
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:39,800
working.

431
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
So let's see what happens when we go here.

432
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,300
Perfect.

433
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,100
That's actually exactly.

434
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,600
Right?

435
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,600
And we should be able to walk straight on through this wall, right?

436
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,800
Yeah, that's hilarious.

437
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,300
I can't get back in because there's walls on that side.

438
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Oh, no, my guy is trapped in the wilderness.

439
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,000
Help him.

440
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,900
Oh awful.

441
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,600
Alright.

442
00:17:59,700 --> 00:17:59,800
Well.

443
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
That was a mistake.

444
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
I admit that I admit that.

445
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
So that's exactly what supposed to do.

446
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,100
Let me rerun it again because I want to show you one thing first.

447
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,500
Just so we're all clear on it.

448
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,100
So you'll notice that that he is able to enter penetrate the wall now

449
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,600
and that's because we're only checking his one base point, right?

450
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,000
This is a point versus.

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
Well, it's a line but it's the motion of a point versus a wool.

452
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,100
So we're only checking that one point.

453
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
That's his sort of Base point, right?

454
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
So you can see that so interpenetrates.

455
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,900
So one of the things that we're going to do is expand him to a area

456
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,100
shape.

457
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,700
In a bit so that we can, we can Collide against that.

458
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,800
But, for now, I just want to point out that that's why that's happened

459
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,900
to so everyone understood what's going on there.

460
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,700
And like, don't go don't do this, don't ever do that.

461
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,400
Do not walk out of there until we implement.

462
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,200
The other one are we're in trouble.

463
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
We can do this with impunity.

464
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,300
Probably.

465
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,000
Can we know we didn't.

466
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,900
That didn't work very well.

467
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,000
Either that just got I'm totally stuck now.

468
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,800
Yeah, so we got to go ahead and fix all the rest of this stuff because

469
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,000
we're bad news here.

470
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,800
If we don't put the rest of these walls and we're going to have guys

471
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,200
ending up, stuck in things all over the

472
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,200
All right.

473
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,600
So all we really need to do now is turn this into something that tests

474
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,300
all the walls.

475
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,900
So I'm going to pull this out into a function and see if I can just

476
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,700
functionalize functionalize it, right.

477
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,300
So I'm just going to go ahead and say, all right.

478
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,300
I've got this this guy here.

479
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,700
It's going to be test wall.

480
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm going to call it.

481
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,600
It's going to do this stuff and we're going to see what we can do in

482
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,300
terms of making this usable.

483
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,100
So, let's assume that I pass, did, I leave I left.

484
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,100
It all in there, right?

485
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,700
Yeah, good.

486
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,100
So basically, we want to pass this the wall X, right?

487
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,000
And this case, it could be an ex or oh, I we want to plas the, the

488
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,900
player Delta X, right?

489
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,500
And these are actually just going to be like, wall.

490
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,000
I guess.

491
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,300
Well, expired out the Xposed.

492
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,200
Even like that.

493
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Third out to X.

494
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
This will be the relex.

495
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,900
So we got to pass the relex as well.

496
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,100
And then we got that and then we need the

497
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,300
Or Delta y as well, there we go.

498
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,300
And notice we're not passing this as a vector.

499
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,700
There's a very good reason for that.

500
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,900
I don't put real here first.

501
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,000
The reason for that, of course is because we don't actually know if

502
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,900
these are x's and y's.

503
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,300
They could be inverted because well, you'll see in a second because we

504
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,400
want to call it for both ways.

505
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,600
We want to call it for y, intersections and X intersections, right?

506
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,300
Okay.

507
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,100
And so then I've got my rail why as well?

508
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,000
Right?

509
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,100
Well why again, I don't know which sense those are that I got

510
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,900
Mighty results my team in.

511
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,700
So then we got a team in is the thing we're updating and then we got

512
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,400
our Min Y and our Max y, right?

513
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,300
So we got our Min Y and our Max, why?

514
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,200
Okay, and that'll do the wall test.

515
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,200
So, what is the problem here?

516
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,300
Team in needs?

517
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
There we go, so they can be updated.

518
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,100
And so now I just need to call this, right.

519
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,900
I just need to call this with the same things I was.

520
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,100
Calling it with before.

521
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,600
So, in this case, I call it with wall X and and that's going to be Max

522
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,200
Corner X.

523
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,800
There we go.

524
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,300
I've got my relex, and my rail, why.

525
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,400
And then I've got the player, Delta X and the player Delta y, right?

526
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,200
And then I've got my team in.

527
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
And I've got my Min Corner.

528
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,900
Why?

529
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,000
And my Max Corner why, right?

530
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,700
And that is my test.

531
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
There it is.

532
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:31,700
Now.

533
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,500
What I can do is I can just Spam this, right?

534
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,600
I can spam this out and say, alright, let's test the other ones.

535
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,700
So now let's test them in corner X as well, right?

536
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,000
And to do that.

537
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
All, I have to do really is change this because it's exact same test.

538
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,900
It just gets a different coordinate.

539
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,900
And then if I want to test the Y, right all I have to do is

540
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,900
That and flip, the things that I was passing, right?

541
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,200
I just flip them because it can just basically do them in the opposite

542
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,600
way.

543
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,600
That it was doing before and that should test against all the walls of

544
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,100
the thing.

545
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,200
If I'm not mistaken, could be mistaken.

546
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,100
Who knows?

547
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,000
We'll find out in a second, won't we?

548
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,800
So there we go.

549
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,300
That hit that wall, hit that well that hit that Willow.

550
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I spoke too soon.

551
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,200
We are missing a wall which wall are we missing people?

552
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,300
So we're missing the WiMAX wall.

553
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,800
So there is a typo somewhere there.

554
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,300
That would be Max Corner .y, real X.

555
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,100
Ro why?

556
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Delta X where Delta right Min Corner x, max Corner, X team in.

557
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,400
What?

558
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,800
What did I type in wrong there?

559
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:47,500
I made a mistake of some kind, but I don't know what it actually was.

560
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,200
Well, you know, actually don't necessarily know that I made a mistake

561
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,900
yet.

562
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,700
Because, technically, there's something that we haven't quite done.

563
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
It's a separate issue.

564
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,000
You about?

565
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,600
I guess I don't know for sure.

566
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,100
Let's put it that way.

567
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
So let me double check and make sure that that's not the case.

568
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
What I'm going to do right here is just check to make sure that I

569
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,800
don't have a thing where I'm just stepping through the wall because

570
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,200
we're not actually doing anything to prevent that at the moment.

571
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,300
Yeah, so that's what I thought.

572
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,000
All right, so that's fine.

573
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
So let's talk about that.

574
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,300
All right.

575
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,300
So we've gotten to the place where successfully testing all the walls.

576
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,700
But now we have to deal with problem number 2 for this kind of test,

577
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,600
which is that when we actually do this computation, right?

578
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,700
So here's the problem that we have when we actually do this.

579
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,700
We are finding the point where he exactly hits the wall where this

580
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,300
guy, exactly hits the wall, right?

581
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,700
And we have a problem, which is that when we, then if we then allow

582
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,800
him to actually be there on the next time, step.

583
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,100
He won't actually necessarily, you know, due to Precision issues.

584
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,800
And so on.

585
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,600
He won't necessarily ever hit this wall because he might be just a

586
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,300
little bit to the other side of it.

587
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,900
Right?

588
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
Because we're counting on that equation.

589
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,400
Producing a tea that is greater than or equal to 0, right.

590
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,800
But if we move him right up to the wall and stick them right on it.

591
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,400
If we stick him, even even the smallest fraction of a floating point

592
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,400
value to the other side of it, right?

593
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Then he would not actually that test would no longer succeed.

594
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,900
So we don't have a very big margin for error there and that's not a

595
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,800
good thing, right?

596
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,300
Right.

597
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
that's not a good thing at all, because we that's not

598
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,400
At that's just not how you want to roll.

599
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,100
Right?

600
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,300
So there's a number of ways that we could deal with this.

601
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,100
And it's unclear.

602
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,600
Exactly necessarily what we want them to be.

603
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,400
I'd have to think about this a little bit more to think about what I

604
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,800
ultimately want to do for right now, since we're only doing very

605
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,400
simple thing.

606
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,800
I would say that the easiest thing to do is just for us to make sure

607
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
that we put in a little bit back from the wall.

608
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,700
Always, if he hits the wall, right, just make sure that you're a

609
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,900
little bit back from it.

610
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,600
That's probably the easiest thing to do and wouldn't really cause any

611
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,200
problems.

612
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,700
But basically this is something that we probably want to handle more

613
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,400
robustly.

614
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,800
Once we get forward enough, that we've actually written Collision

615
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,200
detection.

616
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,300
The way that we want to do it with area shapes and so on, then we'll

617
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,900
talk a little bit more about this case again and see if we can't do a

618
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,400
cleaner job for right now, I'm going to do is make sure that he's back

619
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,200
a little bit from it.

620
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,100
Right?

621
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,700
So what I want to do, there is say that

622
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,000
Whenever he hits a wall, right?

623
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,700
Whenever he actually hits a wall there.

624
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,700
I would like him essentially to be just a bit back from it.

625
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,000
So when he does that, I'm going to say that that we're going to have

626
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,100
this little like we're going to have some kind of an Epsilon on the T.

627
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,100
It be nice if that that was in World space and not motion space,

628
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,700
though is the only thing because if I do it in the terms of the T

629
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,000
value, then the problem with that is that's going to be proportional

630
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
to how far removed.

631
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,800
I'll see if this works.

632
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,900
Now, like I said, I don't want to necessarily do it quite this way

633
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,700
when we get to the end.

634
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,300
So I'm not going to sweat it too much making this quite right because

635
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,100
I'm not sure that we really care but, you know, we'll see.

636
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,400
So I'm going to make a little Epsilon here, right?

637
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,400
That Epsilon is just typically a term we use for like a very small

638
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,900
value that we're using to make a tolerance to work around floating

639
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,500
Point things.

640
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm just going to say that the T Epsilon is going to be something

641
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,900
like, you know, 0.01 or something like that.

642
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
I don't know yet.

643
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,000
Yet.

644
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,200
But we'll just have some arbitrary value that we stick in there and

645
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,800
will basically say, okay in the case, where we actually hit the team

646
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,400
in what we're going to do is say we'll give it the minimum of that and

647
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,900
T that t result - that Epsilon distance, right?

648
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And again, this is not a particularly good way to handle this.

649
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,900
I don't think, but I just want to see if this if this will fit.

650
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
Start situation, right?

651
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,200
Let's see here.

652
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,000
Yeah.

653
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,900
So you can see it's not really great.

654
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,200
But, you know, it is a little further away than I would.

655
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,400
Like.

656
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,400
You can see it's pretty far actually from where the guy is if that

657
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,900
makes sense.

658
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,100
Yeah, so, all right, so we want that to be much smaller, maybe

659
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,000
something like this.

660
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,700
I don't know why I keep closing the application.

661
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,900
So now we can go right up to the wall and hit it.

662
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,100
I don't know why.

663
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
That that was a little weird.

664
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,100
Don't know why he's hitting it that way.

665
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,000
That's very strange.

666
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,300
I got to take a look at why that's happening.

667
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,200
Feels like his velocity is much larger than I would think.

668
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,800
Or is Delta is much larger than I would think it would be.

669
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,400
Hmm.

670
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,200
That is very strange.

671
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,400
Yes, that's fine.

672
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,200
Continue.

673
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,600
Oh, that's right.

674
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,700
We don't actually have a way to continue beyond that.

675
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,500
So anyway, yeah, I don't love that.

676
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,400
Let's go ahead and take a look at this more because that's not quite

677
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,600
as good as I would have liked it to be just in, in general.

678
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,200
But anyway, that's what happens when he hits the wall.

679
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,500
He's now, we now at least know when he hits the wall and we just have

680
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,200
our, we don't have a very robust algorithm right now, in terms of

681
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,900
dealing with what happens when we actually want.

682
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,400
The, the floating-point stuff to work out properly.

683
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, you know what?

684
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,800
We forgot to do, though.

685
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,800
I know we forgot to do.

686
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,700
We need to do our re canonicalize.

687
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,300
That's something that we need to actually go look at as well pretty

688
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,800
soon here because that's going to get annoying real fast since we

689
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,100
haven't gotten to that point yet.

690
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah.

691
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,900
So, I believe we won't hit that assertion.

692
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,800
Now that we don't do that.

693
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,300
We're doing our economic lives, but we still just have that nasty.

694
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,900
I feel like that should stop right at the edge and it isn't.

695
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,800
So I wonder if I have another bug.

696
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,100
I feel like I must have another bug there.

697
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,500
That just feels really wrong to me.

698
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,100
So I think there's a bug.

699
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,400
I don't know.

700
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:13,600
Why.

701
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,300
Why do I keep closing the app I'm used to today.

702
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,500
I was working on stuff all day that did not have Dynamic reloading

703
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,000
because I'm working on some lower level stuff.

704
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,600
And so I'm used to having to close the app every time I'm going to

705
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,100
rerun it.

706
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
So I feel like there's something incorrect In what I'm doing, that's

707
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,300
causing me to get that stoppage in a way that I don't like.

708
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,100
And so I'm going to take another look again here at this and say what

709
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,800
exactly is going on.

710
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,800
Oh, okay.

711
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,700
That's fine.

712
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,500
I typed a minimum instead of Maximum, not the brightest movement.

713
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,100
But yeah, so I was trying to clamp against zero because I didn't want

714
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,800
it to make a move backwards and I typed a minimum, which meant it was

715
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,100
always going to pick zero.

716
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,700
Oh, that's awful.

717
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,900
Not that Salish, same awful, but it's pretty dumb.

718
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,000
There we go.

719
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,600
Much better.

720
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,300
Yeah, so now we're back to where I thought we should be, which is

721
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,000
being able to hit exactly.

722
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,400
I don't know why we're getting that.

723
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,900
I wonder if I'm if I'm still not doing the re canonicalize properly.

724
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,200
Let's take a look here.

725
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,700
So tile I might still not be doing that right?

726
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
But let me let me look at what tile rail is here.

727
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,500
So tile relative is really large.

728
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,400
So that seems wrong.

729
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,200
So I think we're not doing that properly.

730
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,500
New player P.

731
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,500
We cannot.

732
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,800
Last position.

733
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,200
So why are we getting?

734
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,500
Why are we getting that?

735
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,300
What's the tile side and M Tile map tile side and M, so 1.3.?

736
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,400
Well, no, that's that's about, even though that's, that's pretty darn

737
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,400
close, right?

738
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,900
That's, that's a that's about, right.

739
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:55,900
I would say.

740
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,400
So yeah, that's probably close enough these guys.

741
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Yeah, these guys are

742
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,600
Are just going to have to.

743
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
That's just the way that's going to go basically.

744
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,600
Yeah, I don't think there's much of a way around that necessarily.

745
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,100
Let's see here.

746
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,300
I wonder if those should be loosened.

747
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,500
Tile.

748
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,200
So remember we put these in, just to check when we were doing recon,

749
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,600
as we know that they're not going to be exact at the moment.

750
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So, I'm wondering what's happening here when we do this offset and we

751
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
subtract after we do the Divide.

752
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm wondering if it's if it's why it's unable to get us to have

753
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,300
properly like that.

754
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Let's see here.

755
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,700
You know, should it be?

756
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,800
Should I allow some slop there?

757
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

758
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,700
Yeah.

759
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,100
Yeah.

760
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,200
We'll see.

761
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,500
All right, because yeah, I don't I don't know exactly what we want to

762
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,200
do about that.

763
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,700
I but I don't love having those kind of I don't like any kind of

764
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,000
Epsilon things, really?

765
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,100
So usually once we have an Epsilon in the code, I usually kind of

766
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,300
think of it as something that I want to go back and fix.

767
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,200
But only once I actually know that I'm going to use the code.

768
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,100
So like that looked like he went a little bit too far into their which

769
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,400
didn't what's also looked a little bit chunky.

770
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,700
I want to see if I can reproduce that.

771
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
I don't know if I can though.

772
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,400
Yeah, so how did he get in there?

773
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,600
I'm assuming that, that is us not checking something the way that we

774
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
should be checking, right?

775
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,800
Because he shouldn't ever be able to move.

776
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,600
In like that, right?

777
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,000
Like like you can see you can get through there, right?

778
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,900
So how did he manage to do that?

779
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,700
How did he sneak through that hole?

780
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,900
I would like to know.

781
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,400
So yeah, you can see that.

782
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,800
All right.

783
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,800
So I think basically the probably the easiest thing to do is just be

784
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,200
to step up to the next level of collision detection, rather than

785
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,900
trying to get this to work more seamlessly.

786
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,300
Because most of the things that we're seeing here that are janky or

787
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,500
things that will go away.

788
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,500
If we go move to the next sort of level of goodness at that make

789
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:34,900
sense.

790
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,500
So let's just call that done for now, but observe the problems, right.

791
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,200
The problems are we have to have an Epsilon in order to not go through

792
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,100
the wall and even with that Epsilon I believe and I can't say for sure

793
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,900
because if you know, you know, what we could do we could we could

794
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,000
actually do something to visualize this.

795
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,100
To make it a little easier to see what I think is happening there.

796
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,500
And I just want to make sure everyone can see all the problems with

797
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:02,600
it.

798
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,300
Before we go up to the next thing.

799
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,700
Let's see here.

800
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,300
I want to render these guys a little smaller than they would otherwise

801
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,199
be so like that.

802
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,699
I think so.

803
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,000
There we go.

804
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,199
So did you see that?

805
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,300
Basically what happened there?

806
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,900
That that is exactly what I'm talking about.

807
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,699
So,

808
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,800
I can't get through here.

809
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,900
But if I could hit it directly at the edge, right?

810
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,600
Where is it?

811
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,500
Come on, there we go.

812
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,100
Right?

813
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,600
You see that if I hit it directly at the edge, I can get in between

814
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,100
where I was hitting this wall.

815
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,600
And this wall, right?

816
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,900
These two neighboring walls, the two verticals.

817
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,900
I can, I can just manage to get between it, right.

818
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,500
And I think someone on the street, the other day was asking about how

819
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,800
you can glitch through walls, and I sort of Drew that case where the

820
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,600
things, we're just a little

821
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,100
Off.

822
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,700
So that's an example, right?

823
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,200
Because it's the numeric numerically.

824
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,600
It's just not stable enough.

825
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,100
So there's a gap essentially that you can sort of fit through there if

826
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,300
you really kind of work at it, right?

827
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,700
So, that's a good example.

828
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,200
So, all right, so we've got a bunch of things that we would like to do

829
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,600
now.

830
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,700
and basically, what they boil down to

831
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,400
There's really two, there's two two.

832
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,800
Totally separate things that we want that both come from the same.

833
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,700
That will both be solved by the same solution, if that makes sense.

834
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,300
So what are they?

835
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,800
All right.

836
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,700
Oops, that's no good.

837
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,300
okay, so the first thing,

838
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Is that we are testing against an infinitely thin wall, right?

839
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,700
We're testing.

840
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,500
I think that's like this little tiny thin wall and all we know about

841
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:08,000
is that pin point in space that the wall is, and what that means is

842
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,300
that if the guy is on this side of the wall.

843
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,000
He can hit it going this way.

844
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,200
And the guys, on this side of the wall.

845
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,400
He can hit it going that way.

846
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,400
But, if he's right here, or right here, right?

847
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,400
Remember imagine, this was very, very microscopic.

848
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,400
So he's just a hair on either side, right?

849
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,100
He would still be able to move in what freely?

850
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,700
In that direction or freely in that direction, right?

851
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,700
So if we're ever off by even the slightest bit numerically, and we

852
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,500
thought we were stopping him right here, but we actually put them just

853
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,300
on the other side.

854
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,800
Right.

855
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,700
It will it allow them to the player to tell me right through the wall.

856
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,500
And that's a symptom of the fact that we're treating it, as just this

857
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
thin, right?

858
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,900
This very infinitely thin.

859
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,500
Well, you know I'm saying?

860
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,000
So that's not very good.

861
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,900
We don't like that.

862
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,800
What we would rather be the case is, we'd rather it be the case that

863
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,500
this were a solid thing.

864
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,100
Right?

865
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,100
Something that didn't have a very tiny little miniscule, sort of thing

866
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,400
to it.

867
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Where numerical imprecision could ever happen.

868
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,300
We would want this to be as thick, you know, some thickness that

869
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,300
allowed it to knock it through and of course if we think about it, the

870
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,000
tile itself, right?

871
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,300
Is very much a solid thing.

872
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,500
So like the fact that we were testing against each wall individually

873
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,000
and treating it as infinitely.

874
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,400
Thin isn't really necessary because the thing that we're trying to

875
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,400
simulate is not even an infinitely thin border around something,

876
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,000
right?

877
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,800
We're actually okay with just saying, hey, you know, you can't walk

878
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,700
anywhere within this entire block, right?

879
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,600
So what we'd like to do is solve this problem.

880
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,600
First of all,

881
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,900
Then we have another problem that we also have right.

882
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:02,400
And that problem is that our guy is, is too tiny in his Coalition

883
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,500
sense, right now, right?

884
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,900
He can interpenetrate here because we're only doing Collision

885
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,400
detection with that point.

886
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Right?

887
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,200
And the reason that we're only doing context of the point is because

888
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,900
we all we know how to do at this point is do Collision detection along

889
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,900
array, right?

890
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,300
So we have a ray that is moving along and we're testing that against

891
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,300
the

892
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,100
A wall but really he should be some shape here.

893
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,600
You know, he should be like a circle or something so that when he

894
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,800
moves against, when these collisions act against other things, it's

895
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,300
actually whenever any part of the circle would touch, the thing that

896
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,800
he's colliding against that would stop him and that would allow us to

897
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,100
give him some volume, right?

898
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,100
So that he stops away from the wall, like, you know, they're properly,

899
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,300
but also if he's going in the other direction, stops away from the

900
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,800
wall, you know,

901
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,800
Like they're whatever.

902
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,300
Right?

903
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,000
So something that gives them that volume back and I think that's

904
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,600
obviously something that we want as well.

905
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,900
And so both of those things are.

906
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,200
Basically sort of asking us to move up a level in complexity of how

907
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,700
we're doing our Collision detection and say instead of talking just

908
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,300
about lines, right?

909
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,100
Because all we were talking about is lines.

910
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,800
Basically, what we wrote before was something that intersects the line

911
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,100
of the player, right?

912
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,800
With the line of the world, some kind of line in the world.

913
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,900
So, what we're talking about now is, we're saying, let's move from

914
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,000
lines to testing actual areas, right?

915
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,600
Or volumes if they were in 3D, right?

916
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,900
So let's go from lines to areas and figure out how to do area versus

917
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,600
area.

918
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,600
So that we can actually have Collision detection that is both

919
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,100
numerically more robust, because it's not talking about these

920
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,700
infinitely, thin things that are very easy to have Epsilon issues

921
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,900
around A and B.

922
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,900
So that we can make the player, have some volume as well.

923
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,500
And so he will not be just a pinpoint.

924
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,300
This moving around for the purposes of his Collision detection.

925
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,600
And so that's what we want to do.

926
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,900
And ideally we'd like to do that in a way that gives us a fair bit of

927
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,200
flexibility with what these volumes actually are.

928
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,500
You know, I would like to basically say, maybe at the very least, I'd

929
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,900
probably say we might want to allow ellipses in there.

930
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,500
R-right because I feel like the guy is probably wants to be a lips.

931
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't know.

932
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,200
He might maybe he wants to be a circle.

933
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,400
I don't know.

934
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
It's kind of hard to say.

935
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,300
It depends on what's going to feel good to move around, really right,

936
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,200
but I don't know if a circle makes some sense for him or if an ellipse

937
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,100
makes more sense.

938
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,800
The problem is, you know, the perspective of the game is a little

939
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,000
tilted, in that sense.

940
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
And so maybe it needs to be more of an ellipse to properly feel right?

941
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,400
In terms of when you're moving through stuff.

942
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,900
But at the same time,

943
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,500
And that means that your motion is going to feel different depending

944
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,900
on whether you're grinding against a vertical or horizontal wall, when

945
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,300
you turn the edge and stuff.

946
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,100
So, so no means a circle.

947
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,200
So, at the very least, a circle, the very least we need circles

948
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,000
because he's at least going to be probably a circle because you wanted

949
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,100
to kind of be smooth and to be able to roll around things.

950
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,400
So that, when you're pushing into things, you don't want them to have.

951
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,100
Like you don't want its Collision shape to have hard edges, because

952
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,900
they'll get like caught in stuff and be kind of janky new around.

953
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,700
So, a circle is kind of nice because it rolls off things, and it just

954
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,800
feels nice and smooth to move.

955
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,400
Around.

956
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,100
So we definitely want circles.

957
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,800
And then we probably also want rectangles, because there's probably

958
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,200
rectangle stuff in the game, but we might also want polygons, right?

959
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,400
We might want to be able to say let's be able to draw just arbitrary

960
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,400
kind of little fancy sorts of things perhaps, right?

961
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,900
So that's another thing that we might want to have.

962
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,500
And so we're going to want to basically think about when we as we're

963
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,100
sort of, when we upgrade our Collision here.

964
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,200
Now, we're going to want to think about how we can do something more

965
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
along these lines.

966
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,900
So what we might do, what we might do is just do Circle and square so

967
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,500
that we can do tile map.

968
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,300
Well, you know, we could even just do circles and circles.

969
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,500
Yeah, let's do Circle and square.

970
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,700
Let's say let's shoot for doing Circle and square now, but to think

971
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,700
about also polygons going forwards, because when we actually go to do

972
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,600
the real shipping Collision, Vector code, whatever we decide to do

973
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,700
that, it'd be nice to potentially have those.

974
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,500
Not sure.

975
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm not sure if we'll want them, but we might.

976
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,000
So we want to basically set our engine up since that's why, you know,

977
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,100
we're still in the phase where we wanted to find all the things we

978
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,800
needed to do and get

979
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,900
You know, placeholder versions of all of them.

980
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,900
I think that's basically what we're looking at.

981
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,500
We're looking at circles squares and and these and maybe I don't know

982
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
if we want rounded rectangles as well.

983
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't know.

984
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,000
We might, like rounded things that are kind of rounded as well.

985
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,500
I'm not sure.

986
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,300
I'm not sure we will see, but circles and squares will probably be our

987
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,900
Target for now.

988
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,700
So we'll try to do a circles and squares one, and then we'll go from

989
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,000
there.

990
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,600
I think that pretty much brings us to the end of the stream.

991
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,800
It's a short stream of

992
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,600
Bit today because we were chatting a little too much at the beginning.

993
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,800
Everyone was gabbing but that's a good place to stop anyway, because

994
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,900
tomorrow we can write the new College of detector.

995
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,600
And, and so that'll be kind of nice to have the explanation and the

996
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,700
implementation in one day, or at least the start of the implementation

997
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,400
in one day.

998
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,800
Okay.

999
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,900
So let's go to the the questions.

1000
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,100
Now, I will start the little thing here.

1001
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,900
So please, if you have questions put

1002
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,200
A q: in front of them and try to keep them things we've done today

1003
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,300
stream, or on previous streams.

1004
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,000
If you want to ask off-topic questions, come about 15 minutes before

1005
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,600
the scheduled start time, and I'll take off topic questions.

1006
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,200
Then I don't take off topic questions now.

1007
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,000
Can you change the Whiteboard color to Black and use a light colored

1008
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,800
pencil color switching from emacs to the Whiteboard is jarring.

1009
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:07,900
It's true, that that's not really the same color scheme, as it's

1010
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,800
definitely different.

1011
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,400
I don't know.

1012
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,700
How that would look exactly.

1013
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,400
I guess we would do something.

1014
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,500
How do I does this have a universal eyedropper?

1015
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,000
Well, we could do something like this.

1016
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,700
Where is my color cop?

1017
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,700
There's my color cop.

1018
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,000
We could do something like this, where we grab out.

1019
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,800
You know, whatever this color.

1020
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,300
Is he there?

1021
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,500
Here we go.

1022
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,800
So, we grabbed out that color and we could say, okay, the color here.

1023
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,700
Do you have, how do I just imput a color people?

1024
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Where is that at?

1025
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,000
I don't want an advanced color selector.

1026
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,300
I just want, I just want to color selector.

1027
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,500
How do I just type in a color value?

1028
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,500
Seriously, is this where we're at here?

1029
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,300
You won't let me type in a color, will you?

1030
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,900
Alright, nevermind.

1031
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,400
Then I have no idea.

1032
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,500
Like, where are the colors?

1033
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,500
Is these, the colors?

1034
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,700
There they are.

1035
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,300
Okay.

1036
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:27,700
So if I want to add this in its 2051 7125 and we'll make that be our

1037
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,600
foreground color.

1038
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,200
And then our background color is that.

1039
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,400
So that's 22, 22, 22.

1040
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
So, there we go.

1041
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,400
And so that would look something like this.

1042
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,100
We could do that.

1043
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,500
Well, what you guys think about that and think it over?

1044
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,400
Would you give it tutorial for emacs?

1045
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
There already is one.

1046
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,100
Take a look at the episode guide on.

1047
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,100
If you go to him a hero hero dot-org, if you click on the news and

1048
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,600
forums link, there's an episode guide on there and they're already has

1049
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,600
a tutorial for you Max.

1050
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,000
Do you plan on getting into using calculus to get better, Collision

1051
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,600
detection?

1052
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,700
Or is that too?

1053
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,600
You don't really need calculus to get better.

1054
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,700
Collision detection will be doing better Solutions.

1055
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,400
Action will be doing basically perfect Collision detection.

1056
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,100
I mean, perfect is a tough word to use but will be doing Collision

1057
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:49,500
detection.

1058
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,500
That is

1059
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,600
As shippable as any Collision detection, that ships in a game, but

1060
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
without really doing any calculus at all.

1061
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,500
So you do need Cactus for some things are just not that.

1062
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,800
Do you ever feel it necessary to prototype different aspects of your

1063
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,000
game?

1064
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,300
Like, ocean protection with different methods in other languages?

1065
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,700
Would you always do everything in the language that you're writing the

1066
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,100
game in?

1067
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,400
I always do it in the language.

1068
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,200
I'm running the game in.

1069
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,300
Wow, everyone is in favor of the colors, unanimously.

1070
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,400
That's crazy.

1071
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,300
Wow.

1072
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,800
Zoinks.

1073
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,200
If we change the resolution on with your handmade, well the tiles, in

1074
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,000
the bitmap, still draw the same but smaller bigger versions of them

1075
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
with the same settings.

1076
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,700
So right now we don't have any bitmap scaling code.

1077
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,800
So the bitmaps always draw a pixel to pixel.

1078
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,800
So if you change the resolution, they'll change size.

1079
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:08,500
And that is one good reason, for example why we would want our or

1080
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,400
potentially at least want our render to be able to handle things like

1081
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,600
that.

1082
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,100
At least in the final stages where it could blow the bitmap out to a

1083
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,700
bigger size.

1084
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,600
So it always.

1085
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,900
So it's not dependent on the resolution and so on.

1086
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,700
Can you do Collision detection based on if a pixel in a bitmap has

1087
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,300
Alpha?

1088
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,800
Yeah, you can.

1089
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,400
But you can't do it continuously.

1090
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,700
I mean you sort of could do it continuously, but you can't really do

1091
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:37,900
it.

1092
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,800
Very efficiently with a non tunneling based stuff.

1093
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,500
So you try not to do that.

1094
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:51,100
If you can avoid it, like basically the problem is and let's will use

1095
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,300
the new colors.

1096
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,900
So what the problem is.

1097
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,600
Is analytically like we already did this even just in our simple one,

1098
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,200
right?

1099
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,000
We were able to take a Time step from here to here and figure out

1100
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,500
whether we hit the wall at any time during that time step, right?

1101
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,600
There's no way to do that.

1102
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,100
If we have to check the pixels of the bitmap.

1103
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:21,500
And the reason for that is because that creates some kind of a of a

1104
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,700
that would basically create tons of little moving, rectangles, right?

1105
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,700
That are all the rectangles that are set in the bitmap and we'd have

1106
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,500
to check it that way to really do that full thing.

1107
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,800
And so what you would do if you were going to do that, right?

1108
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,400
Is you wouldn't want to do it that way.

1109
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,600
That right.

1110
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,900
What you'd want to do is take a look at the bitmap and let's say that

1111
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,000
this is the bitmap that we're talking about.

1112
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,600
So, for some reason, don't ask me why.

1113
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,700
It looks like this.

1114
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,200
Right.

1115
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,900
What you wouldn't want to do is actually take all of the things that

1116
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:08,200
have Alpha set and actually test all of those swept things versus

1117
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,600
every other.

1118
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,800
Swept, the Emmy be a nightmare.

1119
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,300
Right?

1120
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
What you would want to do.

1121
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,400
First of all is you'd want to say, well, this guy for the motion that

1122
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,700
direction we're going is always going to be behind this guy, right?

1123
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,000
And this guy is always going to be behind these guys, right?

1124
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,400
So I don't need to sweep anything, but the exterior of the thing, and

1125
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,800
I only need to sweep the exterior in the direction that we're going.

1126
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,100
And quickly what you would find when you started to work on this is

1127
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,400
that well, it would really just be way more efficient that no matter

1128
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,200
what, you know, crazy thing.

1129
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,600
My guy looks like, right?

1130
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Like, he's some snowman, weird thing, or whatever.

1131
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,500
What I'd really rather do is just put some polygons in here that very

1132
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,400
closely approximate the dude, right?

1133
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,700
And then just use the edges of the polygons instead of using each

1134
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,600
individual pixel.

1135
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,100
Because otherwise you're just going to drown in computation.

1136
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,200
And this is basically as good because it can be pretty close.

1137
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,900
And you can always.

1138
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,000
Make the polygon pretty detailed if you need to be.

1139
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,700
But at least then you're only checking like you're checking some

1140
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,700
version of it.

1141
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,300
That's not literally looking at every little pixel because that's just

1142
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,300
going to be way too slow.

1143
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,600
If you actually don't want a tunnel.

1144
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,700
It's interesting to have a tutorial on floating-point peculiarities.

1145
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,400
Probably it would be but I'm not the guy to give it.

1146
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,100
Like basically, I'm not super knowledgeable about floating-point

1147
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,900
computation.

1148
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,500
Like I'm Oka passable at it, but I'm just not.

1149
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,100
I wouldn't give a very good tutorial.

1150
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,400
Like basically, the way you see me working around it on the stream

1151
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,900
will be, basically, the all that I know is really how to do, you know,

1152
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,000
so we'll cover it when I do workarounds for stuff, but I don't really

1153
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,600
know.

1154
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,200
I'm not very good at that.

1155
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,400
So,

1156
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,400
I'm the wrong guy to give that tutorial.

1157
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,200
I missed parts of the stream.

1158
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,800
But in the last episode, you added the new Collision system and remove

1159
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,300
the old one.

1160
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,100
Why not use the old one.

1161
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,400
And just use the new ft thing to get the new point.

1162
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,700
If and only, if the old system director Collision because I want to

1163
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,700
move to a system that's actually not using the tile map anymore.

1164
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,000
Eventually, right?

1165
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,300
I want to basically do an object-based Collision system.

1166
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,000
So we're going to have stuff like, you know, I think our tilemap will

1167
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,500
basically have a bunch of stuff in it.

1168
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,700
Like, you know, trees with little Collision volumes at the basis of

1169
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,500
them or whatever.

1170
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,100
And I want to collide against those potentially, like, I don't know

1171
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,400
what I'm going.

1172
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,700
I want to do but I don't I don't want to actually do tile map.

1173
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,300
Basically Asian.

1174
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,400
I want to just do like polygonal and circular base Collision so that I

1175
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,500
have more flexibility with with what the maps look like.

1176
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:49,100
And so I'm not really interested in using the old version.

1177
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,600
so I think, wow, not many questions today looks like

1178
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,700
Oh, and what about the tiles?

1179
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,600
Will they still draw the same across the screen with a different

1180
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,100
resolution?

1181
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,300
For example, we have nine by 17 tiles across and if we switch the

1182
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:18,300
resolution that would be like 17 by nine tile-based.

1183
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,800
We have any bugs and how to fix that.

1184
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,400
So I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.

1185
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,700
But basically, the idea is the game screen will always be the same.

1186
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,800
And so, the right now we don't have the ability to

1187
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,100
So, okay, we'll talk about two things.

1188
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,400
So first of all, we're a bitmap game.

1189
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,600
So we probably want to run in our native resolution most of the time

1190
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:48,300
so we probably want to run in 1920 by 1080 all the time, right?

1191
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,700
That's probably what we will do.

1192
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:55,800
And so what we'll probably do is we'll draw in 1920 by 1080 and we

1193
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,000
might also support downscaling by 2.

1194
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,800
So we might also support running.

1195
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,800
In a half mode where we're running half of that and where we actually

1196
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,700
have our bitmaps pre-processed so that they're all half size and that

1197
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,000
would be to support like Raspberry Pi and stuff.

1198
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,900
If it's too slow or actually more to the point for the Raspberry Pi to

1199
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,500
little memory potentially as well.

1200
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,300
So basically what we will do is we will have a 1920 by 1080 buffer

1201
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,100
where our tiles are lined up the way that we want them, right?

1202
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,900
We will draw to it and then no.

1203
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,800
Matter what the ending resolution is, we will blit that up to that

1204
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,400
resolution, right?

1205
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,700
Because we don't want to resize every individual thing because that

1206
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,800
just waste a lot of time.

1207
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,500
And we'll look worse than if we just actually do the whole composite

1208
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,700
and then scale it up at the end and or down depending on the

1209
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,900
circumstance, right?

1210
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,200
What is dynamic loading?

1211
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,300
I thought see was compiled a need to be recompiled to update the code.

1212
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,400
No, that's I mean c does have is a compiled language, but that doesn't

1213
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,100
mean that you have to not have Dynamic loading.

1214
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:07,900
So we just implemented.

1215
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,600
Dynamic loading.

1216
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,000
You can go back and watch it, the episode where I implemented that we

1217
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,700
basically just embedded system where you can recompile without exiting

1218
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,100
the game.

1219
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:27,700
So yeah.

1220
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,900
Any more on topic questions.

1221
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,700
Does anyone have any more on topic questions?

1222
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,200
I'm guessing the answer is no.

1223
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,700
I'm guessing that the answer is no.

1224
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,900
And it looks like it's true.

1225
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,500
There are no more questions.

1226
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,800
Although I always I don't know how long the lag is when I said, say,

1227
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,100
are there any more questions?

1228
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,600
I don't know.

1229
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,900
When you guys actually hear the fact that I just said, I don't know if

1230
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,300
there are any more questions like, it could be 30 seconds.

1231
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,700
It could be a minute.

1232
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I have no idea.

1233
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,400
But yeah.

1234
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,000
All right.

1235
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,100
Well, then I guess we all get to get to go home early today.

1236
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,400
That's some, that's some seriously, you know, I'm gonna go make some

1237
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,700
more tea, That's what I'm gonna do.

1238
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,200
So, I certainly hope that all of you will think about Collision

1239
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,900
detection and dream about closures action while you're, you know,

1240
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,200
sleeping tonight and what we're going to do tomorrow.

1241
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,300
And so we'll come back tomorrow and we will right away to don't want

1242
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,100
to actually delete this.

1243
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm going to leave it here.

1244
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,700
Can I save, can I now that we've made our settings here?

1245
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,300
Can I save that?

1246
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,100
Setting it all.

1247
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,400
I don't know if we can save like our foreground and background color.

1248
00:56:59,400 --> 00:56:59,800
Let's do it.

1249
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,700
Vaz and I'll just make a desktop thing.

1250
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,000
That's like handmade here.

1251
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,400
O.K.

1252
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,300
Are a, let's find out.

1253
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,900
You ready for this?

1254
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,500
You guys ready?

1255
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,200
I don't know if you are not but doing it anyway.

1256
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,000
Wait for it.

1257
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:28,100
wait for it, and

1258
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,700
Nope, the answer is no.

1259
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,600
So that's a little bit below that down.

1260
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,600
Yeah, it was exciting for a minute.

1261
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,000
It's true, but then it all went to Pieces.

1262
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:48,300
So I guess we're going to have to do apparently is we're going to have

1263
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,200
to do that.

1264
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,000
And then we're going to have to do, where is my color cop?

1265
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,800
We're going to have to do the old.

1266
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,300
Let's see.

1267
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
We're going to have to do the old.

1268
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,300
Color swatch up in the corner.

1269
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:12,600
Trick.

1270
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,400
All right, and then we'll save it and then I'll grab it from there.

1271
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,200
When we reload.

1272
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,800
Thanks carita for not saving anything, with the file.

1273
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,600
You certainly wouldn't want your foreground and background colors

1274
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,000
possessed.

1275
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
All right, everyone.

1276
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,300
Thank you very much for joining me for another episode of handmade

1277
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:30,700
hero.

1278
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,600
We have gotten to the end of our crappy Collision detection.

1279
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,100
And so tomorrow, it's ready.

1280
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,200
It's time to start on some good Collision detection.

1281
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,900
I certainly hope to join me, same time.

1282
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,000
Same place 8:00 p.m.

1283
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,900
Pacific Standard Time.

1284
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,900
Are on Twitch, and we will be talking among among other things about

1285
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,800
our friend, Mankowski, and why you should get to know him because he

1286
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,600
makes your Collision detection life, much, much easier than it would.

1287
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,000
Otherwise be if you want to follow along at home and you have not

1288
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,100
already pre-ordered, the game.

1289
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,700
You can pre-order the game on him, a here at Oregon, get all the

1290
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,300
source code.

1291
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,900
That is a good thing to have.

1292
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,900
If you want to play around at home.

1293
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,200
You can do that right here.

1294
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,100
If you want Sports video series, you can go to our patreon page, which

1295
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,000
is like to hear.

1296
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,100
If you want to learn about the series, you can go to our Resource page

1297
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,700
news in forums, all kinds of good stuff schedule, episode guide catch

1298
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,700
up on past episodes coding resources, which has ports to Mac and Linux

1299
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,200
and stuff like that and code discussion where you can ask questions.

1300
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,800
Like nice little Forum, you can go to and check it out.

1301
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,800
So okay, that is about it.

1302
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,000
I highly recommend checking out all that fun stuff.

1303
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,100
In the meantime, have an excellent Thursday, and I will see you

1304
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,700
tomorrow night.

1305
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,400
Thanks, everyone.
