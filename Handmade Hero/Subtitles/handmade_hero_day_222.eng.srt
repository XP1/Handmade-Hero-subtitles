00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,500
Here are the show that where we code a complete game live on stream

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,200
and I was kind of enjoying making the cut scene yesterday.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,600
And so I kind of want to make the rest of the cutscenes and so I'm

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,100
just going to do that today is day 2 22.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,900
So if you're trying to follow along at home, you want to unpack day,

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,000
221 source code and you want to make sure you have the our pack

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,900
because when we're doing stuff like cutscenes, you got to have the our

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,400
packs and make sure you download it that I showed how to download it

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,200
or rather to unpack it yesterday.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,100
But if you remember yesterday, we started a kind of explain the basics

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,400
of making a multi-layer cutscene, and we went ahead and made this one.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,200
Right here and you can kind of see it's looking pretty cool, actually,

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I think there's some things we might want to adjust about it.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Certainly it's, you know, there's a little if you just want to make,

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,700
but it's looking really nice and it's got that kind of nice depth to

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,000
it.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,500
I really like, the way it's starting to come out.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,700
So what I'd like to do is just go through the rest of the cutscenes

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,700
and get all of the cut scenes working essentially, the same way that

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,100
they're working right here, so that we sort of have each piece and

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,000
then we can assemble them into the

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,200
All cutscene, once we have each one kind of tune and there's stuff

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,600
that I, we can do after that, that, you know, to kind of to kind of

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,100
pull things together in a more coherent way more usable way.

26
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,100
So, we might even want to do a little bit of that today.

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,500
But so if you take a look at what we've got here, you can kind of see

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,600
this.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,800
This stuff is really pretty generic, right?

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,900
Like we haven't really done anything.

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,700
That's all.

32
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,600
That's if the cutscene all we really need to do is just make this sort

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,200
of information here where it says, kind of like how many layers there

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,100
are and how they're supposed to.

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,100
To work, we could even do something like this, where we just say, like

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,600
layer count, right?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
And the layer count is eight.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,500
And then in here, we could say, oh, layer count.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,900
You know?

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
And, and that's now pretty generic.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,400
We're basically just taking this layer placement thing and the shot

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,100
index write this.

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,700
In fact, this right here is essentially the entire data for, you know,

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
for the cutscene right.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
That's all we need.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,699
So if we wanted to, we could easily make this a separate thing.

47
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,800
In fact, I guess now that I think about it really there's not much

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,700
reason not to

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,300
you can imagine us doing something like this where we just have, you

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,200
know, a thing called a cutscene or just, you know, am maybe a layered

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
scenes like that, that

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,900
And we could just have this stuff in here, going to say, all right,

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
how many layers are there?

54
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,100
You know, what's the shot index?

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,700
We could even have something in here, where you know, if we take a

56
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,700
look at the file formats, the assets, we've got this asset type ID, we

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,200
could even say what the asset type ID was, right?

58
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,300
So we could just say the asset type, what the shot index was what the

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,700
layer count is, and then we just need a pointer to a layer placement

60
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,100
array.

61
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,100
That's got all that information in it, right?

62
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,200
Like so.

63
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,200
And that's the basis for our cutscenes.

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,800
And we may have to expand this a little bit certainly and, but

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,300
For the most part that's really all we need.

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,700
And we could also say how long the duration of this thing was supposed

67
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,000
to be would be another thing that we could do pretty easily.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, for example, we could say in here.

69
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,900
You know what?

70
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,300
We wanted.

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,500
That duration to be for now I'm going to leave it, so it's just zero

72
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,100
to five.

73
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,400
They'll all be normalized, but we could kind of play around that a

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,000
little later.

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,200
So now if we want to convert this thing so that we could actually do,

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,200
you know that particular thing we could say that we wanted to do like,

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
you know, render layered scene or something like that.

78
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,300
We could take whichever layered scene.

79
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,200
We were talking about

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,500
And then we could take whatever the T, normal was like, whatever the

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,100
you know, this value was because that's really all we need.

82
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh and there's some things, there are some other things that we could

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,700
prioritize right that camera start and end that was another thing as

84
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,000
well.

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,600
So I'm going to go ahead and grab this stuff here.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm going to go ahead and pull that out like so and now we've got a

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,300
thing that renders that layered scene, right?

88
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
And so if I want to I can make this guy do that right here I can just

89
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
say, Okay render layered scene

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,900
And all I need to do here is make sure that I passed the stuff that we

91
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,800
might need, right?

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,000
So it's going to be the assets, couldn't either render group.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
It's going to need.

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,700
I fact I think it probably pretty much just needs everything that we

95
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,000
originally had but instead of the tea cutscene is now going to be

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,800
giving us some kind of a normalized, some kind of a normalized thing.

97
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,300
All right, so that's just this right, like that.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
And so, all we need now is to actually Define that layered scene.

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,400
And so this stuff here is what we would have been defining the layered

100
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,800
scene.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,700
Right?

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,300
And so I can go ahead and grab that out and I can put it here right?

103
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,600
And I can then I wish I fix that Emax indentation thing but what do

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
you do anyway so I've got a layered see now.

105
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,600
That I can to find here's the scene we're going to render so I can

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
pass that along.

107
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,300
Like so and into that I'm just going to put all the information that

108
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,100
we had, right.

109
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,400
We know the layer count actually just do it like this we know the

110
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
layer count is eight.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,900
We know the shot index is 1, we know the asset type right, the asset

112
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,300
type is just this guy here opening cutscene.

113
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,800
So we can we can fill that in a second, right?

114
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,700
That's this guy here.

115
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
And so that's pretty much everything then we just need the layer

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,100
placement, right?

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,000
Equals layer placement.

118
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,900
Like so and that's pretty much it for defining a scene.

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,100
So then I'll need to do is up here.

120
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,700
Every time we were going to look for stuff.

121
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,700
We start to use that.

122
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,800
Now, these two guys like I said, we hadn't defined yet.

123
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,000
So let's go ahead and put them in there, will do camera, start camera.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,700
And that way, these guys can be in there as well and so we can just do

125
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,500
something like this camera, start.

126
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,200
I put that down here.

127
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,200
Let's see.

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,400
Seem camera start.

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Will slow on the typing today.

130
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Some reason and seen camera, and I'll grab that guy.

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,900
And again this is just you know I've said it a million times this is

132
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,900
just exactly the way that I normally program things when I know the

133
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,100
the fundamental thing I'm trying to do.

134
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,200
I just write it which was what we did yesterday and then I just look

135
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,000
at the stuff that's going to get you know, that I want to use again

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,200
and I just pull it out, right?

137
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,500
And it's the easiest way to do it.

138
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
It prevents all of that, sort of design, paralysis up front and the

139
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,100
whole like going back and forth on things that really don't matter and

140
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
that don't match the problem.

141
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,600
Well, you just solve the problem and then you generalize from that

142
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
rather than the other way around, always the best way to go.

143
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,100
If you know how to do one solution, right?

144
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,500
If you know how to do one cut scene, you could just get in there and

145
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,400
code, it just code that one cutscene.

146
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,300
And then all of the things that you then needed, for the overall

147
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,900
design will just come out.

148
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,300
If you don't know how to do one cut scene, obviously, that's not going

149
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:52,600
to work.

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,100
But when you have a situation where, you know, that that one part of

151
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,500
it, you pull out from there and that's always the easiest way to

152
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,400
design from that, from that point.

153
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Okay, so anyway, we come through here, we've got our

154
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,000
are all this stuff is going to be exactly the same, right?

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,900
Nothing weird is going on there.

156
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,800
We pass in the teen normal so that's all good.

157
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,300
All of this stuff is going to be the same only.

158
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,900
Now we're getting that shot index for getting that out of the scene,

159
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,500
same with the layer cap getting that out of seen, same with the asset

160
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,700
ID, right?

161
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,800
So this is the asset type.

162
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,200
That's really it.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,500
And so now I just gotta clean up couple things are m, 2 pixels.

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Yeah, this stuff.

165
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,200
This is some stuff again that really needs to get.

166
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,700
I think cleaned up a little bit but it's you know, it's fine for now,

167
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,700
but I feel like we want 20 more coherent idea of what's going on

168
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,000
there.

169
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,700
But anyway, so let's see here, we've got signed unsigned problem.

170
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,400
You're right.

171
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,500
These should be you 32 certainly, here we go.

172
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,900
Layer placement is going to be off of a scene now and

173
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,200
That looks like that's just about it now distance above ground.

174
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
So this is a little bit tricky, right?

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So this is kind of a problem because we need to know for this guy.

176
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,600
We don't really have any way of specifying, what's going on with his,

177
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,600
the fact that he's kind of special that he doesn't move at all, right?

178
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,700
And we could just move him way back, but it's kind of a special thing

179
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,000
that we want to remember about these.

180
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,300
And so what I want to do is I want to just go ahead because there

181
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
might be other things like that.

182
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,900
Like if we if there's other things especially

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
All things about a layer.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,400
We may want to start, you know, we might want to start

185
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,900
Having more extra cipa, deeper layer, right?

186
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,299
So instead of just packing into a V for let's actually say, here is

187
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,700
the P of the layer, right?

188
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,200
Here's the height of the layer, right?

189
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,600
So now that's explicit instead of that sort of, you know, implicit

190
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
Vector for thing, we were doing there.

191
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,600
And then, we can also think that we can do here which is like add

192
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,700
infinity or something like that, right?

193
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:58,100
So we can just say where we expect that thing to be right and we can

194
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,400
say, you know, move that Tiffany.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,300
I think I want to do something more like this actually, so we can make

196
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,700
it flag.

197
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,000
So you can layer flags and I'll show you why that is seen layer flag.

198
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,600
At Infinity again.

199
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,300
I said very slow.

200
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,900
I'm typing today.

201
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,300
For some reason you never know.

202
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,200
Some of you have a slow typing day so this is actually going to be

203
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,900
Flags.

204
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,000
Like so.

205
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,200
And so, what I want to do there is I want to now expand this notion

206
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
just a little bit, right?

207
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,000
So now we're going to do is going to say, okay, this is a scene layer

208
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,300
and here is our layers, right?

209
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,600
Then.

210
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,900
This becomes instead of layer placement, this is just layers.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,100
It's not really placement of the layers anymore, it's more than just

212
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,800
just it's more than that, right?

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And so now we got that all good.

214
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,400
We'll go say it's seen layer layer equals seen layers 60.

215
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,300
In fact, I guess I could just grab it out, like so.

216
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Okay, so we grabbed out that layer.

217
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,400
Now, the layer itself, we can say, it's got the layer P, right?

218
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,800
And that's good.

219
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
Now, we can sort of grab those out, more explicitly, you can see what

220
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,600
thereat.

221
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,100
We don't have to do like placement dot w, which is kind of confusing

222
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
with what's going on there.

223
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,400
Right now, this is a little clearer what's happening.

224
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,700
And so now what we want to do is say well okay the P which we're going

225
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
to do it is going to be the layer P, but now we're going to check

226
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,900
those flags, right?

227
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,400
So if those flags indicate to us that it's supposed to be at Infinity,

228
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,500
we might do something else, right?

229
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,200
So basically

230
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,600
We come up here.

231
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,500
We say, if somebody said this is this is at Infinity.

232
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
Meaning it's infinitely, I like an affinity.

233
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,000
But what is that?

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What is in Affinity?

235
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,400
Don't ask me, I just made it up.

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,400
So anyway, if it's at Infinity, we're going to take that pz and we're

237
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,500
going to add distance above ground to it.

238
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,800
So that it's always relative to distance above ground so that way we

239
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,500
can just make that be - 200, right?

240
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
But we can add distance above ground to it.

241
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,400
Dynamically.

242
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,800
So we can say, oh, okay, this guy.

243
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,400
He's actually going to be ad Infiniti, right?

244
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,400
Seen their flag at infinity and so now all I have to do is just re

245
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,500
bracket these guys.

246
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,000
You know what, just because we can, we might even use a little bit of

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,700
a macro for that, right?

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,500
Because I don't know.

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,600
It's just why not use a macro for that?

250
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,500
Kind of ridiculous, totally unnecessary.

251
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,800
Did it anyway?

252
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,700
Just did it anyway.

253
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,800
All right.

254
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,900
And so these are going to be seen layers now.

255
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
And hopefully that will give us.

256
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,400
Well we really try to do here is get our seen back, right?

257
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,200
So there it is.

258
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
And everything looks the same as it did, which is exactly what we

259
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,700
want.

260
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
And so now we can just start working on other scenes.

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,700
Now we can just say, all right let's go ahead and change with

262
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,700
sinesses, you know, you render, you know, use it.

263
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,100
Use the exact code that we have to just render another cutscene.

264
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,100
And that way, we know that we can just reuse, you know, all that code

265
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
that we did, we don't have to write it another time.

266
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,400
Alright, so let's go ahead and start.

267
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,800
We're going to do it.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Back to the same way as we did.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,100
Last time, I'm going to go ahead and make this guy.

270
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,500
Down here.

271
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,900
So let's go ahead and and switch to handmade cutscene do.

272
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,600
There's a dot h, I guess there is a dot h.

273
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, if there's a handmade cutscene .h, might as well put this stuff

274
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,500
in it.

275
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,800
I didn't know, I don't remember making one of those but I guess we

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,300
did.

277
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,200
So there it is.

278
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,300
Happy birthday.

279
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,500
We now have handmade cutscene dot h and made cutscene .h.

280
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,300
Wonderful.

281
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Wonderful, who knew who knew indeed, okay?

282
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,200
So now we can just go ahead and make that full screen.

283
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,400
We can see our cutscene and now we can edit our cutscenes, just like

284
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,300
we were doing before and and off we go.

285
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,100
So inside render cutscene all I'm going to do here is just make a

286
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,500
different cut scene like I said before.

287
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,700
Really pretty.

288
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,400
Pretty basic.

289
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,800
Nothing.

290
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,200
Nothing.

291
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,800
Strange gone.

292
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,100
You're so, I'm just going to take this part of it.

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,300
And I'm going to grab this and make a new one, right?

294
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,600
So now we basically have okay, note Casey, this is shots one.

295
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,000
Then we come down here, this is going to be shot too.

296
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,600
Okay.

297
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,100
And then if I just do if I just run this again in theory, I guess you

298
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,500
know what should probably do is this

299
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,200
Stand up, racket those up.

300
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,600
So don't conflict with each other.

301
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,100
Now we're technically rendering the second one.

302
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,800
We just haven't changed it at all yet, right?

303
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,900
Oh, and of course emacs decides to helpfully indent that wrong.

304
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
So that's always good.

305
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,900
Just want a little you know, always want intends to be wrong certainly

306
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,000
when want them to correct.

307
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,100
So in here we've got shot too.

308
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,300
So now I'm going to switch to shop to and we're going to do exactly

309
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,200
the thing that we did before.

310
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,900
We're just going to look at those layers individually so I can see

311
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,600
what they are.

312
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,000
So here is

313
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,300
Our first layer and I don't really know what our camera motion is

314
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,800
necessarily going to be on this one, right?

315
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm going to remove that an Infinity Flex.

316
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,300
Don't think there are any layers that Infinity on this one.

317
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,700
They're all going to move through.

318
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,400
But I'm going to stop the camera.

319
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm going to take the camera motion and make that not happen yet,

320
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,300
right?

321
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,100
You know what I should do to now I'm thinking about it.

322
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,100
I might if zero this guy out for one second because I feel like the Z

323
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,000
is also something we would want to do.

324
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,600
So we kind of baked the Z in here, right?

325
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,700
I'm going to, I'm going to switch this back to full screen for just

326
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,600
one second so you can see what I'm talking about.

327
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,000
So if you take a look at what happened here, we had distance above

328
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,200
ground, equals 10, minus t normal, 5.0 or whatever, right?

329
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,100
That seems like, potentially a bad idea because this is now hard

330
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,700
coded.

331
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,100
And what we really want is we want

332
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,500
Want that to be sort of, part of the whole camera move.

333
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,400
So I think what we'd rather do is this right?

334
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,400
Which create a stops it from moving at all in the Z direction, right?

335
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,900
And then we'd want to encode that in the camera, start end, right?

336
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,000
So we want the camera to move from 0 to negative 5 or whatever, right?

337
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,800
And furthermore we probably want this distance.

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,700
Ground thing we want distance above ground to not have anything else

339
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,300
encoded with it.

340
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
So we'd probably want to do it more like okay.

341
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,100
It goes from 10:00 to 5:00, right?

342
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,900
So we're just we're just putting in exactly what that motion used to

343
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,800
be then distance above ground, can now be encoded as the Z part of

344
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,200
this, right?

345
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,400
In fact, we wouldn't even really need to do just change this above

346
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,100
ground at all.

347
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,200
This is about ground, can presumably just be 0.

348
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,200
I think and it wouldn't matter at all, right.

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,800
So distance above ground when we put that there.

350
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,800
Now, pz is just going to be whatever the cameras e was.

351
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,300
So it's cameras, the offset, like so, and I think that should return

352
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,800
us to what we were at before, right?

353
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,100
So now everything's just baked into the camera movement.

354
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
The distance above ground is just a meaningful meaningless value.

355
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,600
We don't even ever look at it's because that's just an offset that

356
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,100
gets implied in the inside the renderer for us.

357
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,600
We don't need it because we're offsetting are older layers.

358
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,300
And so now we're back to where we were now that it gives us full

359
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,900
freedom to control, each individual, cutscenes camera.

360
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,200
Using those two variables, which is more what we want, right?

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,600
So here we go.

362
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,700
We're back to see sha-2.

363
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Now here's our first layer and it's not moving at all.

364
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,100
Obviously it's not moving because we're not actually moving the

365
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,600
camera.

366
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,900
And so for this scene I think this is going to be another slow Zoom.

367
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,100
So this one we could we could go ahead and say like went from zero to

368
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,400
negative 5, right?

369
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,300
So it could be another slow.

370
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,600
Zoom.

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Kind of like that.

372
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,800
Maybe it's zooms a little bit more.

373
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,200
I don't know.

374
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,700
We'll see.

375
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,600
But that's going to depend on how close all the layers are certainly

376
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Okay, so I don't think we need to offset this layer if I remember

377
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
correctly, and I don't know that.

378
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,400
We want it to be that far away either, so I'm not sure where we want

379
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,100
to put that layer again, maybe that layer is it - 20 feet or something

380
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,700
like that?

381
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
It's probably going to be a lot smaller that layer.

382
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:48,800
You can kind of see.

383
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,900
This is quite a big movement when you're that close in, but that is

384
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,500
sort of what this scene, this scene doesn't have very many layers, so

385
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,900
it's a very close in shot.

386
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
So let's go ahead and reduce that movement.

387
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,800
Maybe we only move about

388
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,500
And M, write something like that.

389
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,900
Maybe even less, maybe even only a half meter for Words during that

390
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,000
will see like what we want that to be.

391
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,300
We could also extend the amount of time that it would go over, right?

392
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
The other thing that we're not really doing right now is we're yeah,

393
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,900
we're not really doing time.

394
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,500
And so that's again, another tuning thing that we're probably do a

395
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,000
little bit later.

396
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,700
After we make all this stuff, be what we want.

397
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So if we assume that it was 20 meters away that that even still seems

398
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,600
like probably a long distance but I don't know, maybe it's not too

399
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,800
bad.

400
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,200
Dad.

401
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
So if we just go ahead and adjust this up to the point where it's

402
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,100
going to be sort of what we wanted.

403
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,800
That looks a little bit more correct and we'll see what happens when

404
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,900
we when we drop into the lair.

405
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,700
So let's drop it.

406
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,200
Another layer here that layer again is going to have to be in front of

407
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
the of the little kid.

408
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,100
Right?

409
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,400
Like so something like that.

410
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,600
And yeah, probably have to off the set though slightly and then I

411
00:17:59,600 --> 00:17:59,800
don't.

412
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
Member what we've got four, other layers here.

413
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,700
I think not that much.

414
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,900
Let's see what we have.

415
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't know if there's another layer or not.

416
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,200
I don't remember.

417
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,600
I think there's an icicle Slayer.

418
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,300
Yeah.

419
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,400
There's some icicles there.

420
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,600
So those are, let's see what those look like.

421
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,400
You kind of see those up at the top.

422
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,300
So those are probably supposed to be like much closer to us, you know,

423
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,000
that sort of thing.

424
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,500
So you kind of get a little more depth on them.

425
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,600
Let's move them, even closer.

426
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,100
Just so you get a lot.

427
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,700
I want to get a lot of motion on those.

428
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,700
Right?

429
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
So there maybe eight.

430
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,300
Yeah, something like that and so that's going to need to be moved up a

431
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,000
little bit.

432
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,100
I also to kind of put them in the right position.

433
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, that's starting to be a little more like it.

434
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,500
I don't think there's a fourth layer, pretty sure there isn't.

435
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Yeah, so there's no fourth layer.

436
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,800
So that's really all we're looking at for this particular scene.

437
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,700
So now, let's try to work out that Parallax a little bit better and

438
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,900
get sort of where everything is supposed to be lining up a little bit

439
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,400
better.

440
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,400
I want to see.

441
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Let me just see where we're at with this guy.

442
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,100
All right.

443
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,400
Yeah, so I think we want a little more of a parallax effect on that

444
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,000
window.

445
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,800
So I kind of want the window to be like closer, you know, just closer

446
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,500
than it is.

447
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,200
So I'm going to, I'm going to really drop that down quite a bit.

448
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's see here to maybe something like this.

449
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,500
That's looking definitely better but I think maybe we want to drop the

450
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,700
kid back a bit as well.

451
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,300
Right.

452
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,700
And so now we could just kind of aligned him a little bit differently,

453
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I think in that might be okay, right?

454
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Some just want a little more centered in the window.

455
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,200
Yeah.

456
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Yeah, and then a little lower too.

457
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,300
I think something more like that.

458
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,800
That's starting to be starting to be a little bit closer.

459
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,300
He might still be a little too far away, just thinking.

460
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,600
It's hard to say hard to say.

461
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,000
That may be about, right?

462
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,500
So with that, I think that's roughly correct.

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,500
And so, what I want to do now is make sure that the camera again just

464
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,200
like we did before, is zooming in on him.

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,600
And so that we get, you know, a clear sense of motion towards where

466
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,900
the kid actually, is, that makes sense.

467
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,900
So, a little bit down.

468
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
Thinking maybe that sort of thing.

469
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,700
That's feeling pretty good.

470
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,700
We think of that.

471
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,900
I like that.

472
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,000
Now, I feel like there were also supposed to be some snowflakes.

473
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,500
I may have forgotten to include the snowflakes in the art pack my

474
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,300
mistake.

475
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,600
That was my mistake.

476
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,900
So, we may have to, I may have to ship snowflakes at some other point

477
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,200
in time because we were going to maybe add some snowflakes slowing

478
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,700
down here.

479
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
But again, that's sort of separate from the way we're doing these

480
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,400
cutscenes.

481
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,600
So, we'll get all these done and then I'll see if I may have forgotten

482
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,100
snowflakes.

483
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,800
Admit that does my mistake, missing snowflakes, you know how it is?

484
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,600
Is so on and so forth.

485
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,400
Anyway so there's that cutscene I'm relatively happy with that and so

486
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
that's just again only three layers.

487
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
So that's all we need here.

488
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,200
So that is the kid and three, I guess we could call him the hero

489
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,900
because he is a hero as you know and then we have the wall the window

490
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
and then we have the icicles

491
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,400
Okay, so that's a fun cutscene, that's all good.

492
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,200
So now let's make another one.

493
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,700
Cut scene 3.

494
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Sean index and start all over again.

495
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,200
That is the outside when I should probably also do this.

496
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,200
And this cutscene, if I remember correctly, it's kind of a fun one.

497
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,100
This is going to be tricky.

498
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,400
I didn't know if this would work when I kind of suspect it out, I

499
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,800
wasn't sure if this perspective would work, I don't know.

500
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,200
And so it's basically, it's a shot that actually is meant to move like

501
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
laterally, like, I'm sorry vertically, which is kind of weird that I

502
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,600
included one vertical, run, and one horizontal run shot, which are

503
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,000
kind of like unusual.

504
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,600
They're not as common with this kind of a technique and so I don't

505
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,300
really know.

506
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,300
They're going to work or not, but you know, if they don't work,

507
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,000
there's always, you know, you typically go through a lot of revisions

508
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,100
in art stuff anyway.

509
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,900
So, you know, if we have to do some, some revisions we did than we do

510
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,300
and that's totally fine.

511
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
So let's take a look at how this is going to look here.

512
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,800
So, I'm going to go ahead and hold off on that one too much, because I

513
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,000
don't actually know how big that needs to be, so I'm going to move on

514
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,600
to

515
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,700
To, you know, these closer field ones first and then we'll see.

516
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,700
So this is basically the like sky.

517
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,700
In fact, the sky probably shouldn't move because that really is the

518
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,900
sky for reals so well.

519
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,800
Okay, but since it since the weird shot, we'll see,

520
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,500
Because since we're it since it's sort of emulating an over-the-top

521
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,600
camera move that might actually make the Sky Move, depending on how we

522
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:07,900
do it.

523
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,200
So I don't want to say that quite yet.

524
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,300
Alright, so here's the second one, there's the outdoors, the, the

525
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,500
woods there, right?

526
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,200
That's happening.

527
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,000
So let's see what happens there and this might be tricky to, I don't

528
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,400
know if this is a thing where we might have to we might need a way to

529
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,300
counter rotate to counter move people because of the fact that we're

530
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,900
supposed to be simulating a rotation.

531
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,500
And so we're going to have to have a probably in this.

532
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm kind of glad I did the flags thing.

533
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,900
We're probably going to have to do another flag.

534
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
That's like this guy is counter.

535
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,600
Moving with the cutscene.

536
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,400
You'll see what I mean in a second or at least, I hope that that you

537
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,700
will

538
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,400
So I'm going to keep adding layers there because I can't quite tell

539
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
exactly how I want this to move just yet.

540
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,800
Okay, so there's our next layer

541
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,700
Here we go.

542
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,300
Yeah.

543
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,800
So these are not basically this is not supposed to be, this is

544
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,600
supposed to be moving up.

545
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,100
I think and the boys head is supposed to be moving down so you can see

546
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,700
there's a fourth layer which is like the good put that in there which

547
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,000
is the kid.

548
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,300
There he is.

549
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,300
And so, what I want to do is I'm trying to make it, I want to make it

550
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,300
so that it's like, it's like kind of coming over the top of the head,

551
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:28,800
right?

552
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,700
It's like, it's like kind of an overshot.

553
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,500
And so, what I want to do is say, okay, the camera is kind of moving

554
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:35,900
upward.

555
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,200
So those back layers are actually, I want them to look like your comic

556
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
coming over the top.

557
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,100
So the kid's head will move correctly with the camera but the other

558
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,700
ones won't if that makes sense.

559
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,100
So, I'm going to go ahead and just add in here and I'll pop back to

560
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,300
the

561
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,900
The the regular view here.

562
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,500
I'm going to add in here another flag.

563
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,800
That's like counter why or something like this, right?

564
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,200
Like that does a counter camera motion and and maybe maybe I'll

565
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,600
actually say like counter camera just entirely.

566
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,300
I don't know if that's the right thing to do.

567
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,500
But we'll do counter camera XY or just counter camera would never do

568
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,300
captors Z but well maybe so we'll just do will do them all counter

569
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,200
camera, why look?

570
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
So we'll do it that way.

571
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,000
All right.

572
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,500
And so when we do this, this stuff in here, it's the same exact thing.

573
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,300
You can kind of see that we're doing this TV Camera offset thing.

574
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,700
So instead of doing it that way, what I'll do is I'll do them

575
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,100
individually, right?

576
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,000
So I'll do PX equals PX, minus camera offset X.

577
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
X and I'll do p y equals right?

578
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,900
Like that sort of thing.

579
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,100
And so that way, what I can do is just switch on it, I can do it the

580
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,300
same way, right?

581
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,100
I can say,

582
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,200
This.

583
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,100
Right.

584
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,000
And that way I can control whether it does counter or not.

585
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,500
And so this would be counter actually said that should be the plus

586
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,900
case and this should be the - case.

587
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,500
And then again we do the same thing for why

588
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,100
So again, nothing should change.

589
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,300
Now, if I recompile this right, if I if we build with this, nothing

590
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,700
should change or everything should change apparently what did I do

591
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,900
wrong there P?

592
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,200
Plus it's kind of camera.

593
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know what I did.

594
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,100
There shouldn't had a problem.

595
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,300
What what happened there their flags and so it should do it in either

596
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,000
case right camera offset X camera.

597
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,900
Offset y goes off at py that should have worked, oh but Z I'm not

598
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:05,400
actually doing Z and so, right, I forgot to do the Z case cameras @p Z

599
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,700
equals peasy.

600
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,500
Nice camera.

601
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,600
There we go.

602
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,100
Got to doozy.

603
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,500
Okay.

604
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,900
So let's go back to what we were doing.

605
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
So now in here, if I want to write, I should be able to say that those

606
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,300
background scenes are actually going to counter move counter, right to

607
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,900
the camera.

608
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,900
And as I said, I don't really know if this is going to work.

609
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,200
I couldn't tell you, but I'm going to try, right?

610
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,700
So, it's going to do this sort of a thing, right?

611
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,600
Can you kind of see what I'm talking about there?

612
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,300
So it's a again, like it's really tricky.

613
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,900
It's kind of a

614
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,700
Shot.

615
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,700
But we'll try to figure it out.

616
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,500
We'll see if it works and if it doesn't work then it doesn't work.

617
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,800
No big deal.

618
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,400
All right, so first of all, we're going to have the kids start

619
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,900
probably a lot lower than he starting right now.

620
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,700
He's going to be probably you know down maybe down there.

621
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,800
He's got to get all the way out of the out of the frame.

622
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,900
Really if that makes sense.

623
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,800
So he's got a kind of yeah, he's got to kind of do something more like

624
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,900
that and we probably need maybe the camera to move.

625
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,300
Move a little bit further than it does because maybe the shot is like

626
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,000
a bit longer.

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,300
Let's say, yeah, but that's that's actually that's already starting to

628
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,300
look roughly like what?

629
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:21,800
I wanted.

630
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,400
So I think we're going to be okay, I think we're probably going to be

631
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,700
okay.

632
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,500
Now that that background there is got to be a lot bigger obviously so

633
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,300
you know that things got to be I don't know probably like way bigger

634
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,800
than it is right now.

635
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,300
It's got to be like this sort of a thing, right?

636
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,500
Probably well, maybe not quite that much.

637
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,500
Let's try to try to get that back down to, oops, something reasonable.

638
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,300
What did I do wrong?

639
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,100
That's 22.

640
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,800
That's 25.

641
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,200
All right, so that looks like roughly what we would need and I want it

642
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,400
to be able to pan all the way down so that you kind of see it.

643
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,500
So again that the distance of panning there, it's going to have to be

644
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,300
pretty, you know, if that's only going a meter up than I guess, it's

645
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,000
just means that the scene does that mean that this was actually just a

646
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,800
lot closer.

647
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,300
I guess it means it's a lot closer.

648
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,100
So these guys are definitely in you know a lot more than they would

649
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,300
have been otherwise, right.

650
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,300
So it's like a four and a the you know in a

651
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Let's say, five.

652
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,100
Write something like that.

653
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Because one meter is, you know, is 1 meter, the end of the day.

654
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,400
So this is going to be kind of a tough shot.

655
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,900
I guess if it goes for a long time, maybe it would work, but it's

656
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,100
going to be a little bit of a tough shot just with how much ground has

657
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
to be covered in the pan.

658
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,900
That makes sense, right?

659
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Yeah.

660
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,500
It's weird how your mind kind of reads these different sorts of scenes

661
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,500
and how it interprets the motion of static 2D plates, right?

662
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,700
Okay,

663
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Yes.

664
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,200
So I'm going to say that it needs to move quite a bit more in.

665
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
And I guess the five meters four meters thing we could just say that

666
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,700
it's closer in would also be, you know, the probably the right thing

667
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:23,900
to do.

668
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,400
Because I'm just trying to reconcile those, those distances for m is

669
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,300
actually pretty darn far.

670
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,700
So, you know, that's a little weird but, you know, I guess one meter

671
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,800
it probably is a total of 2 m camera move.

672
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,100
Maybe I'm not sure.

673
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,400
Depending on how you want to look at it, right.

674
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,800
But that's yeah.

675
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,100
So that's getting a little bit more.

676
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,200
I'm going to move him in just even a little bit more than that, right?

677
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,300
Yeah.

678
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,400
So that's again, that's getting there.

679
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,400
But it's going to need.

680
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:04,800
Yeah.

681
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,000
Even so it's still needs, probably a lot more, a lot more than that.

682
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,700
I'm going to go ahead and do it this way.

683
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,000
Let's get that.

684
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,000
See how that works.

685
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,700
And this will be a lot smaller as well.

686
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,400
So that's a little more what I wanted but even so.

687
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,500
And again the speed of this is just too much.

688
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,300
So what I'd like to do is I'd like to maybe go ahead and assume that

689
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,800
these are longer than five seconds, right?

690
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,900
Cut scene.

691
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Let's assume they're more like 10 seconds or 20 seconds since that's

692
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,100
probably more what they actually will be in the real game.

693
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm guessing although it's hard to say until we have the voice acting

694
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,300
in there exactly how long we would want each to be, but it's probably

695
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,000
more like that, right?

696
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,100
So that's probably it's going to be more like that speed in actuality,

697
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,800
right?

698
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,800
So yeah.

699
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,400
That's a little bit more like it.

700
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,900
Okay, so let's continue with that.

701
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,400
Let's try to get that more nailed down.

702
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:19,700
So yeah I can't quite tell how that should be, but it probably is

703
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,300
going to have to start like a bit further up, right?

704
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,900
It's probably going to have to start further up and pan further down.

705
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,400
So again we're probably going to have to increase this movement and

706
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,000
and move this up a bit, something like that.

707
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,600
Oops, wrong direction.

708
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,400
Because we want to start looking out the window, you know what I mean?

709
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,700
We want to start with this looking out the window and I'm not sure

710
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,100
exactly where we would want that.

711
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,600
But yeah, let me just see what that ends up looking like in terms of,

712
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,200
in terms of stuff.

713
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,800
Yeah, it's a tough shot.

714
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,800
It's a tough shot to be sure.

715
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,600
But, all right, let me also fix that background while we're there.

716
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
And you know what, I'm going to fix the, I'm going to, I'm going to

717
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,400
make tea, normal equal zero for a second, just so I can focus on this

718
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,100
one way.

719
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,900
The shot is lined up, right?

720
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,400
Which is pretty free for me to do.

721
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,300
I could also sort of make the, the handmade hero guy be maybe a little

722
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,699
bit.

723
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,400
Place a little bit differently.

724
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,000
Something like that, maybe.

725
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,400
I'm not sure.

726
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,500
I guess that's rightfully, right?

727
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,100
Like I said, this is a difficult shot, I'm not sure if it's going to

728
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,300
work.

729
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,700
It's a little bit hard, but that's okay.

730
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,800
And so, this guy is probably, this is more like, probably further away

731
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,400
as well.

732
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,200
And it's, you know, so let's make that big enough.

733
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,400
That we it covers the whole window as well, like, so, and then we also

734
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,500
need our, our guy here to be, you know, this guy's going to be at

735
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,100
Infinity, so, that's fine.

736
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,200
So, how big does he need to be needs to be?

737
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,100
Probably about 45 wide.

738
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,600
I need to be even bigger than that.

739
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,300
You need to be more like you know, 80 or something.

740
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,300
Ninety.

741
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,700
There we go.

742
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,400
So let's see.

743
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,100
So he is a scene layer flag.

744
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,300
He's actually at Infinity.

745
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,000
Okay, so now I'm going to unlock the movement just to see where we're

746
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,500
at.

747
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,600
Right.

748
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,800
And it's sort of.

749
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,700
Works.

750
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,300
I mean it, I think maybe if the Boy comes out of the picture slower

751
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,800
than that, it would work.

752
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,200
Potentially, it's not as maybe as good as I would have hoped.

753
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,100
We also got to make some of those background layers, a little, just a

754
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,700
little bigger, right?

755
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,400
You can kind of see the edges there, right?

756
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,500
As it comes through, and if you can see that kind of over there in

757
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,900
the, in the left corner.

758
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,700
So I'm going to go ahead and beef that up a little bit there.

759
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Oops, wrong one.

760
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,000
My bad.

761
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,300
Same with this guy.

762
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,400
So yeah.

763
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,700
Yeah.

764
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,200
Alright, let's take a look.

765
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,400
Let's see what happens if I make this guy kind of more at the same

766
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,500
speed as the background, if that makes sense.

767
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,400
And then we make him a bit bigger.

768
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,400
I'm not sure if that will work or not, but, again, something something

769
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,900
to try.

770
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,900
So the other thing we could do is we could give a little bit of

771
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,400
forward motion to it, right?

772
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,000
And I'm kind of interested to know how that would work.

773
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
Like if I did this

774
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,600
That's a little too much but just a little bit of forward motion to it

775
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,100
to see if that helps with the effect at all.

776
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,700
Yeah.

777
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,000
That that seems like a little better to me.

778
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,800
I kind of like having a little bit of that in there, so I'm going to

779
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,400
go ahead and and see how that, how that plays out.

780
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,200
And that case, then this guy does need to be much closer.

781
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,700
Take a look at what the funeral is at zero.

782
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,500
So I guess the problem here is maybe the camera starts a little bit

783
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,300
too far up to like if I just were to drop it down, just a hair.

784
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,100
Right.

785
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,300
Then the kid could be higher up and that might help.

786
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,500
Right.

787
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,100
I don't know if it will or not or if it won't but it just I feel like

788
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,800
maybe that would be a little bit helpful.

789
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
So like something like

790
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,700
Something like that, maybe.

791
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,600
Oops.

792
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,800
Something like that and then if we let it go.

793
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,800
So then it halfway it's like here,

794
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,000
See where it's at here.

795
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,900
Bobby comes out of the picture, just really quickly.

796
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah, it's tough.

797
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,400
Let's see how it is.

798
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,100
So I just don't get much feeling emotion from him.

799
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,300
For some reason, I feel like with the Z going forwards, he should, he

800
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,200
should be moving quite a bit.

801
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,500
And so I don't know if that's just because we're not close enough to

802
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,900
him or what.

803
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,700
But I want to get more of a feeling of motion of the, the boy's head

804
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,100
getting bigger, and maybe we just need to move the other part back or

805
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,700
something, but I'm not, I'm just not getting that feel if that makes

806
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,100
sense.

807
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,500
That's, that's a little weird.

808
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,300
And I'm not sure what that, I'm not sure what that's about.

809
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,600
All right, so let's see.

810
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,900
Let me just see what happens here.

811
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,800
Why can't we see anything?

812
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
There's the dude.

813
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,100
At Point 2.

814
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,000
We completely lose them but I don't know why.

815
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,100
Why isn't he there doesn't really make sense to me?

816
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,800
Because the camera supposed to be 800.

817
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,300
So he should still be in front of Congress.

818
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,700
We have a near clipping plane, I guess not.

819
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,400
Exactly sure.

820
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,300
But at three, we do see them.

821
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,200
So there is right.

822
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,400
So that's pretty close camera.

823
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,100
All right.

824
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,600
That's pretty close.

825
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,200
Yeah.

826
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,800
All right, so what happens at one?

827
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,300
It's already past him.

828
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,900
I don't know why I'm not getting enough enough zoom on him.

829
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,900
So here's what I'm going to do.

830
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,400
I'm going to move the other layer back just to see if that gives me

831
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,800
more some kind of more success.

832
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,100
I don't know if it will or it won't but I just I don't know what else

833
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,600
to do.

834
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,000
So as what I'm going to do, I'm going to make that one be a little bit

835
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,900
more since this is a fake camera move shot.

836
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,000
It's kind of hard.

837
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,300
It basically means that we can't just use the net.

838
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,800
Look on the other shots, we just lean on the fact that we're doing an

839
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,600
actual perspective, transform to make it so that we don't have to

840
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,800
worry.

841
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,400
And it all just works, right?

842
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,000
But in this one work since it's kind of a hack we don't really have

843
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,700
any way of, you know, leaning on that aspect of it, right.

844
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,600
So yeah, it's a bit hard to say the least.

845
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,800
all right, so he should be

846
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,500
Now.

847
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,400
There we go.

848
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,000
So let's see if this is any better with that sort of moved.

849
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,200
If we could, if we quote see what we can do, not sure.

850
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:15,800
Yeah.

851
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Alright, so now we just got to make this be a little bit more.

852
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,500
Ocean.

853
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,800
Starting to get it, starting to get it.

854
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,100
Let's make it a little more forward motion.

855
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,400
That's Court of more the, okay.

856
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,000
So that's more what I wanted.

857
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,100
I guess I just wasn't.

858
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I didn't, I should have set up the motion over the boy's head first,

859
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,300
that's more what I wanted to feel like, was that.

860
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,600
So, that's, that's much better.

861
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,600
Okay.

862
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,900
So that should make things a little bit easier on us.

863
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:01,100
Now, we're going to have to dive down deep, you know, further down to

864
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,600
end on on the, the toys, obviously.

865
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,400
But other than that, I think now, we're in much better shape.

866
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,300
Right.

867
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,100
And will probably want to move the toys back a bit as well, if that

868
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,800
makes sense.

869
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,700
Yeah, so that's that's getting better, right?

870
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
That's getting better.

871
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah, yeah.

872
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,100
See what happens at T normal equals one.

873
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
So this is the end of the cutscene can just look at what's that?

874
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,900
Last shot.

875
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
That's correct.

876
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,300
We've got this shot.

877
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,600
And that's correct.

878
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,800
So now let's hope that that's roughly good in terms of the of how the

879
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,500
shop looks.

880
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:52,800
Yeah.

881
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,600
So again, not the best but it worked.

882
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,600
I guess as well as could be expected.

883
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,100
So, let's take oops.

884
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,000
I don't know why I stopped it running, I guess I just did for no

885
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,500
reason.

886
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,300
So let's take a look now at the next scene.

887
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,300
I think I think I like this next scene that's coming up here.

888
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,900
I remember which one it is properly.

889
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,100
Let's see how we're doing.

890
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,400
All right, so I'm going to clear out these flags.

891
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,400
You get us back to something a little more reasonable here.

892
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,700
So cures, oops,

893
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,200
See what we've got.

894
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,200
Move this 2 - 10.

895
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,500
There we go.

896
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,200
All right.

897
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,400
And this one is probably going to be.

898
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,200
I think another slow zoom in.

899
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,100
I don't think there's this one's doesn't have any weird.

900
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,400
This is not a weird camera one.

901
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,400
Yeah.

902
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,300
So there we go.

903
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,400
That's looking pretty good.

904
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,600
So really all we need is a slow zoom on this one and that's probably

905
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,000
fine.

906
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,900
I don't know, maybe it needs to be a little bit.

907
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,400
Sir.

908
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:01,900
Oops.

909
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,300
Then that in terms of motion motion speed,

910
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,400
Motion speed.

911
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,800
Here we go.

912
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,900
Let's put that out a bit.

913
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,800
Just a teens.

914
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,000
All right.

915
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,000
So, let's go ahead and add that next layer in.

916
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,100
And it's going to be a little bit closer.

917
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:26,900
Oh, you know what?

918
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,600
No, it's not.

919
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,900
It's going to be exactly the same.

920
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,800
There's Santa Claus, he's just doing a Santa Claus kind of thing,

921
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,700
right?

922
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,900
Just hanging out.

923
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,600
I think that's all good and I believe this one is actually animated,

924
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,200
so this is going to be.

925
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,200
This is going to be added.

926
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,700
This is going to kind of add a new feature.

927
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,600
That makes sense.

928
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,600
You can see that there's an animation, a slight animation to this one,

929
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,400
right?

930
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,200
Like so that, that makes sense.

931
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,000
So I think

932
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,900
We will have to add a feature to our system, shouldn't be too hard to

933
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,600
do, but let's go ahead and finish up by making layer for.

934
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,900
So that's just a little I guess.

935
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,400
That's one of the people who's in the foreground, is there is there a

936
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,600
fifth as well?

937
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,700
Yeah, so there's a fifth as well.

938
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,300
Okay, so let's see.

939
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,400
I feel like this, I feel like something's a little weird here.

940
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,500
I'm going to make these all those smaller so I can see them better.

941
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,900
I thought there were more children in the shot.

942
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,400
Normally, I don't know where they are.

943
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,200
They're like, missing.

944
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,100
I thought they were off to the left.

945
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,400
I wonder if I exported it raw or something.

946
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,300
That's kind of weird.

947
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,500
I don't know.

948
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,400
What's going on there.

949
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm a little confused.

950
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,600
But I guess that's just me.

951
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,400
So I may have to update the our pack at some point.

952
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,800
If I figure out that that's actually not what's supposed to be

953
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,600
happening, but yeah, all right, so there's little girl who supposed to

954
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,900
be in the foreground and then we've also got some tinsel there.

955
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,900
Let's make that tinsel happen.

956
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,200
There's some tensile as well.

957
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,100
So that's it for that shot though.

958
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
That's really all there.

959
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,200
That's really all there is.

960
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,800
So we'd have that there's a little bit of Animation to it was the only

961
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,200
thing.

962
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,200
So that's something that we're going to have to do.

963
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,000
All right.

964
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,200
So let's see.

965
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,000
I guess, yeah, I'll just assume for now that it's actually correct.

966
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,200
Although, I think I must have explored wrong because I feel like there

967
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,600
were supposed to be more children, it and I have no idea where they

968
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,000
went, they're just gone, apparently, sorry kids.

969
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,300
So, all of that is, is

970
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,100
About right?

971
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,800
I think and all we really need to do is fix these other ones here.

972
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,000
Alright, so for the tinsel, let's get the tinsel up to the correct

973
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,500
size.

974
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,800
The tinsel is going to be pretty close, I think probably, right.

975
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,200
It's going to be more like that sort of thing, probably even closer

976
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,800
than that, maybe not sure.

977
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,900
Yeah, probably something like that.

978
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,100
And then I just want the tinsel to be kind of up.

979
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,800
I don't, I don't want to be so in the way that makes sense.

980
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,200
So it should be something more like this.

981
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,000
You know I'm saying?

982
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,600
Maybe like that.

983
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,800
Oops.

984
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,200
Yeah, something like that.

985
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,700
That seems more correct.

986
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,500
Yeah.

987
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,700
And then, I believe the kid in the Santa are supposed to be a little

988
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,300
bit further down, so I believe they're supposed to be maybe, you know,

989
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,400
something more like this.

990
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,300
That sort of thing.

991
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,200
Yeah, if I remember correctly.

992
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,900
So, yeah, I'm almost certain.

993
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,900
There are some kids missing.

994
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,500
So I'm gonna have to react sport one of those.

995
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,100
I'm not to, I'll have to rebuild the AJ at some future date because

996
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,800
there's supposed to be some kids kind of over in the corner.

997
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,900
And I don't know what happened to them when I was saving the files.

998
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,200
I must have like, misplaced, I misplaced a bunch of children, it was

999
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,700
not my intention, right?

1000
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,500
That was a mistake.

1001
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,800
I don't didn't mean to misplace children, you know, I try to always

1002
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,100
keep track.

1003
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,700
Well, the children as much as possible unless they're just being

1004
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,400
annoying in which case you may, you may decide to misplace them on

1005
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,000
purpose, just so that you just straight-up don't have to deal with

1006
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,600
them, you know, and that's also fine.

1007
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,900
That's we totally we are totally fine with that on.

1008
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,100
He made here, we encourage that just a good way to get rid of

1009
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,700
children, that are kind of being you know, really just just

1010
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,000
Just really getting in the way.

1011
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,300
All right, so let's let's move for over just a little bit there.

1012
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,800
She kind of occludes a little bit of the scene though.

1013
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,200
She includes the other girl.

1014
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,200
They're a little bit too much so maybe, maybe she shouldn't be quite

1015
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,500
that large.

1016
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,100
Let's go ahead and make her kind of a little more tiny there, maybe

1017
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,100
just a bit lower.

1018
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,900
Yeah, that seems that seems okay.

1019
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,200
It seems fine.

1020
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,900
And maybe we'll move Santa Claus over because I think he's not over

1021
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
where Shadow is on the ground there.

1022
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,700
So I'm going to move him and the kid over a bit too.

1023
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,400
Yeah, that's a bit better.

1024
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,900
That's a bit better.

1025
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:45,900
Yeah, maybe just a lips, just a, just a touch, slightest touch.

1026
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
I mean, I don't even want to tell you how slight I'm talking about

1027
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
when I say slight touch.

1028
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,600
I mean like the slightest dissed, okay?

1029
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,600
So if we wanted to make this cutscene, do the animation that it's

1030
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,200
supposed to do, right?

1031
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,800
Then what we need to do again, is we

1032
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,100
We need some way of saying that these two things don't play at the

1033
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,600
same time, right?

1034
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,700
And so we can do a pretty simple version of that.

1035
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,200
If we want to again you know we can just sort of have Knockouts in it.

1036
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,800
Can just say all right this scene layer we have a like mint.

1037
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,500
I'm right in a Max time or something.

1038
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,600
Something that says where the thing, you know, exists, if that makes

1039
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,400
sense and we're, you know, where it doesn't.

1040
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,600
And so, all we would do with that is allow ourselves to have a

1041
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,500
knockout range and so we could have something like this like knockout

1042
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:38,100
or or wood, called transient layer, something like that.

1043
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,500
A layer that's only going to up here during these times.

1044
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,300
And so if we want to set like one of these transient Flags, what we

1045
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,600
could do then is say like oh okay you know these two guys are both

1046
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,800
transient layers and so the timing at which they're going to happen,

1047
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,900
this one's going to happen you know for the first half of the shot.

1048
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,200
For something.

1049
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:01,200
And this was going to happen for the second half of the shot, right?

1050
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,300
Really pretty straightforward.

1051
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:09,500
And we can we can even make this just a parameter like, you know, Shot

1052
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Change time.

1053
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,300
And that's 10, right?

1054
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,400
And then this would just be shot change time.

1055
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,400
Shot Change sign.

1056
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,700
So that's, that's really it.

1057
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,600
Then what we do is inside red related scene is as we go through the

1058
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,900
layer, indices, what we would do is say, you know, all right.

1059
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,000
We'd have a, an active flag or something like that.

1060
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,500
And then we'd say, if active, and we'd only push the bitmap Evans

1061
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,200
active.

1062
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,800
And then we just say, okay, it's true by default.

1063
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,400
If the layer Flags indicate that this scene layer flag is trans that,

1064
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,900
this is a Transit layer, then we just say, okay, if the T normal

1065
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,300
For the thing.

1066
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,300
Oh, and I guess that's true.

1067
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,500
That's this is normalized time.

1068
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,000
Here we go.

1069
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,700
If that t normal is greater than or equal to whatever the Min time is,

1070
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,000
Then it's past the point where the layer should start being active and

1071
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,200
then we just want to check to see if the Tina Rose less than the layer

1072
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:14,800
Max time.

1073
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,300
And you notice, I intentionally use the greater than equal to and less

1074
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:17,800
than here.

1075
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,000
That's because I want to be able to have the layers change precisely

1076
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
on an instant.

1077
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,600
So that that way if it's a time is exactly 0.5 we would switch up to

1078
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,400
the next one.

1079
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,200
So I'm just making sure that the intervals don't overlap on one

1080
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,900
particular specific T.

1081
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,700
So that's very that's intentional, right?

1082
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,100
So there's

1083
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,800
There's, you know, the sort of the animated version, right?

1084
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,100
And you can see them kind of doing their little thing there where you

1085
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,400
put the hat on and, you know, we could think of doing something like a

1086
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,000
fade.

1087
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,400
There, we like transition between them with a fade and I don't know if

1088
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,400
that's a good idea or not, but but, you know, we could also consider

1089
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,900
it if you want to do something like that.

1090
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,100
Then what we do is we kind of do a ramp between the two.

1091
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,700
I'm not sure if that's good for the style that we have here, but point

1092
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:06,900
being.

1093
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,600
That's that's what that looks like.

1094
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,900
Alright?

1095
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,500
Okay.

1096
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,500
So let's let's try to do one more in the five minutes we have left

1097
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,000
because we're getting there.

1098
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,900
We've done quite a few of these shots and that's good.

1099
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,500
We've done about half of them.

1100
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,400
Here we go.

1101
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,300
Here's shot five.

1102
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,200
Don't know why I did two layer counts there.

1103
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,600
So here's shot five and I'm shot five.

1104
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,900
Let's go ahead and see what we've got.

1105
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,800
Okay, so again, it looks like we got a backdrop coming in here.

1106
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,000
Let's see what that looks like.

1107
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,700
Yeah, that's just a standard backdrop shot.

1108
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,500
I think we could probably actually keep it back a little bit further

1109
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:02,800
though.

1110
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,900
Let's see what our next layer is.

1111
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:14,400
Like I said, okay, so here is our like, this is like our big entrance,

1112
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,100
really, you know, this is like this is, this is this is the money shot

1113
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,300
right here, people, this is where it all starts to happen.

1114
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,900
So I'm going to make that the, the background shot.

1115
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,200
I'm going to actually make that be quite a bit further away.

1116
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,400
So it's slower moving, right?

1117
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,900
And and make it bigger.

1118
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,300
So I'm going to make it more.

1119
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,100
Like this, right?

1120
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:42,100
So it's only subtly moving and I might make this be more of a dramatic

1121
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:42,700
camera move.

1122
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,300
So it's got a little more motion to it.

1123
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,800
I think that's what we might do here.

1124
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,200
Okay, so now I'm going to go back up.

1125
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,400
Get those doors in there and will maybe make the doors.

1126
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,200
So we need those doors to fill the frame, right?

1127
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:03,000
These, this is going to again leverage that transient flag for us

1128
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,500
because we're going to have this is going

1129
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,200
Something that disappears halfway through and gets replaced by the

1130
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,700
rest of the layers, right?

1131
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,100
So these are all going to be shot, change time to 1.0 the next one's

1132
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:21,300
and although actually I guess technically, maybe not all of them have

1133
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:21,400
to be.

1134
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,800
Maybe the other ones could be not.

1135
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,600
I think this is where the doors burst open.

1136
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,800
I don't actually remember.

1137
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,800
Let's see.

1138
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,700
Yeah, so that's where the doors burst open.

1139
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,300
Yeah, so that looks pretty good.

1140
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,100
All right.

1141
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,200
And so then we need

1142
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,200
Then same thing for the next one.

1143
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,700
This is going to be maybe just a touch closer than the other ones, and

1144
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,500
it's going to use that same Shot Change time.

1145
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And then, we're going to go ahead and get that next one up there and

1146
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,700
there he is.

1147
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,700
Finally, finally coming into our story.

1148
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,300
Krampus the demon, everyone's favorite holiday figure bursting through

1149
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,000
the doors.

1150
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,400
He's a little too big.

1151
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,200
That's true.

1152
00:56:59,700 --> 00:56:59,800
So

1153
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,900
Go ahead and back him up a bit there.

1154
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,900
And this needs to be a little white larger.

1155
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,100
It looks like okay,

1156
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
see how that works.

1157
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,500
Nice.

1158
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,000
So, you just kind of comes in, you know, you can't stop Krampus.

1159
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,700
He comes in whenever he wants to come in, you know, I'm saying?

1160
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,200
I mean, if he's going to come into your orphanage, he's going to come

1161
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,900
into your orphanage.

1162
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,600
What can I say?

1163
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,200
And I think we should all just Embrace that.

1164
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,600
All right, so he's going to be a little bit closer.

1165
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,300
I think I wanted to have a little bit more motion on them like, yeah,

1166
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,500
relative to the rest of it.

1167
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,700
And then I'd like to also there's a snow layer I believe in here, so

1168
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,800
I'd like to get that in there.

1169
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,200
That also should be.

1170
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,400
Yeah, there we go.

1171
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,700
There we go.

1172
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,100
That is just an idea.

1173
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,500
I'm liking this shot.

1174
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,400
This is this is just great.

1175
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,100
I'm liking this shot a lot.

1176
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,200
That's that's really satisfying.

1177
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,300
Yeah, that's good stuff.

1178
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,100
That's good stuff that

1179
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,800
Is video games, ladies and gentlemen, video games.

1180
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,900
And so we got that all in there and that's nice.

1181
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:18,600
I probably want to change the pan up a little bit to just give a bit

1182
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,000
of motion to it.

1183
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,700
A bit of upward motion to it because it's like kind of go.

1184
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,800
So it's kind of going up towards Krampus like that.

1185
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,500
I feel like that's better or Krampus.

1186
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,900
As the case may be, if you're pronouncing it more, the sort of the

1187
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,000
Continental Style,

1188
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,200
So that's good.

1189
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,300
I like that.

1190
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,200
That's making me.

1191
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,300
That's making me happy.

1192
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,100
So the Q&A technically begins now but yesterday, I don't remember

1193
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,700
there being many questions about this sort of thing.

1194
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,400
So I might do one more because I really like doing these scenes.

1195
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,200
It's fun to see them getting into the game, you know?

1196
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,600
So I'm just going to go ahead and say, let's do shots six while we're

1197
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,200
at it.

1198
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,100
Let's see here.

1199
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,000
So let's do shot, index 6, knock back the layer count again.

1200
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,300
And this one is, of course, now the Krampus is in, of course, as you

1201
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:02,700
know,

1202
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,100
Krampus is going to go after the kids.

1203
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,100
That's just how he rolls.

1204
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,300
What can you do?

1205
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,100
He's there for the children who are naughty, that's just that's just

1206
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:14,700
what he does.

1207
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,700
You know, that's how he does, that's how he rolls.

1208
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,800
All right.

1209
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,100
So this is probably going to be.

1210
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,500
He's probably about you know let's say 8 m 8 meters back.

1211
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,100
So let's go ahead and get that sort of placed a little bit more

1212
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:27,900
appropriately.

1213
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,400
Like so looking pretty good there.

1214
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,900
Like in that Krampus.

1215
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,700
It always gets great when Krampus comes into the picture in my

1216
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,300
opinion.

1217
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,100
I feel like that's when things start to go well for any video game as

1218
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,300
soon as Krampus is in it.

1219
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,000
All right.

1220
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,800
And so there's no transients in this one.

1221
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,000
This one's I pretty sure I remember.

1222
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,800
It's just

1223
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,100
it's just

1224
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,600
Regular regular layers.

1225
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,000
No, no weirdness there.

1226
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,500
So, here we go with the layer count there.

1227
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,300
Let's up that, there's that snow.

1228
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,900
Again, kind of just giving a little bit perspective, perspective, to

1229
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,100
things.

1230
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,900
I try to export the snow on separate layer.

1231
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,200
So you kind of got this feel of like they're being more spatialization

1232
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,400
to each individual image if that makes sense.

1233
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,100
So, okay, let's go back up to, let's get another one.

1234
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,300
There, there's the the poor little child but he's chasing, you know,

1235
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,000
it's hard to get away from Krampus.

1236
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,500
Obviously, Krampus is very difficult to run from.

1237
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,700
I'm sure.

1238
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,600
Are all aware of this.

1239
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,800
If you've ever been chased by Krampus that, you know, that that's

1240
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,300
true.

1241
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,400
And I think we've all been chased by Krampus at least once or twice.

1242
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,000
Okay.

1243
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So let's move him over a little bit.

1244
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,900
Let's move him.

1245
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,700
Oops, that was wrong direction.

1246
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,600
Let's move him over a bit and down a bit as well.

1247
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,000
He should be a little bit lower.

1248
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:51,900
Yeah.

1249
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,400
So it's something like that and I think we want to be kind of going,

1250
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,800
maybe a little bit up towards Krampus again.

1251
01:00:59,200 --> 01:00:59,900
So I feel like we

1252
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,400
The shop to sort of pan, a little bit to the side, right?

1253
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
We want to be panning.

1254
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,500
Oops, not that side.

1255
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,500
You want to be panting.

1256
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:11,100
I think to the side so it kind of so the kids kind of running away,

1257
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,400
ish ish, you know.

1258
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,900
Not exactly but dish.

1259
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,100
So I'm going to make that a little bit more subtle, just going to make

1260
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:18,900
it like that.

1261
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,900
Just so the centering is that kind of thing.

1262
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,700
So that that roughly looks right to me, I think that's good.

1263
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,500
Okay, we've got one more layer, which I think is the tears.

1264
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,800
There might actually be two more layers, but there's a

1265
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:33,100
layer of Tears if I remember correctly on the kid.

1266
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,300
Yeah.

1267
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,400
So that we're going to have to make a little bit smaller though.

1268
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:39,600
There it is.

1269
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,500
All right.

1270
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,900
How small should that be?

1271
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,300
There are the tears I'm going to set the, I'm gonna lock that t in

1272
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,200
place for us.

1273
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,200
So I can line up those tears.

1274
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,400
So, they should not be coming out of his nose because it's not snot,

1275
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,400
it steers to.

1276
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,900
So let's go ahead and sort of move that over a little bit.

1277
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,700
and just see something like,

1278
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,100
This is where if we were going to do a lot of these cutscenes, it'd be

1279
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,100
nice to make a little positioning, something, we can position them

1280
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,500
with the mouse, if that makes sense.

1281
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:26,200
So, I think that just needs to be up a little bit, like, something

1282
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,900
like that.

1283
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,500
Maybe.

1284
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:34,800
There we go.

1285
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,000
So I think that's about right, that's where we would want it, but I

1286
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,300
don't know if we want that to move separately from the kid probably

1287
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,700
not because it's sort of tied into his tear duct there.

1288
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,300
So maybe not.

1289
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,900
And let's go ahead and add our fifth layer as well, right?

1290
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,800
There's a fifth layer, some other little kids.

1291
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,300
That I think there's only fifth there, I don't think there's a six

1292
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:03,800
layers there.

1293
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:06,900
Pretty sure.

1294
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,100
Oh there is my Lord, lot of layers to this one.

1295
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,700
All right, so there's six layer two.

1296
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,700
All right, so for this layer we just need this to be a little bit more

1297
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,200
sane.

1298
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:24,200
So this would be, I don't know how big should be, she'd be well, she'd

1299
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,600
have to be about as big as he was if she's a little bit front of him,

1300
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:28,100
right?

1301
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,400
So maybe like almost on the same layer.

1302
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,900
Almost, I don't know.

1303
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:39,900
Not sure.

1304
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,800
Something like that.

1305
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:48,800
Oops.

1306
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,800
Yeah, something like that and then with the garland that's got to be a

1307
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,600
little bigger.

1308
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,300
And that's also going to be I guess a little bit further up, probably

1309
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,600
guessing, not sure.

1310
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:12,100
Yeah, something like that and maybe a little bit more out of the way.

1311
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,700
Not sure.

1312
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,600
Where that should be exactly.

1313
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:29,500
So that seems like it wants to be smaller than that in higher up.

1314
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,900
I'm guessing, I don't know.

1315
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,200
I'm not really sure what's meant to happen with those.

1316
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,000
I feel like that's a kind of tricky one to place.

1317
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,900
All right, let's unlock that and see how this is looking.

1318
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,200
It Feels Alright to me.

1319
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,300
I feel like the snow should be a little more mid-ground.

1320
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:59,700
So I guess one thing I would do is say let's make that snow more like

1321
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,500
in five, something like that.

1322
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,900
So that it's a little more mid-ground that feels a little bit better

1323
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:09,400
to me.

1324
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,300
We could even make it so that it's a little smaller Maybe.

1325
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:15,700
No.

1326
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,100
All right.

1327
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,900
I'm pretty happy with that.

1328
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,700
I'm pretty happy with that.

1329
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,000
I'm going to go ahead and see where we're at on q&a's.

1330
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
Let's find out.

1331
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,200
Let's find out.

1332
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,000
If anyone has any questions, if nobody has any questions, I'll just

1333
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,600
keep doing the cutscenes because we're you know, coming down.

1334
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,400
Few Khan.

1335
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,000
Why not pass?

1336
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,500
How long each cutscene is instead of it being the same for all

1337
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,200
cutscenes?

1338
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,800
Well, we will, we will do.

1339
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,100
That it's just at the moment, we don't really have to do anything with

1340
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:04,200
that.

1341
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,800
We're not sinking them to music.

1342
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,200
So yeah, we I guess what I'd say if you con we will be doing exactly

1343
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,400
that it's just right now we only have to lay them out.

1344
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,900
We don't have to do much but

1345
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,600
G 7 for the weird camera movement seen, what do you think about

1346
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,700
interpreting against a curve?

1347
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,500
Instead of linearly?

1348
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,700
I like that because if it was rotation, you would do a curve.

1349
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,000
But I don't know.

1350
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,900
Looking at the scene, I don't have high hopes for it ever looking

1351
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,600
quite, right?

1352
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:48,000
So I don't know what to say about that, exactly.

1353
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,600
But yeah.

1354
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,900
And you know, for those of you asking Yang Shanley does all the

1355
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,200
artwork for handmade hero.

1356
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,300
She is a an illustrator

1357
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,900
So, yeah, any of the artwork for the game looks great.

1358
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,100
I love it.

1359
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,300
It and like I said, I don't really are tracked, it too much.

1360
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,500
I just let yangshin do it.

1361
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,300
Or like I'm just like, okay, you know, there's going to be Krampus

1362
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,300
going to come through the door and I'll like do little sketches of,

1363
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,500
like, here's like how maybe the scene is laid out.

1364
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,600
Like you know, there's a Krampus here, there's this there, right?

1365
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,700
And then she just kind of comes up with everything so she you know she

1366
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:34,200
made up what all of these people look like?

1367
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,400
And what Krampus would look.

1368
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,600
I can and so on.

1369
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,400
So if that makes sense.

1370
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,400
All right, so if everyone seems to want more

1371
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,300
More cutscenes.

1372
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,000
Let's just do them.

1373
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,000
Let's just do that.

1374
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,600
Make sense?

1375
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,900
You can always ask questions Tomorrow.

1376
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,900
There's always there's tons of is the handmade hero, every weekday.

1377
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,800
You can always ask questions or let's just let's just be these are so

1378
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,100
much darn fun to do.

1379
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,100
I could do them all day.

1380
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,800
All right, so let's see where we're at with shot index 7, let's see

1381
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,200
here, start with one layer.

1382
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,200
So here is our Intrepid Hero.

1383
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,600
This is another counter motion.

1384
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,899
Seen by think this is going to use the neck.

1385
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:20,600
This one's so easy.

1386
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,899
We should be able to do this one in no time.

1387
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,100
There's only two layers that are thing is

1388
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,300
Krampus in the kid.

1389
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,399
That's it.

1390
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,100
And so, these are going to be counter motion.

1391
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,899
Layers are going to be two layers, counter motion the kid slides to

1392
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:31,800
the right.

1393
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,899
The Krampus slides to the left.

1394
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:35,500
That's really all there is to it.

1395
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,000
So the cameras is moving, right word, right?

1396
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So it's moving.

1397
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,399
It's moving this way.

1398
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,200
It's not zooming.

1399
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So it's basically this kind of a shot.

1400
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:57,000
And so this one's going to have seen flag, whatever seem layer flag

1401
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,800
transient.

1402
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,899
It's going to have seen flour counter

1403
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,500
X, right?

1404
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,200
So it's basically going to oh, what did?

1405
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,500
What did sap?

1406
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,600
Oh, that's great.

1407
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,300
I don't know why.

1408
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,300
I thought that was going to happen.

1409
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:11,899
There we go.

1410
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,100
So it's basically like this kind of a shot, right?

1411
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:20,000
It's a kind of a shot where you sort of have the two things moving in

1412
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,600
opposite to reveal, right?

1413
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:27,800
Each other to review know the Krampus reveals what's behind the

1414
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,399
Krampus

1415
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,300
quote unquote.

1416
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,800
Yeah, I think that's right.

1417
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,700
That's roughly what supposed to happen.

1418
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:44,500
So I think all we need to do is move the Krampus over slightly, right?

1419
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,399
We just need to move the Krampus over slightly.

1420
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:50,300
We maybe need to move the camera more, right?

1421
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,300
So, it moves out of the way, a little bit more of what maybe we don't.

1422
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,100
I'm not sure.

1423
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:00,200
And then we kind of need the the kid to be a little bit more hidden at

1424
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,900
the outset, right?

1425
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,400
So we need the kid to be just a little, just a tear to the side.

1426
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:19,100
So that's about it and you can kind of see, you know, obviously very

1427
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:26,600
heroic little limbless child is stopping the advance of Krampus here.

1428
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:33,700
I don't want to, you know, spoiler alert, spoiler alert but that's

1429
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,100
what's happening, right?

1430
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,000
That's what's happening.

1431
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,100
So, okay, so that's fine.

1432
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,300
So we can keep going again with shot eight.

1433
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,300
Let's get shot 8 in there.

1434
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,300
Let's go ahead and do this.

1435
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,500
We don't need shot change time on these.

1436
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,200
I guess I don't think shut change.

1437
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,900
Time was necessary in any of these, actually.

1438
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:56,000
It's just just the ones that have the transient layers, all right.

1439
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,500
So on shot Seven.

1440
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,500
Let's open that up.

1441
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,900
So I'm shot Seven, we've got another Krampus.

1442
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,200
You can kind of see I don't know what happened here.

1443
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,300
Why are we why are we still sliding to the side?

1444
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,400
What's going on?

1445
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,100
Okay.

1446
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,000
Oops, I headed the wrong one.

1447
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,800
My bad.

1448
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,900
Shot 7 shot, eight.

1449
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,100
Okay.

1450
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,000
All right, so if I take Rick care, if I get rid of this one, we're

1451
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,700
still still got our shot Seven.

1452
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,600
The Perils of using such a tiny window.

1453
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,800
I can't see what I'm editing.

1454
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,300
All right, there we go.

1455
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:56,600
All good.

1456
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:57,600
All better.

1457
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,400
Now, let's go ahead.

1458
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
And do this.

1459
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:02,600
Okay.

1460
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:09,800
Now we've got our Krampus as we should and we can do our zoom in like

1461
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,800
we were doing before, right?

1462
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,700
I don't remember how many layers it has for what they are.

1463
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:20,800
There's the glove magic glove and I think there might be there might

1464
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,700
be some other layers.

1465
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,400
I don't really know.

1466
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:24,900
I guess there's some kids.

1467
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,400
Let's see here.

1468
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,200
Let's try and get all the stuff tiny or so I can actually see what's

1469
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:31,600
in there.

1470
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,800
There's three layers and what's the fourth layer already fourth layer.

1471
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,300
More of the sort of Garland that hangs down from the ceiling.

1472
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,100
That's it.

1473
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,400
So it's just those four layers, so that should be relatively

1474
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,100
straightforward.

1475
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,600
Okay, let's start with layer 1.

1476
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,500
As we generally, do a minute, that should be centered, right?

1477
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,300
And it should be encompassing, the whole screen.

1478
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,400
So, something like that.

1479
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,300
I'm going to check it to T normal zero.

1480
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,700
That looks good.

1481
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,900
Let's go ahead and get the layer count up to 2.

1482
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:19,900
There's my glove.

1483
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,000
The glove is a present.

1484
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,500
Obviously, as you can see, I'm going to go ahead and float that down a

1485
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,900
little bit so that it's it's sort of like a being presented to them.

1486
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,700
What just happened?

1487
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,500
Why did I get smaller?

1488
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,500
I know why that happened and I don't know why.

1489
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,000
That should be about, right?

1490
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:59,200
I think so.

1491
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,700
I'm going to take a look at the motion of that might unlock to normal.

1492
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,600
See what happens there, the hand should be moving a little bit

1493
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,300
differently and so yeah, I guess that's not quite enough.

1494
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,200
So let's maybe do that.

1495
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:18,700
Like that would be better.

1496
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,200
All that's still.

1497
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,000
It's a bit too small.

1498
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,600
I think maybe it should still be that big

1499
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,600
because it's supposed to be about the size of his head.

1500
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:25,900
It's a big glove.

1501
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:30,900
That's pretty good.

1502
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:36,800
All right, so let's now just put in those other two layers as you can

1503
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,500
see, Krampus is kind of a very positive.

1504
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,100
You know, very positive figure in the story.

1505
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,000
Yes, he was coming to chase down the children.

1506
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,400
Once he saw that the little little hero child is actually good and is,

1507
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,100
you know, is trying to do good things.

1508
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,700
He decided to

1509
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,100
Going in and chasing the chasing the other child down.

1510
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,800
And he decided to maybe spend some time, helping out this little kid.

1511
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,100
Unlike Santa Claus who basically just ruins everything all the time,

1512
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,200
just like in real life.

1513
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,100
So yeah, so there's that.

1514
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,000
Okay so you can kind of see we got those kids in the corner there and

1515
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,200
then we'll get that Garland in and then we'll be done with this one.

1516
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,700
So, there we go.

1517
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,500
Oops.

1518
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,800
Might need to get a little further back.

1519
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,300
All right.

1520
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,300
And that looks like it wants to maybe go down a little bit, you know.

1521
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,700
Correct me if I'm wrong but I feel like the camera kind of wants to

1522
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,800
dive a little bit more towards the glove.

1523
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:51,700
Right.

1524
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,300
Like that.

1525
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,700
I feel like that's a much nicer pan.

1526
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,700
So, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to be mr.

1527
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:11,500
Indulges himself all the time for all this stuff, but let's just, why

1528
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:11,800
not?

1529
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,000
Just go ahead and do something like this too.

1530
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,600
if we just did senior interval and we just said, or we could even just

1531
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,100
do

1532
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:30,100
Interval R32.

1533
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,500
Bob, or something like that or Min value max value.

1534
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,200
I don't know.

1535
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,200
I don't know.

1536
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,500
This is getting ridiculous.

1537
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,500
I'm just going to say that's parameter.

1538
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,900
This is a bit of a hack but I don't really care because again this is

1539
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,700
not, you know, going to be very heavily traffic code or anything.

1540
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,100
I'm going to say / Amex Bram, why like that?

1541
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:04,000
I'm going to pass a generic Vector there and and then when we actually

1542
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,800
have these guys here I'm going to bundle those up.

1543
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:09,300
So I'm going to do I'm going to do like this sort of thing.

1544
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:11,800
Right.

1545
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,500
Don't know why they didn't give me an error.

1546
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,300
I should have given me a partially bracketed initializer list there.

1547
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:23,300
I feel like that's a little odd, you know, I don't mind telling you

1548
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,700
it's a bit odd, a bod if you will.

1549
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,000
But let's see what happens there.

1550
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:41,700
Go ahead and loop around there.

1551
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:46,500
I think we made sure our tinsel.

1552
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,500
There is a little little off the loft.

1553
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,500
All right, that's better.

1554
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,400
Okay.

1555
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,000
So, what I want to do here is I want to make that glove.

1556
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,200
I just want the glove to like move up and down a little bit.

1557
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,800
So I want to be able to do something here where I can say oh seen

1558
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:15,000
layer flag you know like floaty or something like that.

1559
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:19,100
And if I say floaties, I want it to kind of just bob up and down.

1560
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,700
And so, what I'm going to do is say, okay, it's floaty and then the

1561
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,000
first thing will be like how much it pops up and down.

1562
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,200
So maybe like half meter up and down.

1563
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,200
That's probably too much, but we'll start with that.

1564
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:31,900
And then the period which will just be, a regular period.

1565
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,500
Let's say,

1566
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,900
And we'll, and then we can just tune those two values to get whatever

1567
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,400
it is that we want, right?

1568
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:44,100
And so in here, we can say, the the peasy, right?

1569
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:48,200
We can precept that so you can say, Okay, layer flags and seen layer

1570
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,800
flag floaty.

1571
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:54,400
We can say the p y plus Z equals.

1572
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:54,800
I don't know.

1573
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,900
The sign will just use a sine wave, so like it Bob's up and down just

1574
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,800
kind of gradually.

1575
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,300
So we can just say, okay, whatever the / a

1576
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,600
Whatever that / Amex is, that's how much it Bob's and whatever the

1577
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,100
params why is, that's how fast it Bob's and we just plug T normal into

1578
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,200
it, right?

1579
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,200
Not know layer there.

1580
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,200
So that's all we're talking about, right?

1581
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,100
And so that's that's not nearly fast enough.

1582
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,200
Obviously the site the period needs to be more.

1583
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:35,800
Honestly a sign weight signs, going to take 2 pi to go through and we

1584
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,800
are only going from 0 to 1.

1585
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,200
So we need that period to be much higher.

1586
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:43,200
Don't know why I ever would have thought that was a good value and

1587
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,500
probably need this to be less than a meter but let's see.

1588
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:51,600
Yeah, so there is it's bobbing kind of slowly, right?

1589
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:03,000
So, I don't know if I like that effect or not, but that's the, that's

1590
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:03,700
the idea.

1591
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,300
What do you think?

1592
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,300
We'll leave it in for now?

1593
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,000
I don't know if it's a good idea or a bad idea but there you go.

1594
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,600
So that's good.

1595
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's how much time you got.

1596
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,200
We got another nine minutes.

1597
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,300
Let's do one more shot.

1598
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,000
Let's just do one more shot.

1599
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,600
So let's do shot nine.

1600
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,200
There it is.

1601
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,600
I think this one's just a straight Zoom.

1602
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,600
No, it'll probably assume up to the to the corner actually.

1603
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,100
So let's see here.

1604
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,300
all right, so

1605
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:50,200
there is our little, our little kid going back to his room so it's

1606
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,100
probably going to be a zoom down towards him, right?

1607
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:59,700
So it's probably going to go you know, that way and this way right?

1608
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,400
That sort of thing, maybe a little less, a little less this way.

1609
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,200
There we go.

1610
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,300
That's looking pretty good, right?

1611
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:13,300
I think.

1612
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,400
And yeah.

1613
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:21,800
So so that's about all we need for that layer, really, I think.

1614
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,000
So.

1615
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,500
We would just need another layer at this point, right?

1616
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:35,800
Which I think it's literally just to like ceiling layers is all it is.

1617
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,000
Yeah, that's it.

1618
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,400
I don't know if there's forth.

1619
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,800
Yes, there's just it's just like some stuff that's up close to us on

1620
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,400
the ceiling.

1621
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,600
That's always there.

1622
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,900
So these are going to be like much smaller and we're probably going to

1623
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:55,500
do like one, two, three like that sort of thing, right?

1624
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,800
Because they're going to move past this pretty quickly.

1625
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,400
I think so.

1626
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:00,800
Yeah.

1627
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,100
So let's go ahead and get those placed.

1628
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:09,800
I'm going to T normal 0 this so I can place them at zero and and

1629
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,800
adjust them that way.

1630
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,300
So let's start with this.

1631
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:17,500
This guy here, he's going to be like this, this garland that kind of

1632
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,600
goes over in the corner, right?

1633
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,500
He's he's like,

1634
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,900
I don't know, he's like this sort of thing.

1635
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,300
You know I'm saying?

1636
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:36,800
Something like that.

1637
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,700
I don't know if that should probably be bigger.

1638
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:42,000
Maybe, that should be a little bigger actually, not sure.

1639
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,900
Probably possibly.

1640
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,300
How do we feel about that?

1641
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,400
We feel pretty good about that.

1642
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,100
Oops.

1643
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,500
So I guess one really is the right number for that, okay?

1644
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,300
So that seems about right for him.

1645
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,900
Let's go ahead and make the lamp a bit bigger as well, because the

1646
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,800
lamp should probably be bigger maybe even bigger than that, might even

1647
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,200
be like that kind of a thing.

1648
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:27,200
I feel like and probably over at least a little bit.

1649
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,100
You know I'm saying?

1650
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,900
Cuz it's got like a hard Edge there, so that it should be.

1651
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:40,100
It should be like, off on against the edge,

1652
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,300
Like that.

1653
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,000
And so then all we need to do is get this this other Garland in there

1654
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,400
and the other Garland's going to be have to be quite a bit bigger

1655
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,900
actually.

1656
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,700
There we go and that'll be just up against the ceiling, I think.

1657
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,400
So that's just needs to be raised just a smidge.

1658
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,300
All right.

1659
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,900
So now I'm going to unlock it from T normal zero and just take a look

1660
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,600
at what happens when we zoom into there.

1661
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,200
That feels nice.

1662
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,000
All right, so I think that's it.

1663
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,500
I think that's it for now.

1664
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,600
I think we've got everything there again, we got some good work in

1665
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,100
here.

1666
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,200
We got all our cutscenes laid out.

1667
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,600
There's only two more to go.

1668
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,100
So, we're almost done.

1669
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,200
We just got to do two more tomorrow.

1670
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,000
And then tomorrow, after we do those two will make it so that they all

1671
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,200
play back in sequence.

1672
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:46,100
And then we've got an opening cutscene - the sound which since we

1673
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,300
don't have the voice acting yet.

1674
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,800
You know, that's how that's going to go, all right?

1675
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,300
Do you enjoy the screaming of the Linker lamenting an driving and

1676
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,800
sisyphean Agony that he can't write to the exe?

1677
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,900
Yes, kind of because Microsoft's Linker is kind of a piece of junk and

1678
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:18,900
so anything that causes it pain and suffering is totally acceptable to

1679
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:19,200
me.

1680
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,200
Icarus.

1681
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,600
Do you have someone lined up for voice acting?

1682
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,000
No, and that's why.

1683
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,700
In fact, the voice acting isn't included in this pack is because I

1684
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:33,700
haven't found the right person to do the the narration for the opening

1685
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:34,600
sequence.

1686
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:43,700
So when I do get a good narrated opening, I will include it in a pack.

1687
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,800
The first thing with a glove, it was a left-hand glove, and the next

1688
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,200
it's a right-hand glove.

1689
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,600
Well, that's that's, you know, if that's the case.

1690
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,400
That's, that's yangshin.

1691
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,800
She may have to fix it because I don't know, it's not really supposed

1692
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,100
to be different handedness.

1693
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,400
Let's find out which one we're doing here.

1694
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,300
So that would be this seam.

1695
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,600
It's a right-handed glove in the second one.

1696
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:19,600
Yeah, you're right.

1697
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:23,400
Although actually, I guess what I could do is I could flip it.

1698
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:29,000
If I wanted to, that would be pretty easy, actually, right?

1699
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:32,600
I could flip the glove from from

1700
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:38,000
from left to right, which would make it a right-handed glove, which

1701
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
maybe is a good idea because there's no reason that it has to be going

1702
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,300
in any particular orientation.

1703
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,800
Especially since it's glowing, that makes sense.

1704
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,400
Let's see here.

1705
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,900
The door was open in the first scene, but closed before Krampus

1706
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:19,600
enters.

1707
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,700
Yeah, that's true.

1708
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,900
That should probably, I should probably make some notes of, like,

1709
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,100
stuff that needs to get fixed for, like, art notes.

1710
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,500
Basically, just revision, art notes.

1711
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:32,900
There.

1712
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,700
Maybe I think there was one with the door closed.

1713
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:36,700
I don't know.

1714
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,600
I'll have to ask.

1715
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,700
I'll ask you a question about it.

1716
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,000
I don't know where that one went.

1717
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:46,600
Backhand shot to.

1718
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,400
I noticed a gap at the top of the window.

1719
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,500
Is that still there?

1720
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,600
It might be

1721
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,800
Let's take a look.

1722
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,600
Are you talking about shot to or shot three?

1723
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,100
Actually.

1724
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,200
Which one do you mean?

1725
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:02,600
Do you mean this one?

1726
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,700
This is this is shot to oh yeah, it does look like the like it's too

1727
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,400
far down for it up in the corner.

1728
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,900
So I think that might I think I don't know if that's what you're

1729
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,500
talking about, but that does look like there is one, so maybe

1730
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,200
That better.

1731
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,500
Yeah, it's not enough Parallax in this one.

1732
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:32,400
but anyway,

1733
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:37,700
keeper Caleb.

1734
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,300
Can I adopt one of the children?

1735
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,800
I don't really know what the policies are of this particular

1736
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,600
orphanage.

1737
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,100
That's a good question.

1738
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,500
Try the community for voice acting quite a few of us would be willing

1739
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,500
to would be willing and Happy Bikes I guess.

1740
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,900
But it would have to be someone with a very specific like with who's

1741
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,400
very good at voice acting, right?

1742
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,400
Like I want to the voice acting to be high quality.

1743
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,700
Will this game have support for left-handed people?

1744
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,100
I don't know.

1745
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,300
I don't suspect it would be really all that different to play

1746
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:25,200
left-handed or right-handed since it's like four directions on the

1747
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:29,100
left hand for directions on the right hand, regardless of which

1748
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,000
handedness you are.

1749
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,400
So

1750
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,500
Could you explain the fading for animation?

1751
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:47,000
Which fading what fading are we talking about anything special planned

1752
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,600
for the 256 day?

1753
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,200
No, I do not have anything special planned.

1754
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:59,200
What's the best way to get my repo blessed on GitHub.

1755
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,300
It's kind of random but the current blessed Restrepo hasn't been

1756
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,200
updated in 3 months.

1757
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,000
Email me is the best thing to do

1758
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,000
You should add a little bit of snow on that one to add depth.

1759
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,900
Yeah, I should add, I have to update with snow.

1760
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,600
I think I need to write these down.

1761
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:25,100
I think on the just so I can remember them here.

1762
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:29,700
Of course, I don't have a pen because there's a couple different

1763
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,700
things like glove handedness and so on.

1764
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,000
But I don't know what they all are.

1765
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,700
You know what I could do is I'll just put them in here.

1766
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:02,000
Okay.

1767
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,500
We will need our own trig function, so we can stop signing by using

1768
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:09,500
the C standard Library.

1769
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,100
Yeah, I mean, again, the C standard Library still supplies, a couple

1770
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,300
things for us right now.

1771
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:20,800
It's supplies sprintf, IT Supplies, sign it supplies floor, and seal

1772
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,500
it supplies.

1773
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,000
Round f.

1774
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,500
Basically, the things in here.

1775
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:40,000
So and squared F, some of these are really trivial.

1776
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,800
So some of these won't take any time to implement like, like

1777
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,000
literally, no time to implement other of these such a like, like

1778
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,600
Florence seal, might be a little, take a little way to work cosine.

1779
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,600
Sine will take an 8 and 2 will take a lot of work.

1780
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,300
Those those will be much harder to replace where some of these other

1781
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,800
ones are way easier like truncate.

1782
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,500
We already saw, we already know how to implement.

1783
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:09,000
It actually I'm sorry round.

1784
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,700
We already know how to implement that with using sse2, so,

1785
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,200
Her Domina you mentioned earlier that we could make the animation to

1786
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,000
go smoother by fading.

1787
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,200
For example once we have to put a hat on the hero I was wondering what

1788
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:25,800
that would look like.

1789
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,500
Yeah that just would basically be taking the time range and picking

1790
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,900
apart of the time range to just change the opacity on those two layers

1791
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,900
so that one ramps from 1 to 0 and the other Ranch from 0 to 1.

1792
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:38,800
That's it.

1793
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:40,300
That makes sense.

1794
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,100
I noticed the cutscene dip Maps, don't scale with the window size.

1795
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:44,800
Why is that?

1796
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:48,300
That is because that we are not asking, that is not how our window

1797
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:48,700
works.

1798
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,200
Right now.

1799
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,700
Our game is rendering at 1080p always.

1800
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,300
So it doesn't ask the game for a smaller window ever.

1801
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,800
It never does that if it

1802
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:04,500
Week, it would work just fine because we can already change the

1803
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,200
resolution.

1804
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:12,900
So for example, if we wanted to we can go to and made through to

1805
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,000
handmade dot CPP.

1806
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,700
We can already go to like this thing where we are doing a full, we're

1807
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:18,800
asking for the full back buffer.

1808
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:26,700
If we want to, we can change it to a tinier back, buffer, right?

1809
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,400
So our engine totally supports

1810
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,500
You know, we're doing things resolution Independence.

1811
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:36,300
You can ask the engine to produce a smaller image if you would like

1812
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,700
and it will and it will keep everything correct.

1813
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:43,500
But right now, for our testing, we don't try to.

1814
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:48,500
We don't have Windows past the window size in as what the resolution

1815
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,400
that we want.

1816
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:56,200
Is that makes sense because we I want to test at the actual resolution

1817
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,700
the game is going to run at which is 1920 by 1080.

1818
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,500
We're never going to let you resize the window of the game.

1819
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,400
That's like there won't be a window for the game.

1820
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:10,600
The game will be full screen so you know it's intentional that that is

1821
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,200
cropping

1822
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:28,900
Mr.

1823
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:29,400
Harris mentioned.

1824
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,400
You have Florence seal are kind of difficult.

1825
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,500
I mean, they're not nearly as difficult as sign or a tan, but they're

1826
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:40,500
just a little bit difficult because in order to properly handle all

1827
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,900
cases, you actually have to use some magic constants and do some

1828
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,300
craziness Martin's Mosaic.

1829
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:45,800
Oh, posted about this.

1830
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:50,100
Actually, he posted some code on GitHub for it even and it's not, it's

1831
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,800
non-trivial like you have to actually stop.

1832
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:56,800
Now if you choose to use sse4 or whatever, then it's super trivial

1833
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,300
because there's actually just a straight up.

1834
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:03,800
Lauren seal function, but if you're, if you're assuming that you're

1835
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:07,000
using sse2, then you have some work to do.

1836
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:13,100
And again, it's not the most hardest work, but it's definitely like to

1837
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:13,900
do it, right?

1838
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
You can do a crappy job, but if you're trying to it, right?

1839
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,800
It's a bit of work.

1840
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:20,000
If to think it through, it's like, you know, four or five instructions

1841
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,300
or something that you have to do.

1842
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,800
Why do we want to reduce sign?

1843
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:45,500
We want to reduce sign because well it's really all just for

1844
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:46,400
educational purposes.

1845
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,400
Like there are maybe some reasons why you would want to actually

1846
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:53,300
reduce sign for real which are performance-oriented reasons, but the

1847
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:57,000
reason we would want to redo sign is simply because this the point of

1848
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,800
the stream is to teach low-level programming and if we call life

1849
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,700
Functions to do things will never learn how they're done.

1850
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:07,700
And so sign is actually relatively complicated function, and if you

1851
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,800
just call it and never know how it works, then you don't really

1852
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,900
understand how you do like power series, approximation Zoar, Taylor

1853
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,500
series approximation, or things like this.

1854
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,600
And so learning how to do that, very important.

1855
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,700
Because if you ever want to simulate a function, that isn't in the C

1856
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:22,800
runtime Library, you would not know how to approach it.

1857
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:23,300
Right?

1858
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,100
And so, so part of, you know, the whole idea of him here is to not use

1859
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,900
any libraries so that we learn

1860
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,300
Learn how to do everything.

1861
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,800
Rather than relying on other people to have done it for us.

1862
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:40,500
And so, you know, right now because by default, everything linked to

1863
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,400
the C runtime Library.

1864
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:44,500
If you program in C, we still call some function, see the runtime

1865
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:44,800
library.

1866
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,400
But before we ship I would just like to go through and take you know

1867
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,100
the handful that we do use and replace them with our own versions so

1868
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:53,900
that we can literally be completely library free.

1869
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:59,400
And everyone can see how to implement all of all the things that are

1870
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,700
in the C runtime library and again there's no

1871
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,800
Overwhelming reason why you have to do that to ship a game.

1872
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,900
You could certainly ship a game with the c runtime Library.

1873
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:10,300
It's just for educational purposes, I don't want to have there be a

1874
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,900
bunch of mysterious stuff that no one knows how it works, right?

1875
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,100
So, alright, that's it for now.

1876
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,600
I'm going to call it a night.

1877
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,900
So let's go ahead and close on down.

1878
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,700
Thanks everyone for joining me for another episode of handmade hero.

1879
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:30,800
It's been a pleasure coding with you, as always, and I'm pretty happy

1880
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,300
to see those cut scenes in the game.

1881
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,600
There are a lot of fun and yeah, just nice to have some some cool art

1882
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,100
in there.

1883
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,800
So thanks for joining me.

1884
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,600
If you would like to follow along, with series at home, you can always

1885
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,600
pre-order the game on handmade hero dot-org.

1886
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:45,300
If

1887
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:46,100
Reorder the game.

1888
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,800
It comes with source code so you can play around with it and follow

1889
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:48,900
it.

1890
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,700
We do on the stream, you can also get the art assets early.

1891
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:55,000
Like, if you want those cutscene assets to play with as your

1892
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
programming, along with the series that comes with it as well.

1893
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,200
So go ahead and check that out.

1894
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,700
If you're interested, we also have a forum site, you can go to.

1895
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,600
If you'd like to ask questions about the series, we have a patreon

1896
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,100
page, you can go to if you want to support the series, the video

1897
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:09,600

1898
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,300
And we also have a tweet bot.

1899
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,100
You can go to which tweets the schedule at you.

1900
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,300
Speaking of the schedule.

1901
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,600
Cool tomorrow, 5:00 p.m.

1902
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,700

I will see you guys back here.

1904
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:24,700
This will finish up our cutscenes, and that will be a pretty fun

1905
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:25,600
thing.

1906
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:26,600
All right.

1907
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:30,800
Thanks everyone for joining me until tomorrow have fun programming.

1908
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,000

1909
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:32,900
Take it easy, everyone.
